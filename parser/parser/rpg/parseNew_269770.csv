Early Access Review
								Let me qualify here, I like this game quite a bit and I think it does deserve all the praise it recieved. So why the negative review? Well for one, Steam doesn't give me the option to have a neutral review, and two I want to give potential buyers some reasons as to why they wouldn't want to buy in. Most of the negative reviews don't really do that, at least not in detail.I've been following this game for a long time, a lot of love has gone in to its development, and it really shows through the quirky spritework. The problem with the development is that it's just been so painfully slow that I can't recommend spending $15 on it at this point, because the desire to check back in after a few months when nearly nothing new has been added fades away after over two years; and that's how long I've had this game. It was first released for beta purchase around April 1, 2014.Over the course of two years, the story has essentially gained one new dungeon (of which there was only one before) along with a marginal amount of content that shows this game is going to be in development for many more years. The content that's there is good, sure, but it's not so stellar as to justify playing through the story more than once or twice.The real mode that seems to add playtime to this game is its arcade mode, which is roguelike in nature, and requires a good understanding of enemy/boss patterns to do well in. Players play through two floors representing each area in the story mode, complete with enemies from said area, and have no chances to heal except at the end of each floor. Despite having numerous floors and all of the enemies from the story mode, it's pretty light on content in terms of roguelikes. There are unlockables and such, but they only give minor advantages, and as a result adding more floors to the mode seems kind of pointless in its current state. Even after over two years of going back to this game I struggle to reach the 7th floor of what must be over 14 at this point. There isn't much incentive to bother trying to reach those floors either. So should you buy this game? Well that depends on how patient you are. After two years I'm pretty burned out and don't see myself playing this game for a long, long time. If you think you can wait for what could be 5 years to play a finished product and want to support the developers, then by all means get this game. If not, keep an eye on it and pick it up a few years down the road when it has a more justifiable amount of content to offer.Edit: Thanks for all the support guys, since this review got so much attention I want to add a little more. If you're worried about spending $15 on a game that won't be finished, don't be. This game is a safe buy in my opinion. Even though the development has been very slow, it has been extremely consistent and the team behind this game definitely has what it takes to finish the job. Secrets of Grindea has been in the works since 2011, and the quality of the content in it has only improved since. Their dev blog[www.secretsofgrindea.com] has a weekly recap that is posted nearly every week without missing a beat. So if you're interested, definitely keep an eye on this game, because it is one of the better early access titles out there, despite the slow development speed.			"

								Where to begin.  This game is as advertised.  It's a game similar to Secret of Mana (SNES), Crystalis (NES), Zelda-esque, Final Fantasy Adventure (Original GB)  and many other old RP games.You can customize your character physically by gender, colour of your clothes, hair style and colour, and name.  Additonally, you get a vanity part for your hat, face, weapon, and shield.The gameplay is very nice, you can be a full warrior, full mage, whatever you want to be; a combination if you want.  Although, being a healer is not an option.This is a beta game, it's not complete, from my estimation it's a little near half done, if that.You can play cooperatively, over the internet, using your steam friends list or direct IP!  This is awesome!You grind in the game, if that wasn't obvious.  (What old school console RPG didn't have you grind?  It's part of the fun!)The transition between keyboard and controller playing is seamless, you just start using your keyboard and it swaps to keyboard mode, you use your controller, it swaps to controller mode.  I found this particularly great!The host of the game's save file is progressed in the story, however - if you're not the host - you keep everything you gained.  You simply have to play through the story (by hosting or single player) to go through it.  The rewards though, you do not acquire again, you already have them!  :DThis is an awesome game!  As far as I'm aware only three people are working on it and they're from Sweden.  They have me as a fan.  The sprite animation is awesome, the artwork for the avatars is great and expresses much emotion, and the game looks very polished for a beta that is not even half done!I used to pay $50+ US dollars for games like these, and wait years for the next to come out.  I love the game very much, and I haven't even started exploring the Arcade Mode.tl;dr - Buy this game if you loved Secret of Mana or any similar games on the console or PC.  Especially if you want to play it co-op with friends over the internet!			"

Early Access Review
								To review this game is to review it in two parts.Story Mode: An amazing adventure akin to the days of Secret of Mana, Sword of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3. Quick swordplay with an oldschool-meets-polish aesthetic that's filled with charm. Combat is quick paced and - with over 20 skills and spells with multiple charge levels, along with 30 talents - more or less unique for every character made. Every attack, skill and spell feels as if it has weight behind it for a thoroughly satisfying brawl through hordes of monsters and challenging bosses.The story is serious at times, tongue in cheek in others without outright resorting to cheese. There's plenty of side-quests, mini-games and collectables, but contrary to the name no grinding appears to be necessary. The shield is as relevant to the gameplay as the sword is, every attack can be blocked if you know the exact timing, reminding me of the days of 'Timed Hits' from Super Mario RPG and Final Fantasy 8.The music is beautiful, the characters well written to make you love or hate them, I can't say enough good things about Story Mode. The only shame is it's incomplete, but between pet taming, treasure hunting, fishing, card collecting, playing with 4 player online co-op and duking it out in the arena, there's more than enough content to keep me busy between updates.Arcade Mode: All the rules from Story Mode no longer apply, Arcade Mode feels like an entirely different game. Less Secret of Mana, more Binding of Isaac. You start in an empty plain and delve within a randomized roguelike-esque labyrinth. Each room is different every time, filled with traps and all manners of enemies or bosses not present in Story Mode. HP is precious, mastery of skills, spells and shielding is required.Arcade Mode is perfect for sinking endless hours into as you try to go deeper and deeper into the labyrinth, gaining points and essence to level up and expand your town, unlock new NPCs to aid you, take on quests for rare and unique loot not found anywhere else. Skills and spells are best experimented with in here to see which build suits you best. With friends it's harder, but with 4 people on screen the monsters barely stand a chance once you hit your groove. The online leaderboards for Arcade Mode help to give it even more replay value by trying to do better than your friends or complete strangers to try and hit #1.If you have any doubts whatsoever, try the demo. With an hour of Story Mode gameplay, several hours of Arcade Mode and co-op bundled into the demo, it's a great teaser for what to expect moving forward.Tip: Opt into 'Frontline' by selecting SoG in your library if you want quicker updates. The normal version receives slower updates, but your experience in the game will be much smoother.			"

Early Access Review
This review is based on the game in its current state at the time of posting and is completely my opinion. Yours may differ to mine. I also only really played the story mode and did co-op.Secrets of Grindea is an action RPG with a major focus on the story and meticulous detail worked into its environments and graphics.I just completed everything in the Secrets of Grindea that is currently available in the version out at this time and I have to say that what they have so far is fan-bloody-tastic.Things I liked Fantastic pixel graphics with fluid animations that make me say ""wow"" in some circumstances An interesting story with creative sidequests and lovely characters Hats and lots of them. I'm a Team Fortress 2 man and I found the choice of hats to be most adequate. The plethora of references. I won't spoil any of them, but they're there. The soundtrack consisted of fantastic tracks that all matched their locations in game. Not a single track sounded out of place in this game.Things I didn't like all that much The story was a bit short. But that can be attributed to the fact that it's in early access. The limited supply of weapons available was quite disheartening as I found myself wielding the most powerful one-handed sword in the game about 1/2 of the way through the story with not much choice on what else to use. Player customzation is unfortunately incredibly limited with the only changable things being colour of clothing, hair style, hats, and facewear. I found myself yearning for a dress but was sadly stuck with my adventurers outfit. I don't want efficieny, damn it, I want to look fabulous!Overall after I played through and 100% completed the game with a mate of mine we both left with a feeling of satisfaction and the desire to one day return to Grindea when more content is released. What I'm trying to say is buy the game already. It's worth it. "

								Let me start off by saying if you think this game doesn't have grinding in it...then seek help. There are people who care about you and don't wish to see you go down this path (not me per se, we've only just met. But I'm sure there are people who love you very much. Like your grandmother or that neighbor with the nice rack. Anyway, I'm going off topic here).Secrets of Grindea is a tongue-in-cheek RPG that draws heavily on the nostalgia of games like Secrets of Mana, Zelda: Link to the Past, and Illusion of Gaia. The sprite animations and colorful backgrounds mimic classic 16-bit games and go well with the fluidity of combat. NPCs are prevalent in towns and in the overworld to the point where the world does not feel empty and that their character is not some lone warrior living on a planet full of monsters (though that sounds like an awesome game idea. Dibs). Each area has its own unique feel that you will hopefully enjoy because the aforementioned grinding will have you staying in one area killing the same enemies for drops.The combat is extremely straight forward where your basic attack is spamming one button or having a charged skill where you hold and release one button. Let me go on record to say that I do not think this is a bad thing. Sure, you won't be chaining attacks that culminate in your wooden sword hitting with the power of a tactical nuclear device, but you will be unlocking and upgrading skills that define the way you, the player, wish to play. The skills are limited (for now I hope) to a 1 handed skill set, 2 handed skill set, and a magic skill set. The player is able to mix and match these skills however he or she wants and has the option to refund some or all of the skill points that were spent by spending gold (this is done in the menu rather than with an NPC). There is a bow the player can get from a sidequest but so far doesn't have a dedicated set of skills to leveling up the damage.The story is pretty straightforward for an RPG of the era it emulates: You are a guy or gal that wakes up, is handing a magical bag that can hold anything without weight restrictions and are sent out to become a renowned member of the ""Collectors"". It seems, from the start, that these ""Collectors"" are a bunch of people that go out and collect cool, rare things. It is all very prestigious. And dangerous. And sexy. Seriously, so far every NPC that isn't a Collector is jealous of you. Normally one would have to buy seven sports cars and have an attractive life mate to get that kind of recognition. This game hands that to you right off the bat (Disclaimer: The developers of this game will NOT buy you cars nor introduce you to hot people for a hook up).My main concern with the game is that it seems too short and I say that knowing full well that not all the features in the game have been implemented; this is not the reason that I feel the game is too short. The in-game journal keeps a record of all the enemies in the game and what they drop when killed. Enemies you haven't killed yet appear in the journal as silhouettes. Upon counting (yes, I did a math) I found that there are only about thirty (30) enemies total in the game including boss enemies. This, in my opinion, is a low number which may make gamers shy away from the game. An increase in not just the number of potential enemies but different types of enemies will add more variety to the grinding while still keeping the player's interest high. I eagerly await the areas that have not yet been implemented to the game.Now, I'm not going to end this review by giving the game a number based off of 5 nor 10 nor 325745456415 (<--- not sure what this number is. It just punched my Numpad to come up with something ridiculous). I will end this review with just a few simple words:I enjoy this game.I hope you enjoy it too.Still enjoying the game after so long.

Early Access Review
								It seems that a lot of the top reviews have forgotten something important from the devs:  “Please read all the Early Access info before buying!”  So, before you read any reviews,  please  read that EA description.Back? Alright. The Concerns The main concerns I’ve seen from top commenters are amount of content and update frequency. Interestingly enough, the devs address both. First, content. Many complaints tend to stem from the fact that, if you skip cutscenes and side missions, there’s about four hours of content, and their disappointment at its limited playtime, etc. However, the developers noted this in the EA info: “it takes about 4 hours to complete if you skip most of the side content. If you want to do everything currently in Story Mode, expect to invest at least 10 hours.” Does this mean you should buy the game immediately? No. It just makes those complaints about content seem a little less grounded when they were given warning. Next, update frequency. This seems to be the major complaint with most Not Recommended reviews. Surprise surprise, the devs were prepared again.  “If frequent updates and/or a determinable release date is very important to you, we advise you to wait for the finished product!”  Again, those complaints lose a little luster once it’s clear that there was a warning. With a large development team, big and detailed games can take years. This game is being made by three people. It’s going to take a long time. However, as of today on day of writing, March 27, 2017, the devs posted an update that ends the area that will be the largest until the game’s very end, which means the update frequency should increase. (Sidenote: I don’t blame reviewers for not knowing that. I only learned it existed twenty minutes ago. But, it is important to note.) In any case, the update frequency is pretty good for three people on this intensive of a game. With that out of the way, let’s move to: The Gameplay This is the star of the game. The swing arcs are clearly defined for each weapon, the animations are smooth, it feels good to hit enemies, with enemy recoil and appropriate sound effects, and a wide variety of character expansion options. In Grindea, there is no class system. When you level up, you receive points that you can put into skills, spells, and stat bonuses of your choice. Want to be a brutal tank who crushes their enemies? Do it. Want to be a deadly mage who roasts and electrocutes their opponents from afar? Do it. Want to be a glass cannon who can crit 25% of the time for 165% of their damage? Do it. That’s where the replayability comes from: a wide variety of combat options and stat choices. I personally have all nine character slots filled with hard-hitting tanks and long-range mages and spellswords and summoners and so on. There are even a couple support spells, with more planned for implementation. You can also get a pet by taming some of the common enemies in the game. You can feed them, and they’ll give you stat bonuses if you put enough into one stat.  Grindea is also very playable with a controller, and I recommend it. While keyboard is good, a controller hearkens back to SNES-era RPG’s and feels great. This game also doesn’t want you to grind. Yes, it’s in the name. That’s the joke. The more you try to farm in this game, the more enemies that appear. You can get overwhelmed if you aren’t careful. The Story I honestly love this game’s story. While the core plot is pretty simple, get some things so the world doesn’t explode, it’s really the characters that make Grindea feel alive. Every character’s text box portraits are detailed and have multiple expressions. Their in-game sprites look good and have smooth animation. These animations give personality to the characters and distinguish them from “blue-haired dude” and “is that Cloud?” There’s growth and blooming relationships between characters. Even with the protagonist, I was pleasantly surprised. Rather than being The Great Hero of the Ancient Prophecy, you’re just a kid doing their job as a Collector, like a lot of other people. You fall into having to save the world rather than being born as the Savior of the Earth or Whatever. You end up “borrowing” some Really Old Super Dangerous and Powerful Artifacts not because a legend told you to, nor because you woke up and decided to, nor because your dead parent spoke to you in a dream or whatever. You just end up having to save the world. There’s charm, wit, humor, and no end of pun names. Singleplayer vs. Multiplayer There are arguments for both sides of this. While singleplayer is viable and the same experience, you’re just not as strong as with others. Some bosses are very tough without help.  Looking at you, Seasons Hydra.  With friends that also enjoy this genre, Grindea is excellent. As long as everyone has a half-decent router and a computer that meets the minimum on the store page, you probably won’t have issues. While large areas do take a while to load on less superb computers, it’s nothing unbearable. Unless  someone’s  ping is 30,000. So, if you’re playing this alone, it’s still fun, but you’re going to have to work harder and longer than with others simply because more people make the game easier. The Verdict If you want a finished game, don’t buy this. If you want a perfectly polished game, don’t buy this. If you want a game that absolutely positively has no bugs, don’t buy this. If what I and the store page have told you has you itching to buy this, buy it. It’s a lot of fun and a good game. If you’re on the fence, pick up the demo. It’ll give you a better sense of gameplay than words ever could. I came into this Early Access game expecting just that. I was pleasantly surprised.  I recommend this game for stellar characters, graphics, animations, music, and mechanics. It’s not finished, certainly. It takes time to make a game, certainly. There are issues, certainly. But what’s there is good. Just because it’s slow doesn’t make it bad.			"

								I bought this for myself and my best friend. We're using our DnD characters. I love this so much. As does she. When my birthday hits I'll buy it for another friend and you know what.....I will buy someone a coffee <3. Keep developing guys and gals. You've made my day with the wimsical game. It brought back good memories of playing resident evil together, zelda games, and animal crossing. We have fishing contests with each other, and when we summon our cute monsters we give them names. My friend's ice summon was named Baby Meta/ Baby Metaknight <3, and the cloud summon I use is named Malo. It seems my friend though has the heart of the cards as she finds them all leaving me in the dust. We'll play this game till we get 100% for everyone. Thank you so much for your hard work. You've made two best friends so happy.			"

								I wasnt %100 sure about this game until i finally said screw it and bought it. It's like if legend of zelda, chrono trigger, and secrets of mana had a baby and taught it funny one liners. 10/10 i highly recommend.Will edit post once ive put more time into it.Edit: So far ive made it to the second main boss.My thoughts so far is the bosses are well made and very creative. They are hard to fight and you have to learn every pattern very well if you hope to beat them. There is a little grind in the game but thats all just part of the experience.Edit: 2I have made it as far as i can in early access. Loved it the whole way through. Cannot wait for a new update to add more content.			"

								Story-wise, it's nothing special. The story is well-written, funny at times, but ultimately nothing that will win any prizes. Action-wise, it's nothing special. Combat systems and skill trees reminiscient of soo many other games of the same kind.Visuals are not really anything special either. Everything is cute and well-made, like in so many other games of the same kind.But you know what? It's engaging, it's fast-paced, it's completely glitch-free and smooth, and most importantly it supports multiplayer through Steam. It's both a relaxing and fast-paced Action RPG that I can definitely recommend that you enjoy with a friend or two. Not to mention it is still in Early Access, which means there's lots of content to still come.So far, this game is extremely well-made and polished, and definitely something you can sink some time into, alone or not; though the multiplayer aspect was ultimately what made me buy it. I haven't tried the arcade mode yet, but I already feel I've seen enough of this game to recommend it dearly.			"

								Whats there is mindblowingly brilliant, but i wouldn't currently recommend a purchase simply because i feel this game deserves to be experienced fully.  Updates to Secrets of Grindea come in really really slowly, and while i love the game, i feel it should have been finished a long time ago.  When the game releases content complete, i will without a doubt alter this review to reflect that and recommend it heartily, if i haven't feel free to poke me on Twitter (Squishydew)			"

								This game has driven me to make my first serious review about a game, ever. This game is one of the most satisfying RPG experiences I have ever had, ranking above many AAA games. Everything about this game brings about an intense craving to  play more  in the best possible way. Pros: Combat -Large skill tree filled with unique and interesting abilities.-If you like an ability you can level it up over time to make that ability do more awesome stuff-The freedom to mix melee / ranged spells to create a unique playstyle-Epic and highly original bosses that are frequent and challenging The Story and Regions -Colorful and vibrant art style with very well done sound effects-Likeable characters and lighthearted approach make for an enjoyable story with a mysterious undertone-Main quests take you to several areas that are have their own unique themes and enemies-Regions are fairly large with explorable secrets and puzzles containing hidden loot Loot and Cards -The everpresent chance of obtaining ""cards"" is one that creates the urge to grind each area's different enemies-Not only do enemies drop cards they drop crafting materials as well as rare and unique equipable gear to further create incentive to grind  THE DEVS! -The trio over at Pixel Ferrets are incredibly talented and hard working-Weekly dev blog updates along with frequent patches add tons of content at a high rate-Buy them coffee to add hyperspeed perk to your favorite dev teamOther Pros:-Easy to connect multiplayer supporting up to 4 people-Well done controller support-A talking bag that roasts peopleCons: -Smallish amount of craftable material (But of course more will be added over time)-Some bosses are way harder than others on the hard difficulty (perhaps need more difficulty settings?)As an early access review the full potential of this game has yet to be realized however; this game has so much personality, tied with a fun combat system and an enjoyable playthrough experience making for a game that has a lot to give.This game is growing fast so you'll always be able to come back and enjoy more of the world of Grindea!I would highly reccommend that you purchase this game if you love RPG's because this RPG is every gamers wet dream.

Early Access Review
								To start... I'm on the fence about this one. If steam offered a ""maybe"" option, I'd pick that.  It was number one on my wishlist for a long time. A LONG TIME. Having a baby this summer, so prob not gonna be able to play much games when that happens, plus the development is taking centuries on this one, so I figured I might as well enjoy what I can out of this game now since it might not happen later.The Good: The game sings of polish and love. What is done is fantastic. It looks simply amazing and you can tell there has been a lot of talent and devotion put into what is playable. The gameplay is freaking awesome. So much diversity, so many options for builds. You can go pure range caster, you can go one handed dps build, or put points into heaving hitting two handed skills that'll take a quarter of a bosses hp down in one well timed hit. There's a lot of choice. And you can also respec at a hefty in game currency price for those who like that option. The gameplay is a 10/10. Really ace. Most pickups are shown aesthetically on your character. The hats (which is arguably the most viewable part of your character over boots and armor since your head is huge) are viewable, while the chest pieces and boots are not. It's basically just headwear and weapons. You also have the option to have ""style items"" which are items that always show regardless of what you have equipped. Like the witch hat look? Equip it in style, and put a better stat hat to boost you. Replayability: It's definitely there. I'll likely replay the story mode several times at least, just to try different builds. One handed, two handed, caster, etc. It'll be fun. The Not Nearly As Good: For having been in development for many years, really, like five years, I was both surprised and disappointed at the scarcity of actual content. There are only a handful of quests. There is a laughable amount of items. For example, I went with a two hand warrior build my first playthough, and I counted five weapons. FIVE. I have all of them. And they all have the same attack animation. A swing arc in front. I was kind of picturing a little more... There are only a couple of areas in the game right now. I don't know how many more are planned but the game felt about half done progression wise to me. To give you an idea, you can fight your way across the entire map in about 15-20 minutes. The temples are cool, but they're short! The first took me maybe 30 minutes. The second, took about 30-40. And that's it. There's two temples. I looked for side quests of which there are many, but they're short too.  For how long the temples are, I was expecting ten of them. Nope. I think story mode took me about five hours in total and I got 72% on completion. Some of that was spent mindlessly farming for combat's sake and some more of that was spent in the arena doing the two challenges over and over to get them perfect.Arcade mode is another beast. I want to love it, but it honestly frustrates the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. It seems way unbalanced. It's basically a roguelite within the game. You start at level 0 and fight through small arena level maps called floors, to a boss, onto the next floor. And it's hard as balls. Hence the frustration. Take damage 3-4 times and your dead. There are NO HEALTH DROPS when fighting. You get a measly health orb when you beat the boss and progress onto the next floor, but honestly, I think the whole arcade mode just needs rebalancing, or a freaking difficulty mode option. Make it so enemies do less damage, or drop health orbs, whatever. I've played it for several hours and only gotten to floor 3 like twice. Out of what, 12? I'm frustrated when I play arcade mode. Not to mention the slow as turtle progression system associated with arcade mode. You get ""essence"" which you can spend to unlock perks to start arcade mode. For example you can buy the perk which unlocks a small metal sword to boost damage from 25 at start to 35. Great. Except it takes FOREVER to get the essence. They're not guaranteed drops and I maybe get one every 3-4 runs of arcade mode. And it costs ten to unlock the lowest perks? Then fifty for a second perk slot (so all your perk unlocks are useless because you can only bring one perk at a time until you unlock another perk slot) and 150 for the third and final. Good crap. This could be fixed by lowering perk costs, or guaranteeing drops based on point scores, but as of now, I could put 100 hours into the arcade mode alone before I unlocked another perk slot. Frustrating. Overall: Like I said in the beginning, I'm really torn. I absolutely adore the combat and look of this game. It's amazing. I just wish there was more of it. It really only wet my whistle. I am left wanting. The arcade mode? I want to like it, but am left.... not liking it due to the current (albeit fixable) issues I see in it. I'll rate this up, but I really recommend just waiting for release... in 2020. Then you can play the entire game at once. "

								I've been waiting for a game like this for YEARS.Zelda/ Ys meets Castlevania, with a story like something out of SNES-era JRPGs.Grindea doesn't take itself too seriously, but really hits home with amazing sprite animations, exeptionally tight and ballanced gameplay, a loot/crafting system that makes you actually want to collect things you don't need, and a simple, yet complex level up system that honestly doesn't feel like any I've seen before, and to top it off, it's got a killer hard mode (arcade mode) that reminds me why I suck at rouguelikes, yet for some reason keep coming back to them!Oh, AND it's got a great coop system! My gf and I look for fun coop games pretty frequently, and we're often dissapointed. Not this time! Great weekend gaming/ veg session!The only gripe I have, is that since it's early access, the adventure content is incomplete. It took the two of us about 14 hours to ""complete"" the story at 100%. Arcade mode had more stuff, but was a little too punshing for us to experiment much.  I need the rest of that story!Seriously. Buy this game. At full price.			"

								I like the game, it's really fun but for the amount of time it's taking them to finish it, it's not worth purchasing at this point. I bought this game nearly a year ago and it had about 5 hours of content, 3 of those hours were spent doing side quests and grinding items... the other 2 hours were the main quest... not a whole lot going on for it right now.If you started the game over from scratch, you could probably squeeze about 15 hours in right now, and that's grinding out all the items enemies drop, including their cards and doing all the sides quests, including fishing. There's currently two dungeons available which looks to be about 40% of the game.Once the game is completely finished I'll do a proper review of it but until that time, I recommend everyone stay away from it, don't give dev's money they haven't rightfully earned yet... This game has been in production for too long and I think we as the consumers and fans need to see better results and more content before any more revenue is earned.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is what I've been missing since the advent of the Nintendo 64 and Playstation.  A quality, amusing, fun, multiplayer RPG that lets you be who you want to be and play with your friends.  A lot of the game is simple enough to pick up, while other aspects seem frustratingly incomprehensible (at first).The Good:Can choose the colors of your character's clothes and hair to stand out from other playersCan change your character's hairstyle to stand out as wellCan not only equip masks to look different, but can equip a ""style"" for masks, weapons, and shields, to allow your character to look a certain way without sacrificing the stats on their gear.  Major props to the developers for that mechanic.Humor.  This game has plenty of it.Active developers who read their forums and respond to feedback.  They not only tell you what they're doing every week, they show images and animated gifs that prove it's not just hot air.Experience Cap - You can avoid outleveling your friends by hunting in areas that are beneath you, so you get money and items but no XP.Arcade Mode - A randomly generated series of rooms that let you play a character with your friends and work toward the development of a town.Puzzles - The Temple of Seasons especially.  The use of seasons to not only affect the monsters' abilities, but also affect what can be done with the room, is amazingly well done.  Some of the other puzzles (like the bells) require a little attention to detail to figure out.  includes puzzle-related humor as well.Fishing - Because fish!  Ok, because it's a free way to get pet food, and the time investment doesn't make it feel cheaty for the return.Pets! - Because pets!  They don't fight for you, but you can increase your stats by feeding your pets certain items/fish.  The more they level the more food it will take, so you may wish to devote specific pets to specific traits.The Not-so-Good:Characters only ever have one clothing style, regardless of colors.  Perhaps my character wants to run around in robes, while my brother's wants to run around in a martial arts outfit like the monks in Evergrind.  What if my friend's female character wants to wer a dress, impractical as they are for adventuring?  Male or female, you only get one (the same) set of clothes.Small development team - While not really a bad thing, it does make the updates take a lot longer.  I applaud their desire to keep with a stable core that isn't going to lose interest and disappear during a project, but at the same time I wish they could produce updates just a little faster.  The forums show multiple offers of assistance, which are politely declined.Arcade Mode - Every time you die, you start over at level 1.  This doesn't make for a ""grind"" as much as a monotonous loop of re-leveling and trying to get back to where you had been.  While being too weak in the story mode allows you to backtrack and level, or hunt cards, the Arcade Mode forces you to keep moving into progressively more dangerous territory, and one bad spawn can reset you to zero instead of just backing off and leveling some more.Equipment limitations - With a good drop on one of the bosses you can have one of the best 1-h weapons in the current release of the game, halfway into Story Mode.  Most caster gear is functionally limited until far into the second temple, while you can get great melee armor and weapons throughout.  Even buying all gear and dropping/crafting allarmors as of the end of the current release, some of the most useful caster gear was either available 1/3 of the way into the game (MP regen robes) or at the end of current content (temple loot/drops).Monster Cards - While I do believe they are awesome and useful, I feel the benefits they grant are so powerful in some cases that you become reliant on them, rather than simply empowered by them.  To change them now might require some major balance tweaks, but Bloomo and Pecko are the two that spring to mind.  Without them I stood little chance alone in the Temple of Seasons against the mini-boss, after XP slowed to a crawl.  It seems awkward relying on those to beat a few fights...  Later in the game, unless more high-HP boosting cards are added to balance tough fights, I could see them being less useful.  For now though, they're pretty much a necessity.Economy - It never really seems like you have to worry about money in this game.  By the time I stopped hunting all the cards and mob drops, I had enough money to raise my Jumpkin to level 10 purely off potions.  Buying anything else was like picking out pocket lint, for all the impact it made in my savings.I believe that the game has incredible potential, and is great fun as it stands now.  I've put in 41.2 hours as of the time of this writing, and most if it is in Story Mode.  I probably won't be gaining much on my play time until they release more, but I keep checking the devblog every week for updates.Pixel Ferrets, I salute your game.  Keep at it.			"

Early Access Review
								So. I got this game because it was cheap, and looked kinda fun. Well, I was not really expecting to be too amused, the game looked kinda low Q and corny.6 hours later i nthe same sitting, I realized I had not eaten anything, nor had a bathroom break. Well, it was a little late.10/10 would sit in♥♥♥♥♥♥again.Now for a more serious review. This game is 15 bucks at the time of this review. I have spent 30 on games that were NOT EVEN CLOSE to as good. I mean, after 20 minutes the game is already throwing you into a deep and fun story. after an hour you have already laughed your♥♥♥♥♥off more than once, and the game does a damned good job of not taking itself to serious.For an ""ARPG"" with great elements from zelda, secrets of mana, and God knows what else lies ahead, it plays any RPG fan into a lifetime of fun. The game excessively reminds you it's about the grind that RPGs generally have, yet you don't feel underpowered at all when you rush through something. On the flip side - it forces you to go back and grind because you feel like you are missing something if you don't.Pros ---Great Storyline-HOURS of content in a tiny little package-Devs clearly care about the game because it gets constant attention-Has parodies of all types of games (no spoilers)-YOU CAN FISH-Side story is still amazing, even in alpha/Early Access stages-Character options are not limited. You can be a mage, tank, DPS, or all, or a mix of whatever. -YOU CAN FISH!-Fishing has rewards-Fish have a purpose-Fish have multiple purposes-Fishing is seriously fun in this game-FISH-I see a ton of replay valueCONS -----No timer letting you know you have been playing for 6 and a half friggin hours straight.-Seriously, I can't find any cons for this game, and that scares me.Overall, this game is amazing.Graphics - 9.5/10 - They are amazing, a great homage to classic gaming.Sound - 9/10 - Some sound effects are a bit overbearing at times, and if you drop the volume you miss out on the little effects.Music - 10/10 - Great score. The entire game has music that keeps you going. At no point did I dislike it a bit. I almost didn't even notice myself humming to it all the time.Gameplay - 10/10 - The gameplay is perfect. For it's genre and subs, it has all of the elements in the right place. PLUS you have so much freedom in character creation.Controls - 9/10 - Id give it a ten, but sometimes the placement of things feels a little off. May be a bit better after you get used to it more I guess. Nothing is actually bad about them, but personally I miss keys from time to time when I need to chain things together. Overall, this game has a solid and simple 9.75/10. I mena, just buy it. You wont regret it a bit. They creators have done an amazing job, and I can't wait till this game is complete, and a sequal is in the works.			"

								This might be catching your interest, and it definitely is very interesting. Even though they still are on early access, then they made a really good job on keeping me going with this game. I usually don't enjoy singleplayer games, so i only play Local Co-op with my girlfriend. OBS!!! FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN LOCAL CO-OP!! There is just one little thing that made me frustrated. That is how to fix the Local Co-op mode. I had to search around a bit until I found it. You have to download something called steam_appid.txt which you can find on this link down here: (file is from a staff member called Teddy)http://secretsofgrindea.com/forum/index.php?threads/local-co-op-on-2-computers.913/Put it in the ...Steam\steamapps\common\SecretsOfGrindea folder. Then you have to run 2 windows at one time and do some other things in order to make each controller locked for each window you opened. You'll find more out on the steps that you will be following in the guide on that page!It works really good when you get everything to work! I play on two different monitors at the same time, my laptop screen and TV screen using HDMI cable. Works really well! You can also have two windows running in a single monitor ofc, or 4 windows if you would like that. It has its cons and pros ofc.GL & HF!			"

Early Access Review
								Absolutely fantastic. I mean that, Best $15 I've spent in a good while.This developer earned my appreciation in a lot of ways in just 30 minutes. First, There is a free demo of the game. You can actually see, first hand, whether the game is going to run properly on your machine without spending a dime. Second, The game warns you of an error that makes some pcs run fullscreen mode badly in the demo. I do not experience this error, I find that it runs perfectly in fullscreen on my (rather old) pc. But the fact that they make that apparent in the demo shows an amount of respect for your time and money that, as a games consumer, I'm well accustomed to not getting. Third, The actual content of the game:Take the 2D Zelda titles, Update the pixel art quality, Add in Diablo-inspired skill trees, but hold the class restrictions. Then add active blocking with a timing mechanic that makes a perfectly timed block benefit you in some way, Differently depending on the attack being blocked. Then vary the weapons, One handed weapons for a swift attacking mobile build, Two handed for a slower hard-hitter, passive buffs on weapons for builds with other sources of damage. Then add spells; Simple fireballs, ice spikes, and chain lightning for damage. Utility spells like haste and damage buffs, Summons to support you, Debuffs to slow or continually damage enemies, and (Being a game in beta) More to come.Then there are the little things:*Pressing a key on your keyboard will change the control prompts to keyboard keys, Pressing a button on your controller will turn them into controller versions. No need to fiddle around with the options, It's automatic.*Downloading the demo before buying the game completes some of the full download, Reducing the time the download takes and minimizing redundant data use. *Your save files from the demo will be carried over to the full game should you (And you should) Purchase it.*And a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor present throughout that amuses me while not taking me out of the experience.I look very much forward to this game's future development and eventual completion, and to whatever Pixel Ferrets decides to do after. With the clear high standard of quality and respect for their customers they display I have no doubt in my mind that it will satisfy.			"

I have been wanting a game like this for so long, but I could never find any good ones.Anyone who liked Secret of Mana or the Zelda games are stupid to not try this, you will love this game!I am so in love with this game that I read the dev blog every week to see if they have released any new content.+The developers are super friendly and open about their work. They post all their work and progress weekly on their blog, and they anwer most of the questions and suggestions the community post on their forum.

Early Access Review
======================================Secrets of Grindea (Read on for the full review!)======================================TL;DR:Secrets of Grindea is a fantastic homage to the golden age of RPGs with a lot of modern comforts mixed in. It is very much feature complete and well polished for a game in early access, and not just features relating to gameplay mechanics, but actual activities you can occupy your time with. Campaign, a roguelite arcade mode, and co-op make for a healthy bit of longevity. Presentation is great, with good graphics, animations, and sound.Pick it up!======================================Pros:+ Graphics: Clean sprites, animation, and backgrounds. Fun colorful palette.+ Audio: Music is nice, sound cues are all reasonably distinct, excluding skill sfx.+ Story: There's enough humor baked in to make it less pointless, albeit hit and miss.+ Grind: Permanent buffs through card collection, tons of items, skills, etc.+ Design: Satisfying level design, puzzles, dungeon length, progression, etc.+ Heart: Some definite love has been poured into this product.Cons:- Waiting: It's not finished, yet.- Balance: Some playstyles fare better than others, but that isn't to say they aren't viable.Neutral:± Binds: Controller binding slightly limited.======================================Introduction:Did you ever wish there was a game where you could just sit around and fish, collect, craft, fight, dungeon dive, level up, and more as you choose, with each element being satisfying, but ALSO you wanted it to be similar to games like The Oracle of Ages/Seasons in the Zelda series? Secrets of Grindea is for you! If you don't want the last aspect, go look at Stardew Valley.Gameplay:Gameplay in Secrets of Grindea is simple. Interaction and weapon/skill use are on separate keys. With a keyboard, skills can be rebinded to specific keys. With a controller, skills can be swapped out inside of specific binds, you can't change the binds for shield and weapon use. Essentially, you're either interacting with an NPC, moving around, or fighting with your weapon and skills of choice. The fun comes from how many ways there are to execute these actions.You can fish, which involves keeping a bar lined up over an icon, horizontally. It's relaxing, satisfying, and you can even fish up equipment from time to time! You can use ingredients and even previous armors and weapons to craft new armors and weapons. Talk to NPCs for fun, or quests (many of which reward skill or talent points.) Refight bosses with ease and convenience whenever you want. Fight mobs with specific spawn zones whenever you want. Respec your build and play a different way. Redo your hair and clothes, including colors. Progress in the campaign, solving puzzles and completing challenges to complete dungeons. Kill monsters and critters to try and complete your card collection, which grant permanent buffs. Capture specific critters/monsters as pets, which can be used to boost your stats. Amass wealth by selling drops you farm. Try your builds in the roguelite arcade mode. Play alone. Play with friends. Play with strangers.No matter who you are, I maintain there is something to like in Secrets of Grindea...Except those annoying bees.Graphics:Oh, did I mention you can do all of this while being immersed in a cute colorful world with gorgeous sprites, backgrounds, and simple fun animations? Because you totally can do that.The screenshots should speak for themselves.Audio:So the sound in Secrets of Grindea may be the one weak point of the game. That isn't to say it is terrible, but simply that the rest of the game is so good, it has a bit of trouble keeping up with its current implementation. You won't find yourself buried in 100 different sounds blurring together and deafening you like some games, but at the same time, the diversity of sound applied to skills and actions can be a bit unsatisfactory. If all the skills had more distinct, appealing, impactful sounds that gave them more individual identity, the game would feel a lot better, as your character would then be something more individual you can be more attached to as well. Now, all that said, you probably won't be muting the game or anything, and the music is nice, although you may end up muting that if you hang out in certain hubs a lot. On the other hand, I found myself muting the music less often than other games, because it is appropriately relaxing and/or fitting for the areas and situations they go with.Conclusion:Secrets of Grindea is an RPG about variety and freedom. Oldschool gamers, adults, kids, casuals, and hardcore players can all find something fun here. I recommend Secrets of Grindea at:Full price.2x Full Price.3x Full Price.Maybe even 4x Full Price.======================================This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union,providing better standards for reviews and reviewers.====================================== "

Early Access Review
								I hate grinding. I really do. But not in this game as the grinding is rewarding and the battle system is a lot of fun.YOU DON'T HAVE TO GRIND - BUT YOU'LL WANT TOSecrets of Grindea is a 2D Action-RPG with roots in the SNES-era ARPG games such as the Mana-series and Legend of Zelda. The battles are fast and the basics are quite easy to learn. You can't just button smash your way through though. The system is very much reliant on your skills and strategies, despite the fact that you can grind for levels to overpower yourself.The beauty of the game is that you don't have to grind an excessive amount of time, but often you'll want to. If you just want to enjoy the story and explore the world, you can advance fairly quickly through the story. Boss battles are often very tough if you're underleveled but with a correct strategy, they are very beatable without power grinding. You unlock new areas to explore by advancing the story and you are free to roam the areas you've unlocked. The enemies are visible on the map and they are all avoidable.A 2D SANDBOX WITH TON OF STUFF TO DOFor the completionists, there is a ton of optional things to do. There's fishing, potion-making, side-quests, secrets, puzzles, pet catching, pet leveling, arena-battles, crafting and a ton of mob drops that are hard to get. I myself have already spend at least 2 times more than my Steam play-time shows in this game, doing all the optional stuff. That was over a year ago when there wasn't this much new content in it yet. The leveling system is very nice since you get points to spend on skills as you please. There is a good amount of different skills to choose from and all of them have strategic value. There is also a lot of different equipment which you can buy, craft or get as a drop from the monsters.YOU DON'T PLAY POKEMON-GAMES FOR THEIR STORYThe story isn't awful either. It's not the focus of the game nor the main reason to buy the game. It has enough meat in it to keep you motivated to go further and to give some context to your adventure but don't expect it to move you to tears or grab you emotionally. Think Pokemon games and their story and you'll know what level of story-telling to expect.As a big fan of stories and powerful story-telling in games, I would've wanted a more compelling story-telling personally but because of the strong gameplay, the lack of PSX-era Final Fantasy-esque story telling doesn't bother me much at all.TOO LONG, DIDN'T READAll in all, this has been my #1 most anticipated indie-game since 2013, when I bought the pre-order beta. SoG is a a good balance of excellent gameplay, exploration and story. While the story is not up to par with the gameplay, the complete package is still excellent and the 3 Swedish Stooges can be proud of what they've been working on for all these years.			"

								This is a fun little ARPG, Well worth the price, lots to do and smooth gameplay. Reminds me of the good old SNES days, and includes lots of references to other games. Kudos to the devs on a job well done, I've only played a little bit of the game so far but i am really liking what i have experienced. I like the fact you can relive boss fights encase you missed an item or if you just want to practice against them. I get nervous when it comes to Early Access titles, but this one tops every other i have tested. Really like the artwork, sprites and music. Lots of different ways to build your character. Refund stats option is nice. Feels like a finished game, cannot wait to see what the devs add in later on.			"

Early Access Review
								It's a zelda-eqse play-with-your-friends 8 bit RPG + an additional mode where you can play it as a roguelike with your friends. It's incredibily polished and the combat system is well refined and requires more timing and depth than other games of the same genre. While some of the ways to beat the bosses are cliche, this is not necessarily a downside because they are splendidly executed. Furthermore, there are a fair amount of bosses whose patterns/attacks the developers have taken creative liberty to make unique, unexpected, and enjoyably difficult. Characters are not class bound; rather each character has a limited number of usuable skill points and the same pool of skills they can choose from. This allows for multiple unique playthroughs on both story and arcade (roguelike) mode. I haven't found a similar game that brings forth the amount of depth, polish and nostalgia that Grindea has. "

								If you are looking for a game to evoke your memories of childhood, this is it.  Secrets of Mana was bar none my favorite game on the SNES.  Nothing I have played since gives quite the same feeling of grinding on rabites for hours on end to build weapon skills.Not only does Grindea have a similar battle system, but it adds several customization options, from combat skills to magic to costumes, it also adds puzzle elements and arcade modes for further challenge.  The rare loot drops keep you farming mobs and bosses, and for the meta meta minded, there are card drops from in game enemies, in game achievements, Steam achievements, and presumably down the road, Steam cards.  It's a total overload of gathering meta!If I had to pick some complaints about the game, here they are:Arcade mode - I'm not patient enough, and never get passed the first or second stage.  Gimme a heal, dammit.Greenlight - It took way too long to get Greenlight, dammit.Development time - Stalking the devblog gets old after a while.  It has been way too long a wait for the complete game, dammit.I might have an issue with patience.Do yourself a favor, if you ever enjoyed overhead Nintendo games, support the devs, give this a shot.  It's only an amazing themesong and a fuzzy sprite away from being a classic.Also, hats.  That is all.			"

								What I like in this game :- Cute arts, animations, sounds and musics (it's really well crafted and lots of tiny details)- Cute story (not finished yet, but the beginning is nice)- Fishing mini game- Pet collecting- Card collecting that gives you character stats- Customisable character, with vanity slots for armors and weapon just for look !- Skill system (I haven't played enought yet to judje it indepth, but just to play casually for the moment, it's simple and gives you a lots of choices to  build up differently your character)- Grinding ! (mobs will respawn quickier if you grind in one place, it's also easy to travel around the map without timer or charges or any annoying time gate. Grinding is fun and that's awesome !)- Combat (not too easy, not too difficult either. It's fun and not boring. It helps a lot with the grinding point too !)- multiplayer : easy to host or join a game. Just becarefull of the ping :p- Arcade mode : addictive and hard !What I don't like :-What I would love to see in the game :- Housing ! I found some housing item so I guess that will come.. maybe ? :D- more mini games !Yeah there is nothing in the ""what I don't like"" list, it's normal. It's an awesome game !If you are wondering if buying an ARPG in early access is worth it, this one is really worth it.Go buy it !Right now.			"

								I have over 100 hours pumped into the game [if you include the pre-steam access] and this is one of my favorite games of all time.Pros:- Typical story, but hilarious dialog, fun characters and environmental/discovery-based story telling makes it a great experience.- Super deep and rewarding combat system with a plethora of skills and mechanics to master such as the perfect guard.- Enemies and bosses attack differently between normal and hard mode, as well as single or multiplayer- Skill charging makes it so you have almost 3 different skills at your disposal despite leveling only one skill.- Loads of side quests, mini games and discoveries to be found.- Multiplayer with up to 4 players that is super smooth gameplay-wise. Connection is also easy via Steam friend list.- Gorgeous pixel art that contains many little details to make the game world feel alive.- Music fits each area very well and does not overstay its welcome at all.- Arcade (roguelite) mode adds a ton of replayability. Beating it is hard enough, the side roguelite quests and high score chasing allows infinite replayability.Cons:- Non-hosts may experience lag, which ruins the multiplayer experience [case-by-case basis]- Would be nice for some skills to interact with each other more for multiplayer mayhem [Earth spike wall + Smash?]For a detailed full impressions video [8 minutes long], check out this video below!

Early Access Review
								This game is absolutely awesome!The game provides a great story and a mind thinking gameplay! Every boss needs some type of thinking to be able to beat it with is good! It is competetive which keeps it interesting! The arcade mode is absolutely terrific! Ive been playing for a really long time now and ive only reached floor 7 or something! So its really a challenge, but it isnt impossible!The only bad thing about the game is that it is not done! But this is only early access, and people who buy it now, agree on that! ;)Remember that only 3 developers work on this game and therefor it may be hard to release content as fast as we wish! Its epic that they (only 3) are able to release such good content with only 3 people working on it! By time updates have come out faster and I think its super awesome with updates because it is always something to look  forward to!P.S The COOP Mode is awesome!			"

								Been a supporter since 2011 and the quality of the content released by these developers is top notch. They're a small indie team (3 people AND they're swe♥♥♥♥ like me!) and they're doing their best to deliver a perfect game. The game is definintely worth 13.99€ and I can't wait to see the finished product! Keep up the good work fellow swe♥♥♥♥! <3 Sure the development is slow, but it's because the content isn't rushed like other games. They're taking the time they need to deliver polished and non-broken updates. It's developers like these that us the consumers should support!			"

								This game is great Reminds me of Ragnarok online in that you horde tons of sellable junk. It's great the dev. did not choose to make this game another mmo and offered it as a stand alone/multi player game instead. Wish there were more rpg's out there like this.1. Has a great sound track2.you can craft items (makes it hard not to want to sell thing's untill you know you don't need it for a reciepe later.)3. You can fish (alot like fishing in the breath of Fire games.)4. You can custimize the color of your character and outfite. Also has gender selction.5. For you card collectors you can collect Cards that inhance your stats permanently, comes with album for card storage.6. It has multi player yaaay!7.Fast travel to get around the map quicker.8. You can fight bosses over again from the collecters HQ.9. This game is made for horders who doesn't love beating up slimes and rabbits for bits of jelly and hide screw mother nature!10. If you loved Earthbound and Secrete of Mana with a touch of Ragnarok online then this game is for you becuase it has a well developed story with a variety of characters with unique personalities never a dull moment . (This game is easily played with a keyboard but i would recomed a controller.)			"

								A long overdue small sum of points I suppose.At the current state the game is beyond playable without being completed.The team takes the time to polish everything they put out even though it may take a long time its well worth it.Tons of skills , abilities and pixel art? Win :DStory mode to 100 percent probably 30-40 hours of content alone right now?? Arcade mode is well..... Endless and great fun.If you have been browsing or following the game for a while now, Just get it lol. Well worth the money. "

Early Access Review
								Secrets of Mana.... I mean of Grindea is a great game so far, Although unfinished (As most betas are) The secret of Grindea is a homage to one of the best RPGs to the SNES, adding in it's own spin on the classic game style. The bosses are challanging, the animations and gameplay is fluid and really nice, you can fish, there are hats. All in all it's a really solid game so far, and I'm excited to see what they can do with it. This is definitely a game to look forward to once it's complete. Although I wouldn't reccomend people buying it right now at the stage it is at unless they want that nostalgia of playing this style of game with friends. I think it's still a little too incomplete to be playable for an extended period of time... Mainly because you'll finish how much they have in the game so far fairely quick. But if the Devs read this, Keep up the good work, because if the rest of the game is as good as how much of it I have seen. And if the content of it keeps expanding so there's replayability to it this is going to be a game that brings a lot of people to it.			"

								Secrets of Grindea will graphically take you back to the SNES era of action roleplaying games. An early access game, but with frequent patches and new art on developers blog, Secrets of Grindea is starting to bloom. Gameplay can be as long or as short as you want it to be. However, if you wish to collect all the goodies, including mob cards, you'll want to grind often.			"

Early Access Review
								First thing i would like to note, that at this current stage, the games storyline and area's are still being developed. And the development progress is in small and sometimes slow doses between updates. For me personally, i have stopped playing til the game is complete so my experiance is not lost by the partial development.With that in mind, do not let that put you off from purchasing the game. It will be one great experience once complete, and even between.Meanwhile, until the game is fully developed, you can optionally beta test and help the developers stamp out any nasty issue's found, make suggestions towards the development via the games forum found upon their site, or simply play the addictive Arcade mode. Or perhaps you just dont mind playing the game in partial installments.""Grind""ea? True to it's name, there is some grinding involved here and there, though it is done and balanced rather well.I Love the detail that has been put into this ""JRP Zelda type"". From the artwork, to the gameplay details such as the skill system. Finding a game of this type with such TLC from the developers (also explains the slow rate of developement), that also supports cooperative multiplayer.. is just rare.One thing that the store descriptions fails to mention, is the existance of the crafting system (Unless that is a part of the ""hidden content"").Weapons, gear etc can be crafted from various ingredients found throughout the game.There is not much else i can tell you, apart from what the store page describes. So ill finish this with a personal rating..9/10 - Would buy it again.. and again. I Love this game, and i love it's ever promising future.			"

Early Access Review
								Updated review It's good, I would say wait until it's FULL RELEASE to even consider buying- and before I start off this, let it be known I have nothing but love for this game and the devs themselves, they're great people, it's a great game but I need to be honest here.The multiplayer works perfectly, I honestly couldn't detect any syncing issues which was nice. I feel like there should be more customization options both in character creation and skills, I know there will eventually be more skills, it's just a matter of waiting.  The crafting system is grind heavy, I personally like that but I understand it's not for everybody. I feel like the combat is a little too easy once you get the hang of it although I love the enemy variety in this game and every boss can provide a bit of challenge but outside of the bosses, the game is a breeze.The story is basically non-existent at this point but I will say the writing is charming and humorous, I actually caught myself laughing at some points. The updates are very infrequent and at this point and it's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, I won't hold anything back on that, since last year the story hasn't progressed in any meaningful way, I can't even bring myself to open this game anymore unless a friend asks me to play. Overall I give it a 3/10, I would give it a 10/10 if updates were more frequent but as a customer I'm very frustrated and frankly I'm tired of the early access game tropes.The arcade mode is also kind of fun, forgot about that, it's kind of like binding of isaac in a small small way, pretty difficult when playing solo.

Early Access Review
								Oh. My. God. The movie trailer does nothing for this game. They make it look almost too cartooney - however - If Secret of Mana and Zelda had a lovechild... you get this game. It is so FUN and addicting. Ive been playing multiplayer with my brother and sister in law who live 3 hours away and its the coolest way to connect with them. It is exciting and challenging for seasoned gamers, but my sister-in-law who never picks up a controller can play right along with us. The game itself has lots to do - quests, LOTS of side activities so you wont get bored. And dare I say... grinding/farming is actually somehow... FUN in this game? I havent found 1 singular thing i did not like about this game. It's a magestic work of art. For the love of god and all things holy PLEASE keep on developing and adding more content. Not like we need any yet... We've played 22 hours getting trophies and doing quests and upgrading our gear so we havent even made a dent in the story line. But this game is worth every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cent. Buy it. You wont regret it. Dear Developers: YOU STRUCK GOLD, KEEP GOING!			"

Early Access Review
								Charming, fun, vibrant and addicting - this is one great RPG!In this world you are a Collector, someone who explores and adventures across the world in search of rare loot and items of power! Every enemy in the game has at least one rare ""drop"" to collect so this really is a game for players who love to collect/farm/grind! There is also a crafting system that can *GASP* actually make powerful and useful gear!The combat gives off vibes of Secret of Mana but its much less rigid and limited than the old school RPGs of yore are. You can choose freely amongst 1h melee with shield, 2h melee and 4 schools of magic (Fire, Earth, Ice and Air). You invest skill points into whatever skill you desire and then the combat becomes an awesome weave of offense and defense as you bust out your skills in real-time!Boss battles are great and plentiful as well! Really, this is a great action oriented RPG with a major emphasis on its addicting collection system (GRINDea, get it? :P) Usually ""grinding"" is looked poorly upon but honestly its quite addicting in this game and every enemy and boss can be beaten without taking a single point of damage so ultimately you don't actually have to grind - if you're really good!

The pixel art is beautiful, the environments and enemies are varied, the puzzles are fun diversions, and the dialogue contains just the sort of humour that I like.			"

								Secrets of Grindea is an ARPG inspired by old classics such as The Legend of Zelda, Secret of Mana etc.You play as a Collector (or a Collector to be) in the world of grindea, a world where everyone is obsessed with collecting items and despite the word ""Grind"" in the title, you never feel like you HAVE to grind, its always there as a side task to help you get some rare loot etc.It also features a very customisable skill system where you can effectively build a character you want, there are no unique classes as such and all the skills you see are the skills you will get, each skill has its benefits and drawbacks.The Game is split into 2 different modes, Story mode and Arcade mode, Story mode is exactly what you expect from most RPG's and Arcade mode is very Roguelike where each death is a learning experience (and trust me, you'll die A LOT)The Soundtrack is Amazing, i regret not purchasing it myself, it fits the game so perfectly.

								Yes!... But no at the same time(well at least no for right now)It's very reminiscent of the ARPGs of the past and definitely reminds me of the GB Zelda series (like the oracles series) and for those really needing to scratch that itch, it scratches that itch... halfway. I really REALLY want this story mode to be finished and figured I put in a bit of money for early access to help entice the devs a little and signed up for the front-line beta to see what's up and coming. Seeing as how consistent they've been on their dev blog, I'm suret hat my money hasn't been put out there in vain.What is present of it rn though, I think it could flesh out to be a really nice and unique experience especially with how out of the ordinary your companion is XD. (and no! it's nothing like Navi or Tatl kek)The only reason to buy it now is to experience the arcade mode, which btw is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic with other people!			"

Early Access Review
								It's a good game, but I honestly feel that it's extremely overhyped for what it offers--which isn't much.  I wouldn't really play the game for its story, as it seems pretty basic and I didn't find there to be much character depth.  It does try and it does give you some background to the characters and features a nice ""cinematic"" of the player's mom (which is actually really awesome because they made it so that her hair+skin color is the same as whatever you chose for yourself).  But that's more of a game feature than something specifically story related--the story itself, like I said is pretty stereotypical.  Some people might like it, but after playing so many games, it just feels repetitive--if this was an mmo, you wouldn't even bother reading it.The combat has some nice elements (though I do remember being a bit frustrated with a few things--sorry, it's been over a year since I played this, so I can't remember the details very much) and the art is cute enough that I would like to continue playing it, but since the game is unfinished at the moment, my only options are to play Arcade Mode or to grind for cards.  I don't really want to grind for cards when their website's forum FAQ states there may be a potential wipe when the game is finished.  Maybe this has changed, but even so it feels odd to grind for something you may never use.The problem isn't that the game is unfinished--we knew that going into EA, but what we didn't know until after we had completed all there is to do was that it's been in development since 2011 and is still only about 30% to completion.  The description on Steam with the link to the devblog in bold paints the picture that development is constant and EA will soon be over, but this doesn't seem to hold true.  Many of the areas in the game that you try to go to will give you a little notification that it's not yet implemented.  (Also on this, if you try to go to another map and you're cooping, you will be denied access unless all party members are at standing on top of you--just a heads up for those who might be bothered by this.)  As is, I think there are about 10 or so hours of content in storymode.   On top of this, if you notice the Discussion Page on Steam features a locked sticky entitled, ""Haven't played in over a year..."" where in the last post, the developer states, ""New threads will be locked, and if the same user keeps creating new ones we're going to assume they're just rabble rousing and we'll use the dusty ol' ban hammer that's mostly sitting in the corner.""  Which boils down to: You are not allowed to mention the slow development.  Ever.  I don't know... I just don't think that kind of censorship is exactly right.Additionally, the website's FAQ states that they are not looking for additional people to help with the project and all positions are filled, so while they say things are slow because they only have three people to work on the game, they're not actively trying to remedy that, despite people offering to help.  I checked out the latest post on the devblog again, and one of the things that was written, ""Definitely looking forward to another year of fun gamedev, and I hope you’ll all stay with us through our journey!"" doesn't sound too hopeful that the game will be finished next year, either.  Again, though, I'm not trying to say the game itself is bad; it's just that... there's not much there.  I'm really sad to leave this with a negative review, but I just cannot comprehend how these issues seem to be so overwhelmingly glossed over.  We bought this game over a year ago and keep checking back only to feel really discouraged; fifteen dollars is a lot for someone to spend on something that doesn't seem to have a lot of hope at the moment and I just don't want anyone to be put in a situation where they end up disappointed.If the game is ever completed, I would probably change my recommendation, but at the moment, I don't think I can recommend it, sorry.

Early Access Review
								Admittedly, I went into this game not knowing much about it at all, which is somewhat rare for me in this day and age. I did this because I felt I didn't need to know much about the game, my very first impression from the trailer and a youtube video sold me on the spot. And I can say, roughly 9 hours into the game as of this review, that my first impression was spot on. If you enjoy the classic action RPGs of the 1990's and early 2000's, such as Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Illusion of Gaia, or (obviously) Secret of Mana, then this game is for you and is well worth your time, money, and intrigue.From my perspective, this game offers 4 distinct areas of interest that define the experience:Story Mode Arcade ModeMultiplayerThe Progression System (Skills and Talents) I will be covering all 4, explaining my experiences and impressions of each.STORY MODEWhile a bit lacking in the engaging story aspect, Secret of Grindea's (SoG) Story Mode offers something many RPGs have failed to have for a while now: the elegance of simplicity. Many modern titles have an obsession with creating a novel's worth of narrative. Cutscene after cutscene, wall of text after wall of text, the experience of these titles are moreso about the story and presentation of it than the actual game.SoG takes the short and simple approach, where it gives enough story and narrative to provide context and motivation, but is spaced well enough where it does not feel like a chore to read through it all (having the option to skip cutscenes helps too). Not to say that the story isn't interesting, though. While simple and somewhat of a parady of other RPGs, many of the characters are likeable in their own right and their clever interactions are both entertaining and humurous. It's clear a lot of heart was put into the devolpment of this game from all of the silly and minor references to other games and characters.Putting aside the storytelling aspect of SoG, there's quite a bit of content packed into what is currently available (game is still in beta as of this review). From collectables, to crafting, to minigames, puzzles, Zelda-esque dungeons, side quests, arena challenges, and engaging and replayable boss fights, there's a lot to do. But my favorite aspects are the inclusion of a genuinely difficult hard mode that can be toggled on or off at any time and the ability to customize the look of your character in the form of hats and accessories (that override the look of your currently equipped armor).To review:Pros:Simple but effective narrativeInteresting and humurous dialoguePlethora of activities, side quests, and minigamesInteresting boss fightsHard ModeCons:Game not complete (with no ETA)ARCADE MODEArguably, this is where most of your time will go. This mode is SoG's roguelike feature, where you attempt to progress as far as you can through a serious of increasingly challenging rooms and obstacles on a single life. Much in the way of other roguelikes (such as Rogue Legacy), you have the ability the make succeeding runs easier in the form of unlocking perks. These are unlocked via a currency you obtain randomly as a drop and from completing quests and achievments.The farther you go and the better you do, the more points you will recieve. After each death, your points are tallied up and added to your total score across all games. After certain thresholds have been met, you will revieve rewards, such as cosmetics (hats and accessories), more NPCs to interact with, and more buildings/decorations for your hub. There is also a global leaderboard for the mode, so if you're into that sort of thing you can sate your fancy here.As for the actual content of the mode, it's challenging but rewarding. Like any other roguelikes, there are a lot of elements of randomness involved. The dungeon layout, challenges in each room, and the loot you get are all up to chance. However, this works as the combat system is based on skill moreso than raw stats. You will get farther in the dungeon because you got better rather than because you got some good luck on your drops. You find that you are excited to get as far as you can as that shows just how much better you got at the game more than anything else.Pros:Unlockable PerksAchievmentsLeaderboardReplayabilityCons:Can have a somewhat harsh learning curveCan feel repetative at timesLike story mode, not all of the floors are implemented yet.MULTIPLAYERWhile I have no personal experience with this feature myself, I have seen examples of this in videos and streams. From what I have seen, multiplayer is fairly smooth and simple to do. Multiplayer is available for both Story Mode and Arcade Mode, so if you have a group of friends you can enjoy all aspects of the game together with up to 4 people.Be that as it may, it's not perfect. Currently, there is no option to play with your friends locally. You will need to connect to each other through different computers, and each person will need to have a copy. Additionally, it lacks some quality of life functions such as being able to join someone from your friends list. And, as one would expect from online play, there can exist some connection issues and bugs (although I've yet to see any).Pros:Can play with up to 4 peopleCan play in both Story Mode and Arcade ModeSmooth and stable online playCons:Can have some connection issues and bugsLacks QoL polishNo Local PlaySKILLS AND TALENTSAn RPG needs to have some form of progression, and SoG does it with it's ability system. What makes this one stand out from the rest is its simplicity and its lack of restrictions. There are no skill trees, no level/stat requirements, you just choose the skills you like and roll with it. And so much is added to this game because of it.There are a varity of skills that appeal to all forms of play, be it aggressive, defensive, evasive, melee, range, single target, AoE, Burst, DoT, etc. And given the lack of restrictions on obtaining skills, you can create a massive amount of different and interesting builds. Want to be an aggressive and fast melee striker? Go for it. Want to be a long-ranged magic nuker? Sure! Want to combine both melee and magic for a hybrid spellsword? That's cool too.Additionally, a lot of the skills from different branches work well together. For instance, Static shock is a spell that will do additionally damage very time you hit with a physcial attack. You can restore charges for this skill from using physical skills or doing perfect guards, meaning this skill can be used in all kinds of builds, both offensive and defensive.While I would argue a need for more skills, the simplicity of the current design is also appealing and useful. While some talents prove to be more useful than others, many of the skills have their uses and can work well given the right circumsances.In the end, what gives this game a lot of replayability, both in Story Mode and in Arcade Mode, is the progression system and the appeal of trying out new builds and tactics.Pros:Non-restrictiveSkills work well togetherInteresting and thoughtful effectsEasy to make and try new builds and tacticsSimple and easy to understandCons:Some talents not as useful as othersArguably not enough skills to facilitate variety "

								How this game is currently1. Hit things till they die with weapons and/or magic2. Take their items and money3. Make stuff with those items4. Do the occasional Quest5. Fight the occasional boss6. Fight those bosses till you get their items7. Fish for six hours8. Kill everything until you get their cardThis is why people might like or dislike this game but if you can't tell that there's grinding in this game you probably don't have a proper vocabulary			"

								Secrets of Grindea is a great game, the fighting is great, I love the art, the grinding/farming is not to horrible either. I love the skill tree also, No set classes are awesome! My only problem with this game is the update rate, I know they don't have a huge team, But I NEED MORE! This game is awesome, I would HIGHLY recommend. If you like Zelda type of art and fighting, or even if you don't, this game could be for you.			"

								Many reviews note that this game is a ripoff and has slow development. And frankly, yeah, it's been in development forever. There is a dev blog and it is updated fairly often but there is still a lack of justification for the length of time it's taken to complete the game.That aside, this is not like other early access games. This is a really, really well-made game with a lot of content already in it. There is clearly a lot of love that went into this game down to the sprite animations, the little cutscenes, puzzles, and gameplay itself. I went through the main portion of the content in 15 hours and beyond that there's achievements and arcade mode which is insidious and takes forever. Co-op is really fun and unique especially considering most games don't offer it, ever.This was without a doubt worth the $15 even unfinished. I loved playing this game and I was instantly addicted. It's extremely refreshing to see quality of this magnitude with indie development. And yet, what's disappointing is the lack of additions in such a length of time. This game has a colossal amount of potential to be even more than it is right now. If you're okay with 50% of a game and 10-15 hours of gameplay, you won't regret purchasing it.			"

								Secrets of Grindea is an awesome little game with a great art style and a lot of care put into it. Has a well written story which is playable entirely in co op (a HUGE plus, more games need to do this) and old school, SNES style action rpg gameplay. The writing is funny, the world is enjoyable to explore and beautifully crafted, the gameplay is simple but really fun and challenging at times. If you're looking for a  cool co op game, this is it. If you're looking for a cool game in general, this is also it. One slight downside: I recommend playing this with a controller, since keyboard controls are a bit iffy. Support games like these!			"

You could get items there you can wear in story mode. :)I also really like the concept of catching an animal in story mode, which will be your pet. I love pets, haha. :) Some skills also look like pets, because they walk with you, really cute. <3I'm looking forward to the moment more content comes available, I'm waiting some time now, but when it's there, I'll be all over it, haha. :)--> Really, really, really recommend this! <--			"

Early Access Review
								For some odd reason, the game reminds me a lot of Paper Mario for the N64. I'm not exactly sure why... there's hardly any similarities.I tried the demo of this game (lead up to the arena fight), and it had me sold. I was hesitant to buy it at the time, on sale, or was released... the formar took over (and I'm glad, worth every $ and then some). This game just... pulls me in and refuses to let go. I have to pry myself away from the game! (or till I feel my bladder being full to the brim...)I picked hard difficulty as normal felt... easy for me... I have completely underestimated hard difficulty than I usually do for RPG games! At first I thought the game was just a collection of popular and maybe hardly used RPG tropes... well I'm not completely wrong. The story in the game is... interesting to say the least (up to what I reached)... at least I think there's a story? Somewhere? Maybe I overlooked it half way...The game does encourage AND reward you for grinding/farming. I've noticed several times the spawn rate increases if it registers you grinding/farming, unlike other RPGs the spawn rate will decrease and/or would spawn mobs elsewhere instead of the spot you're on. (Looking at you MMORPG's... especially the F2P ones...) For some reason... grinding/farming isn't so trivial or boring than other games. Probably because I'm not seeing high leveled players showing me up one-hitting everything while I'm struggling (Always saw that as bad form) or the struggle isn't worth it.Some of the mobs I feel move a bit too fast for hard mode. Strong, more HP, and additional moves I understand but... some just don't pause at all. Rather have the mobs pause less than in Normal than not pausing at all. Be nice if mobs had a weakness and resistance. Having a hard time just trying to kill them with no disadvantages.The boss fights... either the bosses need a little tweaking, the leveling system needs bit of a fix, and/or the skills need to be reworked. There's been a few boss fights that nearly made me just go to normal difficulty (I had to temporary for the sentry mini-boss due to the stupid orbs!) Either too much is going on for me to register what's happening, I'm unable to get strong enough to properly face this boss/foe, and/or the skills I have are weak than they should be.I've nearly crafted every item on the current list... on bit of a card hunt now. See cards as a reward for grinding/farming excessively as they give you benefits whether to your stats or purchases (that I've seen so far). Wish leveling actually increased your stats than just give you points to spend... I shouldn't feel so weak than I should be for (current) end-game bosses (toward Winter, Hydras, Toy Machine, etc.). Granted it's hard, but shouldn't be dark-souls difficult! (That's what it felt like most of the time after the numerous times of being frustrated at bosses to the point of nearly tossing my laptop out the one story window!!!)Pick this up at its price of $15. Shouldn't wait for a sale, unless you're low on cash, to enjoy this. If you rather play a finished product than in development, then you'll be waiting for quite some time. Half of the story content is in the stable beta right now.I'll most likely either update or completely rewrite this review when the game is finished. I think I'll wait till this game is finished before I continue any further in the story though.Update: Tried a bit of Arcade Mode... it's not very forgiving that it discourages me. Reminds me of Rogue Legacy but harsher...-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.			"

								Do not buy this game right now, but definitely put it on your wishlist and buy it immediately when it's finished.Assuming you're looking at this now because it's been recommended by Steam, or you're searching for the kind of game that is reminiscent of Secrets of Mana/Chrono Trigger/Any of those classic SNES RPGs, you're going to absolutely want this game, but don't spoil the experience by getting it now.  It's so good.  They've gotten the feeling of an old school RPG down perfectly, but married it with modern playability and UI.  I've played it with my two best friends in coop and it brought us back over a decade to nights we'd spend sitting around a TV enjoying old consoles together.Secrets of Grindea's store page is the one that I visit most frequently, watching the updates hoping for content completion, because its gameplay is perfection, but when I played it was 25% content complete, and I was pretty disillusioned when we hit that wall.  I want the full experience, and I'm chomping at the bit.I know development takes a long time, especially with a small team, and they're doing a phenomenal job, but if I could, I'd go back and stop myself from playing until the full game was released.  If you're like me and you CAN'T wait, then ignore my warning and buy it, because this is going to be an absolute treat, but know that you're going to be like me, constantly checking the store page for more news.

								Note, before anything else I just want to direct you to this: http://www.secretsofgrindea.com/index.php/dev-blogThis is the dev blog. as you can see, this has been in development for four years, and over the course of these years, they have keeping us up to date, with less the a post per week being non-existent for a long time now. This progect has a very dedicated team working on it. Don't worry, AT ALL, about this game never being finnished. It already almost is, after all.Now that that's out of the way, There's not much else that I can say which you wouldn't learn by watching the trailer. This is a game inspired by, and fashioned after a lot of the old clasics. A bit of Zelda here, a bit of metroid there, and splashes of a lot of other games. I personnaly have been holding back on this game, waiting for it to be finnished before I continue to the second dungeon, but I've played quite a bit of survival (even if I'm still not that good) and enjoyed every minuet of it. Honestly, I recomend you watch the trailer on the store page, it does a better job then I could showing you what this game is, but if you still have some questions, ask below. I'll answer as best I can.			"

The combat system is smooth and well paced, leveling up and spending points to learn new moves and skills works great. Familiar story of becoming an adventurer in a world full of magic, combined with the soundtrack and 2D graphics bring back great nostalgic memories from the SNES era of gaming.Recommend to all, looking forward to playing this game and watching it grow!

The game has so much to see even in it's early access state.  With a fun combat system, great story content, well thought out dungeons, loot driven crafting and a ton of replayablility via arcade mode, this game actually shocked me with how much they packed in.   I have to say I was a tiny bit skeptical at first.  The title alone might make people not want to take the game seriously.  It successfully walks a fine line of being a great RPG and being a self aware parody or classic RPGs. "

								For a Early Access game this is highly impressive. For one the amount of effort and polish here is staggering. Spritework is very detailed and charming and the animations are top notch all around. NPCs don't just sit around, they walk, talk, sneeze, cough, sigh, eat some chicken, work and more. They are all doing something and each one feels unique and goes a long way to draw you into the game world.The gameplay is very tight and responsive. You have a robust amount of options when it comes to combat style thanks to weapon skills and various schools of magic. Specialize or mix and match, its all up to you and the game encourages it. The option to buy back level up points is a nice feature if not pricey. The game also has tons of great design choices. Puzzle challenges let you rewind various steps of the puzzle. Pushed a block in the wrong space? No problem, step on a tile to undo it without having to reset the whole thing. And that feature is nice cause these puzzles can rack your brain on occasion. When it comes to crafting you can pin recipes your working on to your hud so you can know what you need at all times. Tons of smart game design on display here.And not to mention the games Arcade mode which honestly could have been a whole game by itself. Its a permadeath roguelike style experience which asks you to go into randomly generated dungeons to rack up as many points as possible in one run by not only clearing rooms but being smart and quick about it. These points go towards improving your hub town. You can also find special rare items you can cash in for permanent perks that carry over from character to character. Also this whole game has 4 PLAYER ONLINE CO-OP! For Story AND Arcade mode with various features that go with that too like competitive minigames.My mind is blown that this is a Early Access game cause good lord its already far acceded its asking price for me. Get a copy or two for your buddies and enjoy some good old fashioned action RPG goodness. ^^			"

								I've been playing the beta non stop for around 2 days now, and I've got to say that I am very impressed. It has all the charm of older RPG's like 'Legend of Zelda- The Minish Cap' but with a multitude its own little flourishes. The story line (so far) has kept me interested, and the side quests aren't just dull fodder. It took me a a short while to get used to navigating the large menu, and I wish I could banish my pet to the farm (not the metaphor) instead of just ""hiding"" it. Sometimes the graphics makes it hard to distinguish what is background art and what is moveable or collectable items, especially when first starting, but it doesn't take long to become used to it.Altogether I think it's a fantastic game, although I am very biased towards that particular RPG style its a real throw-back to old school gameboy games. I will definitely be getting the fully completed version and I'm glad that the developers are taking their time to make the most out of this game. I hope that the game run time isn't too short in its entirety but from how long the developers are taking, I'm sure these fears are unfounded. "

								A really charming nod to games such as legend of Zelda and Secret of Mana. The combat is unexpectedly very fun. Many different weapons and abilities to choose from. While the story was ok, I found myself coming back for the combat. The game also features an optional rouge-like game mode. Final remarks: you won't be buying this game for the story, you will be buying it for the massive amount of unique and varied combat abilities.Edit. I just completed the game, I felt it was a tad short. I know it is early access and it will be completed eventually, but you might want to wait until the game is further along in development before you buy.			"

								I've been wanting to check this out for months and finally got around to it, and now I can't wait to see it completed.  This game feels like a modern mix between the old Zelda games and Secret of Mana, and it's so much fun.  The heavy-handed writing is pretty funny, and it's nice to know that the game doesn't take itself to seriously while still managing to be a very solid ARPG experience.On top of that, it include a Roguelite mode.  VALUE TOWN.

Early Access Review
								Secrets of Grindea is a game I have been looking forward to since I saw it on steam greenlight years ago. This game harkens back to a simpler gaming era; a time where the games had story, very fun fighting mechanics and a sense of completion and fulfillment. A few minor bugs here and there, considering it's still in its baby beta stage and maybe a few issues with enemies being overpowered in their crow control on players. This game is everything I've been wanting out of games today and just haven't been getting. As a future video game designer, Secrets of Grindea has the formula I've been looking for and want to perfect in making a game. I've gotten well over $15 worth of enjoyment out of this game and it's not even fully done yet. Hats off to the developers. 10/10			"

								Love the story mode to death. Funny and fun. With a tongue-in-cheek name like Grindea, they better be sure to pull off making the grind fun, and they really do (though the game isn't particularly grindy unless you're trying to 100% it). Story mode is still quite incomplete but I felt like I got my money's worth already. I just hope they don't flake out on finishing the story like so many Early Access games.As for the arcade mode - this is more personal preference than anything, but I'm not a big fan of this big roguelike trend in indie games these days, so I'm not into the arcade mode. I prefer to save my progress, thanks.			"

								This game is super fun with friends, and its also good for Jolly Cooperations!The reason why im saying this, basically if you put the co-op of the legend of zelda four swords adventures (without the GBA cables), The Art and Pixels from Legend of Manna, with a hint of the card and hat system from ragnarok, put them in a blender, and BAM!, you got Secrets of Grindea, right in front of your face!

Early Access Review
								When I first saw this game I thought it was some JRPG a game focused on story with little gameplay but it would make up for that with how extensive the customization is. I figured 17.00$ for a unfinished game might not be worth it even if it is good because it is still in early access and would have so little to the game that it is not worth it. The game looked like a higher quality indie maker game and that was not what I was interested in so I dismissed it. I wanted something that will have lots to do good gameplay and lots of replay value. I was really wrong about the game. It is so good it is a contender to be one of my favorite games of all time. The game has great replay value, online multilayer, great combat, the fishing mini game is actually okay and it has a interesting but overall funny story that is skipable.  This game have great replay value there are many different monsters that can drop up to 4 different items when you defeat them, some are crafting items sometimes you can get some armor, a sword or a shield. Sometimes you need to gather crafting items to craft a new item or you can just find a new hat, sword if you kill enough monster that drop items. You can play the game with 4 players making the game harder the more people that play but the game is still fun to play because you can spend time focusing on collecting all the items in the game. I have almost played the game over 24 hours and I still have not gathered all the items, cards, achievement and even finished the story. You can change the game from easy to hard in the middle of the game making it very fair. The game has replay value because you could replay the game to have a magic user build otr a melee user build or something like that. The gameplay is fun there is normal and hard difficulty hard adds a few more monsters to the levels makes them more aggressive, faster and stronger. The magic in the game is fair and not overpowered like it is in other games. You have powerful magic but summoning a monster reduces your energy while your summoned monster or passive spells is out. When you level up your base stats go up and if you want extra challenge you could play the game without leveling up and for a price you can respend your points on new spells and abilities. The game does something crazy it makes it fun and gives you a reason to kill over 1000 slimes. You would want to kill the slimes for exp, money, collectibles, cards, crafting items, and even if you already have these you can sell them for money and give them to other players. And the best part is killing slimes is fun they get smarter the more you kill and if your not careful even easy monsters can hurt you.    The story is great it is funny, full of references to games like legend of Zelda other games anime movies etc. The story is interesting enough to watch a few times but thankfully you can skip it if this is your 20th time playing the game. The game has fair DLC there is a 5 dollar hat DLC that is honest that if you play 5 dollars you will give the devs more money so if you want to support them you can. There is no cheap DLC that gives players an edge like golden armor swords or unfair things like that. The games multiplayer is great and there is little lag for me and you can play arcade, the story, VS with other players and its not like the game needed that because the game is fun just playing by yourself. So do I recommend this game YES it has great challenge, it has some of the best replay value I have seen in a story, the gameplay is great  the collectibles are fun and worth getting, the multiplayer have 3 fun modes VS, story and arcade ( you can also play mini games in the story with others) and they are still making the game? It is worth it for sure and when they keep this system add more content, collectibles and things like that this game would be my new favorite game of all time. I really thing you should consider buying this game for a fun game to play buy your self and a fun game to play with friends. the only posible thing that the game could add to make it better would be local multiplayer. the game has good gameplay like castle crashers, replay value and collectables somewhat like MMO games and a short but sweet story.

Early Access Review
								Secrets of Grindea.....how do I say this in a way that people will think, ""Wow, this games sounds good, I should play this?"" Well I don't know honestly. But I'll try my best!Okay so here we go! Secrets of Grindea, first look before buying it I though to myself, ""Eh, this games doesn't look too bad. I hope it's not like every other rpg I've played."" So I bought this game knowing that it was still early access. What a gamble! Okay now lets talk about my first reaction.I booted up the game, (do people even say that anymore?) and was welcomed by a nice and catchy theme song, one I still cannot get out of my head. I proceeded to select stroymode, singlplayer and boom I was in the game! I played through the intro, the first boss, the second boss, and the first two areas. I fell in love with the game because it was really unique and interesting, let's not forget about fun!Fighting! The combat is smooth and not boring, plus the cartoonish style makes it enjoyable. Two handed swords are slow, one handed swords are fast like they should be and wands make magic dealy but don't hurt much. The skills they have add a sort of customization to the game that can make a player speicalize in what they want wether its a tank role,  supportrole, or somwhere in between. Magic in the game is fun though some of the schools of magic,which are ground, wind, ice, and fire, are better than the other this can lead to a broken system where one school of magic in the game is never used making it pointless. Another great feature of the game is the pets! You got to love the pets they're soo CUTE!!! *cough* *cough* On a professional note pets are a fun feature that really adds to the game. The best part of the pets is  that you can feed them certain items that boost your overall stats. This is great like I said previously but broken becuase the game itself has no protection against hacking. You could hack in a billion speed potions if you wanted to and feed them to your pet which makes you OP as heck and can ruin the gaming experience.Lets talk about the gameplay, so far in the game at the date this is written you can only play the game up to Mt.Bloom, which is okay because the game is still in EARLY ACCESS. The monsters can be challenging at times and make you upset. I don't know how many I died by a monster and said,"" I am going to destroy your face!"" I am looking at you Halloweed. The leveling system is pretty fair with a great exp rate through out the story. The bosses are nice with a unique challenge for all of them, you have to create tactics and learn the bosses attack patterns before you can triumph over them. WARNING: Prepare to get creamed by some bosses!! The level spikes in each area you go to are mostly appropriate besides the third area which can get a tad tough becuase of certain enemies. ( I swear the Yeti species hate me >.> )What is an RPG without multiplayer, am I right? Secrets of Grindea goes about there Co-op experience just fine. You can play story mode with friends or play Arcade mode with friends. There is no match making feature currently in the game so you have to go make some friends to play multiplayer. During the story mode when you play multi player whoever is the host of the game it's their story, so don't expect to pick up where you left off in the story mode with your friends if you try to play solo. When you play solo it is your own story on the specific character. The Arcade mode is where you traverse through floors trying to make it to the end, if you die you start all over and loose your gear. There is a warning though, this mode could potentially ruin the story line.Overall this game is really fun and I reccommend that eveyone gives it a try. I rate this game, IN ITS CURRENT STATE AS OF 6/26/2016,  8.5/10 Paws			"

								Secrets of Grindea so far is a great game. Plenty of challenges both in  Story and Arcade Mode. Skills and character movement are responsive, and there are subtle cancellations that make the combat somewhat customizable. The skill choices aren't limited in any way other than being less effective if you use certain weapons. The skills require a ""charge"" and unlock more powerful versions once you've leveled up the skills enough.Story-wise it has some solid moments. A cinematic-driven story with a lot of humor/comic relief. There are some potential plot twists starting to evolve and that may give the story a bit of a turn and spice things up a bit. Overall while i'm not a fan of story/cinema in games, it was enjoyable and not too dramatic or overdone like what a lot of titles do.Creativity-wise, there is a recipe-driven crafting system. You essentially grind some items and are able to put the items together and figure out what the ""unknown item"" is. The character's house is being implemented and there is potential that players will be able to add particular items to that house, and perhaps in a certain order. Other than that players also have some room on choosing their combat style. A player may be a meteor summoning ""shieldmaiden"" that uses a magical spear instead of the typical sword/staff.Other than that there's still a lot of the game being developed. This review was for a particular steam badge. ;) I'd have written a review upon official release instead of during early access, and likely will udpate this review once SoG is complete.			"

So far I've played mostly the Arcade mode mainly because of the cosmetics that you can unlock which can be used in both modes.			"

If you enjoyed secret of mana or zelda as a child then you will love this. the multiplayer and rogue-like mode are brilliant additions to what is already shaping up to be an amazing game!!They may not have done much of the story at this point in time but I am happy to have bought it now as it will help the two (yes two!) people that are making the game. hopefully more people will buy it too so that they can get the content out at an even faster rate!

								Some of the best fun I've had in a long time with a game. The only downside is the frusteratingly slow updates to it. Outside of that, for newcomers, there is a solid 5-7 hours of playtime, with another 10-15 if you are a completionist. and the challenge mode is quite fun if you've beaten the story.EDIT:I reviewed this game on June 9th, 2016. My review was fairly straightforward. To those still on the fence about buying, since my review, there has been *ONE* large update which added a new zone, few minion bosses, and some story enhancements, overall the update added maybe an hours worth of story with 3 hours of grind farming. As started prior, this game is incredibly fun and witty, however, do not buy unless you are ok with waiting anywhere between 4-6 months for decent patches.			"

I've logged in 13 hours playing a lot of story mode trying out the different gameplay styles. There's so much to do and explore that this game is well worth the $15. It isn't completely finished yet but for what they have it's already one of my favorite steam purchases. All in all I would give what you're paying for a 9/10 it's amazing and fun but still incomplete. If you have $15 dollars I would consider picking this up and have a friend pickup a copy and play together.			"

Early Access Review
								Fun game for what there is at the moment. Though there isn't much content in the story mode which i find strange because this game has been in development for years now and they have only managed to finish two temples and a few zones (then they have the cheek of asking for money to go towards coffee breaks in the form of day one DLC) it's still a great bit of fun and the arcade mode adds a lot of replayability. I can't say i'm a fan of the fact they have placed in a online leaderboards as to me that encourages cheating and there's no way you're going to get the #1 spot unless you too cheat and then it makes it seem pointless to do if you're wanting to take part in the arcade mode for the competitive purpose of beating other players. Though this is and the current lack of content in the story mode (at the time of this build i'm sure this will change in later versions) are my only complaints about the game.The music and sound effects are spot on and you can tell they have heavy inspiration from older RPG games and has a great nostalgic feel about it. I played through the game co-op with one friend and i have to say the net code is spot on and we had no problems with lag what so ever and the game seemed input perfect along with not being too restricted to where you can go in co-op. You and your allies still all have to commit to going to a new zone before the game takes you all there but you're not bound together when you're in that zone. The gameplay is flawless in design too and you feel like you have all the control over your character and when you ♥♥♥♥ up and die it is YOUR fault and not the game's. The game has the perfect balance of fun and challenge and the spells/abilities all seem to have their uses though some seem a lot weaker early game and some also seem a lot weaker later game so it's worth experimenting with the abilities as some may be more usefull early game but end up being weak towards the end.Highly recommend checking this gem out as it lives up to the hype and i am extremely exited in seeing what they add in future updates.

								Me and my friends absolutely love this game! I have a group of friends and we are always looking on here for new games that we can all play together and we have dedicated many hours into this game. At the moment we have beat the game and are patiently waiting for the next update. Pros:Great GraphicsGreat ReplayabilityChallengingAddictinggreat game to play alone or with friendsYou can beef up your character's skills as much as you want. there is litterally no limit to how powerful you can be.Cons:Gets laggy if there are too many enemies on the screen at once (they keep respawning if you keep killing them which is good if you want items or xp but bad if it causes lag.)You have to have a seperate save for playing alone than with friends. Whoever hosts the game when you play with the same friends has to continue to be the host every time because the story mode continues from the hosts story. If you wanted to play on your own it will start a new game for you but you will be able to keep your skills and items from the other game with your friends. Alse if somebody else decides to host the game it will also start a new game. This was a bit of an issue because we could not play the game and continue on story mode unless the host was wanting to play as well. We could only play on his terms. taking forever for them to come out with an update.But aside from the cons it is a very fun game and I would recommend it to anybody. By far my favorite game.			"

								The game shows promise. It's a love letter to games like Zelda: A Link to the Past. The animation of the sprites is awesome, and the environments are varied. The dungeons are absolutely fantastic and are definitely the highlight of the game. But it's been incomplete for an absurdly long time at this point. I understand that they want to ensure that it is polished and as good as they can make it for when it gets a full release, but there is really no excuse at this point for why this game is taking so long to make. I can't recommend a game that may only get released a year from now. What we have now is solid and polished, but short and leaves you hanging. I'm worried that when this DOES finally get released (if it ever does), that the hype train will have already left.			"

								What can I say... it is an unfinished game that I just keep playing. Over 100 hours in fact. It is ridiculously charming and tons of fun.Some things to keep in mind though...You know that ""grind"" in the title? If you want to complete everything there is definitely grinding. I like mindless grindfest from time to time so it wasn't a draw back for me, might be for you though.Also, it is not finished. It is clear that the game is a labor of love for the team of three and it certainly shows in both the charm of the game and the length of time it will take to create. Again... this isn't a problem for me I knew that going in and the developer blog on their site shows you their weekly progress so you know they are working on it again its just 3 folks, but don't both if you are the type to say ""this isn't even early access""... because it is even early access, just way earlier than you want it to be. At this point looks like the story content is about halfway done.The downsides out of the way, I want to reiterate that it is a blast and if you are not a negative nancy about playing a game still in development buy it now and have at it. As said by other reviews it is a secret of mana/link to the past style game that is very tongue-in-cheek regarding rpg tropes.			"

Early Access Review
								I have played 5+ hours of the games main story mode with a co op friend and have thoroughly enjoyed it thus far. I plan to give more insight on the details of the game once I have played more and once the game is finalized (as it is in beta/early access at the time of playing). Controls work well, story,setting and writing are both immersive and engaging with well placed humor. Game mechanics are enjoyable with combat being diverse with many options and a in depth leveling/skill system. Along with quipment leaving many diffrent options for how players what to play the game be it all diffrent types of magic, a large assortment of wepons armor and combat quipment such as bows power up potions and stat bonus rings. The visuals and music are great to hear and dont get old on long loops, puzzles are a good challenge, enemies and bosses are fun to fight while still being the right amount of difficult at times. There is alot of good to say about the game and as I play more and the game becomes finalized I will due a more in depth review. If this looks like the type of game you would enjoy I would highly recommend it.			"

								Worth it for $15 the way it is now, but I guarantee you're going to go ""What! AWWW!!!"" when you do get to the end.The story is lighthearted and has a lot of humor thrown in. I found the dialog between characters to be fairly high quality, meaning nobody just wrote ""This guy are sick"" and hit Enter, it shows that thought was put into everything.This is especially true for the animation. From screenshots you'd think this game has SNES-quality graphics, but when you look at the animation, you'll see how much work was put into it and how obvious it is. The animations have a high framerate and are very detailed.Combat isn't too bad. More skill-based than you'd think for something titled ""Grindea"". There's a lot of grinding, but you can't just faceroll through bosses by leveling up.			"

								Secrets of Grindea is incredibly fun! I absolutely love co-op RPGs, and this ARPG has potential. It has a Secret of Mana/A Link to the Past vibe, and after trying out the free demo, I immediately bought it. While the game is still in early access, there is plenty to do. Once you run though the story (as far as you can, it's still in development), there are likely still items to craft, a pet to level to increase your stats, and an arcade mode that is challenging and addictive. As of right now, the game has controller support for a wired 360 controller, and you can use software to bind buttons of other controllers to specific keys, so you can make different controllers work (I'm using the PS4 controller) - the game feels great with a controller, so it's definitely worth doing if the keyboard set-up just isn't working for you.I strongly recommend at least trying the free demo - as there's nothing to lose. It's a relatively small download, and while  you could probably rush through pretty quickly, if you take your time to explore and take things in a little, you'll get a decent amount of content for a demo. The demo can also be played cooperatively, so it's probably worth trying to get a friend or two (or three, if you can) to try it with you!			"

								This game is incredible. Take classic LoZ world exploring and dungeons and all that and add better combat and you get this. Excellent art style, quality sound, interesting dungeons, well thought out boss fights, story is well enough to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about, and the controls are tighter than a 16 year old. Add coop to this game and I don't know what else you could ask for. The multiplayer is excellent (quality wise) and the arcade mode (that also has coop) is icing on the cake.Quick Edit: I don't have a lot of hours logged on steam, thats because most of my play time was on the DRM free version.

								Think Secret of Mana/Evermore with a ton of add-ons: + Online Co-op gameplay (4p) + Character customization + Skill customization + Co-op story mode  + Rogue-like game mode + Same difficulty level as the SNES days, even with 4 people + Very Polished for Early-Access - I couldn't find any issuesThe only drawback is the dev team is small (3 people) and therefore, content comes slower for an Early-Access game.

								This is a great concept for a game it’s nowhere near done yet though it’s been in development since 2011 since Pixel Ferrets the company that makes it is a 2 guys and one girl show. I did everything possible in story mode and it took me almost exactly 15 hours to do so which isn't too bad. Arcade mode is very difficult I almost never made it to level 2 on single player but I'm sure with more people this game would become a blast. I found the story mode much more enjoyable as some of the characters are hilarious. Anyone would find this game fun the only down sides are that it’s still being developed and hence you can only do the first 2 of 5 temples. It will defiantly be a good game in the future right now though I'm not sure if it’s worth $16 seems a little pricey for 15 hours of gameplay but either way if you don't mind the price for an incomplete game defiantly buy it or even if you have doubts try the demo that's what I did the game will kind of hook you into it.

								I was a little sceptical when I bought this game, because of the graphics and video content. After playing for a little while I seemed to develop a trend with the game and started enjoying it. I was a little upset everytime I ran into an area that said ""not in game yet"". I had to make a map with big X's to say dont go this way since I usually forgot how to get some where :), but it is nice to see the devs have the notion to put new content in. Now saying and doing are 2 different things and only time will tell, but for this moment I enjoy this game. I stopped playing for a little bit, so going back to it and learning the flow again might be a little troublesome, but that can be said with any game. I have to give this game 7/10, but I still recommend it to anyone who enjoys old top down games :)			"

								Secrets of Grindea is an exersize in nostalgia for me. The game feels and plays much like Secret of Mana and Secrets of Evermore, both games which influenced my childhood and love for RPG's. Secrets of Grindea is one of my favourite games on steam, period.My wife and I have spend many hours playing this game together, fighting bosses, grinding equipment, enjoying the soundtrack and even discussing gameplay and where we hope the game will go from here, many hours after we've finished a session. We both hope the game does wonderfully, and that the team who makes it keeps up their hard work!It's good to see such talent in the game industry, and I hope the creators are very proud of themselves for the piece of art they've built. I know I certainly am proud of them.That being said, the game is very much early access, and the campaign isn't quite finished yet. It looks like there's a long way to go yet, and I eagerly devour each and every update as it's put out.If you liked Secret of Mana, and enjoy a good old fashioned item gathering rpg, pick this game up now. Better yet, get 2 copies and play with a friend- It's definitely worth it.			"

Early Access Review
								(Note: Review made after playing through around 50% completion of the beta with 2 other friends.)Secrets of Grindea is an action rpg that takes cues from top down Legend of Zelda games and Secret of Mana games.You run around, fight monsters, and use hotkeyed spells while wearing cool hats.The music is well, nothing that stands out to me though. (Yet!)It features a very large amount of items to collect, craft, and fight with (even in the beta, I feel) and quite a few spells, passives, and skills to play with.The game's story revolves around you and up to 3 other friends adventuring around the world, gathering gear and fighting monsters so you can become the best hoarder in the whole world.I can break down the gameplay into 4 types; Boss fighting, Enemy Fighting, Crafting and Exploring/Puzzles.Now, I wouldn't say the bosses are bad, hell, some even verge into the point of having so many projectiles on the screen you could swear you are playing a bullet hell, and are still well made, but i'd say that the bosses have way too much hp. Examples of this are the ""Raging Toy Machine"" Boss (I think that is what it is called?) which has too much hp and spams too many projectiles at once to even revive your friends, such as lines of dropping bombs, random dropping bombs, spawning monsters that also spawn bombs, normal monsters that charge at you, and a floor hazard that sends a toy train at you at random angles (Since the tracks on the floor constantly change direction) all at the same time. Also, another boss guilty of this would be a certain cube boss that deals insane amounts of damage but is somewhat easy to dodge, yet has crazy amounts of health. Some normal enemies have this problem too, such as the Yeti monsters. I suggest that the Toy Machine Boss has either less hp, or spams less things. Perhaps remove the bombs it drops?Enemy fighting is pretty fun, some monsters dodge, some use projectiles, some shield other monsters, it has a nice amount of spice without overdoing it. However, I do not like the damage sponge nature of the Sky Dungeon's Birds, and the Snow area's Yetis.I feel that the crafting can be improved in the way that some drops are extremely rare, instead of having the drops be really rare, make it so the drops are semi-rare or drop from the monsters in specific areas/quests, but have to pay certain amounts of money to actually craft the gear. The better the gear, the more money you would pay. It would solve the problem in that more often then not, shops have either way better gear then what you currently have, or junk gear that you can't improve or craft with, or, as another suggestion, make it so the gear shops sell basic gear that can be improved into better items. (Some gear from stores already does this, but it would be better if more gear could be upgraded.)Exploring areas is usually rewarded well, along with treasure maps that give you either image hints or riddles to where the treasure is buried, and some puzzles that involve pushing blocks around into a certain area to open a door. (More fun then it sounds.)Another thing to mention is the pixel art style of this game is extremely pleasing to the eye, and the animation is very fluid and appealing to watch. It's also worth noting most npc's do things such as farming and shoveling snow, which adds a bit of life to the game. The monsters are also, very well animated.Something that I do not like, is that in online gameplay, only the host will have the quests completed on their side. Therefore, playing the game by yourself after doing some quests with a friend, means you will have to go through those quests again in singleplayer if you wish to do so. I suggest to the devs that they make it so if the group finishes a quest, all players main story should be updated to reflect that, so they do not have to go through the quests again. Also, it's worth noting you cannot get quest rewards more then once, meaning, if you do it online with a friend, go to single player, and do the quest again, you cannot get the item from finishing that quest again.Overall, I recommend this game even in it's beta state, I have not run into any bugs or problems quite yet, and I feel the game will be even better once more content, polish, and balancing is added to the game.

								This game is great, but can't be recommended in its EA phase. I played this mostly off Steam and spent about as much time playing as you can in its current state, and it's the foundation of a very great game. However the updates are extremely slow, the projected release was in 2015 and it's barely progressed since then. When this game is actually finished it'll be amazing, and I wish I didn't already play the beginning content because it'd be a much better experience if it actually led to anything. This is an afterthought but I'm also not a huge fan of the general artstyle of the game. That isn't to say I'm not a fan of the graphics, because I very much so am, but every single character portrait/boss splash art looks like it was pulled off a middleschooler's DeviantArt page. I realize this is subjective and not a major flaw but even for a small-dev game like this, the artwork is almost too amateur.			"

								As of July 17, 2015Combat is next to none. Learning the move set for each new enemy is exciting as it adds a certain difficulty to the game.The music isn¨t obnoxious and is atually quite good. Well thought out scene/music selection. You can play the bosses over and over again to collect their cards and items. You can bait animals and train them to fight or bring them back to your house. There¨s plenty of side quests and mini-games to help you along the way. If you¨re ever played Secrets of Mana or the Aveyond series you might want to give this a try. The currrent build has a lot to offer so far. About 75% of the upgrades are unlockable and plenty of story to wet your appetite.			"

								In terms of other games: imagine Secret of Mana, with a structure that lets you just hop in and play with your friends, in a lighthearted Ragnarok Online setting.Secrets of Grindea is a smooth, charming 2D hack and slash with cute enemies and a fun world to explore that doesn't take itself too seriously. Fighting mobs of enemies feels great, and there are some cool bosses. Quests and areas are easy to understand without being too straightforward. The structure is pretty linear but offers some fun diversions in the form of collectible items, crafting recipes, and short side quests. Cooperative play is well-implemented in terms of interface and networking code, but doesn't really require you to specialize your characters to fight as a team. Overall, it's fun! It's like snack food (something familiar to satisfy a craving) but it's well-made, crisp, cheesy snack food.			"

								Secrets of Grindea is a great game, I've noticed people complaining about it being ""slowly updated"" when it was just recently updated about four or five days ago from me posting this review.  When this game is updated they have to update a lot of things, considering there are four types of games within this one.  Multiplayer Story Mode and Arcade Mode as well as Single-Player of each type.  This also includes:  Bosses, Mobs, Weapons, Armor, Cosmetics, Skills, Mechanics.  I've played this game a fair bit for the last few days and have had at least five people buy it just because they liked watching the gameplay.  Just imagine the fun you could have if you did too.

Even though this is in Early Access, it is quite polished. Not a bug in sight, and there is plenty of game to sink your teeth into here. I was leary of the price, but its definately worth it. This is a throw-back to some great games of fairly long ago. I definately feel some heavy SNES Zelda and Secret of Mana vibes here. Like those, it also has some fairly heavy MetroidVania elements where you will be backtracking through the open world to access areas you previously couldn't. Pros:+Great artwork.+Great feel to it - it plays really well. Controller support and rebindability is great in this title.+Music is fitting to this style, and is not generic - it is its own thing.+Awesome level of RPG character customizability.+Loads of quests even now. I love the treasure maps. Lots of sidequests, and they are all well done.+Even though the light 'grinding' humor is there - the game never really feels that grindy (ironically enough lol).+I love when the characters clothes/hair/etc. is customizable and changes with changing items.+Storyline is well written - I am not skipping through it yet ;)Cons:-Online multi is awesome but I really wish they would add local so I don't have to purchase a second copy for my wife to play.-Hurry up and finish the unfinished zones already :D !!!If this sounds like something you would like - I guarantee you will not be disapointed with this even in Early Access.

								Easily the highest quality and most worthwhile ""early access"" game I've purchased in a long time. This game is a breath of fresh air. It borrows a lot of inspiration from the handheld Legend of Zelda games, and who doesn't love Zelda? It is simple to play and easy to learn, yet it has a lot of depth involved in it so that it doesn't feel shallow. There are no bugs, no crashes.. multiplayer worked seemlessly from the first time I tried and every time since. If you plug and unplug a controller in while the game is running, it changes over flawlessly with no hiccups. The music is fantastic and the graphics are fun and colorful! Besides the few things missing from the game that the developers plan to add before it's out of early access, you can hardly tell that it's not a finished game. Well worth the price as it stands now, even if the game isn't completely finished. I'm looking forward to getting the full experience once the game is finally finished.			"

								Really neat and fun little game so far. Makes you feel nostalgia for old NES ARPGs like Secret of Mana. You can craft items and there's a fairly well rounded and balanced skill system that's classless so you can invest as much as you want into physical or magical combat.			"

Early Access Review
								8/10A solid game, considering as of August 2016 it's in Early Access. What do you get for 10.99? You get a modern retro looking rpg clearly inspired by the SNES era, with the option to play solo or with up to 3 friends with either keyboard or controller (I recommend you use controller). The gameplay is captivating: the boss battles especially are well crafted and not to mention very challenging. These battles do a good job of incorporating the co-op aspect although the battles are almost as fun solo, albeit slightly easier.The world has a variety of locations and each is unique both in visuals and inhabitants. The music and sound effects are excellent. The story is funny in parts but not the main attraction. Where the game really shines is with its weapon and class systems. There are lots of attacks to use whilst in combat using a range of melee weapons, magic and specials. The game constantly allows you to level up skills and gain new ones. Like in most games from this genre, you have the choice on which skills you'd like to focus on more, for example making your character's health high so you can act more as a tank, rushing into swarms of enemies whilst a friend attacks from afar with magic or a bow. Improving your attacks is rewarding and, in my opinion, is one of the most enjoyable aspects about Secrets of Grindea. Quests involve puzzles, exploration and quite a bit of reading (obviously, although cutscenes can be skipped). Overall it is a great game that is easily woth its price. The only negatives would be: it has a mediocre story and missed the oportunity to make pets aid your character in battle (instead they just follow you around and that's it).			"

								I played the demo through, sat on it for a day, and decided I absolutely should buy the game.  It seems inspired by games like Link to the Past (one of my favourites) and has a similar feel to it.  I like that there is a lot of depth to characters, though if you go for a plain 1h or 2h fighter you'll probably end up with a sort of samey character as you level up all of the 1h or 2h skills.  That said, there are tons of options for combinations with various kinds of magic and skills, though I would like if leveling up skills had more of an effect than 1-2% at a time for most of them, to further increase character diversity.The depth is very good in that there is a lot to do with your character, but not in a confusing way.  I was surprised when I found out you can also level up pet skills to further increase stats, and collecting monster cards also gives solid bonuses.  Looking back, it doesn't seem very complicated now that I've played through the current game a couple times, because it's easy to understand.  If you want to play through the game just mashing the attack button, that's fine (it will be really hard though), but you also have the option to level your skills in such a way that you can set up crazy combos and blow everything up.  The combat later on gets exciting enough that it's fun even to grind mobs looking for the card drop, both against the easy mobs and hard ones.If you like the demo, and are willing to pay for a promising early access game, I recommend it.  The game feels very polished, it's just a tad short at the moment (~8-10h to get through the story mode)			"

Early Access Review
								Easily the highest quality and most worthwhile ""early access"" game I've purchased in a long time. This game is a breath of fresh air. It borrows a lot of inspiration from the handheld Legend of Zelda games, and who doesn't love Zelda? It is simple to play and easy to learn, yet it has a lot of depth involved in it so that it doesn't feel shallow. There are no bugs, no crashes.. multiplayer worked seemlessly from the first time I tried and every time since. If you plug and unplug a controller in while the game is running, it changes over flawlessly with no hiccups. The music is fantastic and the graphics are fun and colorful! Besides the few things missing from the game that the developers plan to add before it's out of early access, you can hardly tell that it's not a finished game. Well worth the price as it stands now, even if the game isn't completely finished. I'm looking forward to getting the full experience once the game is finally finished.			"

								9/10Secrets of Grindea is a completely fun experience whether playing it solo or playing it with a group of friends. The combat is extremely fun and so far the story has been entertaining. The game's replayability is definantly high, especially when you go on to a harder difficulty. The game is a good mix of classics you'll love! Plus developers keep  fueling up my love for this game with every update that comes every few months.			"

								I rarely get this excited about a game, but i absolutely fell in love with this game instantly when i started playing it. So i don't really have alot of negative things to say about it. 10/10 I can't wait to see it finished It plays alot like seiken densetsu 3 meets Zelda.Pros:*beautiful custom maps that flow nicely with the tiling and sprites*the attention to detail on the sprites is impressive*the amount of animation really makes the game alot more lively. Every map is loaded with different animations to give each area it's own unique feel.*the mechanics are perfect, I have no complaints there.*the option for story and arcade mode*there is an monster arena!*good scaling difficulty for multi-player.*crafting system in place that unlock as you discover new items.*trophy room to replay boss battles*fishing, which is nicely incorporated into the arcade mode to help acquire loot.*summons, pets and familiars!! *I'm sure I missed a bunch of other things to point out in the game. Cons:* it's not finished and I'm impatient!* to short at the moment, and not enough replay yet. (arcade mode gets dull after a few hours.)Bugs:*not really bugs but the gigaslime and peckos animation are the wrong ones in the card index. I think it's a regular slime and the peckos doll for thier animation.Suggestions:*Infinite scaling dungeon!! (star ocean style!)*monster catching and breeding for the arena! (ff10 style!)*add in the multi-player games asap, even before more single player content to increase replay value. (think Mario party!)*PVP arena of some kind. Maybe ranked matches with special items people compete for.			"

								TL;DR: Buy this game. Many references, fun story and gameplay but tough as nails bosses.[Some minor spoilers ahead, be warned]What is good about this game:- Being able to select the visual appearence of one item while keeping the stats of another if you choose. No longer must you choose between style and function. You want a chicken hat with the protection of an iron helmet? you got it.- So many references. In my 7 hours I have notices 3 Pokemon references, a Mario reference, multiple Legend of Zelda references, 2 South Park references, a LITERAL Gundam boss, a well-known youtuber cameo in character and probably multiple more that I have missed.- Funny dialogue and interesting characters.- Impressive variety of skills to learn and base your playstyle on. (Several elements with 3 spells each plus many one and two handed weapon skills)What is bad/can be improved:- Menus are a bit annoying. For example if I want to make something and I lack the items needed, I can see if I have enough of item A, if I need more of item B or if I havent discovered Item C, BUT It will not tell me how much MORE of item B I need, which is a bit annoying. The difference between Silver points, Gold points and Talent orbs could also be explained better. I got a fair way into the game before realising what Talent orbs were and that I could spend them.- Some of the bosses feel a bit like Bullet Hells, and it can be VERY frustrating having to redo bosses over and over again since you keep dying to an onslaught of attacks on the screen. Maybe this is intended and I'm just not used to the difficulty, but I think if it is impossible to beat a boss with 1hp, you are doing something wrong as the boss is becoming less Skill based and more Luck based (such as the Winter boss, where he teleports several times and creates multiple ice pillars while launching fists of snow. He can effectively box you in to a point where you end up being hurt by his fist because you cannot move, or by the spikes as you try to avoid said fist. Or the Present machine where you have 6 presents, multiple bombs falling from the ceiling and several trains moving past).- Block mechanics can be improved slightly. I find myself taking damage if I drop my shield after an attack, even if the enemy has moved back or the projectile has vanished.I have high hopes for this game and hopefully this game is finished into the masterpiece it has the potential to be, and isn't another forgotten Early Access game.

Early Access Review
 Early Access Done Right There's just those few times where an early access game comes out, and it's brilliant. This is one of them. I first saw Secrets of Grindea debut on Desura, way back when. I've had my eye on the game for years as I've been skeptical of unfinished indie titles. Now a friend and I own Secrets of Grindea and it's fantastic. It's everything a good RPG needs and it's not even finished yet. Here are some points. PROS Fantastic, and I mean absolutely extraordinary pixel graphics. Some areas completely blew my mind because of how wonderful the scenery looked.Expertly crafted levels give a smooth feel to the game. The plains in the beginning felt chaotic. Felt like it had a sense of wildlife. The town had a clever building layout, the flying fortress felt symmetric and not too maze like. The Halloween map had a wonderful border effect, winding and narrow paths and perfect but not too difficult maze-like structure.Upbeat and catchy soundtrack deserving of it's own DLC.Excellent, sometimes halarious sidequests keep the player engaged every time a main story plot was advanced through.Mindboggling puzzles and secrets that make you think in order to get the reward rather than have you kill a generic miniboss (While minibosses are a thing in the game, they are rare and require some skills to take out.)Up to 4 player supported co-op that really shines. The main story has subtle changes to accomodate to a party with the host being considered the 'main character' while the others were his equally as powerful and important friends.Competetive or Uncompetitive loot share allows for a race-to-the-loot type of co-op gameplay or a relaxed type of co-op gameplay where everyone gets the same items from chests but generic enemy loot drops are split randomly throughout the group so that everyone get's a slice of the bloodied pie.Extensive skill system and trees allowed for all types of gameplay with no class restrictions. Be a Claymore weilding mage, or a Duelist that uses both a Sword and Shield and Two-Handed. Become a jack-of-all-trades with the 4 magic types (Fire, Air, Water, Earth) and a master of none.Ingenious inventory system allows for both and equipment and vanity slots and also allows you the ability to 'transmog' your equipment such as wands, swords, and shields to look like previously collected weapons without the sacrifice in stats. Same goes for armor.You can have a smiling cloud that craps lightning on your foes. CONS With up to 4 player co-op, the screen can end up having a lot going on in one small space. This is especially true in some small boss arenas like the GUN-DAM fight where you have to really pay attention to where you're going. While also making sure you and your friends stay out of harms way.In some areas like the Halloween Forest, a lot of enemies can be in the same areas at once. This can make solo-play challenging especially as enemies respawn on a seemingly short respawn timer that can make battles turn hairy at a moments notice.The mix of magic, skills, basic attacks, and enviornmental awareness can sometimes really disorient people. It's difficult to fight multiple small enemies at once while also keeping an eye on your remaining energy, switching between normal and special attacks, blocking with your shield, AND keeping an eye on your shield-block meter. This sort of combat inspires a rushed and adrenaline-fueld high octane battle enviornment giving people a rush to smash their keys as quickly as possible. At least that's what happens with me. And this usually ends up with me not noticing my health dropping or my friend ending up dead right next to me.The crafting system is intuitive and mysterious, with some recipies not being able to be unlocked until you find a certain item from a dropped creature. For example, the icon for Honey was greyed out until I managed to kill a bee and get myself one unit of Honey. Along with this, the item your crafting tells you the stats OF the item BEFORE you make it, just so you don't accidentally make something you can't use. Why is this a flaw? Well this isn't a flaw in itself, the flaw comes from the process of MAKING the item. For example, to make an Apple Hat I had to take a Straw Hat and gather 60, count 'em, SIXTY APPLES. This can make the game feel grindy, no pun intended. I'm not exactly sure if that's an intended feature or not, but it's not a huge problem since crafting isn't the main focus of the game, and more likely a menu you will look through every-so-often just to check if you gathered enough items to fill a certain criteria. CONCLUSION That's pretty much it. I think this may be the longest review I've ever written, but I think SoG deserves it. At the time of writing this, I'm only 2 hours into the game and I can't wait to see what I can uncover next. This is truly an amazing RPG/Adventure game.I will update the review throughout the early access process and with my advancement of the game. Thank you for giving the time to read this review, and I'll see you in Grindea.			"

								This game has easily slid its way into my top 5 favourite games, and is possibly my favourite RPG of all time. I say this because not only is the art superb, the story gripping(So far.), and the gameplay enjoyable; the game has also managed to make grinding fun. Gone are the boring lengthy grind fests from Final Fantasy, and in their stead Secrets of Grindea provides fun lengthy grind pinatas. By that I mean you can get collectible cards with art so cute that you can't help but want to collect them all.			"

								:) Secrets Of Grindea is a really fun game that you can just waste some time of your life on. You play a cool story as a collector with a companion bag who makes the game and you can (as the name says) grind!  You can use melee attacks or magical moves to fight your way through the game, and you dont have to stick to one group of abilities! You can be a spellslinging warrior if you want. It may not be finished yet but the beta is so much fun and I'm sure the final product will be even better! Its a great game and you should definately get it! :D			"

								Man, if you're looking forward to a small RPG to play with your friends, this is it.Secrets of Grindea creates a small and old-fashioned RPG environment with pixels and adorable sprites, exciting gameplay, and an interesting storyline. The customization in this game is great, you can create different builds revolving around different skills and passives. Although shadow clone melee is the best build, you can try something else that's interesting, like picking up a magic class and mastering different elements. You can have around like 4+ characters that are saved to your own profile, so feel free to test out some wonky builds or follow a generic build!Keep in mind, this game is still in development, and gets better from here on!Not to mention, you can host servers by just a click of a button.

								Secrets of Grindea, being an early acces game, has (in my personal opinion) thrived greatly into a briliiant open world rpg. Me and my friends are currently playing from about 40+ hours of the game, and every time we go back to a place there is always something new that we can share a laugh about. I would rate this game at an 8/10, simply because it has been in early access for a year and a bit now. If this game was to fully release out of beta then I would even go as far as to say it is perfect, and even at this point in time I would say to anyone who has become slightly interested, buy it now without hesitating.

								lOVE IT SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!For what it is so far the gamplay is great with plenty of skills and spells to make me want to grind and test them out but that also means I will be stuck in one location for a long time which while isnt that bad can be annoying.The drops from mobs are not usless and can be used to create awsome weapons and armour so don't sell them.This game reminds me of the original Legend Of Zelda and any other open world rpg because there are other missions to complete than the main one but you only really should explore the world in order because the power of the enemys can rise quickly if youre not prepaired!But overall its a great game that any one can enjoy along with being a challenge if you set the game to hard or try arcade mode which is a neat little game style that I can spend hours on!

Early Access Review
								Honestly can't recommend this game. It has been in early access for nearly two years at this point and only a handful of updates have been made. The game was also released off of steam before it ever was released here. Updates come maybe every 3-4 months if that. The content that we have is fairly good but there is very little of it. I have completed pretty much everything and I only have 8.5 hours logged. Communication with the devs amounts to a weekly dev blog basically. If they are making weekly progress then updates should be coming far more often and the game should be much further along. There is no way of telling of when the game will be finished if it every will be.As a side note this is the first time I have ever written a negative review and I have purchased into quite a few EA games.

								Probably the most fun I've had in a while especially if you take the early access status of the game into consideration. Game itself might get a bit repetitive after a while of playing but it's fun nonetheless. As the description says about the game ""It is a tribute to and sometimes a parody of the old SNES games so many of us grew up with and loved!"" and that is exactly how the felt but as an added bonus it gave me a Legend of Mana vibe which is my favorite game of all time.

Early Access Review
								Secrets of Grindea is a top down adventure game that immediately reminds me of the Legend of Zelda series in it's blend of combat and puzzles. While still an early access game at the time of writing, there is more than enough content to justify the fifteen dollar price tag. With an easy to learn combat system and the lack of distinct classes, combat feels smooth and genuinely fun, as one would hope a game with the term ""grind"" in the title would boast. Likewise, the characters are for the most part interesting, if perhaps not always particularly memorable.The characters of Grindea tend to alternate between totally forgettable and completely memorable. Your talking loot bag, appropriately named Bag, your close friend Luke, and your somewhat obnoxious rival Marino all manage to establish themselves with completely memorable characteristics - Bag is very cynical and sarcastic, with what appears to be an mix of disinterest and dislike for all things not labeled Very Rare Loot. Luke, meanwhile, is a hardworking powerhouse of a boy, but isn't particularly bright. Marino is a rich, bratty noble, and while that's not particularly deep as a character, he does a good job of making it memorable. On the other hand, quest giver Quinton, a couple of clearly reoccuring, almost Team Rocket - esque thugs, and even the player character's own father all seem to have virtually no personality. In the interest of fairness, these characters haven't recieved nearly as much screentime as Bag, but the problem is that the charcters I found memorable made themselves memorable from the first meeting, whereas all of these less memorable characters have appeared at least twice and still have yet to make any sort of impact on me.Combat in Grindea, as I mentioned above, is a very easy concept to grasp, if a little hectic in practice. The Z key is your basic melee attack with whatever is equiped to your weapon slot, X raises your shield, and the A,S,D,F,C, and V keys all bind to the various special attacks and spells you pick up over the course of the game. This means that a solid blend of melee and magical combat is more than plausible, although the effort to make that blend work is probably more than a strictly melee or magical style. That being said, the only character I've made so far is very focused to the ice branch of magic, and so I am unable to comment on how balanced the various skills are as of now. Despite this, it's worth repeating that the combat system itself is very enjoyable, and the more polished parts of the game are an immense pleasure to play.However, it's also worth repeating that this is an early access game, and it began to become extraordinarily obvious when I was coming close to the end of the story mode content simply because the majority of the major fights became seriously unbalanced towards solo players. Perhaps it becomes less of a headache with coplayers in the mix, but one particularly noteworthy boss fight required me to keep putting damage on the boss while at the same time destroying remarkably resilient minions that were spewing poisonous gas across the battlefield. Forget to put enough pressure on the boss, and he will fully heal his minions and render them invulnerable until you go back to putting damage on the boss himself. As a solo player, the task was almost too much for me to handle, and I was only able to scrape by thanks to the points I'd put into my summonable snow golem. I don't take issue with the idea behind the boss fight, but it's more than evident that the devs have yet to find an appropriate balance that challenges a group of playeres and still remains manageable for solo players.That fight notwithstanding, coming closer to the end of story mode also saw a lot of interesting puzzles and challenges spring forth. There's a dungeon in which the changing of the seasons is required to open up different paths to progress, and there's a sequence closer to the end of the existing content in which a teleportation power from earlier is used to cross elaborate labrynths of cannons, using mirrors and timed launches to get across. While difficult, I found myself enjoying the sequence, and look forward to seeing how the puzzles might further develop with the release of future content.All in all, Grindea is a fun game that is definitely worth the price, despite it's glaring flaws, and it shows a lot of potential in where it can go from here. While not yet finished, it's a very enjoyable product and looks to be a fantastic game in the making.			"

Secrets of Grindea is a great game for what is currently finished so far and i just wish i hadn't gone through the game so quickly. The only con about the game is that it isn't complete and that the updates are very spaced out, but it'll be worth the $15 once its complete.			"

								this game is a killer zelda like game and thats not a bad thing theres a slightly better story then the older zelda games at times but i have some issues with it, a few being once your about lvl 20 its near impossable to lvl up without massivly grinding areas but the games small so i can understand it,it needs more content! i like arena id love to see more like a boss round where you face them one after each other to try and obtain drops that seem impossable to get, ive crafted every item almost other then the boss item required recipies i have almost every card some monsters seem to have a next to impossable drop rate after killing 1000's of some no luck idk lol. frontier (beta) version is cool you can test the new ""almost at the next story dungen"" simple low exp was alright if a bit annoying with the poison im not great at reviews but this game has a lot of potential still it just needs MORE in every term of the word spells are fun but odd mele spells are a tad annoying to use since you get cancled if your hit and your mele....your going to be close lol so im always hybrid useing cloud and snow summon with max flies and then mele with a 2h whenever someone gets close bosses are alot of bullet hell and spamming spells while you run (flies are epic fyi) lol ok ill stop my rant id say buy the game support the developer and get ready for a crazy ride i just hope this game can deliver :) 8/10			"

								Really great game where grinding is a must but I don't mind it, probably because of the art style and the fact that it looks and feels like an old zelda game (Link to the past comes to mind for me). From the bush and crate cutting to the movement and pixel art it all feels very old school zelda which is amazing. On top of that add some great dialogue between npc's and even some zelda references and you got Grindea. The crafting system is really great too, grinding for items to make even better gear feels very rewarding. And an unlimited bag space means collect every sword, hat, shield, and card you can because ♥♥♥♥ it, why not? Bottom line, if you loved old school zelda games on the SNES and NES you'll love grindea and it gets even better when you play with friends.			"

The art and music are awesome, the gameplay is simple to grasp yet tough to master, and the characters and story make ""Secrets of Grindea"" shine! There is a great mixture of action, crafting, and minigames to keep your experience varied and entertaining. In it's current state(4/20/2016) it offers about 15-20 hours of playtime through the main story, not including replays and the arcade survival mode. I have nothing but good things to say about this game and look forward to it's completion. Played with a friend you will find yourself wanting for more!			"

								Finally an Indy that gets it RIGHT.  They have captured the old SNES games 100%.  No cheese, no lameness, no clunky interface, no tryhard here,, just a great title.  My only problem with Zelda III and Secret of Mana is that both games had an ending, they were so good.  Those games are timeless, and the graphics hold through even today due to the art style etc...   Secrets of Grindea continues in thier tradition and I just love it, there are a few throwback references but they don't overdo it (like a lot of games do).   Even though it's still Beta, early access, etc... I hope they continue to produce content in the form of DLC forever.  Thanks. Gameplaywise, the controller support is spot on, it is very alt tab friendly, the game is only 380Mb, so will probably work on any computer out there.  (I'm playing on a tablet, Surface Pro 3..).  Go for it!			"

								What an incredible game!Secrets of Grindea is a story-driven game (With phenomenal RPG elements!) where you can customize your character's appearance, skills, and talents. While the mechanics are simple to grasp, there are many unique bosses and mobs that require certain nuances to accomplish.The leveling system works out relatively well. It never feels like an over the top grind (hah) until about halfway through, where it suddenly starts to feel like it takes longer to level based upon the monster EXP.Perhaps my only real complaint about the game lies in the skill system. They've set it up so that you get silver and gold spell points, where you spend so many silver points before you may only place gold points to further level up a skill. After spending 17 hours in the game, I've only been able to get one skill all the way up with gold points, as you only receive one point every few levels.Still, you can completely customize your hotkeys, and they made it quite easy and intuitive. Though it is early access, they've already thought of many convenience things that other games miss: equipping cosmetic items for free, pets that increase stats, NPCs that have witty responses, etc.It's rare you find an unfinished game that leaves you thinking about it even while you're in the middle of working, exercising, and trying to sleep. I'm only sad it isn't finished! 9.5/10TL;DR - Buy this game. I'd regret not trying it. Smooth graphics, intuitive gameplay, conveniency in the game, and some light humor! Totally worth the price.

								Brings back memories of old school console games. It's a pretty solid game for being in beta. Apparently there is some time between updates but it is continually updated. Xbox controller works perfectly for this game. My wife and I have fun playing this.From my perspective it's a buy.			"

								The closest you are getting to A Link to the Past on PC, and considering that alot of people consider that the greatest game of all time, thats pretty high praise. Honostly though, this game is near perfect so far. The levels look amazing, the story and characters are funny, the abilities are awesome, and to top it all off its multiplayer. HOWEVER, the music is run of the mill and the game isn't finished yet. I'll probably play it again when they finish making it and edit this review afterwards.			"

								This game is amazing. Hands down the best pixel rpg I have ever played. I played it for a while and its awesome the variety of enemies and how colorful the world is! Every boss is unique and takes skill to beat. You have the option of grinding out cards and side quests to max out skills or just do the story mode. I expect great things when this game comes out of early access. I hope it to be supported for a long time to come because it is awesome!!!			"

								10/10 the only RPG without skeletonsIn all seriousness, this game is AMAZING. This is the only game I have ever seen on steam that has a perfect 10/10 rating!PROS.-Fantastic artstyle, even though its pixelated, everything flows really nicely -No limitations, choose any ability you want, whenever you want, and however many you want.-Fun spells and attacks, make you feel incredibly powerful -Funny and lovable characters-PETS!-Lots of replayability-Grinding is suprisingly fun-A good challenge I have not faced in some time-Overwhelmingly fun multiplayerSheesh, that took a while.CONS.-Kind of short story mode, but its in early access so it gets a pass (in my book at least)-Arcade mode is repetetive after some time-$15 is a bit expensive for some-Some bosses are just huge difficulty spikesIt actually took me some time to come up with cons. This game is a MUST-BUY!			"

								This game is outright amazing. My friend and I got it to play and it is just flat out amazing. the story mode is amazing and so far the only things that are there are two dungeons. Plenty to grind for (Ha) and plenty of things to craft. However, there are a few things that♥♥♥♥♥♥him and I off though. In arcade mode, enemies need to be debuffed or you need to start with ability points and skill points from the start, the fact that two rabby's can kill you easily in the first room of arcade mode, is just horrible and unbalanced. And those points that you get for purchasing perks are so rare that I would rather just not play it. It doesnt feel like a grind to get it, it just feels like a waste of time because its not garaunteed that you will get any whatsoever. You can go on a run through the first five floors and not even earn a single point.			"

Early Access Review
								TL/DR;Pros  - Spiritual successor to older ARPG titles (Secret of Mana/Star Tropics/A Link to the Past)  - Solid build customization and choices that change gameplay a lot  - Responsive Controls, Xbox controller works fine off the hop with zero third party software necessary  - Good Humor  - Good Multiplayer Experience and Customization  - Decent Musical Score  - Fairly difficult compared to modern games (Tough but fair, it's not quite ""Nintendo Hard"" but close)Cons  - Default keybindings can be hard on hands, probably want a controller unless you want to custom keybind.  - Menu slightly unintuitive at first  - Crafting doesn't seem to be covered at all in the first few hours or so  - Game is incomplete, some areas not accessable even early on, does not impact current gameplay though.It's pretty decent, only have 3 hours in so far though.   Like it says on the tin it definitely captures the spirit of Secret of Mana/A Link to the Past/Star Tropics. However it also adds in some nice new shiny features, the biggest one being build customization. I guess the closest comparison on the build system would be something like Skyrim or Kingdoms of Amular: Reckoning (as in non linear, pick whatever you want but there's still progression within each).   The controls are responsive however being an old goat I got hand cramps after the first hour and switched to Xbox 360 controller and enjoyed it a lot more after that (could still probably be solved with some manual rebinding). It's a little quirky to get used to the menu controls being that it behaves exactly like an old SNES title (no mouse, nested menus button press down and back up).  The dialogue is pretty funny, it has a lot of fourth wall humor often poking fun at itself and the genre. So far the score is decent but I'm only a few hours in.  I got a few friends to buy it and we've been playing together and having a blast, the steam integration makes this super easy. You can choose whether to scale the leveling or not which seems nice but hasn't actually been tested by me yet, we're all pretty low level so I didn't see the point. Also loot options can be customized I didn't bother though as round robin seemed to work, the nice thing is it seems that if you haven't got a chest yet in story mode and another player opens it up you still get it. It doesn't seem to scale the enemies much in 2 player, so you can sort of cheese some content by ressurecting a downed player, but you have to time it properly so I guess it's not the end of the world. Oh and other than that, there's no healing in the game beyond picking up a certain drop (sort of like old Mega-Man games). I was nervous buying on early access but feel that this genre was worth the investment, we don't see many and I was pleasently suprised by the quality of this early access and the decent amount of difficulty in the game, you'll probably die quite a bit, but it's pretty fair. So yeah would recommend.EDIT: After playing with 3 the difficulty does indeed scale, though perhaps not enough I removed the con from the list.			"

								This is a SNES inspired ARPG...sort of like Zelda: A Link to the Past.  Long story short, I am enjoying it.  For an early access game it is quite polished.  There is clearly still some contect that is going to be added (new zones, enemies, items, bosses, abilities, passives), but there is already a lot here...I have 3.5 hours on 2 different save files and I am about 10-15% done with the current content.  I figure there is about 20-25 hours of gameplay available now if you want to collect/unlock everything.Here are my first impressions (I also have a Let's Play series on my YouTube Channel):

								For a start, I have no idea why this is called ""grindea"" implying there would be grinding like no tommorow. Which it aint, not even if you want every single item in the game. Sure its a little bit timewasting, but you do not have to go 24/7 mode. Story mode is very short and the game is not worth buying if thats all you wanna do (for now).However the arcade mode is a truly good ""timewaster"" if you have nothing else to do and makes it all worth it, its not an expensive game after all and is fun, if restarting every time you die is something you like.I'd give this game a 6/10 in overall rating due to the short story which I guess will get alot more in the future!

								really nice game, way better then secret of mana because of the skill systeme. The only negative tough is the fact that the group making this game is little so the game progress is slow. But what a game, nice art, nice graphic, not a lot of bug and we defenitly hope to see the world get bigger cause this game is really fun to play. Don't give up this game guy and thank you for bringing a good game like that with such a low price.			"

								edit: editing this review because the fanbase of this game seriously cannot handle anything that isn't blatantly positive.I don't recommend this game. I played it during EA, my initial reactions to it were lukewarm and it didn't feel worth the money. I have played the game since and it STILL didn't feel worth the money. That's all you're going to get.What's important to note here is that I had a pretty in-depth review about this game, that could have informed consumers before purchase, and now I don't. Now it's just  a thumbs down because the community around this game are irritating and I feel that offering any kind of information about it, is supporting it in some kind of way. Every time I logged into steam and saw a message notification, it was about this game - someone whining about how I didn't review it right, or I just ""suck"" at it, or - my favourite - am somehow obligated to continuously update a review on a game I do not play anymore.So yeah, don't buy it because I don't like it because reasons.

								The Secrets of Grindea is a neat little game reminiscent of ARPG's like Secret of Mana and Ys: Oath in Felghana. The combat is fluid, more so than that of Legend of Zelda and equipping a Two-Handed weapon does not take away your ability to use a shield. The character sprites are amazing and dynamic, you rarely find an NPC doing nothing physically as most have a nice implemented action to make themselves seem more lifelike. Ones that you find in-game that do this range from flipping their hair, kicking a wagon, turning a crank, and even sipping tea or sneezing. It makes the world come to life more and each NPC has their own individual character portrait to show that they aren't just faceless boring no-name people in the lush world of Grindea.Skills take another aspect of the game in that they ARE diverse but there isn't a lot of them. Your main weapons will consist of a sword, either one-handed or two-handed and that is the limitation of your weapons. You will find others such as a bow and arrow while exploring but that is just a side weapon which left me wanting a more diverse weapon system. I wish there were more weapons such as a double headed spear that an enemy NPC had or even another skill branch for the bow and arrow but alas there is none. The world of Grindea itself is nice and all the sprites are beautiful and amazing, however that does not excuse the games limited exploration. Throughout my playthrough I had tried to explore numerous pathways to other parts of the world only to be stopped by an invisible wall and a text box saying. ""You can't go there! That part of the game is not yet implemented."" This kills exploration as there is only on path you can take instead of being able to explore the world as you like which leads me wanting more.For the price of 14.99$ this game is not bad, and is actually amazing. I just wish that there was more diversity in weapons and one pet peeve of mine is that equipment (such as gloves, shoes, or armor) does not show to change the characters clothes as if appearing invisible. That being said however, this game is not worth 15$ but IS worthy of your time as the world of Grindea is still being made, hopefully once finished it will be worth its expensive price.			"

								An amazing game  that feels like a throw-back to the classic zelda games, like Link to the Past. The controls though simple provides a lot of fun. So many different possibilities for customization so you can make your character unique in each way possible. What I love about this game is the spells and abilities. You want to use one handed sword? Here have some skills that feels like an extension and takes some time to master. You want to use two handed swords? Have even more skills that are fun to use.Now for magic,  though it feels a bit on the weak end, it is still fun, especially the fire skills to me. It is also fun to have a little little cloud or some other little summon pet to help you out so you are never alone.Anyone who loves the classic games like Legend of Zelda or Legend of Mana will love this game.

								I'm just playing for 2 hours, still I can say it's one of the best game I played in a while.As the name ""Grindea"" already implies, the gameplay is kind of grindy, but in a very innovative way. Every monster you can find in the world of Grindea has a few possible drops, which can be gathered to craft new equipment or sold to make money and therefore buy new equipment. These drops are listed in some kind of codex but unless you find them, they are blackened out. Besides that there are also very rare cards which drop only once and improves your characters abilities permanently. These two features provide a lot of motivation randomly hunting monsters for their loot while following the main storyline on the side. It's almost a pokemon-like feeling where you try to complete your pokedex.As I said, I haven't played much, but till now the story is pretty basic stuff. Starting in a small village, doing a test to finally become whatsoever and heading out to great adventures. This is not necessarily a bad point, because you still keep track of the story, even if you skip some dialogues. The dialogues on the other side are quite funny and self-ironic. They make fun of some very stale RPG-cliches, like the bottomless bag of the game's main character.The main story holds up with some big boss battles, which are more or less challenging, depending on how much you grind on the side. If a boss can drop unique loot, the battle can also be repeated at any time. As far as I discovered, the game also provides some side-activities like fishing or treasure-hunting. The game's skill system allow to spend an active skillpoint in melee, magic or supportive and a passive skillpoint in general, melee or magic on each levelup. There are some skills that aren't implemented yet, because the game is still in early access. Nevertheless there are plenty available skills which can be combined freely. Every skill can be charged up to unleash a more powerful attack, which variates based on the amount of skillpoints put into a single skill. All in all the skill-system provides a wide range of different gaming-styles.Also, there is an arcade mode, where you have only one life to conquer a randomly generated world. Everytime you die, you start all over again in a newly generated world. But there are some unlockable permanent advantages.Summary: Buy the game! Also I'm sorry for possible language mistakes.			"

								So far the game is pretty good. All of the bosses, except for one, have been somewhat challenging. I just hope that the game will progress further and not end up dropped and incomplete. I feel that the game needs a lot more content still. Maybe expanding the crafting system with upgrades and more rewards for farming.I really don't like purchasing Early Access games but it was good enough that I only regret buying it a little. So if you've got a ton of money to spend, go for it. If you're looking to spend your money a little more wisely, I'd wait a bit for a more complete game.			"

								For being in only alpha, the game is already really well off and shows a lot of potential. I've done a brief solo run and am currently doing a run with a friend and it's really enjoyable. The abilities have good variety, nothing is particularly overpowered and there's a good amount of mechanics. So far there's a pretty nice variety in side quests, and nothing feels too tedious. My only issue would be how purposely dislikeable some characters are, though this is more of an annoyance than an issue with the game itself. I have really high hopes for this game, and I'm looking forward to continuing my playthroughs.			"

								If you like: The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Final Fantasy (Any), or Chrono Trigger... You will LOVE this game. I've been losing hope in new and upcoming games lately, but purchasing this game is more than worth it. I would have paid twice as much to own this work of art... AND ITS NOT EVEN FINISHED! Me and my brother played this game for about 7 hours straight when we bought it... (and we really don't have that kinda time anymore..) Needless to say, I will be on the edge of my seat each and every time they patch or update this game.This has all the RPG elements you could want. The real-time battle system is amazing. The skill trees and talent trees are superb. I love how the games characters take the time to make fun of itself. It's a serious game that doens't take itself too seriously (does that make sense?). I LOL at the dialogue often and actually want to see what each NPC has to say.The quests are fun and simple, but some are actually challenged for even a season RPG player to figure out.You will not regret spending a penny on this game! I promise you that. Enjoy. P.S to the developers - You guys rock... thank you SO much.. I've been waiting for a game that rivals The Legens of Zelda: A Link to the Past for so long... and yes I did just compare the two... I know what I said.			"

								I think this game is RIGHT down my alley. Unfortunatly, I have a couple of opinions :/ First of all, I think that pets should be able to help out in fights. Second, I think that Mages are a little OP. Third, there should be SOME form of regen like Health Potions sold at the Alchemy Shop, or some kind of Spell that restores health. Forth, Boars are insanly difficult and frustrating to battle considering they are incredibly fast and deal heavy damage, so you cant easily take them down without heavy damage. It doesn't really help that you have to perfectly time a Quick-Block. Fifth, I found an easy way to exploit the fact that you can cut off the attack recharge by Quick-Blocking. For example, if I were to Attack and Block really quickly alternating, i can attack twice a second and deall about 400 damage per second. I also used a whole lot of differant things that i could label as a little broken. First, Phillip (what I call the adorable little snow monster), I want to know whether or not i shoul consider him broken. I decided to max out Phillip and now hes practically like a second me (^-^) I'll add more later, but for now, I'd love to see Boar nerfing, and Health Potions in Story Mode.			"

								Actually pulls off the SNES era look-and-feel really well. Arcade mode is a great new rendition of the Lufia 2 Ancient Cave. Also really enjoy the open skill system and customization. Great polish and tons of potential. Highly recommended.			"

								Pleasantly surprised would be an understatement for this game.  It has the feel of the old SNES era, with throwbacks abound. It's clean, crisp, funny and challenging as well!While still in early access, arcade mode offers a ton of replayability, and with quite a few save slots, you're not going to be short of trying different paths for characters early on in the story either (Not that you have to have more than one!).I'm loving it and I'm very excited to enjoy the whole thing as it's made and once it's done as well!

								For being in only alpha, the game is already really well off and shows a lot of potential. I've done a brief solo run and am currently doing a run with a friend and it's really enjoyable. The abilities have good variety, nothing is particularly overpowered and there's a good amount of mechanics. So far there's a pretty nice variety in side quests, and nothing feels too tedious. My only issue would be how purposely dislikeable some characters are, though this is more of an annoyance than an issue with the game itself. I have really high hopes for this game, and I'm looking forward to continuing my playthroughs.			"

There are some funny moments and well, Serious moments. Heck, I actually got sad for a character that wasn't even in the game physically. But besides the point, It's a great game. There's even a rouge like arcade mode once you beat the game. This is my first review, Hope it helped!			"

Early Access Review
								Early Access: I stumbled upon this game casually browsing steam and immediatly thought the game looked awesome at face value.  I got pretty excited when I saw that this game had a demo (including the multiplayer I might add), I played the demo for about 3 hours with and without a friend, and it hooked me the moment I stepped out into startington.  The music is top tear, the pixel art is astounding, the gameplay is crisp and challenging, and the game world has been the first to charm me this much since The Legend of Zelda Windwaker.  So far, I LOVE this game.  The game doesn't take it self very seriously, but there is still loads of meaning behind what you are doing in a world you actually care about, I want to catch every fish, get every pet, complete every quest, collect every item, and I want to be there to watch the story unfold.  Play this game with a friend and have so much fun that 6.5 hours go by like 60 minutes.  Devs if you keep this up, the game will marvel even it's inspirations (Secret of mana SNES) and (A Link to the Past SNES)  I would 100% reccomend this game right now, even if it's unfinished what has been here so far has been totaly worth the $15, grab a friend or 3, or play solo!

								An amazing game  that feels like a throw-back to the classic zelda games, like Link to the Past. The controls though simple provides a lot of fun. So many different possibilities for customization so you can make your character unique in each way possible. What I love about this game is the spells and abilities. You want to use one handed sword? Here have some skills that feels like an extension and takes some time to master. You want to use two handed swords? Have even more skills that are fun to use.Now for magic,  though it feels a bit on the weak end, it is still fun, especially the fire skills to me. It is also fun to have a little little cloud or some other little summon pet to help you out so you are never alone.Anyone who loves the classic games like Legend of Zelda or Legend of Mana will love this game.

								First of all: it's a good game.If you first choose to play the demo and buy the game afterwards, you may keep the demochar.Grindea is really addicting and reminds me strongly of ""Secret of Mana"", ""Zelda"", and ""Breath of Fire"". It's definitly a mix of this games. Contra: - little bit childish design but therefore very detailedPro: - tons of loot- skill diversity- craftables- special missions- ingame games- arcade mode- coop mode- well balanced difficultyso far...

								So far the game is pretty good. All of the bosses, except for one, have been somewhat challenging. I just hope that the game will progress further and not end up dropped and incomplete. I feel that the game needs a lot more content still. Maybe expanding the crafting system with upgrades and more rewards for farming.I really don't like purchasing Early Access games but it was good enough that I only regret buying it a little. So if you've got a ton of money to spend, go for it. If you're looking to spend your money a little more wisely, I'd wait a bit for a more complete game.			"

Early Access Review
								High quality action rpg fun with a lot of nostalgia tossed in aswell. There really isn't enough I can say about this game, the multiplayer is crafted perfectly, with drop in/out features enemy difficulty increasing with each additional player not just increases in attributes but additional skills for bosses etc. Very indepth character leveling, allows you to create and mold your hero as you please, so you can find your perfect build. The story mode is probably about 50 percent complete, by the time i reached the end i was really yearning for more. There are tons of collectibles and several mini games including pets. Perfect game for the kind of person that loves additional content after the story, especially those who enjoy some grinding.For those tired of playing in the story, there is a very well crafted arcade mode that is of course also multiplayer and has almost infinite replayability. The real seller with this game though is the combat, which takes you back to old school SNES 2D top-down games like Link to the past and Secrets of Mana, but it is so much more then that. Once you find a build you enjoy whether you're just sitting back grinding enemies or facing the highest difficulty challenges, time just flies by.As you can tell I highly recommend this game. There is a demo available which definitely gives you enough of a taste of the game to understand my high praise.			"

I'm about 60 percent done with things i can do and about 15 hours in. The gameplay was surprisingly good, there are MANY different talent/skill specs that you can do. The combat is well done and smooth, I had started with a fire mage skill spec and next character i will try a 2 handed skill spec. There is still plenty i can do and want to do. This is one of the best games ive played in a long time. Well worth the 15 dollars. Try the demo if you want, then you'll see for yourself how well made this game is.			"

Sadly it isn't mine.

								Secrets of Grindea is an homage to old school hack'n slash RPGs with multiplayer support for up to 4 players. Rarely have I seen a 2D game with such an enjoyable battle system and the sheer amount of detail that has been put into the various animations of the playable characters, NPCs and the world around them truly warms the heart of an old school gamer like myself, who has never lost his love for 2D games. I can't wait for this game to be finished and I would definitely recommend anyone to show some love for the developers by either purchasing the game or at least trying out its Demo.tl;dr I absolutely love Secrets of Grindea, can't wait for the game to be finished!

When i compare the content to the development time it'S VERY disappointing. I really doubt that they will ever finish this game with satisfying content. The Arcade mode is simply no option for me, it feels like a way to artificially extent the content.Its truly a shame, cant recommend the game right now, but it could be ""a one of a kind game"" that you come back to and talk about even after 10 years.IF there will be satisfying content someday, i will change my review and you will get tons of praise from me.

That being said, the game has been in development for about 5 years (per dev blog) and I am worried it may never get finished at this pace.Recommend if you are cool within the context of what it is, if you want a full game experience, skip the $15 and play the demo to get a taste of how great the game will be when it gets to full release.

								I'd seen a few negative comments about the grinding needed in this game and a few others things prior to buying it, honestly, after playing it through to the end of the current demo i really enjoyed it and i look forward to seeing more past that point.I've also played with a few of my friends from the US (being from Australia) and at first the fact the game told me id have 300 ping worried me but they have done well and its not even noticable.

								Secrets of Grindea is an homage to old school hack'n slash RPGs with multiplayer support for up to 4 players. Rarely have I seen a 2D game with such an enjoyable battle system and the sheer amount of detail that has been put into the various animations of the playable characters, NPCs and the world around them truly warms the heart of an old school gamer like myself, who has never lost his love for 2D games. I can't wait for this game to be finished and I would definitely recommend anyone to show some love for the developers by either purchasing the game or at least trying out its Demo.tl;dr I absolutely love Secrets of Grindea, can't wait for the game to be finished!

								TLDR; IT'S A GREAT FREAKIN GAME, YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GET IT, LIKE NOW.This is truly one of those ""hidden and unpolished gems"". The game has this beautiful yet nostalgic art that just sucks you right into it. If you like intense combat that actually requires you to stay on your toes at all time, I really recommend this game. Even though it is an early access game, and that a lot (if not the majority of EA games) just aren't worth it, trust me on this one, this one really is.Pros:- Even though it's an ea game theres at least 5-10 hours of gameplay in the story mode so far.- Beautiful artwork.- Engaging combat system, with a variety of classes/skills that will make you wanna play it for a second time, just to test them out.- The story itself is fairly interesting and you'll most likely have a good laugh every now and then.- A big variety in the monsters and bosses, most of them function in different ways, making the game more interesting and not repetitive. - You can play with up to 4 friends, choosing whichever character you've saved. (There's I believe, 9 save slots atm)- Once you've played through whats been released in the story mode, you can just jump over to the arcade mode, which is sort of like a rougelike mode, which is super fun and addictive.- There is also a crafting system where you can craft weapons and armors.- There's a pet system, as for now it is pretty useless, but it is fairly fun to play around with.Cons: - It's an unfinished game, you will get to the point where there is no more content story wise and at that point you will be crying, begging for more.- I don't know if it's meant to be, but the crafting system is pretty useless in the arcade mode, since you never get enough materials to actually craft anything.- There's not that huge of a variety in items. There's a few for each class and so on, but after a few playthroughs the items will be a bit repetetive.Overall, if you like rpg style games, killing monsters, completing quests, fighting epic boss battles and taming crazy rabbits, then this game is definitely for you. I rate it 10/10. "

								There is already enough there to justify a purchase, even if progress is slow.Character building is flexible.  Control is tight.  Boss fights are SNES-era multi-stage endeavors.  It's easy to see how it would take a small team a long time to make this content.You can check out their blog and judge for yourself whether they're on a proper pace.  There's even a free demo.I wouldn't expect a 100% finished game this year, but we already have a 100% playable and fun SNES-style game that looks 60-70% finished content-wise.  The quality and variety is competitive with old-school SNES ARPGs, and this is all coming from a much smaller team than who was making similar games in the 90s.  It's a great mix of nostalgia with enough innovation to make it their own.  They are maintaining a steady pace and consistency of quality so far.It isn't humanly possible to do it much faster, and if you want a complete game fast, you can hold your money instead of your breath when it comes to this title.

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: Great game but slow progress. Recommended but see this as an investment, not a direct consumption item.For a game that has been an on going project for this many years there are certain expacations to be made. However seeing it being an early access game made by a very small team some criticisim can be made and some can't. But that's the point of reviewing. You give critique so the creator can be better. The beauty for us gamers is that developers are like wine or whiskey. They are either good and becomes better, they are good but falls hard due to arrogance and godlike complex or they never were good to begin with. The devs of SoG are hopefully the first type.Now enough of that and unto the game.The graphics are smooth and fantastic, for being 2D Spirites. That is however nothing bad as they simply tap into a bit of retro or nostalgia, depending on your age. For reference it's nostalgia for me. As I started this game it felt like playing a new Zelda game. A World to explore and you as the hero. The graphics help this mindset as you travel across the land and my god is the scenery gorgeues. Even with the limited graphics of 2D spirites they make everything flow smoothly and with an almost seamless action. The particles created by the various spells and skills as well as the various stages of boss fights make this game very good. During the harder difficult I died once due to the fact that I stopped and had to process I went from a Zelda-esque game to a Touhou level bullet hell. It was beautifulThe sound and music of the game aids the nostalgic/retro feeling and the sound effects made when you cast a spell or use a skill is quite satisfying. There is no lack of audio feedback on what's going on in this game. You will know when the enemy is about to charge you or a boss is starting a massive barrage of onslought. The feedback you get as a player in this game becomes even more valuable as you play on the harder difficulty when the bosses can go from ""oh look a large quantity of bullets"" to ""This went from casual to hardcore bullet hell real fast....""As for the gameplay and it's mechanics I'm happy to say that it all feels fantastic. The controls respond as expected and the game runs smoothly. It lacks any need to have a beast of a machine. This is a game I have played during lunch hours on my work and those machines could be from last decade. The mechanics are well thought and well implemented into this game. It's easy to plan ahead on how you want to combat an enemy or a boss as the various types of attacks have easy and memroable patterns to learn. The fact that you also can easily switch mid-game on how you want to play makes it a nice setup for various combinations of attacks. It does however cost some money but it's worth it if you want to experiment.The game truly makes a good claim on old grinding games. It will become a massive grindfeast if you want to. I spent a good 10+ hours farming for various cards in the game, they are used to get passive boosts. The various mechanics in how you grind with combat can go from boring to a meditative set of moves. If you enjoy grinding that is.Overall the game works so good I really WANT the developers to finish the game but as I mentioned earlier in my TL;DR. This is to be the equivelent of a stock market investment. It may or may not yield profit in the end. Only time will tell. So far however, I've earned back my money spent in hours so for me this game was quite a good ""bang for the buck"" deal.			"

This game is a lot of fun, has a lot of potential (even though the story and dialogue is ""so so"" every now and then. BUT, it is not worth buying yet. Maybe in 5 or 10 years.

								here's my thoughts: 1. Better music. The cheerful anime music is annoying as hell. I'm not saying it should be sad or anything but there's plenty of happy music that isn't annoying, like from zelda and ghibli movies.2. Add blood and ragdoll effects. The more violence, the better lol.3. Get rid of the weird anime drawings in dialogue. It doesn't fit in nicely and they look really stupid. Just use enlarged sprites for the characters3. Write better dialogue. I don't know if this game is supposed to be for kids or not, but the dialogue is kinda boring, which I understand since it's hard and that's why most people hire a professional writer4. Better UI5. I think I would enjoy the game more if you could walk in all directions using the mouse.6. Get Stardew Valley instead			"

								'Puts carrots on a tree stump''Rare bunny comes out''Kills bunny''Gets a carrot sword and uses it for the rest of the game'""Secrets of Grindea"" is an amazing little rpg. You have a ton of side quests. You can craft your own items. You can fish. You can kill pumpkins and you get a sweet♥♥♥♥♥carrot sword. Seriously this game is pretty dank. I've spent 11+ hours in this and im not even close to done. Developers are still updating will new areas, temples, and other cool♥♥♥♥♥♥ Buy this game if you're looking for a cool rpg. It also has a dungeon minigame type thing. It has different levels, you get loot, there is puzzle rooms, and you level up.  (͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖)👌 <""pretty dope"">			"

								While this game is still a work in progress, for what i have been able to do, this game is epic :DDialogue-ish stuffit has comedy, and stuff that makes sense. +9/10some comedy get's repeated too much, ie bag and fairy talking -2/10gameplaysince this game is a work in progress, im surprised how well it works. Boss battles were fun, just the right difficulty (my opinion, don't judge me XD) , which is when you die like, 3 times and then you beat the boss, or you farm for EXP (or grind) , and i love how they give you side quests to make it less linear! +10/10some quests are very repetitive, but theres not much to vary that kind of thing. -2/10graphics and art stuffah yes, an RPG adventure game. I personally think they should always be detailed, but cartoon-like or pixel-ish, and that's what we got. +8/10sadly though, lots of games accomplish this but it takes a lot of work to do art -1/10storya treasure hunter being his dad and wanting to be like him? ok story +7/10not too original -2/10varietytwo game modes!!! arcade and story! in arcade you basically have to go through a bunch of floors and kill monsters, and you can expand your home area to get really cool features! in story, it's... a story. fighting, questing, buying, and rage await! 10/10i do not have a problem -0/10awards-great for steam early access +8/100-solid, fun game for a affordable price +5/10087/100so buy it now!!!! or not... (cries in the corner of the room) XDretail: $15			"

								(This review is based solely on the Story mode)This is an extremely promising 2D ARPG early access game that I absolutely adore. It is by no means close to being finished but it has an incredibly solid foundation. The first thing I need to mention is the art style is phenomenal and the game has one of my favorite soundtracks of any game out there. As I'm writing this review, my character is in the Flying Fortress just so I can listen to the music. The music gives me Final Fantasy vibes that I love. Let me also mention that the art in this game is awesome. The game is full of color and it's a beautiful game to look at.In terms of gameplay, there are many choices to be made. There are skill sets for 1H or 2H weapons and the magic is divided into fire, ice, earth, and air (which should be called lightning...). There are no classes so you can mix and match between all of these sets (For example, you can be a 2H user that also specializes in ice spells. If you freeze an enemy, you are guarenteed your next physical attack to crit). So far, there are 2 dungeons in the game that both have very strong themes and art styles. There is not a single part of this game I dread going through. I loved Tales of Symphonia but I HATED some of those dungeons/temples (especially the sewers, oh god). Let me also mention that the second dungeon has a mechanic involving changing seasons that I have never seen before in any game. Watching the whole room change colors is quite the thing to see. My only issue with the dungeons are that they are too short. I WANT MORE.-There are 6 notable bosses in this game and they are all designed very well each offering very different strategies to conquer them.-Each type of enemy has a small chance to drop a card which gives your character small permanent bonuses (5% discount at shops, Atk/MAtk/Def buffs, AtkSpd and CastSpd buffs, etc)-""Farming"" is very easy in this game. If you kill a group of enemies, stick around for about 2 more minutes fighting enemies and the spawn rate at that location will increase like crazy. There's a room in the toy factory that will spawn endless amounts of presents for you to kill repeatedly. I probably did it for a solid 30-45 minutes and it was great!-This game also features Arcade mode which is essentially a rogue-like version of the game. It's pretty darn hard but fun I suppose. I haven't played it enough for the purpose of this review though.I'm looking forward to seeing more updates for this game. Not sure if you want to buy it yet? No biggie, PLAY THE DEMO! Thanks for reading! I will update this review once more updates come out.			"

Even though it's 16-bit and like csgoose. Anyway, it's an RPG with magic spells or (you can choose to use spells or special sword attacks) sword attacks. Buy this game because it's good!			"

								I don't really know how to describe this game other than, ""Strangely Satisfying"".Yes this game is all about grinding (sort of self-evident by the title) but the grinding is actually pretty fun, You get a really wide range of attacks and abilities to use so you can really customize your combat style to your preferences. The game does unfortunately seem to be lacking a little bit in terms of character customization, but that's not a terribly bad thing, just something I wish would be improved upon. In fact I'd even say this game sort of handles like some of the old-school The Legend of Zelda games, except with more RPG elements to it. Plus, as someone who generally couldn't care less for dialogue, the dialogue in this game is actually pretty good. I actually laughed at a few parts and rarely found myself skipping through dialogue. Not to mention I think it's pretty clear the devs have some real passion for this game. You can really see all the hard work, love & care that went into this game.The only downside is that updates are unbelievably slow and infrequent.I can't really think of anything else to add that might convince people, but seriously, just buy it. I'm almost certain that if you're already interested, you'll enjoy it. However if you know this isn't your kind of game, why are you even here?			"

								Brief:Do you like zelda games, top down exporler games, 8bit rpg story games,rougelike games if yest to any of those get this game.Graphics:The graphic are a great form of 8 bit style of the game, and the music is so spot on its perfect. They have such a huge varity of objects and animations that make this game look so good.GamePlayI have followed this game the day they it was on there site. I loved every mintue of there demo that i bought three copies, because the best part i think about this game is that its full 4 player online supported game. Exploering and boss fights are the best with friends and that ways it stands as one of my favorite games. Now classes there are none its all skill based and you can pick and choose how you want to play the game. You can be a mage and do all magic attacks like fire wave or ice spikes , or go summons and just lie the ai help you with everything. Theres alot to do so youll be fine for awhile.ThoughtsThis game i mean i have spent weekends on the couch with my roommates and so exicted to get the next skill, items , world, boss fight everything si so great about this game and they update the game about once a week so get it now.

								I LOVE THIS GAME!!! This is the first RPG game that i have plaued besides pokemon when i was younger.  The pixil art is great! Such small details are put into this! It took me 68 minutes to beat one of the first bosses, i kept dying and thats where the learning curve comes in, you start to notice the patterns of attack and adapt to them. I absolutely love the music too! And the colors, i just love green environments. This game reminds me of Sword Art Online, and the beginning is kind of like Hunter X Hunter if anyone has seen that. Oh and the characters are pretty funny, i literally laughed out loud when there were 2 thugs stopping me at a bridge and they came charging and i used a quick burst of lightning magic and they just fell flat on the ground XD Anyway ill give this game a....10/10!!

								After watching Day[9] play this on his live stream we couldn't wait to play. It's amusing dialog is hilarious to read through, and keeps the progression of the story fun enough to not want to skip to gameplay. The customization in fighting styles between my husband and I became evident right away. I dove into a two handed knight with fire damage, and lightening magic to power up my hits. He went into one handed with evasive skills, and speed. We are excited to see what more comes out of the game, as its hard to find co-ops that are so enjoyable in this style of play. Highly recommend!			"

								I LOVE THIS GAME!!! This is the first RPG game that i have plaued besides pokemon when i was younger.  The pixil art is great! Such small details are put into this! It took me 68 minutes to beat one of the first bosses, i kept dying and thats where the learning curve comes in, you start to notice the patterns of attack and adapt to them. I absolutely love the music too! And the colors, i just love green environments. This game reminds me of Sword Art Online, and the beginning is kind of like Hunter X Hunter if anyone has seen that. Oh and the characters are pretty funny, i literally laughed out loud when there were 2 thugs stopping me at a bridge and they came charging and i used a quick burst of lightning magic and they just fell flat on the ground XD Anyway ill give this game a....10/10!!

								After watching Day[9] play this on his live stream we couldn't wait to play. It's amusing dialog is hilarious to read through, and keeps the progression of the story fun enough to not want to skip to gameplay. The customization in fighting styles between my husband and I became evident right away. I dove into a two handed knight with fire damage, and lightening magic to power up my hits. He went into one handed with evasive skills, and speed. We are excited to see what more comes out of the game, as its hard to find co-ops that are so enjoyable in this style of play. Highly recommend!			"

Early Access Review
								**This review is coming from a pure single-player experience** (there is multiplayer)I have done all of the story mode content there is to do at this time, minus collectibles, as of version 0.600amigo.Pros:-Fun combat, lots of skills and perks. You can respec for a doable in-game fee. Smooth and fluid animation.-Multiplayer, which I did not try out. This can be done in the story mode and arcade mode.-The environments are awesome, the character artwork could be better, and the music is good, but nothing I see myself humming to.-Many cameos from other video games. Zelda, RE4, Honeydew, to name a few.-There's a stable version and a ""frontline"" version. Pretty self explanatory. The latter has more frequent updates (every few weeks) the former every month or two, from my understanding.Cons:-The amount of monsters you have to kill and the many hours it takes to get a drop does not line up with an items rarity most of the time. It is not unheard of to spend 4-8 hours killing the same monster all to get a drop that is probably not better than what you already have JUST so you can work towards 100% completion. This is never a requirement, but the cards you can get in particular offer small permanent bonuses, and it can take you anywhere from 30 minutes to 8 hours to find the one that you want.-It's short. But the game's not done yet. The current story can be done in about 4-6 hours. Getting collectibles could get you another 10-20 hours, depending on your luck. Question is, do you want those mostly mediocre drops bad enough to spend all that time?-Arcade mode as a single player is quite a challenge. I usually opt for the harder options in video games like Kingdom Hearts on Critical but this mode is hard from the get go if you are alone. I would like to see some scaling in difficulty to make it more doable (maybe there already is, and I just suck.) But if you're looking for a challenge, you've got it here. An option to turn down the difficulty would be nice though.These problems can be easily remedied with time, however. The creators are friendly and interactive with their community, and they post frequent updates.So the question is, do I recommend this game? Is it worth the current price of $15.00?Yes it is. For the amount of playtime I got out of it, for the potential of what it can become, and for the multiplayer, which I didn't even touch, which is sure to add many hours. If nothing else, follow this game. Come back to it later. For an avid RPG fan, this is a game to watch out for.			"

								Secrets of Grindea, OH......MY.....GOD! I hate this game and I love this game, I hate that you don't regenrate helath or that I die way too much (potions or no potions) but I love when you destroy that same enemy who kept killing you over and over again. I'd say it reminds me of Dark souls if Dark Souls went retro. This game will make you rage ALOT, especially if you don't know what you're doing since as of right now it doesn't have a very good tutorial. I really hope this game gets finished and doesn't fall under the ""Early Access Game"" curse because this game is pure gold.			"

								What can I say? I didn't think I would enjoy it near as much as I actually did. I mean, for a 14.99 Beta I expected some grumps, bumps and bugs but this is an extremely polished early access. There are zones you can't enter, sure, but the combat, story and characters are well rounded and feel complete. I was also extremely happy with the level of difficulty that came with some of the puzzles and bosses. It was a very lovely weekend diversion that I will be constantly revisiting for  more content.In one word? Omghappynostalgiagleechallengingexcitingrelaxingmmfgoodnesshighlyrecommend.			"

								I had pre-ordered this way back when it first started pre-orders. I think this was two years ago? At the time the game only had about an hour of gameplay if you 100% everything. Being a person that understands what early-access is I decided to give the game a while before coming back and trying it again. Now the game has evolved quite a bit since I last played. They have added on a few features, and the story is far more progressed... and it's awesome. The combat is fun, the dungeons are very well scripted and planned out, and the bosses are exciting and challenging. I'm happy to say the multiplayer is also very well done. I have spent a few hours playing with my wife with little to no issues (One time she couldn't see a boss for some reason)One of the neat aspects about Grindea is actually the way grinding works. If you stay in one place and kill things for a bit you will see that enemies will begin to spawn more and more frequently. This allows for quick leveling and farming for items. It also means that grinding gets more challenging in that spot. It is well worth it for more than just leveling, enemies can also drop special cards that give your character permanent stat boosts.I could go on but I think one would really have to play the game to get a good impression. Luckily they have a demo although I don't know how up to date it is compared to the actual game.			"

								This is what you might consider a baby review. What I mean is I only do reviews on initial playthrough and how long a game keeps me interested. Overall Rating: 5/5This game so far has won the ""Keep me playing Longest Award"" by far. I am serious. Usually a game keeps my attention for .4 to 3.5 hours before I move on to another game or switch back to playing CS:GO. 19.4 hours before I am forcing myself to go play a few CS:GO Matches. That is insane. I beat the early access normal Story. Then ran some Arcade, which is so Rouge-Lite it made my heart hurt. I just had to keep going. Okay, so a bit of a breakdown. The Graphics are what you see. 16 bit love. The game play is a mixture of A Link To The Past, Secret of Mana, and some flair of it's own. Multiplayer is a bit laggy at times, but other than that it's fun as hell. I cannot recommend this game enough honestly. There are bugs, there are balancing issues, and I can accept that because the game is not complete. But that being said, I would play this incomplete game over 90% of the complete games avaliable right now. Buy this. Share this. Throw money at the Devs and expect nothing in return. Other than a brilliant game that is. If you are expecting me to go into further detail, you are missing the above sentence. Seriously... Buy this.			"

They have such a huge varity of objects and animations that make this game look so good.GamePlayI have followed this game the day they it was on there site. I loved every mintue of there demo that i bought three copies, because the best part i think about this game is that its full 4 player online supported game. Exploering and boss fights are the best with friends and that ways it stands as one of my favorite games. Now classes there are none its all skill based and you can pick and choose how you want to play the game. You can be a mage and do all magic attacks like fire wave or ice spikes , or go summons and just lie the ai help you with everything. Theres alot to do so youll be fine for awhile.ThoughtsThis game i mean i have spent weekends on the couch with my roommates and so exicted to get the next skill, items , world, boss fight everything si so great about this game and they update the game about once a week so get it now.

								Brilliant! Absolutely loved it. I'm not the biggest fan of this type of game but theres something about it, i think because it's not too serious, it is quite easy to either have a quick half hour session or too completely lose yourself in the story for a few hours. Simple and adorable art style.The only problem is the length, in the early access there's about 8hrs tidy content (which is still more than COD) but it is a highly polished, complete section of the game so as long as you don't mind waiting for the full release it's still worth the price tag.

I heard about it from one of my friends and had the time of my life! The game has a good amount of content and keeps coming out with more and more. The creators of the game are quick to respond if there is anything wrong and they keep updating old features of the game and the new ones that they bring still astonish me! This game is pretty fun, but to experience the best is to play with others! I had a great time playing with my friends and having this game come out on steam helped to ease the multiplayer feature of this game. I did not do much except let my baby boy Jacob and a cloud spell named Kevin do the work for me, but I still had a lot of fun!12/10 itching for moar content plsP.S. Buff Kevin and Jacob			"

								bought this the day the devs first put it up for sale on thier site. was well worth the purchase then and there's been loads added since that i haven't seen yet. linear story but plenty of charm. arcade mode (thnk binding of isaac but with grindea assets) is hard as nails and is fun as on its own.if you like grinding, zelda, bright colours and communicative devs with an open approach to early access, buy this game			"

								This game is amazing. It's a love letter to the classic ARPG titles it's honoring, crafted by a very capable team. Every rock, tree, enemy, animation, npc cameo, plot twist - every piece of this game is further proof this is a passion project for Pixel Ferrets.I'd write more, but that's going to keep me and my friends from more time we could be spending enjoying this excellent title. TL;DR - Lovingly crafted + Awesome Gameplay + 4 player co-op + Free Demo = Hidden gem of a game you absolutely must try.			"

								Short: It plays like Link to the Past with alot more weapons and spells to choose from, and it looks much better!Long: Super worth the price, the grinding isn't that boring with the vibrant graphics and fun detailed animation. There is also a timed stage mode where you can change load out and try to reach as high as you can! Stages are very interesting and you can tell there's lots of heart put into it.			"

								What can I say? I didn't think I would enjoy it near as much as I actually did. I mean, for a 14.99 Beta I expected some grumps, bumps and bugs but this is an extremely polished early access. There are zones you can't enter, sure, but the combat, story and characters are well rounded and feel complete. I was also extremely happy with the level of difficulty that came with some of the puzzles and bosses. It was a very lovely weekend diversion that I will be constantly revisiting for  more content.In one word? Omghappynostalgiagleechallengingexcitingrelaxingmmfgoodnesshighlyrecommend.			"

Early Access Review
								I had pre-ordered this way back when it first started pre-orders. I think this was two years ago? At the time the game only had about an hour of gameplay if you 100% everything. Being a person that understands what early-access is I decided to give the game a while before coming back and trying it again. Now the game has evolved quite a bit since I last played. They have added on a few features, and the story is far more progressed... and it's awesome. The combat is fun, the dungeons are very well scripted and planned out, and the bosses are exciting and challenging. I'm happy to say the multiplayer is also very well done. I have spent a few hours playing with my wife with little to no issues (One time she couldn't see a boss for some reason)One of the neat aspects about Grindea is actually the way grinding works. If you stay in one place and kill things for a bit you will see that enemies will begin to spawn more and more frequently. This allows for quick leveling and farming for items. It also means that grinding gets more challenging in that spot. It is well worth it for more than just leveling, enemies can also drop special cards that give your character permanent stat boosts.I could go on but I think one would really have to play the game to get a good impression. Luckily they have a demo although I don't know how up to date it is compared to the actual game.			"

								Probably worth the asked price just for the arcade mode on its own. And then you realize there's the campaign.What can I say ? The combat system is simple to learn, hard to master, with a lot of small things that you can learn to do giving it a large learning curve (blocking in time, attacking at the right frame, etc).If I had to criticize something, it would be the artworks (not the pixel art, it's amazing), the portraits looks REALLY bad, and I wish we would just have the pixelly models, because they look so much better. If the devs get enough money from early access, it'd be a good idea to hire another artist to make those portraits.			"

								Just made it through the story missions available, as well as a few side things. Gotta say this is really good. I dont usually buy into early access, But this shows a lot of potential. Solid music, good combat, and some pretty good humor make this a great time, and really makes me eager for future updates. There really isnt much to complain about here, but there are a few nitpicks. I noticed a few typos, picking up health orbs is a little annoying (as you need to stand right on top of them to collect them), some of the bosses need a bit of tweaking, and some of the characters artwork could be touched up a bit, maybe smoothed out a bit and varying the facial features, as many characters look similar. None of those nitpicks really take away from what you get here though, a fantastic look into what I hope will be an amazing finished product. If you're into games like the zelda series then this is a great pick for you. Thanks to the developers, you guys are doing a great job.			"

Early Access Review
								Though in early access, this game is super entertaining. It brings back the feel of classic games like The Legend of Zelda, but with the added bonus of your friends tagging along. The story is fun, light, and there are many classic throwbacks that gamers will smile at as they play. Definitely worth investing in to help progress it to completion.Some more good things; there are a lot of reasons to continually fight spawning monsters, which makes farming experience worth it. From collecting new items, which help to craft better armor and weapons, to making the money, to just gathering xp to expand your skills. (Which there are many of.)The only downside I and my friend have found, is the magic abilities aren't as useful as the melee abilities. We both wanted to utilize the magic skills but we quickly realized just using our swords was easier and much much faster.This game is in development so I hope to see some changes to the magic abilities down the road.

								Even though ""Secrets of Grindea"" is only in Early access at the moment, the little preview of what they have made so far has me looking forward to seeing more.This game look me back, oh the nostalgia of the old Action / Puzzler / Rpg's really got me remembering those game I once used to play when I was younger,  I used to spend hours just looking for that sword or hunting for the rare monsters! and even getting stuck on a puzzle (until I just gave up asked a friend if they got passed it and how they did it)For those wanting a good Rpg, puzzle, Action, Adventure game with a slice of nostalgia or just something different to play I would recommend this game! The game play is fun and engaging, the starting story line you get to see, gets you wondering what is coming next, the skill leveling gives you so many different ways to play, even the fishing! (something I hate in Games) is more like a mini game than a chore! I can't wait to see what else is to come in the later updates 10/10 from me  :)  "

								The charms and mannerisms of Zelda meet the colours and music of Pokemon, thrown together in a modern take on classic action RPG's.This game is godamn beautiful. A work of art, and I'm able to say this after hardly any time played. Infact, I bought it for myself, and then within 5 minutes had bought it for my partner and friends. Story Mode is great, the bosses are awesome and you actually see yourself getting better at the game as you play (amongst the thousands of deaths). SPOILER ALERT: Arcade Mode is also pretty awesome and the take on it is unique. You have a small town, and depending on how well you do fighting on the mountain, your town is improved.I would highly suggest this game even to those of you who perhaps haven't tried a game of this type before. 10/10			"

								Initial Review:This game reminds me of the snes rpgs but brings new mechanics to the forefront.  Its as many people have said about it early access however the devs been working on this game for 4 years from what people are saying in the forums and it shows through the quality of the game.Story mode from what I gather is still lacking about 6 hours in total however it only intends to get better :) and longer as they add more stuff in. as the development progresses I can only see the game getting better.Arcade mode satisfies my rogue dungeon crawling needs as you have 1 life to get through as far as you can get which is a good time killer if no time for story mode.Overall the game is very polished and I am glad to play this game as early as I did hope it gets only better :), because this game shows that the dev is very knowledgeable and very concern with quality.

								Do you like RPGs? Do you like grinding loot? Do you like....you get the point.  This game has the retro feel of a NES LoZ game with the classic leveling up progress of any other RPG.  For the hour I played I enjoyed the simple battles, easy controls (game controller compatible BIG plus from me), and cant wait to try out the multiplayer modes of both story and arcade.  The story its self isnt too intriguing (again only played an hour as of this post) but I hope to be drawn in with my two friends that NEED to get this game yesterday!Oh so yes buy this game.			"

They have such a huge varity of objects and animations that make this game look so good.GamePlayI have followed this game the day they it was on there site. I loved every mintue of there demo that i bought three copies, because the best part i think about this game is that its full 4 player online supported game. Exploering and boss fights are the best with friends and that ways it stands as one of my favorite games. Now classes there are none its all skill based and you can pick and choose how you want to play the game. You can be a mage and do all magic attacks like fire wave or ice spikes , or go summons and just lie the ai help you with everything. Theres alot to do so youll be fine for awhile.ThoughtsThis game i mean i have spent weekends on the couch with my roommates and so exicted to get the next skill, items , world, boss fight everything si so great about this game and they update the game about once a week so get it now.

								I LOVE THIS GAME!!! This is the first RPG game that i have plaued besides pokemon when i was younger.  The pixil art is great! Such small details are put into this! It took me 68 minutes to beat one of the first bosses, i kept dying and thats where the learning curve comes in, you start to notice the patterns of attack and adapt to them. I absolutely love the music too! And the colors, i just love green environments. This game reminds me of Sword Art Online, and the beginning is kind of like Hunter X Hunter if anyone has seen that. Oh and the characters are pretty funny, i literally laughed out loud when there were 2 thugs stopping me at a bridge and they came charging and i used a quick burst of lightning magic and they just fell flat on the ground XD Anyway ill give this game a....10/10!!

								After watching Day[9] play this on his live stream we couldn't wait to play. It's amusing dialog is hilarious to read through, and keeps the progression of the story fun enough to not want to skip to gameplay. The customization in fighting styles between my husband and I became evident right away. I dove into a two handed knight with fire damage, and lightening magic to power up my hits. He went into one handed with evasive skills, and speed. We are excited to see what more comes out of the game, as its hard to find co-ops that are so enjoyable in this style of play. Highly recommend!			"

								**This review is coming from a pure single-player experience** (there is multiplayer)I have done all of the story mode content there is to do at this time, minus collectibles, as of version 0.600amigo.Pros:-Fun combat, lots of skills and perks. You can respec for a doable in-game fee. Smooth and fluid animation.-Multiplayer, which I did not try out. This can be done in the story mode and arcade mode.-The environments are awesome, the character artwork could be better, and the music is good, but nothing I see myself humming to.-Many cameos from other video games. Zelda, RE4, Honeydew, to name a few.-There's a stable version and a ""frontline"" version. Pretty self explanatory. The latter has more frequent updates (every few weeks) the former every month or two, from my understanding.Cons:-The amount of monsters you have to kill and the many hours it takes to get a drop does not line up with an items rarity most of the time. It is not unheard of to spend 4-8 hours killing the same monster all to get a drop that is probably not better than what you already have JUST so you can work towards 100% completion. This is never a requirement, but the cards you can get in particular offer small permanent bonuses, and it can take you anywhere from 30 minutes to 8 hours to find the one that you want.-It's short. But the game's not done yet. The current story can be done in about 4-6 hours. Getting collectibles could get you another 10-20 hours, depending on your luck. Question is, do you want those mostly mediocre drops bad enough to spend all that time?-Arcade mode as a single player is quite a challenge. I usually opt for the harder options in video games like Kingdom Hearts on Critical but this mode is hard from the get go if you are alone. I would like to see some scaling in difficulty to make it more doable (maybe there already is, and I just suck.) But if you're looking for a challenge, you've got it here. An option to turn down the difficulty would be nice though.These problems can be easily remedied with time, however. The creators are friendly and interactive with their community, and they post frequent updates.So the question is, do I recommend this game? Is it worth the current price of $15.00?Yes it is. For the amount of playtime I got out of it, for the potential of what it can become, and for the multiplayer, which I didn't even touch, which is sure to add many hours. If nothing else, follow this game. Come back to it later. For an avid RPG fan, this is a game to watch out for.			"

								When you screw up, it is important to admit it.  I got a message like ""Sorry, you need to quit now.""   Or similar.    That is unacceptable.  I was kinda hoping to have fun playing this game tonight, but it's not gonna happen...  and you need to change your exit messages to be less hostile - and make it less common for paying customers to experience random exit messages...

								I agree with many other reviewers beneath me in that Grindea is an engaging, bugless and smooth rpg that has a definite MMORPG feel with the optional rare items farming that I find incredibly relaxing. Pros - *Excellent 2-D graphics without being pixelated as seems to be the norm lately.*Responsive easy to learn controls that forgive mistakes but only to a point.*Crafting system makes even weak monsters seem worth killing.*Boss fights are genuinely epic and satisfying.Cons - *Crafting system starts out promising but the lack of items to make in later levels makes it feel gimmicky instead.*Lack of weapons in general makes battles feel too repetitive after awhile.*Replay value somewhat hindered in storymode by the increasing costs of changing your talent points, sometimes requiring 30 minutes to an hour of farming to try something new.All in all I'd say for an early access game this is terrific and if the developers could fix the above issues and perhaps double what is already in the beginning stages...It would be a good I would be willing to pay 40+ dollars for. It feels like an offline MMORPG with Zelda-esque vibes. Great game for relaxing and listening to tunes. I pray it gets better from here.			"

								they take a long while on some updates, and some of them are rather small on the end of playing, but the devs seem to be trying their best to make this one of the best damn Arpgs available for people who want to relive the glory days of super nintendo. i love them for this effort and hope this game gets finished before i die, but what they have here is amazing and worth playing if you dont mind an incomplete game that's still being updated.i hadn't really toyed with it in awhile and 2 updates went through so i'm currently trying to play through the game again and see what the updates are like. the devs are still working on it but sometimes it just takes awhile for a patch. don't hate on them, just be understanding or wait till the game is finished.

								Bought this game on a whim and I really glad I did.  Has some of the best elements from the old adventure rpg games from the past.  I reminds me heavily of the old SNES Link to the Past meets Secret of Mana.  Gives you the ability to chose your skill pattern as well as giving the option to repsec using ore.  I bougth this game today I a managed to squeeze in a little over an hour into.  The controls are really smooth and its really easy to go back and forth between skills.  I have not joined a Co-Op game yet, but I think the single player mode is fun in itself.  I would recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of classic feel adventure RPGs of the past.  The only negatives I would say is some of the names of the characters you run into.  Could use some work there but that's only me trying to find one this wrong with this game.  Really good game.  Looking forward to put some more hours into it.			"

Early Access Review
								(Current review is for version .650SUMMARY:  A love letter, homage, and parody of classic Nintndo-style action RPGS filled with features, character and customization.  Must-support and must-buy for fans of classic action-RPG and crafting.  Even in Early Access it's impressive.Let's get the bad out of the way - this game is Early access, and as of late 2016 I don't expect it to be finished for over a year.  That being said, if you love top-down action RPGs with crafting, you probably should be supporting this anyway, but if you want, read my review.Secrets of Grindea manages a difficult job.  It is a love letter to classic top-down button-mashing action RPGs Nintendo was famous for, but also packs in the ""best"" features of many games.  It is an homage to all those games, without limiting itself.  Finally it's a parody that's not mocking, but affectionate - and the parody elements even work into the plot.The best comparisons I've found are Dungeonmans and Starbound, games that took their time, knew their subject, evolved, and turned into something amazing.In the game, you are a young Collector in the world of Grindea, your aim is to collect artifacts and equipment.  The game offers:* Highly customizable skills.  You can focus on two kinds of weapons, four kinds of magic, and support skills.  You can also tweak ""talents"" that affect how abilities and skills function together.  Each of these abilities can also be leveled up, improving and changing how they work.  Build a combat maniac who mashes stuff with a hammer, a summoner surrounded by friends, a dashing dodging ninja.  It's up to you.* Simple but effective crafting with depth.  Find enough stuff, make stuff is how it goes, but you'll need to explore and experiment to discover what unknown ingredients are needed.  Fortunately things you encounter that can be used are specially tagged.* Choose your equipment. Weapons, hats, armor, accessories, and more all affect how your character functions. Power up your magic with a sorcerous chapeau, find boots that speed up your movement while you charge skills, or stick a pumpkin on your head. You can also choose items to be ""cosmetic,"" changing appearance while you benefit from an equipped item.* Plenty of quests and sidequests and extras.  There's always something to do in Grindea, with plenty of rewards.  Don't forget to return to people you've talked to before.* The fun of the grind.  If you want to max out your equipment, you're going to mash monsters. Grindea, however, makes it fun, with ways to increase spawns, meet tougher monsters, or refight bosses.  You can even tweak skills and equipment for maximum, fast grind. Farming is actually fun.* Lots to do.  Go fishing. Raise a pet. Find minigames.  Look for hidden treasure. Up your hat collection with Mister Fabulous. Grindea offers you many things to do depending on goals and mood.* A great visual style. The world's classic-cartoony not-quite-anime look is charming and appealing, the monsters have personality, the settings are colorful.* A great soundtrack. There's a classic game soundtrack here that sets the mood and is excellently composed.* Story and humor.  There's plenty of humor and an actual story (with some great twists) that's not all laughs. The game comes to life as well as making you laugh.* Two game modes.  You've got your usual adventure, but also the roguelike random adventure mode that lets you gradually build a character legacy and a town.* Optional co-op. On top of everything else, play with friends.Sound like a lot?  The game's staff also consists of three people as of this writing. It's pretty amazing what they've done since 2011.Just a reminder as of this writing it's early access.  The game is very fun, there's lots to do, but it's not done.Now who should get this if you're willing to go Early Access?* If you love old-school AARPGs you probably should just pick it up now to enjoy it and give feedback.* If you love looting and crafting and hunting up rare things and playing minigames, get it.* If the above review interested you.  This game hits a special sweet spot, it just ""fits"" some people.I picked it up and figured I'd check it out due to curiosity.  I played it for 2 hours before realizing how deep in I'd gotten.That might be the best reccomendation I can make. "

								This game is a fun, skill-based, strategy game. This 8-Bit MMOARPG will leave you on the edge of your chair, stool... floor? I guess if you are playing on a floor. You can make your character any way you want with anything you want. Make it a Knight/Mage, or a just flat out DPS Squishy assassin. The enemies are tough and challenging and very intriguing when playing. I love this game and I received it from a friend and we have been playing it since. Season Hydras are a bit of a pain but other than that the game is a very fun, fast pace, quick-response type of game. Be quick and agile when playing this game!			"

								Secrets of Grindea has so much win it's difficult to discribe. Think Zelda's a Link to the Past, or Secret of Mana, but with infinate inventory, craftable equipment, and a slew of spells, including summons. There's tons of humor, too. The best part is, although it's a few hours of play just for the main story, it's beta, so there's more to come! Once you've beaten it, or any time, really, you can play Arcade Mode, which has it's own challenges, and perks you can use in both games.			"

								From what I've played so far, this doesn't get repetetive, which is really nice. Even being in Alpha, there's already quite a ton of content. I'd say it's definitely worth the money, even as it is now. (Incomplete, but you don't really notice that aside from when it says ""This part of the map isn't complete yet."", and the current lack of support skills. Definitely worth the money!			"

								Where to begin, So I do enjoy this game as it's got a Action RPG style to it with customizable talents. The co-op is fun but the enemies are difficult. The NPCs and storyline are kind of boring but it makes up for it with how visual the game is. There's not much content in the game up to where I played. There's no info on https://howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=18233 so I'm not sure if I should keep playing or not. I got stuck a few times not knowing where to go. It's a cute game and I've payed the full price for it. But I think it being in early access I'd rather play it when it's completely finished. That could be awhile.			"

Early Access Review
								I played the whole game until the end of the ""current beta"" (Spoilers)While the game is rich there are a lot of things that really made this game a bad experience:Combat seems to offer a lot at first sight but after playing it has a lot of flaws. I did not suck at combat, i think i did pretty well, i also farmed nearly all cards, but during combat a always felt annoyed, they are a chore:- The deeper into the game the more unbearable the combat system becomes. At first everything is fine and plays decent, enemies have some advertised charge abilities and some require you to block or dodge.- Then suddenly the enemies start to kite like hell and abuse your 4 directional attack restrictions of your abilities by dodging diagonally all the time (Skycastle). Next you have the Snowball jugging guys in the snow-areas which throw nearly invisible projectiles at you.- The gift-box enemies just throw an infinite amount of bombs at you to create random area-denial which taunts you to respec your combat style to spells but this costs much gold- The season temple was ok, except for the hydra fight which shows what is the biggest problem for the remaining game: The game sets up a framework for combat, and then completely cripples this framework by denying you in all sorts of ways in order to create artificial difficulty.Good games create the challenge around the tools it hands to you, not by giving you good tools and then break them.The hydra either does Area denial in a much too small arena, makes you blind (what a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ design choice) or removes your ability to move responsively (ice-floor, even when you have the spiky boots) in a battle that requires evasion of charges, so you are fully dependend on your dodge ability, which makes the fight pretty easy again, as if the developer wants you to do things a certain way, like Apple. The fight vs the Winter-dude sucks because it has so much randomness and badly advertised attacks. I decide therefore to just gimp him by blocking the storm that was supposed to lure me the the opposite site of his long vincibility frame with the mushroom shield. This creates a blind-patch that boosted my crit by 25. That and a dmg-potion and he can be killed after two of his ""i just wait 30s until you pass through my ice-maze that totally abuses the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ movement to damage you""-phases. Did i mention that diagonal movment isnt normalized? so you move Root of 2 faster when moving diagonally.The game has its zenit in the Crystal-cave- zone where every enemy and NPC is just designed to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off until you just skip them.There are Worms that create Area Denial patches everywhere that must be outwaited in order to take no dmg. Mushrooms create blinding fields if you vanquish them. Shell Monsters do a random charge-bounce thing that is so fast that it WILL hit you randomly... All this artificial crippling is shoved into your face one last time with the fight vs the Power-Flower in order to remind you why you hate this games combat.After that you are having the most annoying npc interaction of the game so far with a caveling that is scamming you obviously, but you have to follow through and at the end you are completely mocked, 2 minutes later the game ends.Other:- You cannot really try every skill without grinding loads of gold because there is a somewhat hefty fee required everytime you want to respec your points. There is no way of trying abilities without spending your sparse points into it, maybe save game manipulation, the descriptions are detailed though- The bag (your travaling companion) constantly patronizes you and is in general a scum-bag (pun anyone?). It comments on your inferiorness every time you die, which really feels discouraging because some battles are really badly implemented and always regards you as an incapable kid through the course of the game. I would throw this thing away immidiately if i was given the option.- While the Pixelart-Animation is wonderful and very fluid, the Background Artwork lacks some texturing at the snow and grass areas which make them feel like MS-Paint-Jobs. The Woods and Caves are gorgeous. The dialog-box-faces look strangely out of place and i wonder if they where made by a different artist			"

								So I really love the begining of this game. It was just perfect. Exactly what I was looking for and I had so much fun. Just perfectly blocking stuff to reflect it, dodging things by using Skills, trying to figure out some puzzles. It was so much fun.But since I started playing the Tai Ming - Part, I stoped enjoing the game. It's just boss fight, fight vs 1000 mobs where parrying is useless and you just have to run arround, followd by another boss fight, followd by a fight vs 1000 mobs and so on. It's just not that much fun in my opinion, and the outplay potential is pretty low there. Also one of boss of this Quest just is kinda anoying. It's basicly just like playing one of these japenes 2d dodge games. And I totaly hate them...I just hope that they woun't continue to make these almost only boss dungeons, because thats not what I bought this game for. Because there are tons upon tons of boss after boss games out there...So long term short: I loved the begining of the game, but I don't like how it's developing.Maybe my view onto this game is going to change with some upcoming dungeons and so on, but that's my current opinion on this game.

								This is what indie retro games is all about. Forget all those games you get in bundles that claim to be retro greatness, but they are really just posing behind 8 & 16 bit graphics but are missing all the greatness that those eras stood for. Those games try to make you buy their games based on your love for nostalgia. This one hit it on the money!!!!!Secrets of Grindea!!!! Oh yes, this game has done it all right. This is a game that brings back all the best memories from the classic era, games like Zelda for SNES, Secrets of Mana, and it takes what we loved in those games to a whole new level with modern additions and systems.The combat is awesome action RPG goodness. Hack and slash, cast spells, dodge, block, aim, it is all here and feels great, tight and responsive.The class system is that you can be anything you want. use any weapon, buy any skill from any school of magic. Boost defense, boost elements, boost crit, boost certain spell types and so on. Insane amount of depth with limitless combination of ways to build your character. You can also customize the way you look with different looking hats, shields, weapons that you find and equip throughout the game, its all visible, your hair and skin color and more is also selectable.Slash bushes, crates, vases, you know we all loved to do that and see what item is inside, could be nothing or something great. There is crafting, fishing and all kinds of other ""jobs"" that you can do in this game as well. It has multiplayer where friends can join you on your adventure online.This game has so much greatness and is only in EA. These Devs work hard and love what they are creating and it shows. If you really love retro gaming, you will buy this now!!! Stop buying the low quality crap that comes from greenlight for 10 games in a $1 bundle and put your cash down on something you will actually play, enjoy and be proud to own and say you paid for.

But this game, the potential, wow, I cant wait to see the finished product, and I hope more and more will be added once the product is finished.  This game reminds me of the days I spent playing Secret of Mana with my best friend from childhood, and we beaten that game six times over and still didnt get tired of it.  Everything is superb, music, animation, but what gets me is the potential for massive grind, character customization and the collection of items.  I hope by 1.0 the game will have more weapon types, ranged, and at least double the skills magic and abilities to choose from.  Plays really friggen well on my Razer Sabertooth.  I am glad I purchased this game and will have my partner purchase it as well once its fully released. If she wont, ill buy her it.			"

								I'm not normally into these kinds of games, but I bought the 3 pack for me and 2 friends, and I dare to say, this is one of the best games i've played in a LONG time. Instead of skipping the dialog, I was actually drawn into the clever humour of it and the small little references to other games like this. The battles can keep you on your toes and it's very varied in spells and abilities so you're able to have the replay value of this game. There are also puzzles to solve, which keeps your brain aswell as your fingers occupied.There are also hats and pets to tame, and a frikkin cupcake house to go into! What more could you possibly want?!I cannot wait for this game to be updated to I can see where our adventures will continue. I shall be waiting eagerly for this :D			"

								Grindea is a 2D arpg: - With great humour,  - Noticable references that somehow don't feel out of place in the world - Good music - Great and relatable character - A simple yet deep and flexible combat system - Varied zones, and enemies with movesets that you need to learn in order to counter them (ala dark souls, sort of) - Beautiful and amazing level designs and artwork - Some of the best and most varied animation I've seen in most games (even the ones that use mocap! Even more than call of duty ghost's dogs and fish) - Very diverse and interesting bosses, some of which even ambush you so... DON'T WATCH A PLAYTHROUGH as it will most likely lessen the experience. AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON AND ON AND ON and on and on a,,nd o,,, n ,,,,, If I was to name ONE flaw, (which isn't really a flaw) its that its not done yet. Although I'm personally pretty patient, this game is so amazing that its making me impatient!!Beware, its hard to get your health back after you take hits. So it may either be a very skillful game or a very slow one as you agro each enemy 1 by 1 or avoid/block multiple attacks repeatedly. Its a very hard game if you do not think about your tactics and just mindlessly wail on enemies.  But regardless, I highly recommend playing with a controller, as the game fully supports it and is much easier to work with compared to the keyboard and mouse. There is no voice acting from what I can see however the story is enthralling and very well written. Its well worth the read, so if you can, make sure to read the dialogue.Whoever wrote the scripts, make a book. I'll pay to proof read it no matter how many rewrites you do! In fact I am currently tossing my credit card at the screen with my bank details as we speak.Anyway theres a lot more to talk about but... TLDR; JUST GO BUY IT! BUY IT THEN BUY IT AGAIN SO YOU CAN PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS SINCE IT SUPPORTS 4 PLAYER CO OPP.S. If you can somehow, somehow resist the demonic levels of temptation then just keep it in mind for the full release and experience the complete package. As it stands right now though its still definitely worth buying even now. I haven't finished it yet and I've got over 5 hours so its certaintly got enough content,			"

Early Access Review
								EA Summary: Really polished encounters, controls, and a ton of fun.  Currently low on content (about 6-7 hours to do all main quests and side quests).  While I recommend this game, it is NOT worth $15 at this stage (9/1/2015).Detailed Pro's: The encounters (11/10!) in this game are incredibly well tuned and the clear highlight of this game.  There's no healing that I'm aware of, which means you will be challenged to learn each of these encounters as you die many, many times, similar to Super Meatboy or Dark Souls.  Like Meatboy, you will respawn instantly, and like dark souls, being greedy never pays off; slow and steady wins the race.  The world is also quite nice with beautiful pixel graphics.  I would describe the dialogue as 14-year-old humor that harps on many RPG tropes.  The writers clearly have a sense of humor, which is nice.  The (side)quests are about a 4/10, really only designed to have you revisit old areas.  Some of them have unique bosses, those are cool.The gameplay is also about 8/10, very tight controls.  I really only played 2H with a few extra spells, but the game will allow you to play archer, sword n board, 2h, or a mage in any/all of 4 magic schools.  Plus, there are support spells that help both melee and caster.  The spells seem really weak at low level but quite good once ""leveled up.""  Points can be re-allocated for gold, which is great because you can try something for a price.  Cons: Not much content yet, but it is still a solid stable and polished beta build.  If they keep creating more of the same, this game will be a fantastic modern version of its predecessors like Secret of Mana/Evermore, Link 2 tha Past and others. "

								Awesome game. The name suggests you'll be grinding a lot, but the combat is good enough that you probably won't mind. You're never really forced to grind more than what's reasonable, but completionists will enjoy collecting all the rare cards from every enemy type.Co-op is also pretty fun, and both of you can have your own playstyles that compliment one another.The story is good enough to be compelling. Areas are very interesting and quests are fun to do.If you like SNES action RPGs like Zelda or Terranigma, you'll love Secrets of Grindea.			"

								Content spoonfed to keep the game in Early Access as long as possible so they can make more money. Don't be fooled by this abuse of the EA system. Avoid until it is completed, or better yet, avoid entirely to send a message this is basically fraud. I had high hopes for this game but the developers have maintained their ""we working hard and be patient"" shenanigans to no end. So much so that they locked and pinned a thread created about lack of release and completion to try and keep the complaints down. I've supported plenty of games through EA and am well aware of what constitutes legitimate progress and what is a sham and this unfortunately is the latter of the two. Could not be more disappointed.			"

								This game is the biggest disappointment I've ever spent money on. I had done research and watched videos of the gameplay online and it looked great, kind of like Legend of Zelda meets Stardew Valley. What I ended up purchasing was a half finished abandoned project filled with glitches that hasn't added more than a cave in the past year. After playing through the 4 hours of storyline avaiable before it cuts off abruptly, I decided to give arcade mode a shot since I love roguelikes and roguelites. It seemed unbalanced and bluntly just wasn't fun as far as roguelites go. I requested a refund, and probably wouldn't have if I had any hope that the developer would continue working on this, but honsetly this just feels like a scam getting people to pay $15 for a half finished game. The boss battles were unique and there were some decent mechanics implemented in the storyline gameplay, but they don't even begin to makeup for the cons.			"

								No this game is not a grindfest. It's got 2 modes: story and arcade, both can be played solo or multiplayer. Story is a world with waypoints, quests, and little punishment for death in normal mode. Arcade is similar to Binding of Isaac with rooms that lock you in with enemies you must kill.Really well done game with some quality content, good mechanics, and great multiplayer. It's simply a lot of fun and also challenging. Did have some issues with infrequent disconnects and crashes, but players can join an existing session so it's not too troublesome.There's a lot of potential here, but the story mode is just too short right now. The game's really nice for early access, and as is would be worth $5-10. You can finish the current incomplete story mode in about 5 hours or less. Hopefully it gets finished in a timely matter.			"

								This game was an extreme disappointment. My friend and I had been looking forward to this game for months and when my friend bought it for me as a surprise I was ecstatic. Now all I feel is guilt that they paid money on this unfinished garbage and am hoping the refund goes through.The game seemed beautiful, but how this game looks in gameplay videos and the trailer is incredibly decieving. Don't let it fool you- there's only a few hours of story content here, and not even good story at that. You won't be getting much out of this game other than the pretty visuals, and there are plenty of much better pixel art games out there that you could buy.While playing through with my friend we encountered multiple glitches that made the game unplayable or forced us to close it in order to get out of a never-ending loop of glitches. The storyline is nowhere near finished and hasn't been updated in months (if it ever plans to be finished). Don't even get me started on the rougelike. (It's not fun in the slightest and just seems like a shoddy thrown together attempt to make the buyers stop complaining about lack of content)Overall the best description of this game is soulless. It felt like it was made for the purpose of enticing people to pay more money than what the minimal amount of content is worth, It looks appealing to the eyes, but has no replayability and runs out of content incredibly quickly. This game is not and will never be worth 15 dollars in it's unfinished state, and it says directly on their dev blog they never plan to put it on sale  until it is finished, and I feel like there's a better reason for that than the shoddy one that the dev blog claims. As evidenced by the amount of content that has been put out in the past two years, they seem to be putting out the minimal amount of content to give the buyers hope that this game isn't completely abandoned.Don't purchase this game. You'll regret it and be hoping for a refund like I am.			"

Honestly I'm really liking what I got and don't regret the purchase at all. There is a lot there but... y'know. I don't know.

								Only giving a thumbs down because there are only the binary options, otherwise I'd get like a 7/10.  On the whole it is a good game, but not what I wanted.  Gonna be a bit negative, but know that if the game's name caught your attention than you should not be dissapointed.  I've been living and breathing action RPGs for years.  Each Souls game? 100+ hours.  Each Monster Hunter?  700-1500+ hours.  Got this to fill in the drought between DS3 and MHG.If you are thinking about getting this because you like the more difficult and/or intricate action combat systems then you might want to pass.  Normal mode is far too easy, and the answer to hard mode is just ""throw more sh*t in there.""  With your character's sprite, your pet's sprite, any summons you have, and the gang bang of hostile targets it becomes a clusterf*ck of pixels.The problem is you only really have your shield to be defensive.  The angle is somewhat forgiving when you block, but blocking commits you to the direction until you drop your guard.  Add in that there are no defenses based on mobility (sprints, side/back steps, rolls, etc) and your perfect guard will be swiftly answered with a kick in the♥♥♥♥♥Not that this all matters anyway.  There is no penalty for death as of yet.  Takes some of the teeth out of a difficult game when there is no penalty for messing up.But in the end if you wanted to live the old days of the SNES action RPG then by all means get it.  Don't let a grumpy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like me change your mind.			"

								Meh....This game is ok. Definitely overrated here on steam though.For one thing it's one of THEE most slow to develope games I have ever seen. Barely only faster then games like Starforge which quit development. If you buy this, don't expect a complete game for at least 20 years. Don't be surprised if they never properly finish either (rushed content). STANDARD ISSUE JRPG STORY?I don't personally care for the story much, and the gameplay is extremely repetitive (go into field, whack the mobs, repeat). OTHER GAME MECHANICS?They added all sorts of things to do like fishing and crafting but non of these extra things are well designed nor very fun.Fishing is annoying to do, trying to keep a small area lined up on a moving line or you lose the fish, and it's very unforgiving if catching a big fish. Probably the most uninteresting way to add fishing, even more boring then how ARK does it *quick time events*Crafting is structured in a way so that you never get higher level tier materials. You will only ever find CURRENT story progress relevant level materials, ensuring you can only ever make gear that is almost identicle in stats to what can be purchased at the store, or found as loot. There is no way to get future gear that makes current dungeons easier. Great, but, SO WHY HAVE CRAFTING THEN? IT doesn't do anything else and feels so hopelessly tacked on. It isn't even interesting in HOW you craft. Just get the mats, hit a button, done. You don't harvest resources either, the mats are just from killing monsters. Seriously this crafting system is here only so they can brag about having a crafting system to sucker people into buying this ho hum game. =3BOSSY!The boss fights are intense, and the only hard part unless you don't take time to grind for a while (Note I played on hardest)- you need to be a master at not stepping into the fire, and gear\stats is secondary in importance. Expect to die die die die die over and over again trying to learn some of these fights, especially WINTER boss. Hard mode will definitely not be for everyone here.The music was fair.The art is really high quality.Controls are fluid.My butt is acid.erm...What else am I forgetting?The roguelike mode was a HUUUUUUUUUUUGE disappointment. It isn't some random dungeons like your favorite roguelike game with exploration, oh no, it's more like playing smash TV with each room being a small arena and a few mobs to kill so the door to the next room unlocks. It's the near same thing everytime, same mobs, same pretty much everything. The only fun thing about it, is unlocking new shops and stuff in town to help future playthroughs not be as boring (hopefully).The Secrets of Grindea are not much of a secret, and this game is only some small bits of fun to me. But this isn't exactly my bag baby, what with secret of mana not being amazing to me either. That is the game this is most similar to from the past I'd say, and most people will adore this game as the very high steam rating can show you.I recommend it, only because I know everyone is less jaded then me on games like this! But seriously dev team, finish it sometimes this decade please! "

								Okay, so I've reached the end of the Beta. Figured I'd give my input.For $14.99, it was fun while it lasted, but waaay too short as you could reach the final area before you're stopped by an NPC that tells you you've reached the end of the Beta.So far I'm Lvl 20, and though I did most the side quests (only have like 3 left), there isn't much else to do other than grind and collect stuff, which is repetitive and tedious. Then again, that's what you gotta expect from a game called Secrets of Grindea, and playing the role of a ""Collector"" as they are called in this game.Not saying it's a bad game, it was fun, and it's more fun and challenging if you have friends to play with, but aside from that, it seems fairly short for its current price, as the game is incomplete, and you have to wait for more of the story to be released to be able to continue.Because of this, I can not recommend this game, because I've seen games before that are early access, or incomplete, with a fairly moderate to high price, only to eventually not be completed at all, leaving us loyal consumers in the dust, and kicking ourselves for spending $14.99 on an incomplete game that may or may not be completed in the near future.I'll continue to play it, just so I can get all the cards, and farm some items while I wait. But until then, I wouldn't recommend this game until it is fully released, and when it is, I may change my recommendation then.			"

								As should be apparent with the date, this is an early access review.This game is about as great as it looks. It is reminiscent of games that share its aesthetic from SNES era, but with crafting and a skill system. Pretty sweet. I blew through what single player content there is for it pretty quickly, but that's fine because the game isn't complete and quite fun regardless. Anyone with a reasonable enough income and patience for an incomplete game(read: me) to have the money for this game is unlikely to be disappointed. Time to check out the new patch.			"

								Fantastic potential!  Above average story, fun, engaging script, and likable character tropes.  The visual style lends itself well to all aspects of the game.However, this is a game where combat is the bulk of play; in its current state combat is just a little too clunky for my liking to give this game a solid recommendation.  That being said, much of player control is surprisingly tight and responsive.  The problem is that there are too many zerg-rush rooms to let skillful control shine.  Anemic character reach is punctuated by punishing post-swing recovery, and the mobs of enemies ensure that, whether you hit your target or not, another enemy will likely be shooting you in the back during your recovery frames.  Shield-block input seems sluggish deciding between whether you told the character to strafe with the shield up or to change direction to block the sword about to slash your back open.  Perfect Guarding is just an absolute mess when 4+ enemies are wailing on you.I'm hopeful this will end up a gem of a game, but right now stay away unless you're interested in playtesting to contribute to its growth.

								(Thanks Mike) This game is Good, Even for Beta, it stands quite tall and it sure has a lot of features to show that, I beat the Story with both Mike and my Brother, which was cool because sp is boring. The dialouge is quite humorous in fact I chuckled at a few parts. Now the controls I did not like and Literally had to rebind because it's kinda confusing. The system for leveling up Skills and talents is nice but Talents should of had at least one in each of the 3 that you can choose which kinda leaves everyone to have the same defensive talent. but nonetheless I enjoyed the 10 hours I put into this game regardless of the occasional grinding I do reccommend this game (totallyworththe15bucks)			"

								The game itself is fun, nice graphics, story and gameplay. But I can't recommend it because the development is too slow and it lacks of content.. Arcade mode is ok to spend some time, but if you just want to play a roguelike you have better options out there (Binding of Isaac for example).			"

								This game needs quite a bit of tweaking. After only 2 and a half hours of gameplay, not only have I had to restart the game from the begining, but I would have to do it again because half of the quests I do break if I exit and save only to come back the next day and find out that I apparentley I already did it even though the quest is still not done.Another issue I encountered was that when I saved on my first session playing this game and came back the next day, even though I had all my equipment, all of my quest and story progress had been lost. Pretty annoying if you ask me.My third and final issue that I found was that half the time while trying to run the game, instead of loading it up straight away like my other games, it wouldn't start up. So after clicking on the desktop icon a couple times, it finally loaded up but not properly. The game's resolution screwed up my screen size and zoomed in on a portion of my desktop in a lower quality without the game even loadind up fully. The taskbar icon for the game was active but the game itself wasn't running at all. It didn't even come up when I loaded task manager and tried to end task it. Manually closing it from the taskbar didn't help either. I tried to get a refund, but of course you can only get a refund for a game if you have UNDER 2 HOURS. Pretty dissapointed because not only could I have spent my hard earned cash on something else that would actually work, but I can't even get my money back.Overall, gameplay and fighting is kinda generic and well put together, but the amount of bugs in only 2 and a half hours is pretty horrendous.4/10P.S. The resolution screwing up when booting up the game may be just my fault because of the small resolution monitor that I play on, but come on:It's a laptop			"

								Apparently, from what I've been told and read, that this game has been in development for 5 years.I come back to the game a year after I beat the content of the game and all that's been added is a few pages of dialogue and a new ""dungeon"". Took me about an hour or so to bust through the new additions, then I spent some time in arcade mode.So... Let's do some simple maths ('Cause I don't know how to do much else concerning maths);~1 hour of story content = 1 year of development.Game looks to be about 30-50% ""complete"" in its story. Wouldn't be surprised if the devs skimped a bit just to release a ""full product"" in a few years.Let's take a look at, say Cave Story. Took a guy 5 years (during his spare time, also in college and working a full time job) to make this game. Game's a masterpiece in its genre. Polished and perfected.Let's also assume that the 3 devs (I dunno if they hired anyone else, doubt it though) are also on this same schedule. Spare time working on the game only. 5 x 365 = 1826. 1826 / 3 = 608.733333~That's just shy of 2 years in development for a completely finished product if 3 people are on the workload in an an equal capacity. So why has it taken 3 people 5 years to do the same amount of work as 1 guy? Why is the development of this game so slow and awful?I shall pose an answer for you in the form of a question; Say you pay someone upfront, the full price of the cost to put a roof on your house. What is the motivation to actually do the work? What's stopping this company from driving in a single nail per day and then calling it quits? They already have your money, why continue with the job at all?Early Access is just... A bad business model in its current form. It's not bad for the business, that's for sure, as games like Starbound and this one will attest to. It's bad for the consumer, and for some reason the consumer just laps this garbage up like it's some sort of ambrosian nectar of the dev-gods. There really needs to be some sort of time-limit (One year at the most, 30 days after the deadline to clean up) for games to either finish their development and release a full product, or start refunding all purchases completely.As it stands, there's absolutely no reason for anyone to ever pull ""Early Access Game"" from their pages it's basically free money for a tech demo and a couple of lines of ""story"" to sate the spasms of frothing, ADD-rattled fans.Gaming has fallen so far, and I hope for another crash.

Unfortunately, the story is barren and the arcade mode can be generously described as a watered down Isaac clone, and not so generously described as plain boring.If you buy this game for the story, you're going to be disappointed.If you buy it for the procedurally generated Arcade mode....get The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth instead.

								A fun adventure game that plays well, has deep skill trees and combat, a charming atmosphere, and what seems like a huge world to explore.Unfortunately, it's really poorly tuned right now. Some boss battles are utterly ridiculous with how much is going on. One often finds themselves fighting with the controls - facing the wrong way unable to defend against attacks, dealing with weird angles of attack, skills or spells not triggering, etc. So while it has a lot of potential, I'd wait until this one is out of early access to insure it's tuned up and polished. It could be an amazing game one day.			"

								Here's the summation as quickly as i can:  This game COULD be amazing.  But it feels... like a lacunae.  There is just this huge hole in the gooey center where the peanut butter should be.  With some skill fine tuning, additions of more skills (because even for a nostalgic ARPG this is really light on what you can do besides mix and match) perhaps this game could be a buy.  I bought 3 copies of this for myself and 2 friends... and let me tell you.  That was a dissapointment.  This game MIGHT end up a gem, but for now?  This gem needs a roll in the rock tumbler.  PS.  Fix your combat skills.  As smooth as the movement is, the skills feel like you have to touch the enemy to land half of them.  Also: in multiplayer health orbs not only are actually hard to pickup due to the 1 mm hit detection, but they arent shared with the team.  thumbs up on boss fights though.  for instance, in the first dungeon I really enjoy how you presented them.  even if your gear is such dogsh*t that if you get hit a few times you get dropped.  button mashing won them... not skill placement			"

								who wrote the level design, the graphics artist??? the only reason I kept playing was because it pulls you back in with the fact that you feel empty inside unless you somehow beat the room you cried in. the problem with indie games is that they are poorly play tested, and the developers should have to test every room and every enemy multiple times to get a feel for what their game will feel like. I'm surprised they even implemented motion because they probably didn't test anything.			"

Storyline isn't even completed to the four main quest. I'm absolutely disappointed. So much potential, and it's still on the works, and it has been so for a while (not apparent from the Steam release date, but the project has been going on before that for a couple of years). The arcade mode's difficulty needs to be tuned more adequately for the many skillsets. It can become nearly impossible and beyond frustrating for some.I don't recommend.

								Wait until the game is finished, unless you enjoy reading signs in the game with things written on them, such as, ""Not implemented yet.""Just bought two copies for me and my girlfriend and...we're both pretty disappointed to finish what is completed in the game in under a day. It's apparently been in early access for 3 months already and I don't see any deadlines or promises about when it will be finished.			"

								Even though its still in early access, it can be fairly buggy. Sad to see a buggy title sold for $15. Other games, like terraria or system shock 2 or super meat boy, are cheaper and have more content. This is however a good example of how an early access game should be handled so if you want to support the people making it be my guest. also pls add steam trading card support :P			"

								Its a really well done game, but the current state its in, I recommend waiting before purchasing it. Its not done and some parts of the game feel a bit out of place with the crafting system being hard to come by or just boring grinding. Boss fights are amazing and one of the best parts of the game but is one of the only good parts to look foward to in this game. The leveling up system feels out of place and I know that the devs wanted a game where you can do anything you want with no class or items that truly make you different with others but honeslty that what makes a good RPG or even games with simular things like WoW, Fallout, Skyrim and etc, hell even Terraria does it well. So many times me and my friends found items that were just better that what we had already so having no other choice we use it hoping maybe it will help us. With No Classes thier no reason to build up to a certain classes or benifits really because at times it seems like your character is no different then the other people who play this because everyone justs goes for something thats good and only the good moves and perks making it kinda pointless when just everyone gets the same♥♥♥♥♥♥ taking the varity out of the game and really nothing to say"" I made this character to my play style or even a cool build"". Money is also Pointless at times and just used to buy junk at the blacksmith because you dont wanna grind or dont even know about the bad crafting system in the game. The crafting system is never really introduce and its just there at times not really showing you anything about it or some of the cool items you can make. Two choices that best describe the crafting system is thats it there use it or don't because you will probly forget about it or don't care.Story is good, fun and amazing but at times its like left 4 dead, by just walking from point A to point B making it really boring along with the never ending spawning of enemies that just are annoying as hell at times.This game brings alot of cool elements and amazing coop gameplay that just make it feel right. I truly want to play this game more but theres nothing atm ( AND THE GAMES NOT DONE ) that makes me want to come back with buddies and play. Its a great adventure but with mechanics that don't feel right but is not afriad to try something new but Im just not sure if it fits the game while this game trys to be more than one genre and even then it hardly fits them. Its a decent game and I see alot of potenial in this and wish that other games took risk with like this at times.			"

								This game looked good and I understand that it is a beta, but it lacks so much even in the begining. Make the enemies super easy, beyond easy and then make the boss super hard, two hits your dead. In the story mode you can't go back, so better level up before.....the adventure mode is lame. If you fail the floor you don't get to keep anything, so if you suck at the game, too bad. RPG's should let you level up to where it's beatable. 15$ it's a money stealing joke and I expected so much more. 2$ there that sounds better. Boo this game should be deleted.			"

								This game is beta. 'Some' bugs can be accepted. But If the game is equal to bug itself or has problems that are preventing players to move on with story line, that is unforgivalble according to 15dollar bill.this game. is fantastic. I have dreamt to play this kind of rpg for so long and I have met it. But since this day bugs got insane distturbing entire game play. every 5~10 minutes the game crashes eraising latest game memory. Major bug made quests messed up, preventing any more progress to the story line. I'm so heart breaken with these sudden issues, and sadly I am very upset with the developer also.			"

								no updates anymore. game isnt even done. it will never leave early access.edit: If your rebuttal is that they still release updates every 3-4 months, then clearly you have some form of autism, because: you took my words literally as if you don't understand the concept of an exaggeration or figure of speech, and/or you think the updates given every 3-4 months actually amount to enough content that the game will be finished and polished within a reasonable amount of time (subjective, yet at the rate this is going, it won't be reasonable to 99 percent of the consumers/customers), and/or you think the game is closed to being polished, which implies that you probably have down syndrome in addition to autism.

								Okay, so my time says 2.2 hours, mostly for the case because it does'nt count offline time... BUT i still think being that i've gotten pretty dang far, i think i should have a say, before i start, these are simply my pros and cons upon the game, you like them, great! if not, well prefernaces are preferances! now let's get started!Pros:-Old fashion RPG style, i think it's refreshing to see old styles coming back, not lazily done either, this was actually made as such with care, sure it's a work in progress or ""Early Access"", BUT so far, can't complain too much about the game style.-graphic style, i'm not usually one for 2d pixle style unless it's either done well, or turns out like terraria, where the gameplay makes up for it (My opinion... besides, you can make you're own texture packs for terraria anyways...), but game however, has done it correctly in my opinion, given it that charm that i don't get from most games now a days.-skills, sure alot of them are'nt that ""Uniqe"", but they are pretty good, concidering you can dash foward and damage anything in the way? or leap back and slash foward? i can't complain that much!-Cards, this is actually better then you may think, No it's not part of a card game, but their permanent boost to a certain stat, or additional damage or special ability, plenty a pain to gain, but pretty good otherwise.-Crafting, not much at the moment, but i can see this going pretty well if done well.-Costume slot, Has to be said, considering i can have a full plate helm and still look like i just have glasses on, basically making my own appearance in the game? gotta say, THIS i really like...-Pets, Gotta say, i like pet's as is, but just having a jack o lantern as an option? that won me over for that detail, but to the real stuff, basically feeding you're pets, you give the xp in a certain stat, once it levels, it gives you a bonus for as long as you have the pet! (Seriosely though, Devs, Great job on the jumpkin pet, Love it, Love it, LOVE, IT...)now the cons (Note: i don't have too many because the rest are mostly one nuetrals):-YES the game is very grind-ish at times, gaining materials, certain armors, weapons, I'm just placing this here because even I have to admit that this CAN get mind numbing, BUT take note: This one is least concerning, why? The word ""Grind"" is in the title, so really... well that IS what you're getting a peice of... but to be fair, you don't HAVE to grind to get through the story, again, don't pay TOO much attention to this one.Now the Nuetrals:_Custimization: Yes i do like the costume feature, and yes i can basically make myself in real rife... for the most part, still missing facial hair, but we are playing as a young child... my point in this one is, Yes it's there, just not much of it is there at this time, which the reason it's a nuetral? ""Early access"" is why.-Armor, and when i say this one, i mostly mean chest armor appearance, basxically... it never changes, no form of changing it accept colors, i guess you could say this is SORT of a request, but a deal breaker by any means, Just a small request to let us change from simple shirt and scarf to say leather or metal armor? to appropriate to the class? robesx for mages, leather for rogues, metal for tanks? mostly for appearance, like in costumes...-Difficulty, i don't mean for the common enemies, i just mean for certain bosses it CAN be rather... unforgiving... until you find some form of work around or loopole to the boss...That's about it really, again, the game is early access, so not TOO much can be said upon it quite yet, it does look promising so far, heck, if i had friends or people to play with, or someone to help get through the story, i'de go for i9t to be honest, but any ways,  at the current time, i would give this game... 7.5/10 seem fair? for it's current status, this is in no way the final grade, but yeah for those who just want a charming, nice, Mostly friendly game to play, i recommend this plenty!

Story, its serviceable and obviously the game isnt finished, but I'm sure it will get better.The developers have been constantly adding new content on a regular basis, so there's that going for it. Honestly I think this things going to be a top tier RPG when its completed, and i've already gotten much enjoyment out of it.

								Zelda meets Terraria.At least, that's how I'd view it.  The graphics are very good and well animated (for a 3 person team, from what I've heard!).  But that's probably not what you want to hear; you probably want to hear about the gameplay.The attacks are very satisfying, going up two types of charges: silver and gold.  And if you don't like your build, you can use money to reset it, which is very nice.  You're not restricted by classes either, so you can switch freely.  What's better than hitting the (current) last dungeon and ohko'ing everything with your 2h weapon and a crit build?  Probably a billion dollars but if I'm trying to convince you to buy this game, you probably don't have a billion dollars.  Sorry.The story is quirky and cute, and the puzzles are pretty easy so it's not hard to get by the story.  The references are great too.  And if the story's not enough for you, but you don't want to do arcade mode, there's always the grind (for loot and cards)!Arcade mode is quite a challenge (at least for me and my trio of inept friends.  Oh god, the bees) but it's fun and so far seeing the perks and trying to get town upgrades motivates me to keep trying. (We've made it to the second floor.  A true display of skill.)However, some things I'm not so keen on, such as:- Bows.  Do you even really need them? (except for that one area that I won't spoil)  I was doing 1.1k+ damage with a 2h weapon on a crit, but only 255 damage on an arrow crit.  Not to mention that the ammo is limited.  I would like for there be a more traditional ranged weapon class, so I'm hoping that later editions will introduce stronger bows, perhaps.- For some reason the hair stylist sometimes glitches out and the previews of the hair icons are all glitched.- Leveling pets is a bigger grind than I thought it'd be, but it's probably because higher level food drops haven't been implemented yet (I'm hoping.  Oh god 1000 apples no why).- Marino needs to be stopped.  I hope the devs write in a side quest for this.  Thanks.- CHICKEN HERDINGI'm very much looking forward to future updates and the full release of the game!  And if you're still interested, but on the fence, try out the free demo!			"

Early Access Review
								PERMANENT BETAPERMANENT BETAYesterday Planetary Annihilation released a standalone game that completely replaces their older product. The game was successfully Kickstarted and went through Early Access where it attracted endless negative reviews; missing features, promises that weren't kept and deadlines that weren't met. The cynical among us might suggest a completely new product means a fresh slate for Steam reviews - but it's a damning indictment of a company's misuse of Early Access.It's a shame because, for the most part, Early Access has been a phenomenon, allowing games to grow and developers to get real feedback on what's working and what isn't and make changes based on those player responses. Secrets of Grindea has recently hit the Early Access scene and, after a successful demo launch earlier in the year, stands out as a shining example of development done right.Secrets of Grindea is a 2D RPG in the vein of the older Zelda or 'Of Mana' titles. it has the same charming art style but has a quality of animation that gives the whole game a modern feel, that unfortunately doesn't translate especially well into screenshots. The game focuses on a young boy leaving his village to become a man (stop me if you've heard this one before) and to do so he must first collect his sword and shield and make his way to the nearest town.On the way you'll learn the basics of combat and get a real feel for how exceptionally well animated Secrets of Grindea is. The sway of a cloak as you dash, the hunched shoulders of a defensive position and the theatrical swirl as human enemies pirouette to the ground in defeat.The premise of the game is, aside from killing and leveling up, that you are a collector. A type of champion who's tasked with chronicling and cataloging things within Grindea's gorgeous and vibrant world. There's a hint of Pokemon about it all, but Secrets of Grindea wears its influences proudly; and why not? This is an excellent reimagining of some classic ideas and franchises.The levelling up system itself is more reminiscent of Diablo than any other franchise. As you level up you get skill points which you can put into various areas; magic, defense, skills etc You can unlock new, castable abilities which subsequent points will improve, or level up several of your passive skills. It's adequate, though I'm yet to come across a level up system that I could ever describe as anything other.I've finished all the content available in Secrets of Grindea's Early Access build outside of the game's Arcade Mode which I'll delve into when the full release arrives. As it stands, though, I would have no reservations about recommending Secrets of Grindea to anyone. It's been a while since a game has been so whimsical, light-hearted and, as simple as it sounds, fun. It's gorgeous, colourful with a stellar soundtrack and is more than an homage to 16 bit classics. This is a faithful re-imagining of the tropes of old with a modern shine and it does it so much better than everyone else. http://www.permanent-beta.net/previews/2015/8/19/early-access-investigations-secrets-of-grindea "

								Alright, Secrets of Grindea, played through what the game has in it as of writing this, have been playing the frontline version. The game is very enjoyable, with friends there is hours of fun to be had. The game wants you to explore the world, the puzzle solving is fun and can be challenging. I really enjoyed playing it with my friends. The game is also fun to play on your own, there are no classes to lock you into certain skills so you are free to choose how you build your character. overall the game is very enjoyable 7.5/10			"

								I really like the game play and everything. However my main issue is i find Normal too easy and hard too hard. My point really is I like solo playing alot but the feature of having to hope for health drop is too stressful. I neither want to simply crush the AI. I would really like some type of health potion of some kind. So the solo player can pla hard with having to worry about lossing mutli staged levels.			"

								This game was purchased to me by a friend, we played it together. It's (as the name suggests) kinda grind reliant, the grinding itself is pretty fun though! Monsters/enemies are well-made. Good aesthetics, not too easy and not too difficult. There's plenty of secrets and tricks to discover as well.The crafting system is actually pretty decent, it's quite easy to figure out, though there's no information saying ""item dropped by X"" - You kinda have to remember which enemy drops what, but the names are quite relatable!I've played it solo as well and can be fun, but I think with good company it's more enjoyable, although you'll have to fight for loot haha! (loot settings can be altered by host)I'd recommend this game if you like exploring and crafting. Not to mention the art style is incredibly cute :) (reminds me of Maple Story)			"

								Currently, I'm about 7 hours into this great game.  Talk about a refreshing one! Lately, I've been having a hankering for some nostalgia, but at the same time I really didn't want to play something I've already played before. This game was able to satisfy both of those aspects for me. While it is still in beta, this game actually really stands up for itself! Customizeable characters (hair style, hair color, skin color, scarf color, shirt color, and pants color), hack and slash, level up system, upgradeable skills, crafting, clever dialogue, addicting gameplay, and difficult bosses keep you addicted as you realize you've lost a few hours of your life. No ragrats!			"

The story is very fun and reminds you of old rpgs like Legend of Zelda. The atmosphere and music of the game fits perfectly to the story and provides an amazing element of nostolgia. My only gripe with the game would be how short it is, but I'm willing to wait for more as the dev team is a team of two working endlessly to make the game perfect. Overall a 9/10			"

								If you have a friend you really like playing with online, I really cant say anything else than WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? This game is wonderful, the combat is beautiful, the music is awesome, and the humour put into it actually wants you to read the text and kinda follow the plot, I was really sceptic to this game when we started and then you start to get the feel of the game.We ended up finishing the story mode that's currently out as it is early access still, and we've sat for about 8 hours if not more. The combat is very satisfying, especially with controller, I havent tried with mouse and keyboard, but with controller everything is smooth and awesome. The bossbattles are extremely wild and incredibly satisfying when you win, the battles are quite hard on normal difficulity, and when you die you dont really feel cheated or that anything is unfair, you just kinda laugh and get back at it. The graphics are a perfect 10/10 for the type of game it wants to be. beautiful particle effects, and animations. Some of the characters you meet are quite memorable, because of their attitude, or just humour. If you want something to play by yourself or with up to 4 friends , thats smooth, fun, challanging, and awesome, then this is the perfect game, and its not that expensive. I really reccommend this game even tho on the screenshots and video it might not look that extraordinary, but trust me, its fantastic. 9.5/10 from me.			"

The story itself (so far, at least because it is still in early access) is also good, your standard RPG story I suppose. The art is crisp and colorful, and the mechanics of not only boss fights but areas as well are very fluid. I am expecting great things from Secrets of Grindea, and hopefully in the near future.			"

								An awesome game, it feels extremely nostalgic yet completely new, the game system is good, it has a crafting system and two distinct ways of playing, either alone or with your friends in online Co-op, since both Story and Adventure modes support Online play. It could be a little cheaper, specially since I live in a Country where everything costs more by default, but it still is worth paying for, and playing as well, I recommend this to anyone that's from the Old times, who used to play The Classic Final Fantasy games, Chronno Trigger or Secret of Mana.

								Man I feel dumb.I Was told this game had straight up multiplayer, like just joining others in groups and so on without having friends who own the game.I guess I should have read the description first, its just the idea of a secret of mana like game with a nice controller support was excellent, but as a single player game I'd rather be playing mana.PROS: Excellent skills and abilities system. Simple and effective gearing system, nostalgic feel, cool areas.CONS: this game could be really fun if it had an online multiplayer player matcher or something, just something that can put players with eachother when they are roughly the same level and progress in the game, this would give a sense of community within the game. I'm not great with puzzles, so I've given up at a few points to go play arcade. "

								It kept me playing because of the difficult (on hard mode) combat coupled with smooth controls and a decent number of viable gear+skill builds.  Not much story, but what is there can be pretty funny.  Devs are still very active, and post weekly updates on their website (which eventually make their way into the stable build).  I spent most of these hours playing single player campaign, just messing around with every build I could think of.  The arcade mode is also a great challenge.  Both modes can be played with friends (although I have only played solo).  Even if (and this seems unlikely) they stopped developement, I would say I have already gotten my money's worth.			"

Early Access Review
A blend of scott pilgrim and Diablo 2Note: This entire review is from playing story mode by myself. I haven't tried multiplayer and arcade mode I've only tried a small amount, so realize this isn't the most complete review.Pros:The game has an action rpg feel with it's talent trees and skills that is like diablo 2/torch light. There's alot of depth here for you to customize your hero into a full warrior or a mage or a hybrid of the two. The retro look makes it seem easier to pick upAs you go deeper into the game the boss fights become more challenging, to the point where I can almost guarantee that you'll die by the 4th or 5th bossThere's a crafting system that reminds me of dragonquest XIII, it's pretty dope. You take misc. items and you combine them to form stronger swords, shields, etc.Cons:The story seems like a parody of other games, many bosses are references to old games and anime like a gundam boss and things similar. And the title of the game itself, Secrets of ""Grindea"", is a reference to grinding, or hours of constantly doing monotonous tasks in mmorpgs in order to get something. Many of the cities like EverGrind are references like this too. You can definitely see where the creators drew inspiration and they take alot of time to give nod to that but I also wish that they'd take their own story and lore a bit more serious. Admittedly I haven't really taken the time to read much of the chat boxes but that's the impression I get from some of the bosses and atmosphere. Some of the spells feel lackluster at first and I find myself constantly respeccing my hero.Would I recommend it?I would to someone who's already a fan of a scott pilgrim beat em up or like diablo 2/torchlight type of action rpg or someone who's into games like the older zelda games like link to the past. For $6-$10 I think this game is well worth the price. There are promised updates with more dungeons in the future which I'm really looking forward to. I'm only level 13-14 at the time of this review and not even close to finishing all of the content, there's definitely enough content and grinding to keep a player in the game until updates arrive.

								If you played and enjoyed any game of this sort as a kid, you'll love this. It is oldschool as ♥♥♥♥, the bosses are a lot of fun and frustrating, just how you want them to be in this game. Its great in multiplayer, the music is original and memorable, the skills are a lot of fun to experiment with, you won't regret buying this.That being said, I do hope for more depth and some new features / areas / quest lines in the final release of this game.Overall rating: 9/10			"

								**Edit** The game has been updated to now fix the save file deletion issue I had. As this was my only reason for saying ""no - not in the current state"" I have now changed it to a positive review (as it always was if fully read). Cheers!Great game, but not recomending it in its current state. Played for 4-5 hours with 2 others, my girlfriend was the host. Alt-tabbed to activate skype and both myself and the other guy we were playing with crashed and lost our characters. Not in the select screen.. simply gone. I would recommend supporting the game as we had a lot of fun whilst it lasted, with funny dialogue and a promising talent/combat system like a modernized zelda title. If you don't mind the potential loss of character in multiplayer, or you are a fan of hardcore rogue-like, feel free to play now :)			"

								Great little RPG that can give you quite a bit of fun and a lot of hours of gameplay. The combat is very good, fluid and doesn't make you ""get caught in animation"" with that said, you can miss attacks if not facing the same way as the enemy. This can make things a bit difficult in tight spots, however the blocking system works really well.All in all this game is great, you wont regret buying it, full price or on sale (which I have yet to see it do) however I have one caution for any buyer....****DO NOT BUY THIS ON STEAM!********You're missing out on a free DRM free copy!! Thats right, if you buy this here you don't have access to the DRM free copy, but if you buy it through either Secrets of Grindea's website, or on Humble Bundle's site they give you access to both the Steam key and a DRM free copy! So DO NOT BUY HERE! Or you're forced to miss out on that free copy. Hope you find as much fun in this little title as I have.			"

								I very much love the game, there is not a lot of problems and its a great story. But the lil snow golem i maxed him out and sometimes and enemy glitches him out and starts to get a lil choppy and won't attack. Not sure if anyone else found this out but its not that bad of a problem. I also love some of the puzzles mostly because you ACTUALLY have to think about it, and my friends tried multiplayer and some of the bosses there..... very challeging i won't say any of them because spoilers but dang some get hard. You have a good game so far i just hope you dont do something to ruin it like some games do.			"

								Secrets of Grindea is a fantastic love letter to old school SNES RPG's while adding in much of its own to the mix keeping it fresh and intresting. This is a game I've imagined playing for a long time and I'm glad to see that it's in great hands with developers that actually care. Especially a great time if you've got some friends. With the pixel artistry, soundtrack and humourous dialogue this game is gem and I can't wait to see the finished product.			"

								Secrets of Grindea is a great game.  Love the old school nostalgic feel of it and it's simplicity.   The graphics of the game are exactly where they need to be for this type of game which is what drew me to it.  I also love the fact that your characters and their skill sets are completely customizable, making the game an ever changing adventure for the players.  I played as a battle summoner, as well as a mage. :D  Another thing I love about it is that you can use a keyboard or gamepad which for me made things a lot easier.  This game is well suited for a gamepad.  The only complaint that I have is that I wish they would get more content out there for us so I can play the rest of the game. :)   I don't mind playing the rogue-like arcade mode, but would much rather finish the storyline within the game.  Been wanting to do an online run with some people and make some new friends so feel free to add me if you want to. Overall I would give the game 4.5 stars out 5 rating.  Once the game is finished I more than likely with give it a 5 out of 5. Great Job Devs, and keep up the good work.			"

								I grew up playing Secret of Mana and Secret of Evermore with my brother on the old Snes and had been looking for a game that would do them justice and I can honestly say this game is it. I am not even halfway through and it is a great game in the same vein of the Secret of Mana games. Blown away with how well put together this game is. Little graphics and animations that add the extra flavor a great game needs. Really looking forward to the official release of this one. Get a gamepad for this one by the way, just doesn't play the same with a keyboard!			"

								I would definetly reccomend this game, but $15 is a bit steep, it's been in dev for 4+ years and it only gives you about 3-4 hours of story line gameplay *solo*, the best weapon in the game you get an entire dungeon before the end dungeon so it lacks some things. Aside from that, it's a very fun game to grind whether you just wanna spam adventure mode or beat the game.			"

								With 11 hours into the game, I am still looking forward to playing more. While this game is technically in early access (beta), a lot of the important stuff is polished; and the portions of the game that still need work haven't caused any problems (so far as I can tell). I'm very much looking forward to the additions soon to come and the developers are hard at work on the game with the updates remaining constant. What appears to be the most important aspect of this games early success, though, is the games ability to capture my attention for long periods of time; and want more when I'm not playing. I know that I will be sinking many more hours of my life into this game and I highly recommend this game to any action RPG fan. It will keep you glued to your computer for hours.			"

								An awesome game, it feels extremely nostalgic yet completely new, the game system is good, it has a crafting system and two distinct ways of playing, either alone or with your friends in online Co-op, since both Story and Adventure modes support Online play. It could be a little cheaper, specially since I live in a Country where everything costs more by default, but it still is worth paying for, and playing as well, I recommend this to anyone that's from the Old times, who used to play The Classic Final Fantasy games, Chronno Trigger or Secret of Mana.

								Man I feel dumb.I Was told this game had straight up multiplayer, like just joining others in groups and so on without having friends who own the game.I guess I should have read the description first, its just the idea of a secret of mana like game with a nice controller support was excellent, but as a single player game I'd rather be playing mana.PROS: Excellent skills and abilities system. Simple and effective gearing system, nostalgic feel, cool areas.CONS: this game could be really fun if it had an online multiplayer player matcher or something, just something that can put players with eachother when they are roughly the same level and progress in the game, this would give a sense of community within the game. I'm not great with puzzles, so I've given up at a few points to go play arcade. "

								A very solid game so far. I feel the bosses are particularly well-designed. Also, it's hard for me not to enjoy a game that themes one of its first areas around Halloween.With something like half of the map still inaccessible, I'm defintely looking forward to further developments.			"

								It's not bad but honestly a little more could have been developed before releasing it. There's also the thing of some stuff doesn't change like how the Fae kind of just leave the other fairy in ice as well as Summer not coming to Ever grind. Though it is very well done the crafting system is very intreging and it's also a very funny game the bag's lines are hilarious. So yes I definately recomend this game but possibly might want to wait a while for it to develope further before purchasing it or don't and wait along with us for it to update.			"

								I have invested a good bit of time in this game so far. Personally my favorite part is the multiplayer mode with the endless damn levels. Well in all honestly i think its 12 full levels all together,, but talk about freakin fun. Me and a friend of mine have played this almost 50 hours in a short amount of time. I would suggest this game, I just wish they would update it with the rest of the story so I can keep playing it further. But I know awesomeness takes time			"

								Instant love. Gorgeously animated, and well executed and tight gameplay. The story and setting pokes fun at the genre. It is quite charming, and delivered at an appropriate fast pace. Lots of skills and specializations seem to indicate repeated plays if you wish, but there doesn't seem to be any random maps. Game's biggest weakpoint are the backgrounds, which are very crudely drawn in places.			"

								Everyone who enjoyed The Legend of Zelda (escpecially the ""older"" ones like A Link to the Past and Link's awakening), Secret of Mana, Secret of Evermore, Illusion of Gaia, and so on, will love this game. It somehow reminds me of all those games at once and the childhood memories connected with those games. It's simply beautiful. The game is also funny at times without appearing too immature. Cheers to the Devs. They really deserve to get a extra coffee (that DLC lol).			"

								Secrets of Grindea is a fantastic love letter to old school SNES RPG's while adding in much of its own to the mix keeping it fresh and intresting. This is a game I've imagined playing for a long time and I'm glad to see that it's in great hands with developers that actually care. Especially a great time if you've got some friends. With the pixel artistry, soundtrack and humourous dialogue this game is gem and I can't wait to see the finished product.			"

								Secrets of Grindea is a great game.  Love the old school nostalgic feel of it and it's simplicity.   The graphics of the game are exactly where they need to be for this type of game which is what drew me to it.  I also love the fact that your characters and their skill sets are completely customizable, making the game an ever changing adventure for the players.  I played as a battle summoner, as well as a mage. :D  Another thing I love about it is that you can use a keyboard or gamepad which for me made things a lot easier.  This game is well suited for a gamepad.  The only complaint that I have is that I wish they would get more content out there for us so I can play the rest of the game. :)   I don't mind playing the rogue-like arcade mode, but would much rather finish the storyline within the game.  Been wanting to do an online run with some people and make some new friends so feel free to add me if you want to. Overall I would give the game 4.5 stars out 5 rating.  Once the game is finished I more than likely with give it a 5 out of 5. Great Job Devs, and keep up the good work.			"

								I'm so addicted to this game it's not even funny. I just love it so much. Replayability value is very high and there's so much you can do; you could spend about 30 hours completing the game and keep playing past that. Music is nice - the song during boss fights has a little Zelda ring to it, if I'm not mistaken. The co-op is a fantastic touch. Playing with friends has never been easier or better. Graphics are absolutely perfect. Dialogue and story is not bad, could be improved though! I simply love SoG, and if this is how the game is in beta, I can't wait to see how it looks like in the full release. The devs already have a polished game here, simply fantastic! 11/10+ co-op+ graphics+ replayability (30+ hours)+ game concept (skills, hats!)+ gameplay+ very playable+ challenging~ music~ dialogue- you get addicted			"

								Oh boy, where to begin... Very fun combat- feels just right, very awesome skill trees and customazation. Fishing, the fishing mechanic is just right imho and adds to the game. Graphics are pixel perfect and control is spot on. Story, its serviceable and obviously the game isnt finished, but I'm sure it will get better.The developers have been constantly adding new content on a regular basis, so there's that going for it. Honestly I think this things going to be a top tier RPG when its completed, and i've already gotten much enjoyment out of it. Recommended as long as you know it's not finished and you're not going to complete the story until well, they complete it ;)			"

								Bought the game, learned about /respec, /setlevel xx and /skillpoint. abused the h*ll out of 9999 EP. jokes aside what I would like to see in this game is a Endless dungeon for story mode characters. Also random spec'd weapons in that dungeon [recoloured weapons an items if developer gets lazy but need stronger weapons for /beastmode on]. Arcade mode is a blast and the story is fun. The art work for the NPCs is alittle dodgy but it adds to the games flavor. Its just after you get as far as the story will let you, arcade is the only replaiblity after you collect everything. Great so far and has a sh*t ton of potential and i can see it going far. One thing i have been talking to my friends about is a trade system and a strafing when attacking. I just really want an Endless randomizing dungeon you can access in the story mode characters. for now i'ma just farm the gifts and presents with /beastmode on.Last note, possible steam workshop for this game? allow modders to add mode balanced weapons and equips. possibly maps and dungeon out side of arcade mode.Edit. some hit boxes are off as well			"

								Secrets of Grindea is an over-head 16-bit style RPG. It implements features like skills that you can upgrade, which allows you to choose what role your character takes (Melee or magic, or both). The devs seemed to focus more on mechanics and gameplay rather than storyline. But, it's not all hack-and-slash, there are puzzles through out the game, some that you have to complete, some not. The combat is good in-that you can't just spam the attact button since that'll probably get you hit, the game kind of forces you to utilise skills that you've chosen when in combat, which is a good thing because it keeps the player on their toes and makes them think about what their next move will be. Overall, I'd recommend it to anyone who likes these sort of games and not just games like CoD and CS:GO and even though the game's in beta, it feels like a completed game.			"

								Have you ever wondered what a Zelda game with Terraria aspects to it would be? Well, the Secrets of Grindea is basically that, but better. SOG as I call it, starts as you as the silent protagonist in the world of Grindea, a fantasy world with a main story, and a bunch of side quests. This game is yet another early access game, but there is a ton to do here, just in the Beta version. There are 2 main modes so far. There's the main story campain, that you can eather play alone or with friends   online on a co op game. And there's Arcade Mode where you and friends can go through dungeons, collect treasure, weapons, do challenges, and kill enemies, to see how far you get. If you die you start over, so you have to do it all again, but  you can get escence statues, that you can use to purchase upgrades, to give you an easier time. Honestly, I think it's annoying sometimes, starting all over each time, but it's still fun regardless.SOG is a very good game, and I absolutely love it, even in Beta, and I can't wait to see what the full game will be like! It's fun with friends, and great alone.  For $15 I still think it's worth the price, and I usually don't think that for other early access games. The Secrets of Grindea gets a 9.5/10			"

								Really fun game, both the story mode and the arcade mode. Some may complain about the price, but it was well worth the price of admission, in my opinion, for the hours of enjoyment I've had and will continue to have with the game.On a negative note, the story mode was stagnant for a few months, but the developers do stay busy doing what they're supposed to do. Plus, the included arcade mode is just as fun as the story mode and could be a seperate game by itself.			"

								Interested? Read This First!ContentIt really depends on how you play it. I lke to call myself a beta tester even though im not and i dedicated my time to try and collect all items. Still havent done it though and ive put nearly 50 hours into the game. If you are a person who likes to collect things, try to find interesting exploits and glitches, then the game is perfect for you if you put it on frontline. If you are a hardcore speed runner, the game is still good for you even if it isnt on frontline as the arcade mode has infinate replay value and you could try and give yourself a challenge by putting the story mode on hardmode. However if you are a person that gets disinterested in things very quickly, this game is fun but not the best for you. UpdatesIf you put the game on frontline you will get very frequent game changes, update ideas, bug fixes, and other things that will have you able to play the game over and over to see what they changes and how it affects the game. For regular/non-frontline updates, you will see updates every so often, sometimes quicker than you think, but not as frequent as frontliners.Max levelThere isnt a max level and i would know becuase most are levels 30-40 while im level 35000 something. No joke.If you need any more info on the game just send me a message.			"

								This is a very well-made game, even though it's still in Early Access! I'm excited for every patch, and I love the passion put into this.I reccomend keyboard controls with it, but those get complicated after a while if you put in a LOT of spells, as is the same with using a controller.Overall, I highly reccomend this to play with some friends, especially in Story Mode! Arcade mode is just a simple, yet extremely difficult-as-it-goes kind of endless dungeon deal. You can upgrade your town(Called Arcadia) and get styles and items that can carry over to Story Mode!(My favorite has to be the Cat Ears and the Butterflies :D)The pixel art is amazing, the story is pretty funny, the characters are quite amazing, and overall it's great in my opinion! There's probably quite a few flaws, but I've yet to see any. Probably due to the rose-colored glasses I bear to these kind of games.Rating: 10/10!			"

								If you have a friend you really like playing with online, I really cant say anything else than WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? This game is wonderful, the combat is beautiful, the music is awesome, and the humour put into it actually wants you to read the text and kinda follow the plot, I was really sceptic to this game when we started and then you start to get the feel of the game.We ended up finishing the story mode that's currently out as it is early access still, and we've sat for about 8 hours if not more. The combat is very satisfying, especially with controller, I havent tried with mouse and keyboard, but with controller everything is smooth and awesome. The bossbattles are extremely wild and incredibly satisfying when you win, the battles are quite hard on normal difficulity, and when you die you dont really feel cheated or that anything is unfair, you just kinda laugh and get back at it. The graphics are a perfect 10/10 for the type of game it wants to be. beautiful particle effects, and animations. Some of the characters you meet are quite memorable, because of their attitude, or just humour. If you want something to play by yourself or with up to 4 friends , thats smooth, fun, challanging, and awesome, then this is the perfect game, and its not that expensive. I really reccommend this game even tho on the screenshots and video it might not look that extraordinary, but trust me, its fantastic. 9.5/10 from me.			"

								Possibly one of my favorite games ever. Sunk in almost 20 hours as of writing this.ᴮᵉᵉᶰ ᶰᵉᵍᶫᵉᶜᵗᶦᶰᵍ ᵒᵛᵉʳʷᵃᵗᶜʰ ᶠᵒʳ ᵗʰᶦˢSecrets of Grindea has kept my attention from the start. I had played the demo and been hyped as ever for this. Completed the current story as of build .650a and have been working on achievements as well. Currently the story isn't SUPER long. But if you don't try and rush the whole thing and take your time as well as take in the atomosphere of the game, I believe you'll really enjoy it. I spent most of my time GRINDING for cards and item drops, still missing that damn rabbits foot.On the topic of Grinding, this game has LOADS of it. But oddly enough I enjoy the grind, you feel satisfaction when you finally acquire the item you've been busting your♥♥♥♥♥♥trying to obtain.To sum up my feelings about this game. It has AMAZING potential, and I hope to be along for the entire ride as the game develops. I also really hope I have some friends that will buy this soon as it can get lonely on your own all the time. Especially when you don't have meatshields for arcade.			"

								Great art and customization (I can wear a chicken hat and have a pink rabbit follow me around everywhere?? Yes!), intriguing storyline, fun side quests and sidekicks. The only complaint I have so far is that the boss battles can be ridiculously difficult. I'm not someone who shies away from a tough boss, but I am someone who doesn't want to fight a boss twenty times in a row in order to defeat them. I think this could be remedied by offering health potions, which I'm kind of shocked Secrets of Grindea doesn't already do.			"

Little graphics and animations that add the extra flavor a great game needs. Really looking forward to the official release of this one.

								This is a fun, classic-feeling ARPG that's just as enjoyable solo as with friends, although I prefer multiplayer.  Difficulty ramps up with friends (up to 4). The game will provide 6-8 hours (curerntly as of this review) of base ""Story Mode"" content.  The temples (""dungeons"") are very well thought-out and provide adequate challenge and they also display innovative mechanics. I played through story mode with 3 players in about 7 hours, and I wish there was more or more replayabilty in story mode. ""Arcade Mode"" is a bit slow to get into, especially with friends. The replayability is there, but it's kind of a slog to get started (and re-started). I bought the 4 pack from their website; would I spend $15/per player again on this game? Probably not. It's unfortunately, at best, a ~$7 game right now. I do however recommend this as an enjoyable game.  The value, however, isn't there just yet.			"

								Amazing GAME!For anyone who has ever fell in love with a SNES RPG like Secret of Mana , Secret of Evermore , Mario RPG , Final Fantasy , Chrono Trigger .. Prepare to fall in love with Secrets of Grindea.The Graphics are nostalgic and will make you feel like a kid again playing Super Nintendo.The Story is very good and the dialogue is fairly realistic , There are some sarcastic comments from the bag that actually made me laugh , many jokes about other rpgs and how silly some quests can be .Combat is fun , a nice pet leveling system , good amount of quests and gameplay .The bosses are tough like some dark souls/World of Warcraft Bosses . They all have their own gimics and are much more than just spank and tanks like many other games . The Hydra Boss is the best example that I have seen so far. Only thing that sucks is that to play co-op offline you have to go through alot of hoops and there is no online gamefinder. Hope they change that . GET THIS GAME!			"

The game still has a long way to go, but i'm enjoying it.If you don't feel that i am right, add me on steam and we can discuss the subject in matter.			"

Cheers!Great game, but not recomending it in its current state. Played for 4-5 hours with 2 others, my girlfriend was the host. Alt-tabbed to activate skype and both myself and the other guy we were playing with crashed and lost our characters. Not in the select screen.. simply gone. I would recommend supporting the game as we had a lot of fun whilst it lasted, with funny dialogue and a promising talent/combat system like a modernized zelda title. If you don't mind the potential loss of character in multiplayer, or you are a fan of hardcore rogue-like, feel free to play now :)			"

The aiming/hit radius could be worked on a bit, and the boss battle (at the end of the game right now) is way over powered.

								If you're like me and you read game reviews before buying a game, you might be wondering why a lot of people are so massively frustrated at the lack of timely updates to this game. After playing the game, I can understand why. Secrets of Grindea is really, really good. Every single area in the game is polished to a diamond sheen. It's just a huge shame it isn't ""finished"".Pros+Great Animations and Soundtrack: I really am a fan of the animations here. While the character portraits are, in my opinion, a little offputting, the animations of the characters and enemies are top-quality and show action surprisingly well. The soundtrack is very well-made and fits the areas of the game well.+Fun Combat/Character Building: There's a lot of flexibility to the leveling system, and you don't have to fall into the Warrior/Mage/Rogue trope like many other games. The combat is fluid, and surprisingly challenging sometimes, even on normal mode.+Surprisingly funny satire: The narrative of Secrts of Grindea plays out like a satire of genres ranging from classic Legend of Zelda-likes to MMORPGs and Roguelikes. Unlike a lot of satire, however, it does this really well. Stick with the story, and don't pass it off as another edgy attempt at satire.Cons-Updates all over the place: From what I can see, development time is slow. You can access the beta, and the content in the beta is just as well-made as the rest of the game minus a few sound effects here and there. This, however, is not a lot of extra content, and the current beta maybe adds an hour-and-a-half to total gameplay time. I find it hard to be too critical of this considering the polish of the game, however.-Sometimes a bit too challenging: Some areas of the game can get hard. Like, really hard. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but due to some boss and enemy patterns, it can come down to rng more often than not. Skill will get you past it, but sometimes it can et annoying.Overall I would suggest waiting for the game to fully release, but if you're like me and don't care too much about early-access, I would recommend it.

Early Access Review
								This is a very well thought out and carefully developed game. The developers are transparent with their project and unfortunately this isn't their full time job. If you're not the type who is:A) Interested in game design from a developer's point of view via blogsB) Interested in providing imput and feedback on a game in developmentC) Patient enough to wait as long as it may take for updates or full releaseThen Secrets of Grindea may not be for you, probably best to wait for the full release because you may be disappointed. Don't get me wrong, what's been already released is great. But you'll be left wanting more, like getting a three course meal and extra long for the entree. Development issues aside, Secrets of Grindea is a combination of several action adventure titles, made into a unique experience. There's a lot of heavy influence from Secret of the Mana, but there's some Legend of Zelda, and Monster Hunter thrown in too, but in a way that meshes well to create something fun and engaging within itself.  One of the best aspects is not having a class restriction. There's three skill trees: One Handed, Two-Handed, and Magic. You can focus on one, two, or a combination of three to create your own character, fully customed to your playstyle. Throw in the three passive trees: General, Melee, and Magic and you have ways to relly make skill combinations shine. So far the favorite build I've made is a Berserker that gets a magic attack bonus from less than 50% MP that randomly deals burn damage on attack and gets a physical attack bonus on burning enemies. (There are different types of support magic, but those are still in development) The story is engaging for what's there so far. Plenty of overused RPG tropes, but done in a humorous way that pokes fun of the genre or even some twists on what you would expect. A handful of pop culture references mixed in too for lampshading purposes. It's short, sweet, fun but still a work in progress. The real draw of the game is the Arcade Mode. Pretty much a Roguelike system where you run through randomly generated dungeons with whatever kind of build you want to try. This is probably where you'll be spending most of your time after ""finishing"" story mode. It feels like a roguelike, plays like a roguelike, and is as fun/infuriating as a rogulike. Good stuff, just make sure you go through story mode to avoid any spoilers. 6/10 for what's on the table now. Most likely would get a 9-10/10 when fully released. Buy if you're interested, definitely follow it if you're curious. Just keep in mind that it's only three people with full time jobs making this game. Updates are pretty slow when compared to standards you may be used to with other Early Acess titles. Not a bad thing, just a lot of care put into development.			"

								This game has probably some of the best sprites I have ever seen. The sprite artist is amazing, the story is also pretty good.

								Amazing.Graphically the natural areas feel genuine, there is good depth to all the environments (have a loot for the various NPCs building and repairing♥♥♥♥♥♥in town. Good attention to detail) and each enemy does appear to have a unique style. There are character portraits (which is awesome) and they are actually quite good with a variety of helpful emotions. All of the animations are 10/10; really satisfying to watch which really helps to promote the depth of their combat mechanics and enemy actions.The combat system is gold. There is a variety of incredibly rewarding abilities to choose from and the devs chose a fully open point buy system with the option of point buyback at a reasonably steep cost. IT'S SO GOOD. I feel liike my decisions matter, but also that i am free to try different abilities off the list to see if i like them without being locked in forever. There are also a surprising number of ways to coordinate different abilities together so you can get fairly creative with how you build your character. Overall good music choices; they reinforce the tongue-in-cheek comedy with which the game explores classic RPG tropes but nevertheless they in themselves well composed and very appropriately selected. No complaints regarding sound effects. As you might expect the story is rather weak...then again, it's only real weakness is being predictable. Since we're following even the tropic story arcs of this games predecessors, you might expect them to seem rather generic. Again I was surprised at the amount of depth that was given each plotline within the main questline. In fact even the side-quests have a truly authentic feel to them, though mostly this is due to the lively personality of the quest-givers.Man, the puzzles are just super, super good.Yeah just buy this game and play it with a friend. It's really good now, and they are still adding stuff.			"

								This was a great game! It is still Early Access and it seems like some of the features are not implemented yet but it is really fun to to play with a friend. If you, just like me, played older pixeled games when you where younger that nowdays fill you with warmth and nostalia then I can really recommend this.If you want an unforgiving mode then you should try out melee class on hard. It is pretty short right now but the developers are still working on the story and are developing the arcade mode. For now you can just support their work and have a great time, while doing it!			"

Early Access Review
								So my wife and I just finished the story to it's current state.The game is still missing a good bit of content, but we managed to get 10 solid hours of enjoyment out of it already. Pro:- Co op seems to work pretty well, sometimes desync here and there with summons or pets, but nothing major.- We enjoy the recipes and fish collecting. Finding new pets seemed neat at first until we realized they all start at the same stats, so changing pets just sets you backwards.- Love the hats and the masks, wish you could see the different shoes on your character. - Fun story :)- The open skill system with added effects at later levels.- Love the music, very nostalgic. - The card collecting adding stats was a GREAT way to make a seeminly simple mechanic actually worth using. Cons:- Some of the boss battles feel cheap, the hydra comes to mind as they will wait to attack the only time you have to attack the one that's on the ground, so you just end up running around in circles with your thumb up your rear. - Some boss fights have attack timings that rely more on lucky character placement as you can't react fast enough to block it or avoid it. They are still fun, but we def. ended up fighting Winter like 5 times :p. - - More recipes, more gear, more skills, just need more content. Overall, both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed what this game had to offer so far, and were glad to support the developers and look forward to future updates. P.S. Grand Master Ivy is a ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

								This is exactly the kind of game I was looking for. Open World Action RPG, 2D.  Co-op/Multiplayer AvailableFull Controller Support is TRUE!Not System Heavy but still very beautiful.Crafting AbilityCustom Skill Building (your not locked into a class)I was hoping for Sandbox, but I'll be happy with a house.Skills are refundable and money is easy enough to make.  The Story Parts that have been done appear to be complete for the most part. Story Mode puts the Grind in Grindea but it's fun, and you're given skills to make grinding efficient. Then Arcade mode is more about survival, and speed. Either mode, the further you get the more powerful you can become. I usually have a bad experience with Early Access Games (developers fall of the face of the planet), so I'm really hoping this game pulls through. This game is very addicting and I'm glad I purchased it.			"

								Secrets of Grindea is what it says on the tin. A very grind happy ARPG in the vein of Secret of Mana, with cheesy humor and  all the tropes you tend to encounter in such games. Floating castles, Santa, haunted forests, and faeries all pop up, and there is a thread of story in there, though there is currently only 2 main dungeons in the game. I beat the available story mode with about 8 hours on the clock, inclusive of some grinding sessions. The main goal of grinding is hunting 'cards', which give permanent minor stat boosts. Overall, its fun enough solo, and I imagine it'd be a even better if I had played multiplayer. This game has great potential, and I hope the devs keep at it.			"

It has good graphics, the battle style is very smooth and theres yet to come from just looking at the ""upcoming"" content in the menu. Theres quite a bit of locked content for now that says coming soon so thats what I'm excited for. This game is for the skilled and I'm not one of them. Died so many times already playing on NORMAL.

								I love the older feel to this game; it reminds me of the many similar games I used to play growing up (Legend of Zelda, Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana...). It also brings a lot more creation to you for your character, allowing you to customise your appearance and choose the way you level your abilities/skills (one of the main reasons I love RPGs). Not to mention that you can play with 3 other people, who make their own unique characters too. My brother and I bought this game yesterday and have had a blast playing it together, which was quite helpful as some of the boss fights would be a real pain by myself; farming for crafting materials too.Of coarse it is still in the beta and there are a few paths that are blocked off as the next map has literally not been added to the game yet, but my concern at this point, is worry for how big this game will be; My brother and I haven't played that long (though it has been a few hours) and it appears that we are about halfway through the story. You can have up to nine characters, but there isn't a whole lot you can do different between plays (you can make it more difficault and play alone for a real challenge or try a different build for your character) and I fear I may get board once I've finished the game once or twice, but thats just me; others might like shorter games.Having said that, I have no idea what the creators plan and what plot twist there could be, which could have this game spiralling much deeper and longer than it appears; my hope is for a game at least as long as the games I mentioned above. It is in beta after all, and so far I love this game. "

								The people that created this game clearly understands what made some of the retro prgs great classics.This game manages not just to look like a cheap imitator with pixelated graphics to appeal to nostalgia, but rather it's a game with a very solid feel to it. Retro in likeness but refined to have better controls than most. Ill admit my nostalgia took me for quite a spin with SoG, reminding me a bit of some of the later made 2d zelda's as well as alttp as well as final fantasy.If you have played these types of games in the past then you know what you're getting yourself in for and I can highly reccomend this game.

								This is a very well-made game, even though it's still in Early Access! I'm excited for every patch, and I love the passion put into this.I reccomend keyboard controls with it, but those get complicated after a while if you put in a LOT of spells, as is the same with using a controller.Overall, I highly reccomend this to play with some friends, especially in Story Mode! Arcade mode is just a simple, yet extremely difficult-as-it-goes kind of endless dungeon deal. You can upgrade your town(Called Arcadia) and get styles and items that can carry over to Story Mode!(My favorite has to be the Cat Ears and the Butterflies :D)The pixel art is amazing, the story is pretty funny, the characters are quite amazing, and overall it's great in my opinion! There's probably quite a few flaws, but I've yet to see any. Probably due to the rose-colored glasses I bear to these kind of games.Rating: 10/10!			"

								CAN NOT wait for this game to be finished!  The fact that you finally aren't hindered by class restrictions is amazing.  In the game I have two(three if I count the swarm) summons and can attack with a 2Handed beast of a weapon  at the same time!  An ACTUAL FACTUAL battle mage.  The dialogue is quirky!  With a name like Grindea not even the grinding gets boring!  Bosses can be challenging, but definitely doable!  Quests aplenty, lots of characters rather than just NPCs and such a huge list of mixable skills!  So far, so good!  Here's hoping it continues in that direction!Story isn't done due to Early Access, but there's plenty of fun to be had in Multiplayer and Arcade mode.  Both are limited to friends, but there are plenty of people on the Discussion board looking for others to play with!All in all, worth the price, but with all Early Access you just have to be patient!

								This game is not finished, so if you aren't into waiting for updates, it might not be for you.That being said, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing gold. The amount of hand-crafted detail in pretty much every aspect of the game is noticeable. If you watch the dev videos on the website you can watch the guy literally hand-craft every room. As that is a lengthy process, it is going to take some time between updates, but I am into this game for the long haul. Everything it does it does with pure excellence.If you really liked what you played so far and you have the 10 bucks to spend, I would recommend spending it on the DLC just to support the game. Being an indie developer is not easy, and these guys ♥♥♥♥ing deserve it.			"

								SECRETS OF GRINDEA is a great game but its short. this game will give you about a few hours a fun gamplay and a good plot.  the game can be played with friends which its one of the games best aspects and its a action RPG             { I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME }  If you like action RPGs if you do like them then....play this under rated gem and if you do play dont slam your key board on the hydra boss,trust me Ive been there and the season temple is kinda like the water temple from LOZ if you waited a long time to get this game then you wont have to feel the pain of waiting for the full beta then you made the smart opption if your like me who bough the game before the beta then your gonna wait if you got this game and are wondering what the full beat is like then you could check out the web site in the web site there are spiolers so im warning you after this review im going back to play this game so... bye "

Early Access Review
								Great game, lots of replay value (beat it 5 times), the crafting system is on point, combat feels amazing, tons of spells to use, unique monsters, really cool bosses after the first one and an overall great expirience.Although this game excels in gameplay I don't feel very compelled by the story line, but that's probably because it's still in beta and hasn't had time to expand. So it will probably get better as the game grows.A couple things I don't like about the game is that it doesn't allow you to fight all bosses you've beaten before, it does with certain bosses that drop loot but not with others that don't, I hope this gets changed in the near future.Also a certain boss feels as if they aren't even a challange, the boss of which I'm talking about is Phaseman his attacks are fair and deal enough damage but he can't sustain enough damage to make it past he's second position, he simply dies too fast, I recommend that he's health pool should be increased dramatically. So many of he's center phase attacks I did not see until my 5th playthrough.Overall this game is pretty neato and I recomend you buy it. I currently have logged over 50 hours in offline mode on my laptop.			"

								Best purchase I've ever made on steam. This game is amazing. Think of it as Legend of Zelda (Story) Mixed with Animal Crossing or Harvest Moon (Arcade). I played this game for almost 11 hours straight the first day and loved it so much that I bought it for 2 of my friends to play with me! Probably the best game you can get on steam for under 20 dollars and I cannot wait for this game to be completed. A complete mastepiece in my opinion.			"

								A extremely stunning game! Very nice combat system, challenging bosses and magnificent mechanics. The problem I'm having is the update is way too infrequent and I'm getting a little bit impatient at this point, it took me only 4 tries to beat the Cursed Priestess. I cracked this game a year ago and decided to buy it today to support the developers. It is a well-made game but the content could be a little bit more than that.			"

								If you don't mind a grind like the title suggests, the gameplay is crisp and enjoyable, the crafting is fun, and the boss fights are challenging enough. The skillcap is high enough to feel that you can outplay most challenges. As I'm currently nearing the end of the available content (?) I think I can say that the game is already enjoyable and worth buying just to support the devs in finishing their excellent product. -Should you buy this? If you like Zelda, crafting, enjoy tight skill windows, etc, and don't mind a grindy game, then yes! -Should you not buy this? If you don't like a heavy grind. That's basically the only con in my book is it can be overly grindy at times. Strongly recommend!			"

								**Edit** The game has been updated to now fix the save file deletion issue I had. As this was my only reason for saying ""no - not in the current state"" I have now changed it to a positive review (as it always was if fully read). Cheers!Great game, but not recomending it in its current state. Played for 4-5 hours with 2 others, my girlfriend was the host. Alt-tabbed to activate skype and both myself and the other guy we were playing with crashed and lost our characters. Not in the select screen.. simply gone. I would recommend supporting the game as we had a lot of fun whilst it lasted, with funny dialogue and a promising talent/combat system like a modernized zelda title. If you don't mind the potential loss of character in multiplayer, or you are a fan of hardcore rogue-like, feel free to play now :)			"

								I love this game - I bought it specifically to play with my boyfriend and sister and love it. The aiming/hit radius could be worked on a bit, and the boss battle (at the end of the game right now) is way over powered. It would also be a good idea that if someone can't beat a battle after so many tries, the battle could be made a little easier.Over all I still love the game, and cannot wait for future updates.			"

								Nice one 9,5 of 10 points.Awesome combination of classic RPG titles with demanding fight system. Especially good that there nothing like healing potions, life regeneration or life steal. Meaning: The player needs to use the shield and evade enemy’s attacks probably in order to master the game… at least at the difficulty “hard” it is mandatory.For me, the complexity of the card- and the pet-system could be increased to give the player more flexibility to customize the character for the different kind of builds. Here some rough ideas for inspirations for the Story Mode:Card System:-	The Player is able to fight Cards more than one time. Cards are categorized in 3 different type of cards: Melee Atk, Magic Atk, Def-	The player needs to equip these cards in order to get the bonuses in a new interface-	The interface consists out of 5 columns with each 3 rows. In these columns the player can put the cards which he already has found. -	The combination of the cards in one column will result in some kind of a bonus. For Example if the player combines three “melee atk”-cards in one column, the benefits of the cards will be multiplied by the factor XX. This is only one example. The combination of 3 different types of cards should also bring an interesting bonus, for example: Increased Damage for a special Skill or something.Pet System:-	Different pets could have different kind of base stats. Depending on the characters build he will use different kind of pets. Or for example: For the pet “Gift” it takes less needed points to increase the “critical strike”-value (Luck) but instead more points to increase the life bonus.-	Pet Transformation:  Assumption: Pets can be caught more than once. On Level 10 you can combine to Pets by a percentage of XX. If the transformation succeeds the new transformed pet will be stronger than before. -	Equal to the Elite and non-elite enemies, pets can be caught as elite-version. This will be much harder (mini-game) but the base stats of the pet are higher than normal and the bonus by leveling up the pat is increased.That’s it for the rough ideas. I am sure you had some of these ideas already on your own. If some of the mechanism could be included in the game the complexity and therefore the playtime for each player will increase because especially the hardcore gamer will try to find out the best combination between builds, pets and cards I am looking forward to see and experience you upcoming work.Great job so far!Best RegardsInch "

								Amazing GAME!For anyone who has ever fell in love with a SNES RPG like Secret of Mana , Secret of Evermore , Mario RPG , Final Fantasy , Chrono Trigger .. Prepare to fall in love with Secrets of Grindea.The Graphics are nostalgic and will make you feel like a kid again playing Super Nintendo.The Story is very good and the dialogue is fairly realistic , There are some sarcastic comments from the bag that actually made me laugh , many jokes about other rpgs and how silly some quests can be .Combat is fun , a nice pet leveling system , good amount of quests and gameplay .The bosses are tough like some dark souls/World of Warcraft Bosses . They all have their own gimics and are much more than just spank and tanks like many other games . The Hydra Boss is the best example that I have seen so far. Only thing that sucks is that to play co-op offline you have to go through alot of hoops and there is no online gamefinder. Hope they change that . GET THIS GAME!			"

Works like a charm using a gamepad.- I like the asthetic of the game. Usually I don't like game with this kind of style, but the whole package just fits.Will update if something changes about my feel about the game.Update:Updateschedule seems to be a little slow at the moment (at least for the normal releases).The DevBlog is active none the less.

								I'm very excited to see more of this game! I've done what's available (up to tai meng) and so far I'm really enjoying myself! I'd reccommend having a pair of players, one focusing melee and the other focusing magic.My first and now abandoned character was a bit frustrating because I wanted to try everything but it was a learning experience. With my second character I focused on leveling a few specific skills as much as possible which made the game much more enjoyable! I prefer melee over magic, with the exception of the ice companion who I'd reccomend for any build.			"

								im just going to post a comment on how i think the game is and there is going to be some heavy feedback to the game creator.The game looks really nice i love the style they went with. the themes of the areas are weird since there is an halloween area and x-mass area so for me thats just outdated and kinda lazy to put in since its really easy to think of and really easy to make. The enemies are cool n all but they get a bit challenging if you dont grind alot to get lvles and rare drops. the dungeons are fun with puzzles and all. The bosses are fun to play but can be a bit frustrating if you get mad easy. there is not alot of replayability on the story since its the same quests over and over again. The arcade got more replayability but not so much since its really easy to die because you dont get alot of ways to heal yourself and the nurse is a damn ripoff, shes way to expensive to use but i guess that adds to the difficulty. the classes are extreamly unbalanced since 1-handed sword is the only good option if you want to do dmg, the mage needs alot of EP for the tiny amount of dmg the spells are doing since that are the only source of their dmg, they take alot of dmg because of their low armor and doesent do enough dmg for it to be worth putting your points in to. The 2-handed choice is a bit better but still underpowered since the 2-handed weapons only do 10 more dmg than the 1-handed and hits 3 times as slow tho they can hit twice as far as a 1-handed weapon wich is good for a small amount of enemies like a plant or smt. later into the game your sheild becomes to important and it breaks way to easy if you dont get a perfect block. The pets are kinda useless atm you need to fish ALOT if you want to get a tiny bonus from it, for me the pet is just in the way since sometimes i think its an enemy and just hit in the air xD. The items are cute and themebased i dont have anything against them tho the crafting system is pointless aswell in the current state of the game since you need to farm a good amount for the items when you can just get a better item in the next area.i think i got everything that i wanted, i got nothing against the game its really fun if you got friends to play with and the fact that you become a cute ghost when you die is an awsome addon. i recommend that you try the game if you have at least 1 friend to play with, i look forward to uppdates and buffs to the underpowered classes.This game at it current state get a 7/10			"

								Sometimes the bosses are hard, especially with a keyboard. Much easier to play with a controller in my opinion. (But I'm generally not good at games...)I love the art and dialogues and I can't wait for this game to be fully developed. :)			"

								Whenever i buy a game like this i'm scared i'll regret it. So i had the same doubt when i got this game.Been in love with this style for really really long but most of the times devs can't get it right... not this time tho.Pros: - The art style is adorable          - Touhou kind boss fights         - My bag is my best friend         - I can build any character i wantCons: - Gah i should have studied but ended up gaming (not even sure if this is a con ;P)Overall: I really recommend this game!

								Secrets of Grindea... What a game!So far, the storymode is amazing, well balanced and fun! It's ~7 hours long. There is also an arcade mode, which I haven't fully explored yet, but seems fun nonetheless. Controls are fairly easy altough the skills might get a bit clunky after it stacks up. Grinding is fully optional, it just provides better gear (you have to craft), also runs on a potato! Love it, keep up the good work.Recommended!			"

								This is a surprisingly fun game no matter how you play it. The adventure mode's not finished yet, but what is there works well. The rogue-like mode is challenging as well, and the option to play coop makes this a fun little game for a group. If I could make one suggestion, however, it would be an increase in the number of weapon types. Then again, this is something that will likely be addressed later.			"

								This is one of the best games I've ever played. And it's not even finished. No wonder it's taken so long for the small (3 person) team to develop. Every inch of this game is beautifully designed and animated. The dialogue is fresh and interesting, and actually funny! The combat system is fun and allows for a surprisingly deep amount of customization and specialization particularly in coop play. The monsters are all unique and have well-designed AI and combat patterns. The story and the world is the best part. It's completely immersive, colorful, and filled with life. Very few games, even AAA open world titles, create a world that you want to explore as much as Grindea. A sense of adventure is in the air. One thing is clear. The developers have made this game with LOVE.To any old Maplestory players: buy this game and when you finish it you'll have TWO games that will physically pain you to remember because nothing will ever feel the same.

								This game is really good and it has a lot of potential. the style is great and all the game mechanics feel smooth. my only problem is that this games style does not always fit the dialogue. this lighthearted but surprisingly deep game has had a few curse words in it. I was a little shocked because I did not expect that at all from this game. I would appreciate if those were removed before the official release, but the devs can do whatever they want. that is the only problem for me. everything else is great so I give it a 9/10.EDIT: After a little longer of playing I have realized that the boss fights are amazing! They are very difficult but not so difficult that you don't feel like you are making progress. I get just a little farther every time and that makes me want to keep trying till I have worked myself up to the point that I don't want to do anything until I beat the boss.			"

								i bought this game thinking it was like secret of mana.I do not regret buying this game. At first it can be a bit hard on casual player like me but it is easy to get around. The controle are great and fluid (recomend a gamepad). No class you build you player the way you like and this can give many way to attack and cast spell. So far the puzzle are great as well. The down side is that there is no healing potion or mana potion but mana charge back farely quickly and some foes drop health.I totally recomend this game.Early access Game...so far i don't see anything missing, did not find a glitch or a bug so far.

The only thing I don't like is how short the game is.  would love for it to be finished, and no longer a beta, because I got as far as you can in it, before you can't do anything else. Great game, should get out of beta soon			"

								I don't typically write reviews, so forgive me if it's a bit sloppy.I love this game. Everything about it is awesome. While it is short if you play the just the story, but its in the beta so more will come. The game takes the real time fighting if A Link to the Past with the leveling and class building of Final Fantasy and blend it into a game that when finished, will be a masterpiece. But hey, that's just my two cents.			"

								Basically it's one of those game which would have been a hit if released on the GBA  and NES consoles. I love how I can use different attacks as well as switch weapons as fast (though I would love if i could just toggle weapons with the same button,I play with a CONTROLLER,I haven't tried keyboard because I've known epic failure).Character customization is great and vanity items thankfully exist, not that i don't like the carrot sword but i'd rather have a wooden one. Surprisingly but still great and I love it, no classes like warrior, sage, mage, shaman,etc. just a free-lancer with all kinds of abilities, so make the most of it and become a unique class of your own. I'm not much of a 'craft' person but I have to admit it will take you far in the game, though I think we need more craft-able objects, I don't think you'll do ALL of them, but the material is fairly easy to procure given your 'grind'ing in the whole game. Side activities are plenty and good too( i still grinded more than doing them but they are definitely not boring, its a time to time thing).If you love the 90s versions of zelda and sword of mana. You will definitely like it. Although it's not completed yet Arcade mode is still something to die for literally in-game, something you can't miss, the story mode so far makes me feel like the updates are not enough, I went through the story but just couldn't get enough of it. I'll probably start from scratch and grind my way through the story again.I would definitely consider buying story-based dlc if ever put out in the market.Gameplay and features is all that matters to me and I got the best of both of it without the need or urge to have to m0d it like in more popular games,same genres (it's a compliment). I highly recommend it, don't download demo, buy the game, like I said, if you love zelda or sword of mana you won't regret it. "

								Solid gold.Art style is adorable, sound effects are acceptable, combat is greatly varied if a little unbalanced in favor of melee over magic (I have no doubt this will change in time), story is on par so far with much more developed rpgs and the game feel is fantastic. Im going to buy these guys a coffee and frankly you should too.EDIT: After reaching 15 hours I think I can finally bring up some constructive criticism. (1) The minigame for taming pets should display the buttons we bound attack and block to instead of just showing a symbol for attack or block, this takes an extra second for the brain to process and the game moves so fast for the higher level pets that this can lead to failure within the first sequence. (I still havent managed to catch either the bee or the present.)(2) In arcade mode health should be returned automaticly upon lvl up and this effect should be reduced depending on how many people are in your game. IE: solo = 75% per lvl, 2 people 50% and so on. This would make arcade mode much more playable in singleplayer.(3) Would love to see more items added next update. My frontline char has over 25000 gold because there is nothing for her to buy anymore. I feel uneasy about saying this but I would gladly wait patiently for more story if it ment we got new items to buy/find/craft every second update or so.(4) My last and perhaps pettiest of gripes is that arcade mode is too damn hard. Ive spent half of these 20 hours in arcade mode and ive never made it past the 6th floor. Perhaps it was designed to be played in co op mode but seeing as none of my friends own this game and there are no dedicated servers for multiplayer Im kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck. Perhaps if my second gripe is implimented this would become much less of a problem but as it stands arcade mode is a bust for me. And thats about it. Still loving the game and want to see alot more of it!			"

(make your own builds if you want!).Even if updates are few and far between, this game is a very polished for Early Access and people crap on it for slow updates.  Devs have lives too, you know.

This game is quirky and gets you involved in the story so well, I didn't even realize I started to care until a character in the game started to change in his own way. The visuals, everything is so nice to look at and the music is perfect, all I could ask for is for a time lapse and the game to be done.

I know you can go both on ATK and MATK (This make me love this).. And there is Pet system wich increase your stats by feed them but i hope there is special effect or special attack on every pet..This really bring me a nostalgia wich i've search this for a few years but this comeup and i know this about 2 years ago, love the graphic so and any effect on this game so much really <3 ..And the best about this game theres an Arcade Mode !!!

								This is a great game. It mixes all of the best characteristics of rpgs into an amazing fun-filled experience.  Character custimization is great you can play however you want.  The quests are fun, quirky, and challenging.  The game keeps the player enthralled for hours at a time.  The only cons i can think of is the slow progress of new material and the need for more side quests.			"

								I grew up playing Secret of Mana and Secret of Evermore with my brother on the old Snes and had been looking for a game that would do them justice and I can honestly say this game is it. I am not even halfway through and it is a great game in the same vein of the Secret of Mana games. Blown away with how well put together this game is. Little graphics and animations that add the extra flavor a great game needs. Really looking forward to the official release of this one. Get a gamepad for this one by the way, just doesn't play the same with a keyboard!			"

								Now, I have been severly dissapointed with the games that have come out recently. All these new games all look good, with their super realistic graphics and their ""super advanced"" combat, but for some reason I could never get invested. Now I'm not sure what it is about this game, could be the beautiful pixel graphics, or the simple but diverse skillset. But I absolutely love it, I have finished this game multiple times, Many of those times with friends. I definitely recommend playing with a few friends and just ♥♥♥♥ing around for a few hours.			"

								One of the very few Early Acess games that's actually worth it. Devs are competent, content is simplistic, yet refreshing (much like the old-school Zelda games which were good enough for your father and thus are perfect for you younger folks). Plus, sidekicks, something pretty much every other game reduces to ""Dumb character X"" but this game actually fleshes out beyond comic relief.All in all, A+ game, and worth all the money you spend on it.(but ♥♥♥♥ the present pet taming minigame)			"

								I have to admit at first I had some doubts about this game- but they were instantly all put down.Secrets of Grindea is overwhelmingly well made and well thought out, and though there is still quite a bit of work to be done, the game in general has a bunch of stellar points that make me excited for further developments.The first thing I want to say is that it's obvious how dedicated the team is to the game right off the bat due to the artwork and the story. The pixel art for everything in general is just outstanding, detailed and gorgeous, and the level to which you can customize your character makes me beyond happy! I also love how you're put into a really cool story right away, with really strong characters, who each seem to have a clear definition of who they are, and most of the time a past as well. The game runs smoothly and has a bunch of cute monsters that roam freely outside of towns as well, and an easy system for fighting, equipping weapons and using different combos with quick slots.It's a challenging game, but not too frustrating- a VERY hard balance to create.Apart from features being unfinished (which was a given, since it's early access) and a few bugs that you're warned of (fullscreen issues with some processors), I have absolutley no complaints. Well worth the money, for sure!			"

								Before you buy this game, there are large portions of the game not finished, if you intend to complete the game; wait on this.I completed my first run through on normal in about 4-6 hours. I'm not playing through on Hard, which by the way is really hard for those who enjoy a solid challenge mode.If you enjoyed games such as Secret of Mana, Legend of Zelda LTTP, and Diablo 2, this game might be for you. The combat works like the former games while the character builder works more like an action RPG. With a large variety of spells and melee abilities, part of the fun of this game is working on builds and seeing which ones work and which fail miserably.The shining point of this game is the combat and character building, so if you enjoy those things you might consider a purchase.The story is solid, the comical parts are funny, and you get just the right amount of information so that the cutscenes (which are all skippable) aren't too long, nor are you confused as to why you're doing something.The puzzles I've found hard rather difficult late in the game, practically one that requires you to build a bridge, with a limited amount of pieces, to cross the room. The crossing of the room is rather easy, figuring out how to get the extra item however is a real challenge that took quite a while to figure out.The boss designs are good too. With solid boss mechanics that are hard to the point where when you first face a boss you think “how is this possible?” But then is really satisfying once you complete it. Really this game has few flaws besides not being completed. Once it is done, it could easily be one of the best Action RPGs ever.			"

								I suck at reviews but yoloFriendly reminder for any and all Early Access Games: Before you purchase, observe the time it takes for them to dish out updates with some sort of new content. 100% completion is fairly easy due to the game... not being completed. If you dislike arcade mode, dislike speedrunning games for fun, and/or already have 100% completion, then this game will simply collect dust in your library until a new update comes out in which will probably equate to only an hour or so of fresh new content. Cheats are available if you desire due to the game still being ""tested"". The grinding aspect is there, but since it's an incomplete game, it truly doesn't take very long compared to if you've played a game like.. uh, Runescape and are experienced in the art of RNG drops.Take from this what you will and decide for yourself.

								Truely a hidden gem.This is one of the only actually Early Access games out there on steam, No scumbaggery here at all.I would recommend buying it if you don't care about waiting a few more years for its completion (It would take this long since the dev team are just 3 people, and the polish the hell out of EVERYTHING they do in this game, so it makes sense why it would take this long.)Currently the game gives you about 15 hours of gameplay which to be honest is totally worth it. 15 dollars=15 hoursIf you don't want to pay for an unfinished game because you can't wait I wouldn't recommend this to you.

								Classic style RPG filled with challenging puzzles and boss fights, an interesting combat system, and an addictive soundtrack. The co-op is amazing, and runs very smoothly with the new Steam connectivity patch, no more direct IP and port forwarding nonsense. The combat is clean, and challenging. You can't just hack and slash your way through dungeons. You have to think about your foes weaknesses and your strengths and play on that. The boss fights themselves can sometimes be considered a puzzle. Overall the storyline is fairly average(and at this moment incomplete), but the creators have put a lot of effort in making sure the dialogue is complete and and have even slipped in some comedy to give you a laugh every once in awhile.Good game overall with lots of potential, can’t wait to see what comes next!

								I've been playing for about 2 hours at this point, but wow I am impressed! This game reminds me of the SNES type action-RPG's that I loved growing up. While the game is still in development, I can't wait to see how it shapes up. For anyone who is thinking of buying this, it is important to note that there are two servers. The first is the stable server that you get access to with initial purchase. This is the one I started playing on before I realized there was another server: Frontline. Which is the beta server and has the latest updates and much more content.So far this game is exactly what I've been looking for in a ""retro"" style game. Currently 5/5. Will adjust score when game is released as a finished product.			"

I'd reccommend having a pair of players, one focusing melee and the other focusing magic.My first and now abandoned character was a bit frustrating because I wanted to try everything but it was a learning experience. With my second character I focused on leveling a few specific skills as much as possible which made the game much more enjoyable! I prefer melee over magic, with the exception of the ice companion who I'd reccomend for any build.			"

								Absolutely love this game. I wasn't sure, at first, if I would like it though. But once I started playing? I can't stop! I keep creating new characters so I can start fresh when I get my friends to start playing. Been telling people all about it! So ready for more to come out, but understand that it takes time. I'm just so impatient!!! Noticed a few minor glitches/issues, but completely understandable due to being in beta still. If you are joining someone else's game, you have to from the get-go (meaning: before they even start their game: thus at the invite screen when hosting a game). You can not jump in mid-game or there will be issues (screen freezing, health bar stretching across screen, screen resolution messed up, major lag, unable to charge powers, etc). Also, if you are joining a game and you are fighting monsters from/or in the Haunted Forest, you get X and Y (what look like coordinates) in your text/chat box. A little upset over the chances of getting a card, but that makes me play the game more TO get cards. Overall though, I HIGHLY recommend this game for others. It may be in beta, but with the amount of game play time and the story line/plot and just how much fun it is... it's totally worth it! Please! If you're even CONSIDERING buying this game, please do! It's worth it, I promise! Plus, the more people buy the beta, the better it helps the developers/builders of this game. GO PIXEL FERRETS!!!!			"

								It's a good game and I would recommend, mainly if you like the 2d Zelda games.I feel that the number of skills available are pointless, though. Some of them are too similar, and for me there is no point in leveling several skills because you will use only two or three of them in battle. In the end, it looks like the producers had an ambitious view on their skilling tree, which does not meet the expectation in the actual gameplay. It may change when the final version is released, but would be a surprise for me.			"

								Truely a hidden gem.This is one of the only actually Early Access games out there on steam, No scumbaggery here at all.I would recommend buying it if you don't care about waiting a few more years for its completion (It would take this long since the dev team are just 3 people, and the polish the hell out of EVERYTHING they do in this game, so it makes sense why it would take this long.)Currently the game gives you about 15 hours of gameplay which to be honest is totally worth it. 15 dollars=15 hoursIf you don't want to pay for an unfinished game because you can't wait I wouldn't recommend this to you.

								This game is not finished, so if you aren't into waiting for updates, it might not be for you.That being said, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing gold. The amount of hand-crafted detail in pretty much every aspect of the game is noticeable. If you watch the dev videos on the website you can watch the guy literally hand-craft every room. As that is a lengthy process, it is going to take some time between updates, but I am into this game for the long haul. Everything it does it does with pure excellence.If you really liked what you played so far and you have the 10 bucks to spend, I would recommend spending it on the DLC just to support the game. Being an indie developer is not easy, and these guys ♥♥♥♥ing deserve it.			"

								A meal in one long ""taste test"" session, but unlike Delver, it still appears to hold promise of completion.But I will review it as is, anyway.What can I say? It gives off a smell that reminds you of your younger days, mixed in with a smell that promises freedom.When you take a bite, it's not bad at all. Although its name is related to the exercise of ""Grinding"" in most RPGs and it makes references to it, you'll be grinding the night away, with it's systems designed to make grinding less of a chore.You can also choose to challenge yourself in the ""Hard"" mode. This mode will make you suffer, but you will also feel much more rewarded afterwards, the taste of victory oh so sweeter.There's also an arcade mode, a delve into a more ""arcade-y"" meal. You've only got one life and you have to make it as far as possible. It also gives rewards to the main story, if you want an excuse to taste this mode.			"

								I am a big fan of top-down RPG games and this is one of the best ones I've played in a long time, even in early access. Everything they make has as much, if not more, polish than some titles from major developers and is made by a three-man team. If you are hesitant to buy it because it is unfinished take comfort in this; everything they put out in the updates is incredibly well done and I've never experienced a bug.If you are curious you should check out the dev blog, lot's of info into the develpment of it all layed out pretty well!

								I like this game, I do, but why is it still in early access? It's been a couple years since it's been in the works. It feels like it will never be completed. Also, multiplayer is the laggiest thing I've ever experienced and sometimes we lose just because it's so laggy. Occasionally, single player mode is also laggy, but not as much as online.If the game wasn't so fun, cute, and creative, I wouldn't recommend it.			"

								This game really harkens back to the days of Secret of Mana, one of my favorite RPGs growing up.  Thankfully, an easier menu system than that game.  I've been looking for an enjoyable 2D RPG for some time as it seems like most game devs have all but abandoned the genre (yes, it's a genre, not a technical limitation).  So far, I'm really enjoying the flow of the game.  I'm fairly excited to play more of it.  Story is cheeky and fun.  Mr. Bag is hilarious.  Looking forward to throwing more time into this game.Great work, devs, you've made this guy happy.			"

								I would definetly reccomend this game, but $15 is a bit steep, it's been in dev for 4+ years and it only gives you about 3-4 hours of story line gameplay *solo*, the best weapon in the game you get an entire dungeon before the end dungeon so it lacks some things. Aside from that, it's a very fun game to grind whether you just wanna spam adventure mode or beat the game.			"

								This is a very well-made game, even though it's still in Early Access! I'm excited for every patch, and I love the passion put into this.I reccomend keyboard controls with it, but those get complicated after a while if you put in a LOT of spells, as is the same with using a controller.Overall, I highly reccomend this to play with some friends, especially in Story Mode! Arcade mode is just a simple, yet extremely difficult-as-it-goes kind of endless dungeon deal. You can upgrade your town(Called Arcadia) and get styles and items that can carry over to Story Mode!(My favorite has to be the Cat Ears and the Butterflies :D)The pixel art is amazing, the story is pretty funny, the characters are quite amazing, and overall it's great in my opinion! There's probably quite a few flaws, but I've yet to see any. Probably due to the rose-colored glasses I bear to these kind of games.Rating: 10/10!			"

								Interested? Read This First!ContentIt really depends on how you play it. I lke to call myself a beta tester even though im not and i dedicated my time to try and collect all items. Still havent done it though and ive put nearly 50 hours into the game. If you are a person who likes to collect things, try to find interesting exploits and glitches, then the game is perfect for you if you put it on frontline. If you are a hardcore speed runner, the game is still good for you even if it isnt on frontline as the arcade mode has infinate replay value and you could try and give yourself a challenge by putting the story mode on hardmode. However if you are a person that gets disinterested in things very quickly, this game is fun but not the best for you. UpdatesIf you put the game on frontline you will get very frequent game changes, update ideas, bug fixes, and other things that will have you able to play the game over and over to see what they changes and how it affects the game. For regular/non-frontline updates, you will see updates every so often, sometimes quicker than you think, but not as frequent as frontliners.Max levelThere isnt a max level and i would know becuase most are levels 30-40 while im level 35000 something. No joke.If you need any more info on the game just send me a message.			"

								Legend of Zelda a link to the past + many other old school games with a pretty good amount of comedy involved. I mean really it doesn't get much better than that. There's still work being done from time to time, but in my opinion this is a fun and challenging game, the more people, the tougher the enemies become. And frankly, that's where this game shines, its multi-player aspect. Though, don't let that hold you back, because even playing this one player, it's more than worth it. I don't have a lot of hours invested yet, but that's mostly due to personal things that just get in the way of game time. But for the short amount of hours I have put in, I can say the moment my friends and I are available to jump back in, we plan to do so. Old school style gameplay mixed in with rpg and parody just equals out to awesome.			"

								I like it alot. Zelda like action rpg. Writing is good, times funny. .. Game mechanic is good. It is classless so you can build your own hero. Gameplay is good. I like the roguelite addition. I like the collecting aspect. They have pet system (still in its infancy .. 4 pets so far). Rare card drops that give you boot effects.Unfortunately it is still in early access. Story is not yet complete. Skill balance still need some work (2handed seems underpowered due to lack of gear progression).BUT, I am super excited for them to release the next part of the story. I still cant get enough of it.Might roll a new character focused on magic now.  Unfortunately 4 magic combat types to choose from (fire, ice, air, earth).. then there is the incomplete support magic.			"

Early Access Review
A blend of scott pilgrim and Diablo 2Note: This entire review is from playing story mode by myself. I haven't tried multiplayer and arcade mode I've only tried a small amount, so realize this isn't the most complete review.Pros:The game has an action rpg feel with it's talent trees and skills that is like diablo 2/torch light. There's alot of depth here for you to customize your hero into a full warrior or a mage or a hybrid of the two. The retro look makes it seem easier to pick upAs you go deeper into the game the boss fights become more challenging, to the point where I can almost guarantee that you'll die by the 4th or 5th bossThere's a crafting system that reminds me of dragonquest XIII, it's pretty dope. You take misc. items and you combine them to form stronger swords, shields, etc.Cons:The story seems like a parody of other games, many bosses are references to old games and anime like a gundam boss and things similar. And the title of the game itself, Secrets of ""Grindea"", is a reference to grinding, or hours of constantly doing monotonous tasks in mmorpgs in order to get something. Many of the cities like EverGrind are references like this too. You can definitely see where the creators drew inspiration and they take alot of time to give nod to that but I also wish that they'd take their own story and lore a bit more serious. Admittedly I haven't really taken the time to read much of the chat boxes but that's the impression I get from some of the bosses and atmosphere. Some of the spells feel lackluster at first and I find myself constantly respeccing my hero.Would I recommend it?I would to someone who's already a fan of a scott pilgrim beat em up or like diablo 2/torchlight type of action rpg or someone who's into games like the older zelda games like link to the past. For $6-$10 I think this game is well worth the price. There are promised updates with more dungeons in the future which I'm really looking forward to. I'm only level 13-14 at the time of this review and not even close to finishing all of the content, there's definitely enough content and grinding to keep a player in the game until updates arrive.

								Great little RPG that can give you quite a bit of fun and a lot of hours of gameplay. The combat is very good, fluid and doesn't make you ""get caught in animation"" with that said, you can miss attacks if not facing the same way as the enemy. This can make things a bit difficult in tight spots, however the blocking system works really well.All in all this game is great, you wont regret buying it, full price or on sale (which I have yet to see it do) however I have one caution for any buyer....****DO NOT BUY THIS ON STEAM!********You're missing out on a free DRM free copy!! Thats right, if you buy this here you don't have access to the DRM free copy, but if you buy it through either Secrets of Grindea's website, or on Humble Bundle's site they give you access to both the Steam key and a DRM free copy! So DO NOT BUY HERE! Or you're forced to miss out on that free copy. Hope you find as much fun in this little title as I have.			"

								This game is amazing and anyone who loves RPG's should buy it immediately. Seriously. I haven't been this into a game in a long time and i'm currently sitting at 93% completion with all but arcade mode done. Will get around to arcade mode soon though haha. But trying to get all the monster cards and crafting all the equipment and also finding every item that each monster drops is fun and I'll be waiting around for more content to be added.Only complaint I have is I wish there was more released right now haha. Though I just finally completed as much as I feel I can right now. Arena I have A's on both and I want that next hat but S ranking both of them feels a tad out of reach for me right now.			"

								Currently, I'm about 7 hours into this great game.  Talk about a refreshing one! Lately, I've been having a hankering for some nostalgia, but at the same time I really didn't want to play something I've already played before. This game was able to satisfy both of those aspects for me. While it is still in beta, this game actually really stands up for itself! Customizeable characters (hair style, hair color, skin color, scarf color, shirt color, and pants color), hack and slash, level up system, upgradeable skills, crafting, clever dialogue, addicting gameplay, and difficult bosses keep you addicted as you realize you've lost a few hours of your life. No ragrats!			"

								This game was purchased to me by a friend, we played it together. It's (as the name suggests) kinda grind reliant, the grinding itself is pretty fun though! Monsters/enemies are well-made. Good aesthetics, not too easy and not too difficult. There's plenty of secrets and tricks to discover as well.The crafting system is actually pretty decent, it's quite easy to figure out, though there's no information saying ""item dropped by X"" - You kinda have to remember which enemy drops what, but the names are quite relatable!I've played it solo as well and can be fun, but I think with good company it's more enjoyable, although you'll have to fight for loot haha! (loot settings can be altered by host)I'd recommend this game if you like exploring and crafting. Not to mention the art style is incredibly cute :) (reminds me of Maple Story)			"

								Well, if you loved your golden years playing Legend of Zelda, Secret of Mana and Chrono Trigger (like I did), this game will blow your mind. Well made battle system, a level up layout that lets be from a classic warrior/mage/support(so far the supp tree is incomplete) to a battlemage/a sick 2H barbarian/or a flippin ninja, keeping it well balanced and tight. The world is beatiful, nostalgic pixel-art world and kinda anime-ish sprite characters. It has so much potential to be one of the best rpgs of the recent times, been an 	organic mix of old and new.

								Really fun and very addicting game! Also pretty underrated as I dont see this game get a lot of attention. This game is a nice throwback to old school RPGs and plays like a zelda/secret of mana type of game. This game is still in early access and not finished however I highly recommend this game still because you can get plenty of hours of gameplay trying to collect every card, discover every monster/item, and also the main quest itself which is a great storyline, plus CRAFTING. It also has an unforgiving roguelike arcade mode which is very challenging. Did I also mention you can explore grindea with friends? I havent played the game coop yet but will eventually with my best friend but if you have friends to play this game with, you can do that too! Support the developers of this game!			"

								Fun game  I really like it but sence this game is still in EA (Early Access) and it takes a while for updates/new quest to come out i thought mabey you can have a quest that is really grindy so while we wait for the new missons and areas to come out we can level up our player and get stronger and the quests be so grindy like actuly having to kill 10,000 pumpkins and get half the EXP bar full or somthing or get 20 apples in 10 minutes and other things like that so when the next part of the story comes out we dont have to grind to beat that part wewould have already done it but ither way i give this game 5/5 water bottles			"

								Tight controls and a solid aesthetic make this game easy to jump into.Combat is slightly twitch based. Precision blocking is rewarded and many of your skills can be charged up for greater effect. Difficulty isn't derived from ridiculous controller-based stunts but instead from tight positioning and timing requirements.That being said, bosses provide just the right level of challenge and punish you severely enough to making mistakes.All in all I give it an 8.5/10. Great game, if you liked SNES ARPGs like Secret of Mana and Legend of Zelda you will love this.			"

								Delightful high quality retro RPG. Feels satisfying and easy-ish, but has a high skill ceiling. The grinding is optional in a very  natural and enjoyable way, appealing to the completionist or to the attentive player who might want to craft a couple of things along the way to make their life easier, while being entirely possible to just brute force through the storyline and ignore all the pesky reading. Hard mode is *actually* hard, at least at the bosses, and so is Arcade mode which is really more of a roguelite.			"

All these new games all look good, with their super realistic graphics and their ""super advanced"" combat, but for some reason I could never get invested. Now I'm not sure what it is about this game, could be the beautiful pixel graphics, or the simple but diverse skillset. But I absolutely love it, I have finished this game multiple times, Many of those times with friends. I definitely recommend playing with a few friends and just ♥♥♥♥ing around for a few hours.			"

								         Well, I picked this up thinking, I have some time off and don't want to get too involved in anything and this seems like it could fit the niche.  I'm not positive how far into the game I currently am but it's been about 5 hours of entertainment ( i've actually been more entertained in the past 5 hours than almost my entire play through of Fallout 4).           The ""STORY"" my gaming jesus  so far the little tid bits of what i'll call lore for now, are spaced well and very attractive to anyone who likes story heavy games.  The way the story is being told and the humor is very satisfying.  Giving you enough slack to enjoy bashing in enemies faces while at the same time being 100% ready to get right back into whichever quest you were up to when you decided to stop and ""grindea"" few levels out ;D .         The ""ART STYLE"" is fairly simple and ""old school"" classic indie.  I can't complain though considering it allows all varieties of computers to play it aswell as not degrading the quality of the gameplay itself.  They also do a decent job at making the variants of objects reasonably refreshing in their surroundings.         The ""COMBAT MECHANICS"" aren't overwhelming, timing is key, patterns exist in most cases (which typically require a decent amount of focus to manipulate). Although the spell casting can be very frustrating with keybind locations.  Personally I would avoid a heavy attack magic play (unless they format it to work more effectivly in the final game).  Overall it feels pretty fluid.         The ""CHARACTERS"" some of them are steriotypical but they fill the rolls they hold very well and give most players a comfortable feeling from the homefront foward.  Some of them (so far) have had decent story driven developement and I look foward to finishing the game to see their full fruiting when I can finish this game.        ""OVERALL"" So far i'll give this game a solid 7.6/10 (For it's genre and from a single player only unfinished playthrough experience).  It is, however, still in Beta.  Meaning the More people who try this game (and hopefully enjoy it) will give it the opprotunity to finish developement at a reasonable pace and fund the developers.*SUBNOTES-I don't usually bother writing reviews since they can be a dime a dozen with most overly hyped games or just mass playerbase games that I commonly find myself playing to pass time.  I apologize if my format isn't visually pleasing, if I made any spelling/grammar mistakes, or if it wasn't in depth enough to make you atleast want to try the game (though you seriously should atleast look into trying it c: ).

								Before you buy this game, there are large portions of the game not finished, if you intend to complete the game; wait on this.I completed my first run through on normal in about 4-6 hours. I'm not playing through on Hard, which by the way is really hard for those who enjoy a solid challenge mode.If you enjoyed games such as Secret of Mana, Legend of Zelda LTTP, and Diablo 2, this game might be for you. The combat works like the former games while the character builder works more like an action RPG. With a large variety of spells and melee abilities, part of the fun of this game is working on builds and seeing which ones work and which fail miserably.The shining point of this game is the combat and character building, so if you enjoy those things you might consider a purchase.The story is solid, the comical parts are funny, and you get just the right amount of information so that the cutscenes (which are all skippable) aren't too long, nor are you confused as to why you're doing something.The puzzles I've found hard rather difficult late in the game, practically one that requires you to build a bridge, with a limited amount of pieces, to cross the room. The crossing of the room is rather easy, figuring out how to get the extra item however is a real challenge that took quite a while to figure out.The boss designs are good too. With solid boss mechanics that are hard to the point where when you first face a boss you think “how is this possible?” But then is really satisfying once you complete it. Really this game has few flaws besides not being completed. Once it is done, it could easily be one of the best Action RPGs ever.			"

								Secrets of Grindea is an RPG with real time combat like Zelda,and is fun to play with or without a friend,which is really rare on RPG with MP games.Pros:*No class restrictions (you can be a fire mage with a cloud and a ice friend protecting you,i'm serious)*Puzzles,LOADS of puzzles,and you will need some time to think about some.*Character creation,not much to talk about here,move along.*Regions. They can vary from a city to a spoopy forest,and they are all fun!*Combat,mixing skills,making awesome combos,and crafting another weapon to be stronger,REPEAT!*Pixel art is great!*The Story. The characters are lovable,and with time you will change your opinion about some,also,there's some plot twists here,funny jokes there,and TONS of sarcasm.*Cards,or Monster Cards if you like,are rare drops from enemies,if you got a card from a enemy,it will give you a random bonus and a cute artwork from the enemy you killed,which is ALWAYS a plus in my book.*Soundtrack is good*Balanced (at least on normal mode),like the Yetis are MADE to tank your attacks,and some other enemies are made to be annoying.*Easy to connect to MP through Steam and AWSOME controller support.*THE EASTER EGGS!!!!!! I managed to find a Triforce near the pile of gold in the flashback sequence!!!! :D*You can replay bosses to get more loot from them,well,everyone but...Cons:*You can't replay Winter's or the Mt. Bloom boss fights,I mean,the Winter boss was one of the most fun boss battles I ever saw,even if it didn't drop ANY loot,I would be playing it for ages,not for the Mt. Bloom boss fights,but they could have some extra loot and the replay feature anyway :|*GRINDING,and i'm not a fan of it.It's not just walking in circles to begin a battle,you have to kill ALL enemies in the room to spawn another wave of enemies,although this sistem is great,it's boring to get the action going.*The crafting system could be improved,like seeing the item kinda faded away,because my friend thought the ''red emmiter matrix'' was a calendar,that's right A CALENDAR. And there's not enough recipies...*Not even at level 10 (max level of skills) my Frosty Friend could kill a Rabby in 1 hit,and a Rabby is the second enemy in the game,and it has ≅ 120 HP.*The cards are just TOO rare to make it fun to grind,and it's based around luck too,so just to get a Jumpkin card,I had to stop my playthrough over how boring it was to get a 0,5% of card drop,to try again the other day :|*The ''character portraits'' (the picture that appears when you talk to a character) are bad,they aren't pixelated,witch isn't that bad for itself,but they look more like a photo that has been glued there,the quality is horrible too.Final Veredict:9/10It's a really fun game to play alone or with friends,if you like an ARPG I would recommend buying it.It also has a Talking Bag...Did I say there was a Talking Bag yet??

								Absolutely love this game. I wasn't sure, at first, if I would like it though. But once I started playing? I can't stop! I keep creating new characters so I can start fresh when I get my friends to start playing. Been telling people all about it! So ready for more to come out, but understand that it takes time. I'm just so impatient!!! Noticed a few minor glitches/issues, but completely understandable due to being in beta still. If you are joining someone else's game, you have to from the get-go (meaning: before they even start their game: thus at the invite screen when hosting a game). You can not jump in mid-game or there will be issues (screen freezing, health bar stretching across screen, screen resolution messed up, major lag, unable to charge powers, etc). Also, if you are joining a game and you are fighting monsters from/or in the Haunted Forest, you get X and Y (what look like coordinates) in your text/chat box. A little upset over the chances of getting a card, but that makes me play the game more TO get cards. Overall though, I HIGHLY recommend this game for others. It may be in beta, but with the amount of game play time and the story line/plot and just how much fun it is... it's totally worth it! Please! If you're even CONSIDERING buying this game, please do! It's worth it, I promise! Plus, the more people buy the beta, the better it helps the developers/builders of this game. GO PIXEL FERRETS!!!!			"

								After 20+ hours i can confidently say this game has me hooked. So far only played single player and am really enjoying it. The story and characters are rather cute and funny which is a nice change of pace from new age games and quite reminiscent of an old school RPG atmsophere. The puzzles are also well done. There was a few moments in the in the Fae forest that were top notch and had me thinking the whole time going in between back and forth desperately trying to figure out what to do. The combat is also very enjoyable. Very rarely can you just ""go ham"" and often you have to think before attacking. Boss fights actually being a challenge and needing strategy is a huge deal to me. AS for a score not sure what i grade it its good but i dont know if its that good. If this game gets some more content a littel more balancing and some final polish 10/10 easy. As is, I have to rate it a 7/10 due to lack of content and a few balancing issues, If they fill out that support tree make that a 8/10 (biased mage player here XD). Support is a staple to co-op play in any game so it will be nice to see what they will add. I must say i dont know how a healer or heal skills would be implemented but it would be nice for someone to be able to play ""Team Mom"" keeping everyone healthy and buffed. Maybe a regen over time heal or something. So my final call if u dont mind spendning the money and it looks decent to you then by all means go ahead. Its fun, but short, yet retains a very unique style you won't find elsewhere. As someone playing the game atm my final call is please go buy and help them finsh the game. It is truly a masterpiece just in need of some more content. If you really enjoy the game remember theres a hat dlc you can buy to help support the devs as well.			"

And above all else, it's very addicting.The only CON's i could think of while playing was that first off, the graphics aren't that great, and sometimes gives of a little bit of a Facebook game vibe, and second, there's not much content to it now. So if you like what you've seen from screenshots and videos, and don't mind sticking around while more content roles in, that you shoulde definitely buy this game.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is very promising. It may be early access but don't let that deter you as it has tons of content to keep you interested. If you're a fan of games like Final Fantasy, the Legend of Zelda, Fantasy Life or other similar RPG games you'll find joy here. The 4th Wall is something it likes to smash down quite often as you'll come across many Easter Eggs and reference, one being the Triforce laying on the ground or a character mentioning ""/"" commands. Secrets of Grindea knows it's a video game and uses that to it's pleasure since it allows it to make tons of jokes. Heck you start out from a town called ""Startington"". The characters are also quite pleasing to meet. Your father has a backstory and a driving motive that I find interesting to explore, as you plung further into the game his past is opened up to a point where you realize you aren't the only character of importance running around Grindea. The games controls seemed odd to me at first but I later came to admire how well they work. The arrow keys act as your movement while Z & X are your sword and shield. You have items and skills linked to the A,S,D,F,G,Q,W,E,R,T keys which can each be rebinded. I tried to change them around but I find it much more comfortable to use the defaults. I definitely recommend this game to any fans of RPGs and in-game collecting.			"

								Classic style RPG filled with challenging puzzles and boss fights, an interesting combat system, and an addictive soundtrack. The co-op is amazing, and runs very smoothly with the new Steam connectivity patch, no more direct IP and port forwarding nonsense. The combat is clean, and challenging. You can't just hack and slash your way through dungeons. You have to think about your foes weaknesses and your strengths and play on that. The boss fights themselves can sometimes be considered a puzzle. Overall the storyline is fairly average(and at this moment incomplete), but the creators have put a lot of effort in making sure the dialogue is complete and and have even slipped in some comedy to give you a laugh every once in awhile.Good game overall with lots of potential, can’t wait to see what comes next!

								If you don't mind a grind like the title suggests, the gameplay is crisp and enjoyable, the crafting is fun, and the boss fights are challenging enough. The skillcap is high enough to feel that you can outplay most challenges. As I'm currently nearing the end of the available content (?) I think I can say that the game is already enjoyable and worth buying just to support the devs in finishing their excellent product. -Should you buy this? If you like Zelda, crafting, enjoy tight skill windows, etc, and don't mind a grindy game, then yes! -Should you not buy this? If you don't like a heavy grind. That's basically the only con in my book is it can be overly grindy at times. Strongly recommend!			"

								FUN AND EASY I was looking for a game to play co-op with a friend. The Co-op part is really easy to set up. With in minutes of starting the game we were able to play with each other. I did notice that every once in a while we did have a lag point, but only like once ever hour. It wasn't so bad that we could play.  Game play is easy to do with a keyboard, but recommend using a controller.  Friend found it so much better that way.  Only bad part of the game I would say is,...  they have a fishing part included and you can lose hours just doing that. Also we ran into some areas that haven't been implemented yet, so it's sad that we can't play it yet,but it dose give us something to look forward to.			"

								I was worried about the content as this game is in beta but it's surprisingly full! Sure, you run out of main story between 8-12 hours but the arcade mode is very very fun! It has quests within itself and is highly entertaining! I finished what the main story line has currently in about 10 hours while doing some side quests along the way and as you can see, I've put over 25 hours into the full game. I continually go into arcade mode to play about an hour a day just to have some fun. My only issue is that the multiplayer option on our arcade mode didn't work so my partner and I couldn't play together but that may have been a computer issues and not a game issue. Overall, definitely worth the money and fun to play!			"

								I like this game a lot and i think it has amazing potential.I like the fact you can really personalize your characters abilities and paths.I like the art style as wellSome challenging bosses which is goodBUT if youre looking to buy this and play it for the next month straight then hold your horses. I love this game and recommend it but it still has SO far to go until its a complete game. as you can see ive played it for about 15 hours and ive beated the story line with 3 different characters. Granted I didnt do TOO many side quests. I think the game will get even better in time but its just... exactly what you should expect from an early access game. once that little message popped up saying ""the rest of the story is still being developed"" i was like..... ""oh, so soon?"" but it was a good ride and i cant wait for it to be updated more.			"

The story's pretty good, albeit pretty short, allowing you to grind for more XP and cards and whatnot.

								What we've seen so far is great, and I look forward to 5 or 6 years from now when this game might actually be nearing completion, but seriously, SoG is pretty much the definition of everything that's wrong with Early Access. lolI mean it's still a fun game, and worth it for the price, but man it is taking a while.

								This is a very well-made game, even though it's still in Early Access! I'm excited for every patch, and I love the passion put into this.I reccomend keyboard controls with it, but those get complicated after a while if you put in a LOT of spells, as is the same with using a controller.Overall, I highly reccomend this to play with some friends, especially in Story Mode! Arcade mode is just a simple, yet extremely difficult-as-it-goes kind of endless dungeon deal. You can upgrade your town(Called Arcadia) and get styles and items that can carry over to Story Mode!(My favorite has to be the Cat Ears and the Butterflies :D)The pixel art is amazing, the story is pretty funny, the characters are quite amazing, and overall it's great in my opinion! There's probably quite a few flaws, but I've yet to see any. Probably due to the rose-colored glasses I bear to these kind of games.Rating: 10/10!			"

								So. i have some pretty base-ground to tell this...THIS GAME IS AWESOMEPros: ~-Co-op up to 4 people-One of the best skill leveling systems I ever saw on a RPG (or ARPG)-Grinding is not necessary-Super Exiting boss-fights (That you can repeat if you want)-Mind-Breaking Puzzles-Difficulty modes (I NEED A 0-DEATH MODE DEVS)-Awesome Music-Tons of Sidequests/Activities-Arcade Mode (random loot drops/bosses/floors)-Battle Arena (Where you can battle with or agaisnt your friends in some wacky mini-games)-A pet systemCons:-Only 50% of the story is finished by the time i'm writing this-Some bosses can't be repeated (SPOILER: Winter, the Hydras, etc...)-Grinding is not needed but it helps a LOT (card drops)I recommend to get this game, but in a more advanced state. The game still has a long way to go, but i'm enjoying it.If you don't feel that i am right, add me on steam and we can discuss the subject in matter.			"

Early Access Review
								I suck at reviews but yoloFriendly reminder for any and all Early Access Games: Before you purchase, observe the time it takes for them to dish out updates with some sort of new content. 100% completion is fairly easy due to the game... not being completed. If you dislike arcade mode, dislike speedrunning games for fun, and/or already have 100% completion, then this game will simply collect dust in your library until a new update comes out in which will probably equate to only an hour or so of fresh new content. Cheats are available if you desire due to the game still being ""tested"". The grinding aspect is there, but since it's an incomplete game, it truly doesn't take very long compared to if you've played a game like.. uh, Runescape and are experienced in the art of RNG drops.Take from this what you will and decide for yourself.

								Truely a hidden gem.This is one of the only actually Early Access games out there on steam, No scumbaggery here at all.I would recommend buying it if you don't care about waiting a few more years for its completion (It would take this long since the dev team are just 3 people, and the polish the hell out of EVERYTHING they do in this game, so it makes sense why it would take this long.)Currently the game gives you about 15 hours of gameplay which to be honest is totally worth it. 15 dollars=15 hoursIf you don't want to pay for an unfinished game because you can't wait I wouldn't recommend this to you.

								It's good, the grinding is more fun than other game and doesn't get boring; the story so far is amazing with good dungeon and area design with some cool side quests and the bosses are challenging.As far as I know you can only obtain healing potions in the arcade, I'm fine with this because with healing items the main game would be way too easy.My only real complaint about this game is CHICKENS! I hate in the arcade mode when you get the mission 'Herd the Chickens!' because the chickens just don't care - you wack them into the barn and they decide to walk off the other way or what happens to me a lot is you hit them into the barn but they a few pixels off the door and they just run around the back.I have only had just over an hour on the arcade and one playthrough of what there is at the moment story-wise, but it's great fun!Obviously, if you hate early access don't buy it as the developers are only taking it out when its 100% done			"

								This game is very good. Has everything an RPG needs - slimes, swords and a broken keyboard due to rage. The storyline is really interesting and kept me hooked.There are some things that could be changed/added:1. Movement: we need to attack diagonally. I know this game is supposed to be old school, but firing projectiles is annoying.2. More weapons and armour3. Better bonuses for when you max out a skill or talent4. More hairstyles (I wanted something spiky but not too spiky) and beards5. Health regenWhat I liked:- This game in general- Lightsabres- Killing Winter and the three Hydras after so many attemptsWhat I didn't:- The game was too short (I know it's in EA so I won't count that)- Item drop rates were hella low (took me ages to get Cystals for my lightsabre)I can't wait to play this game when it's fully released.

								Holy what in the hell....yeah, this game is full of charm, the Grinding in Grindea isnt actually that bad, and grinding for tons of collectibles is fun! the battle is tight, with a few minor things and the graphics, the design, heck, even the missions that have depth to it, all of these components are really awesome and this game,. even in early access, is starting to already shape up as one of the better rpg games that ive played this year.TL;DR: This game is AWESOME! you like nostalgic zelda-like exploration games, but with more customization, collecting and crafting, really fun skill progression, abilities that vary greatly, and enemies that are designed smartly and with a challenge???  Then buy this game!Graphics: alright, its a top down 32 bit looking game. and man, do they do a wonderful job at making sure every pixel counts, and every animation is fluid! The graphics are nostalgic, and they are done wellSound: Man, the music is really suited for an adventure game. i really was not diaaposinted by the music at all, very well done. the sound effects were plenty, and they had depth and actual weight and distinction to each move you make. Of course, its nothing too fancy, but its not done poorly, they made every sword swing, every fireball, and every crate breaking sound goodGameplay: Man, I am very impressed with the combat. its quick, its fluid, the enemies variety are very challenging and require to think about how to approach each one, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY START WORKING TOGETHER AND F*** YOU UP!! oh man, there were some parts where i was sincerely triggered cause i couldn't get past some enemies when i really wanted to blow through a part of the stage to complete my mission. I played this on the hard difficulty, so im sure that why they were much more difficult to kill. Anyways, what everyone will definitley enjoy about how the combat is done is by the way you character is...Customization: Yes, this game is very customization friendly! You want to go nothing but tank? well choose the corresponding stats to boost you defense significantly, dump your points into two handing that tree bracnh you get when you first start out, and sponge away the many slimes presented, all the way until youre three hours deep into the pumpkin forest, trying to hack away at ghosts that keep friggin disappearing in front of your face, and even though you know thats not the way to kill them, youre already soo hellbent on getting the last hack on his ectoplasmic butt, because your a tank, with the brain of the sponge, and YOU DONT KNOW ANYTHING ELSE!!!..... But, if you do have a moment of awreness, you could totally respec you're guy on the fly! you can totally dump those pointe that went into tanking into something like a snow buddy. A cute little snowball dude who's totally loyal to the cause. And hey, why stop theree? You can throw your invstment into four different magic categories, earth, fire, ice,. and wind! And best belieive that your armor, and your clothes are customizable too! I REALLY appreciate the developers for going this route, AWESOME!Look, im gonna stop here and give you fair warning. As of this review, there are somethings that are still locked in the skill tree, because they are still indevelopment. Which leads me to one of the biggest troubles of this game. THERE IS LITERALLY NO HEALING. the only way to heal, is to pick up healt orbs from enemies (which drop pretty frequently), go back to town, or lvl up. Nopne of this was really an issue......until you start fighting bosses. OHHHHHHH man, this is the biggest flaw of this game.HOW THE HELL DO I BEAT THE DAMN BOSSES THAT ARE OP, WITH NOT A SINGLE HEALING POTION OR SKILL!!!!This, my dear developer, is THE MOST infuriating thing in the game, I pray to the flying spaghetti monster that you include something, cause this has got me beyond vexed. And the only other thing i gotta complain is the way blckin is handled, it seems real unforgiving, and even a bit unresposive at times. But hopefully, these things will be fixed.			"

								The game is a good game, me and my little brother had quite a bit of fun fighting the bosses and dying. The story is okay as well, with the gameplay just like The Legend of Zelda mixed with Sword of Mana it really takes a ease on the rpg style. I also love the collection of monster cards and items. The style give it a more personal feel as you can customize how you actually want to look instead of how weapons and armors look.One thing that I just don't really like is how often it gets updated, I know many people talk about this, but sadly with 3 developers working on a game this big, who knows when we'll get to see the ending of the game. Have been waiting for quite some time now, and I'm sure lots of fans are. Overall, its a great game, but until it's finished, you won't know how great of a game it will become.			"

								I purchased Secrets of Grindea for myself and 3 other friends and I'm in love. Lists are easy and fun to read, so here we go:-Pros--The storyline and dialogue are amazing. Very few games give me the sense of adventure and laughs that Grindea has-Art and music directory is great, with a vast, diverse world to explore-Multiplayer is incredibly fun. If early Legend of Zelda had multiplayer, it would come really close to this-The items and characters are rich and addicting, making you explore and grow-Cons--Multiplayer took some toying around to get to work, but was manageable-The controls feel foreign to start, which can be discouragingOverall, Secrets of Grindea stands solid on its own, but with friends, it knocks the genre out of the park.

This game feels like Zenonia or LoZ, but allows for a really great co-op setting. The customization feels never ending, the crafting is reasonable and relevant, and the combat is simple, yet challenging. I REALLY enoy playing this one with my brother, it's a great co-op game, with a good story, and solid mechanics. I recommend that if you're a fan of the genre, or you want something to play with a buddy (or two), give this a shot!			"

								It is an easy to understand game that maintains a decent level of difficulty.  It is easy to burn hours into with it's good story and exceptional combat.  The only negative thing I have to say is that at the time of this review, Secrets of Gindea is in beta and therefore awaits completion.  I look forward to seeing the finished product.			"

								I cant stop playing! the crafting is fun and not frustrating. The fighting took me a few minutes to get used to but its nice and smooth. The story is fun and inviting. The only thing I can say is a bit sad is that I get all this gold but not much to use it on because all of the good weapons are crafted. Health is a bit scarce at times but managable.			"

								Legend of Zelda a link to the past + many other old school games with a pretty good amount of comedy involved. I mean really it doesn't get much better than that. There's still work being done from time to time, but in my opinion this is a fun and challenging game, the more people, the tougher the enemies become. And frankly, that's where this game shines, its multi-player aspect. Though, don't let that hold you back, because even playing this one player, it's more than worth it. I don't have a lot of hours invested yet, but that's mostly due to personal things that just get in the way of game time. But for the short amount of hours I have put in, I can say the moment my friends and I are available to jump back in, we plan to do so. Old school style gameplay mixed in with rpg and parody just equals out to awesome.			"

								It's been about 2 years since I purchased the game and they've added about 20 minutes of play time to the campaign, which I honestly thought would have been done by now, seeing ONE patch being put out every 3-5 months is NOT very encouraging either, let me stop here and say this game has potential and can be fun, however it simply is NOT worth paying 15 dollars for, period. If they aren't going to bring more devs/artist ect. to build their team and hastin the process then they should really consider lowering the price if they expect anyone to stick with them, I think most of where they are at now is that new people discovering this, just don't realize how long it's been in development. So to that point, its been 6 years + in development and they are like maybe 35% done with the campain not to mention any other features or balancing. It just tiring to check back every 6-8 Months and to typically only see 1 patch posted. TL;DR: The game will most likely never be finished, over 6 years of dev and less than half done. Fun for a few hours or more so, if its on sale for less than 10 bucks its worth it otherwise hard pass this one.			"

								This game, in my personal opinion, is amazing. I get it for my friends and we all have a blast playing it, truely it's a fun little RPG and if you have friends to play with it it's really entertaining, plus if you like a challenge then playing by yourself proves worthy. I had trouble getting to the current part I am (which is as far as you can go with current development at the time I'm posting this) and now I just like to play the game with my friends. Love the pet system too. I would recommend this game for people who have some freidns who are looking for a new game to play because this is the jackpot.			"

Early Access Review
								The game is great so far its very challanging and soo much to do. I just hope to see great variety of skills so everyone can make their own unique fighter . Don't get me wrong the skills system already is great but between short sword or two handed and magic not much other styles to choose from. Like every game i see I always look for daggers and dual wielding aspect of the game.  I'm the type of person who like to see great weapon variations along with skills with each specific weapon skills and animation. Would like to see things as a heavy weapons such as axe and claymore along with spears with each its own animation style and short handed weapons like claws daggers swords. The magic is great as is each with a skill for each element I would say be nice to have dark and light but light i can figure would be a problem since light usually represent heals and that alot would make people over powered and take the fun out the game. I enjoy the stat system that focuses on your style of gameplay such as i sacrificed most of my heavy def gear for gears that give me speed boost and decent crit rate. These are all just my opinion and I'm pretty sure its been crazy suggestions. I wanted to add my own input that would have you enjoy different styles of gameplay and still maintain a challenge to its styles. The dungeons is just like old school dungeon runners with real hardcore puzzle and the noble tempting chest that seem impossible to obtain but with enough work and shift in other puzzle u can maintain it with a great reward. The enemies are very challenging which I love lmao no one like a game way to easy thats unfulfilling nor does people enjoy games that are psychotically hard but this is right between I hope to face more challenging enemies in the near future. The card collecting feature with perma stat buff and neatos procs are gre it gives people a reason to grind their hearts out along with the crafting system I hope to get deeper in dept with. Before I end my crazy little speech about how the game is and what I hope to see in near future (which are just my opinions) I just wanted to say this. THE GAME IS GREAT THE ROUTE YOU ARE CURRENTLY ON WOULD LEAD U TO GREATNESS AND FANDOM MAY YOU CONTINUE MAKING THIS GAME AS U SEE FIT AND FOLLOW ALONG WHAT YOU ALL BELIEVE I HOPE TO EXPERIENCE FULLY RELEASED GAME SOON AND KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK I LOVE IT!!!

								This game is very good. Has everything an RPG needs - slimes, swords and a broken keyboard due to rage. The storyline is really interesting and kept me hooked.There are some things that could be changed/added:1. Movement: we need to attack diagonally. I know this game is supposed to be old school, but firing projectiles is annoying.2. More weapons and armour3. Better bonuses for when you max out a skill or talent4. More hairstyles (I wanted something spiky but not too spiky) and beards5. Health regenWhat I liked:- This game in general- Lightsabres- Killing Winter and the three Hydras after so many attemptsWhat I didn't:- The game was too short (I know it's in EA so I won't count that)- Item drop rates were hella low (took me ages to get Cystals for my lightsabre)I can't wait to play this game when it's fully released.

								Your luck couldn't be any worse.You've been in the same area for hours already.The ground is lined with corpses.The grass runs red with fallen blood. The enemy's, yours, it doesn't matter.No Rabby, no Green Slime, no Mrs. Bee could ever hope to stop you, yet they still file in for the slaughter.And the only thing going through that borderline-psychopathic mind of yours is, ""Where the f*** is that card?!""Grinding's the name of the game, bucko. The story's pretty good, albeit pretty short, allowing you to grind for more XP and cards and whatnot. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a really good time-killer, a much better Castle Crashers, or a replacement for that steaming pile of sh*t that is Spiral Knights.Also, Winter is no longer my favorite season. 10/10			"

								This game is very promising. It may be early access but don't let that deter you as it has tons of content to keep you interested. If you're a fan of games like Final Fantasy, the Legend of Zelda, Fantasy Life or other similar RPG games you'll find joy here. The 4th Wall is something it likes to smash down quite often as you'll come across many Easter Eggs and reference, one being the Triforce laying on the ground or a character mentioning ""/"" commands. Secrets of Grindea knows it's a video game and uses that to it's pleasure since it allows it to make tons of jokes. Heck you start out from a town called ""Startington"". The characters are also quite pleasing to meet. Your father has a backstory and a driving motive that I find interesting to explore, as you plung further into the game his past is opened up to a point where you realize you aren't the only character of importance running around Grindea. The games controls seemed odd to me at first but I later came to admire how well they work. The arrow keys act as your movement while Z & X are your sword and shield. You have items and skills linked to the A,S,D,F,G,Q,W,E,R,T keys which can each be rebinded. I tried to change them around but I find it much more comfortable to use the defaults. I definitely recommend this game to any fans of RPGs and in-game collecting.			"

								Secrets of Grindea is a pretty decent game. I've enjoyed countless hours playing this game even though ive just bought it. The only thing I see is there are some ""Glitches"" with it, If you have two players. The host will start an old boss fight in the trophy room while the secondary player leaves that room on the same frame. which will put the secondary player out of bounds. Works best on the slime boss. I don't mine if you don't fix it since its pretty fun to mess with! This game is amazing!			"

								I was looking for a game that would be easy to control with my new Steam Controller and friendly enough to play in front of my kids. This game was well worth the money. The fighting is not easy and for each enemy you need to have a plan. And I don't mean each type of enemy, like there are a couple types. I mean each enemy in general has specific things they will do, not just some reskinned new color of previous enemies. Great fun so far and my son loves watching me play since I named the main character after him.			"

								The part of the game that is out now is very fun to play and the ""endless"" mode is very fun to play too. If you buy this game it is more of an investment than it is an actual game. Will recommend if you like grinding and simple varied combat, if you actually seek difficulty in combat or puzzels then I would not recommend this game as it is quite easy except for the endless mode.

								Having not grown up with this sort of game, i did not feel any nostalgia while playing it. However, that didnt stop me from really enjoying it. Its still in beta, but the story still gave me about 10 hours of gameplay, and it also has an arcade mode which is based on the fighting parts of the story. As of writing this review, i have spent 2 hours in the arcade mode, and I doubt i will be stopping there.Dont let the fact that it's still in beta stop you from at least thinking about this game, as its already really good. Parts of the world map aren't free for players to explore as of now, and im sure they will take very long to make as the game looks astoundingly beautiful, but what there is currently is great. The main quest is also still not finished, it just abruptly stopped, though there is still alot of it. As i said, the game gave me 10 hours of gameplay, which i find is a very suitable amount of time for a game.The story consists of puzzles, bullet hell styled boss fights, combat, side quests and obiously the story itself. Some of the puzzles were actually quite hard, to the point where i had to look up gameplay videos find out the solution, while others were a decent head scratcher that wouldn't last too long, or too short. The boss fights all take a couple tries to beat, but never enrage you like other games (namely shovel knight). I recommend this game to everyone, though especially to people who like The legend of Zelda, and other RPGs like it.			"
