Update: Server no longer available. Leaderboards and Achievements stopped functioning when Nival took down the servers without as much as a notice a while ago.  The game also pauses to try to connect to its server frequently during play.  Completely broken now, as if the points below weren't bad enough in the first place.Having paid for the Steam version of this game feels like an EX slap in the face with a trout by a troll.It is free to play (with microtransactions) on Kongregate, Facebook and mobile devices.  The Steam version does not get updated, it's at version 1.2. The F2P versions get frequent updates and are currently version 1.7.3.A borderline criminal business practice. On Steam, if you buy the game, they already got your money so why update the game eh ? And likewise on F2P, its of course very important to constantly update it with new things to spend money on.  Disgusting.Seriously Nival? You gave us the wonderful Homm5, and then you do this, why? :(Its not even a bad game, its a very functional and decent looking TD with a unique CCG flavour, its actually well worth checking out.  Just.. don't be a fool like me and purchase it here, play the F2P versions instead.			"

												Great game, upwards of the top of nice tower defense games, however, the devs of this game abandoned it on Steam, they  dumped all thier paying customers in favor of a tablet F2P version that is both updated regularly and (of course) Pay to win and full of microtransactions. So, if you want to play it, just go play it on a tablet and refuse to pay anything, the game will still be higher version even if you don't spent any money. But, on the moral side, just skip this AND the tablet version and go play the many other nice TD games. I suggest Gemcraft, Defense Grid, Ancient Planet and quite a few others. Don't support Devs like these.			"

Do not buy. Achievements and stats have been broken for almost a year and with the game now unsupported, a fix is unlikely.The game itself is okay but Nival tied stats and achievements to their own servers for some inexplicable reason. Servers have been shut down without warning and there hasn't been any word from the devs ever since. I was hopeful that a patch to at least fix achievements would come but it seems the devs can't even be bothered to at least write a post or thread about it.			"

												I really wanted to like this game because of the whole tower defense thing and how nice the game looks, but it is VERY, VERY, poorly executed. It starts off fun for the first half... You get to upgrade towers and combine powers and unlock new abilities... All very nice...BUT...The baddies are in a constant state of ""better than you can ever be"" near the middle of the game. As you are upgrading towers, like in other tower defense games it should be EASIER to take out baddies so they just throw more baddies at you so you can then upgrade towers more, but in this game they not only throw more baddies at you but the baddies are near invincible and require HOURS AND HOURS of grinding to finally beat. Even with upgrades and such, the starting ""prime"" money/resources at the begining of each level is insanely low for the amount of powerful baddies that show up even in the first wave... The amount of prime you get from each kill does not go up with the difficulty increase and health increases the baddies get as the game progresses, so it makes it even harder to upgrade towers and such without pointless hours upon hours of grinding. Also, the types of towers that show up after the midpoint are completely random, so you may get some decent towers in a playthrough or you may never see those towers at all!  It just feels like a poorly executed port from a mobile platform ""free to play, but pay to win"" type game at that point. I mean I had towers upgraded that could do 5000+ damage in a single shot and it couldn't take down the weakest swarmers.I really cannot recommend this game because of the insane difficulty curve that spikes in at the midpoint of the game; it goes from being fun, to being a decent challenge, to being an automatic rage quit. Maybe I will revisit the game and give a better review if the devlopers ever fix the balancing issues. (DEVS? If you are reading this, play the game 'Defense Grid"" that is how a tower defense game should be done.)			"

												Metascore 58?! Are you kidding me?  I just don't get it.  My only complaint with this game is that it's too grindy at certain points, and with not so many maps it can make the experience somewhat repetitive.  Aside from that, the upgradeable trading cards meets tower defense idea here works surprisingly well, and above all it's fun. If you're a fan of tower defense, I say go for it.  It's one of the best in the genre (up there with defense grid, plants vs. zombies, etc.).  8/10			"

												This game feels suspiciously like a mobile IAP-based game that was translated to PC...First though, the good -- the game looks very nice indeed for a tower defense game. Very high production values when it comes to visuals and overall presentation.But back to the mobile app part -- unlike your typical tower defense game, which focuses on strategy and proper tower placement / usage, this one features a very heavy emphasis on grinding for permanent upgrades to your towers, which makes it almost as much of a hybrid RPG game as a traditional TD one. The game features a booster / upgrade store, and it is this part which feels distinctly like a remnant of a mobile port. As the levels progress, the same types of creeps gain increasing amounts of health, while the strength of your towers remains constant - thus the need to spend substantial amounts of time grinding previous levels for money to buy upgrades. One might imagine that a mobile version of this game would include the ability to buy these upgrades on the spot in exchange for real money...I'm kind of ambivalent about whether or not to recommend this game. The hybrid TD-RPG concept can work well and be enjoyable, but in this case, I think my problem is mostly with the balance and unnecessarily high grind requirement.			"

												No no no no.It's a promising TD game. Good graphic, decent mechanics (using card system to deploy tower and it has even magic and talent trees) but the game is not even supported. You'll see your screen freezes every random seconds. Some can mitigate the effect by blocking the game's exe in Windows firewall to stop sending handshakes to external servers. And the servers... are dead. Leaderboards? Bye bye.More so, not only have the developers terminated the support without warning, leaving paying players on Steam to see the free counterpart on other websites updated continously is just daylight insult.Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, shame on this horrible business practice (they had the guts to promote their mobile games on this game's Store Page when abandoning the game).You'd be better off playing TD like Sanctum or the legendary Defense Grid series.

												What a shame. This is a pretty tower-defense with decent but grindy and mobile-oriented mechanics (all of the sorts of traps littered into f2p games on mobile platforms, designed to entice you into paying money to speed up gameplay), but with the only way to get them on PC being to rather tediously grind for them. This still would have gotten a thumb's up from me despite the grinding (because it was enjoyable to play through the campaign, and I liked the art and core gameplay loops), and I was sort of slowly grinding my way through the final achievements, when the servers were unceremoniously shut down for this SINGLE PLAYER GAME, which breaks the achievements and makes the gameplay lag.It was barely excusable to have this game have an online component when the servers still worked, but it is inexcusable for this company to continue to sell an game whose abandonment degrades its performance. It also never got the updates and bug fixes that other platforms got, and the developers ignored the bug reports from Steam. Don't put it onto Steam at all if you don't want to support it here, or stop taking money for it when you discontinue support, please. Without the server requirement and with updates done in parallel with mobile (or even freezing updates here after the major bugs were fixed), this game would have been a good example of a completed and satisfactory tower defense game. Without them, it's a black mark on this developer's record.			"

												I am slightly conflicted in recommending this. On one hand, purely from a ""tower defense"" perspective, the gameplay is pretty solid. Everything works as it should and it is well-designed (nice interface, towers all serve specific purposes, enemy health, waves and routes are clearly indicated, etc). And most importantly, the actual gameplay itself is fun. What brings this down are the nonstandard elements the developers tried to introduce into the standard tower defense formula - specifically, the ""card system"" (and everything that comes along with it). There's nothing wrong with the basic idea - tower types are represented by cards that can be collected and leveled up, and you have to pick and choose a subset of cards from your deck before going into a level. Where the problem comes in is obtaining the cards you need you be successful and ""leveling up"" those cards. First of all, the leveling system is overly confusing and needlessly complicated. Secondly, in order to beat the later levels, you will need specific cards leveled up to adequate levels of strength. The problem with this is that most of the cards you get as rewards are random, so you could go a good long while without (or possibly even never) finding a Lightning Tower card, for example (which I would consider absolutely essential for beating the game). And even if you are lucky enough to get some good towers, the process of leveling them up takes serious time. You basically just need to keep grinding out optional levels to get extra cards that can be used to fuse/evolve other cards. And make no mistake, you are going to be doing some serious grinding. So, depending on your tolerance for grinding levels and ranking up things, that's how I would recommend you make your decision to buy this or not. Personally, I am the OCD-type who feels the need to level things up and complete stuff, so I forced myself through and eventually got enough cards of high enough strength to power through the main game, as well as the extra hard difficultly that unlocks afterwards. While I did enjoy the game overall, it did take a lot of time and effort to get the most out of it. To me, tower defense shouldn't be about making towers strong enough to win by brute force. It should be about overcoming the challenges using a set of predefined towers and nothing else except whatever strategy you come up with. The first half of this game can be played along those lines, but once you get to the later levels, you will absolutely hit a wall if you don't have certain cards leveled up to a certain strength. That's poor design in my eyes. But even with all that said, I honestly still had fun with this game, as it's well made and I have a semi-high tolerance for grindy things. If you think you can deal with the grinding issue and like TD games, definitely go for it. Otherwise, you may want to hold off or wait for a huge discount.			"

												Tower Defense crossed with a Card Collecting game; an unusual mix that strangely works well together. You have a set campaign of around 20 quests to complete before you, with some side quests you can do between main quests to gain further experience. There is some backstory to the whole game but its not overly interesting only appearing after winning certain levels. You use the drops, silver & stars earned from each win to upgrade your towers & magic, increase your deck size & obtain other perks.Initial levels in the game are very, very easy to complete, making me think this might be a 'one session to complete' kinda game. Once you hit around level 10, the levels get much harder though. If you have been unlucky on the drops or have put your upgrades into tower cards you shouldn't have you can find yourself grinding out upgrades to get through the next level. This isn't overly frustrating though as the maps are randomly selected for each difficultly level & can have random modifiers to block certain tower squares from use. This adds new challenges for existing maps. There are also some unique boss levels where you have a set amount to build & take down a large enemy - those are fun!There are a LOT of different towers you can build up in your deck. For tower defense veterans, most of the common suspects are there in some form (guns, flamers, slowers, long range), plus some other more unique configurations. Not sure exactly how many tower types there are but would estimate at least 20. The quality of the card determines how far you can upgrade, with each upgrade generally improving DPS/Range/Efficiency etc.For those who like a strong mazing component to their tower defense, then this game might not be for you. There is some maps with a smaller level of mazing but most have a set path design. The strategic importance in PW:D is with your card selection to match the incoming enemies & what you put your limited upgrades earned towards. Better choices will make moving up the levels much easier (unlike my poor effort of a play through lol!), & bad choices will make the game feel next to impossible to beat.The HD support (or lack of) I found a bit disappointing. Running PW:D in full screen ends up stretching the desktop down to 1280x720 - windows like the Steam window open in the background always get shrunk down & I need to resize. It looks fine at the lower resolution just a minor frustration. Again, a minor frustation I found was the menus between games. There is a lot of going in and out of different sections to get your upgrades done, check your towers etc. This could have been simplified to fit more cards on one page, and have main functions and browsing together to save going back and forth. Overall, I have really been enjoying this one. Its a challenging & addictive tower defense game with a card twist! Lots of achievements & one that is well suited to load up for a quick 10-20min TD session.If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

												Lets start of by saying that i havent played a lot of tower defence games but if a fair few have the quality that this game does then i think i will be playing a fair few others.When i started playing the game i was like ""I really like the setting"" (huge fantasy fan me) ""but do i really like the style of gameplay that this sort of game has"".Then i watched as time went by and i realised this is exactally the sort of game i love to spend time with,the setting is pure fantasy and is well represented in game with the graphics,sound and script.The game plays out from battle to battle and you gain coin and different cards that you can use in battles defending the entrance that the demons (from bouncing heads on sticks to exploding frogs-GO FIGURE) try to reach and if they do so in a certain number then its ""GAME OVER MAN"" (couldent resisit the quote there).The cards are also used in between levels in upgrading the towers you have,and beleive me when i tell you that this plays a heavy part in the game as dont upgrade and you are not going to proceed any further than where you are at that certain point in the game.Grinding plays quite a huge role in the game and is an important part of being able to upgrade the equipment you have so you can get that one level closer to the finishing line and the demon who seems to want your head on a pole.Like i have allready said i really liked the game and after playing for a while (havent quite finished just yet-but dont think it will change my opinion on the game as i will still regard it as a game i would reccommend to anyone with a love of tower defence games) then decided to buy another tower defence game (well the pack) ANOMOLY 2 and found that i really like that game also.So sometimes it is good to play games you arent used to as you then find that sometimes a change can be just what you needed and that a game style you have never played before can get you gaming in ways you never thought you would.

												If you are into this type of games - tower defence - this is the one you definitely wanna try. Prime World: Defenders makes you think how you could beat AI better, quicker and cheaper. Every tower has its price and costs an amount of ""prime"", which you are lack of and it makes levels hard as hell so this is the reason why you need better towers which you can achiev by buying new cards and playing almost same levels again and again which sometimes makes this game really boring. You can improve your cards by evolving and fusing them. It's the biggest minus that I see in this game, it takes really long to have powerful and useful defence against all types of monsters so if you are not patient this isn't game for you.

												So far I've recommended three games that are each very good in their own right. Unfortunately, not every review can be positive, just not like every Tower Defense can be good. And Prime World Defenders is an example of how to do one wrong, in my opinion.The game is a spinoff of Prime World, an MMO also on Steam (which probably should have sent off some alarm bells right away). It takes place in the Prime Zone, a stretch of land that was struck with a miniature apocalypse, where pockets of energy have appeared and dangerous mutants roam the land. You play as a new recruit to a group of treasure hunters slash do-gooders who explore the wasteland. I didn't find myself particularly interested in the story, though, and it didn't help that the voice actors didn't appear to be either.Defenders starts off perfectly fine, and annoyingly it takes a while for what I disliked most about to rear it's head. The game looks nice, there's some interesting maps, and every map has some special conditions you can pull off for some rewards. But inevitably, I ran into the big problem: this game is grindy just for the sake of it. Your towers have a card gimmick to them, and you're rewarded one or two after every mission. To make your towers stronger, you can sacrifice junk cards you don't want for a slight stat boost, and you can also 'evolve' them by pairing them with another card of the same type. This is absolutely necessary, since that's what allows you to upgrade them in stages.So if you find yourself needing a card, your course of action is to play stages hoping it will appear - if it does, the game also shuffles up rewards to make getting it random too. You can try again for a fairly sizeable amount of silver, a resource the game wants for everything, including evolving cards. The game offers a shop, too, where you can spend silver on mostly random boosters, or use stars, a harder to acquire currency, on more specialty items. This is probably reminding some of you of something, and it likely won't surprise you to hear Prime World Defenders also has a mobile version, among others. There's no micro-transactions in the Steam version, but when the framework of the game still seems built around them it's hard to say that's a positive change.What's really damning though is that the version of the game on Steam has basically been abandoned. The last time the developers were seen about the forum was apparently two years ago, and there are bugs that haven't been fixed. Meanwhile, the versions of the game that do have micro-transactions are still supported, with fairly obvious implications as to why. I bought Defenders in a bundle, so I don't feel as ripped off as I could have been, but it's hard to recommend a game the developers seem like they could care less about, especially compared to the ones I've talked about and a lot of the ones I will.

												Unfortunatly I can't recommend this game any longer. The developers tied many game features to an online server, which they have since shut down, making all of these ""always online"" features broken leaving a shell of a game behind. Many of these features, like game progress and achievements, have no need of online functionality yet their gone anyways.In addition, the developers abandoned this version of the game early on, instead deciding to only update a F2P version littered with microtransactions avalible elsewhere.It started out as a fun little tower defense game, but the actions of the developers show they're not very consumer friendly, and you can not count on their games working for long. I'll be avoiding any games by Nival in the future.			"

												I have over 1,000 hours in multiple TD games (Defense Grid, Sanctum, Orcs Must Die, and about a dozen others, so speaking with somewhat authority on TD)This is a grindfest broken game which is no longer supported by the developers on Steam. You get to play the same set of maps, over & over again but hey let the game try & trick you by rotating the game to a different orientation! Oh joy of joys. Then turn the game into a grindfest, playing over & over again to get an elusive 2nd card so you can upgrade a tower! Oh, but then you get to do it all over again! And again, And again!If you enjoy banging your head against a brick wall over & over, but then make the mistake of progressing too far, the game takes a leap in diffulty which will basically stop you in your tracks. The good news is no more grinding, the bad news is you'll never get to finish the game. Broken, unsuported pile of Crap. Avoid.  "

												Really good Tower Defense game, recomended for anyone that likes TD games or even card games as the mechanics are card based. A bit of grinding may be needed at some points but the random generation of totems on maps makes it fun to replay levels and you can always speed up the game and call waves early to fly through any level.The only downsides seems to be that the Steam version appears to have been abandoned by the developer as it has not received any updates compared to the iOS or Android versions and some achievements appear to be bugged so if you are an achievement hunter you may want to look into this before buying.Overall a great TD game, but until the devs release some updates maybe buy it only on good offer or in a bundle.

												Very fun and adicting game. I love the upgrade system, the rare towers, the unique towers, are awesome once fully upgraded. Though you have to do alot of map grinding to be able to progress further into the game, the payoff is well worth it. There are some maps I have beat probably 70+ times and I am not that worn out from it. Every time you play, the Touched (monsters) are always in a different order, different combinations of touched each map, ect. So they game is always somewhat fresh every time you play it. If you are not sure about this game because you get bored easily and dont want to take a chance on waisting your money, then I suggest getting the game  when it is on sale or in a bundle.4/5 Stars			"

												Great game, upwards of the top of nice tower defense games, however, the devs of this game abandoned it on Steam, they dumped all thier paying customers in favor of a tablet F2P version that is both updated regularly and (of course) Pay to win and full of microtransactions. So, if you want to play it, just go play it on a tablet and refuse to pay anything, the game will still be higher version even if you don't spent any money. But, on the moral side, just skip this AND the tablet version and go play the many other nice TD games.			"

												Update: Offline mode has been implemented. Prime World: Defenders is a challenging tower defense with card collecting and rpg elements, where the story is told through comic book art sequences with full voice acting. 23 repeatable story levels, as well as randomized levels for grinding, are laid out on an overworld map. When you play a level you’ll have a rotatable, zoomable and pannable isometric view of towers and enemies. Towers cost “prime” to build and upgrade, and you only begin levels with a small amount. Killing enemies will earn you more prime, as will summoning additional waves of enemies before they’re due--though in many cases this will increase the difficulty and possibly overwhelm you. Where towers can be placed on the field there are sometimes helpful anomalies which increase their range, power or firing rate. There is also a handy toggle for 2x battle speed.Towers and spells in the game are represented by reusable cards in your inventory, and you can only carry a set number with you into battle. You can see which enemy types populate a map before you enter so you know how to build your deck. There are towers for both land and air enemies, invisibility detection, snaring, poison, fire, mortar and more. Destructible towers which buff or heal the enemy may also exist within levels. Spells don’t cost prime but are instead on a timer, and consist of targetable AoEs which snare, stun, reveal invisible enemies and/or do flat damage. Spell and tower cards can be combined with other cards in the forge to level them up--increasing their base damage, range and/or secondary effect intensity--and tower cards can be combined with their duplicates to make the towers upgradeable to tier II and tier III during battle, doubling and quadrupling their damage respectively.Currency is awarded after battle and can be used to unlock talents for your hero, purchase cards from the store and pay for forging costs. Each story map you complete will earn you 1-3 stars as well, depending on your performance. These stars can be used to unlock high level talents and purchase rare cards. You’ll also be numerically scored on every story map depending on how much damage you take and the amount of prime you have left over at the end, and these scores can be compared with friends’ for each map. You’re also given a total game score which can be compared both globally and with friends’ on the leaderboards. The difficulty can be frustrating and requires some grinding before bosses, but it tends to be a gear check rather than a matter of skill. Everything about Prime World: Defenders is surprisingly solid for a title that came out of nowhere, and that’s even considering my time with the game was mostly in its beta state and the fact I am not remotely a fan of tower defense.

												Prime World Defenders is a good game but it does have the annoying remnants of a free-to-play system that make the game a bit irritating at times. You unlock towers and spells by progressing through the game, like many other tower defense games, but in order to upgrade those towers you need to get duplicate 'cards' and combine them. You get random cards from beating randomly generated 'grinding' levels and from buying booster packs. You can get common towers easy but the rarer towers (the ones that you really need to perfect some levels) will elude you for a good portion of the game. Eventually you will max out everything and then the game is really enjoyable although easy at that point.Each level has two challenges that encourage you to play in different ways and after beating the game once you unlock a harder difficulty to really test out your skills (think new game +). The towers and enemies are fairly standard by tower defense...standards but I didn't really have a problem with that. There are boss fights every few levels that require a bit more strategy until you unlock a tower that absolutely shreds bosses to pieces when upgraded. Some kind of infinite survival map would have been a good inclusion, there are 250 wave survival maps when you finish but with a decent enough strategy you can easily beat them with minimal effort.Overall I'd recommend the game if you don't mind grinding a bit in the early/mid game to get the towers you need to upgrade.

												Prime World:Defenders seems like an interesting mix of RPG and Tower Defense but unfortunately you will find yourself grinding for exp/coins/stars A LOT during the last couple of missions and bosses.Don't even think of doing the last two missions and the final boss without grinding up a level 3 Lighting tower and Dragon Fire tower, they are impossible without them and you'll have to grind for hours if you aren't lucky with opening booster packs.

												Prime World DefenceRating: 7.5/10Overview: Isometric Tower DefenceThe Good:+ Nice Detailed Graphics + The game features solid  tower defence mechanics. You have tower and magic cards and you can only select a handful before each level. You can collect new towers and magic by completing levels and/or purchasing them in the shop using in-game currency. If you have two or more of the same tower cards you can combine them to increase the stats which also allows you to upgrade the them in battle. You can also further increase the stats of towers and magic by using any unwanted cards and combining it with the cards you want to upgrade. All of this leads to a somewhat addicting quality of the game of completing levels and collecting tower and magic cards and making them stronger as you play.    + Variety of different towers, enemies and levels. Typical of any tower defence game, certain towers are more useful in certain situations than others, some towers can only target land while others can only target air etc. Enemies are pretty typical as well, you have groups of easy to kill enemies, slow but hard enemies and everything in-between. Its very well done and strategy is required to make it through the level but if you've played tower defence games before nothing here should surprise you. + Upgrading towers and magic is very rewarding  + Permanent passive upgrades used with in game currency to further increase stats and bonuses  The Average:There is a story but it really isn't the main selling point of the game. It certainly doesn't take anything away from the game but it doesn't add anything to it either. You could easily skip the story and nothing of value would be lost. I found the levels to be well done but also very standard. Compared to other tower defence games in the market it seems like a real missed opportunity to try some creative things in each level. I wish the levels got more complex in terms of enemy paths, in most of the levels you have very little control in how the enemies reach the end. In most of the levels, especially in the beginning, everything is pre-determined especially enemy paths and tower placement.      The game has some bugs but nothing that ruined the game for me Lacks different game modes and options present in other tower defence games The Bad:This game requires significant grinding in order to advance. If grinding out levels is not your thing then you should avoid this game at all cost. In order to complete some of the more difficult levels you not only need better towers but you also need to level them up. The tower and magic cards you get for completing a level is randomized which means it could be awhile before you finally get the tower card you need to upgrade it. This should not be surprising once you realize there is a free version that has micro transactions to speed up the grinding process. The free version has also received a lot more updates than the steam version.   Conclusion:I've played a lot of tower defence games and I put in a lot of time with this one. Its very well polished but other than its upgrade system it doesn't really provide anything new to the genre. The more I played the game the more I realized just how 'safe' it was in terms of its design. The game is lacking in game modes which hurt it and the game can start getting frustrating when you reach a level that becomes way too hard to complete without grinding. Most people who are not tower defence enthusiast would probably stop playing at this point. If you love the genre than this is a game worth checking out.   "

												The metacritic rating for this game is certainly correct. As someone that likes TDs, likes the art style, atmosphere, and music, I have trouble giving it more than a 6/10 simply due to all the gameplay ruining engine glitches. It probably doesn't even deserve that. Without the engine glitches, it might be a 7/10 or 8/10 TD.There's a good assortment and variety of towers in PWD - nothing that leaps out as being incredibly unique, but they've got splash poison, single target poison, splash fire, single target fire, AA poison, etc.; what is unfortunate about the tower system is it comes down to luck whether you actually find all the tower cards or not. Even after playing through the entire game, then grinding another hundred levels and buying as many cards as possible in the store... I still did not unlock every tower. Bummer. Aside from that, some towers are slightly unbalanced. If you find some electric tower cards early and max upgrade them, building nothing but those towers and invis detectors is sufficient for beating all but ~3 levels.I'm skillful enough at TDs that I had no trouble beating the game and collecting all achievements - which brings me to the next problem. The achievements unlock in-game, but some do not unlock on steam. There I am, in-game, and I can clearly see I've got an achievement from beating a level with certain requirements met (like holding onto a large amount of prime energy - used for tower building) - got it in-game, but not on steam. There's an elaborate reset procedure that you can do to give yourself a second chance to unlock such achievements, but if one of the two grindy achievements (win 500 games, build 10000 towers) locks itself down, you'll have no way to unlock them without the help of a tool like Steam Achievements Manager.It's quite aggravating staring at a list of 134 achievements, 132 of them legitimately unlocked, and 2 of them frozen. You know that you can get (and deserve to get) the final two, but they are utterly frozen and unresponsive. If you do reset them and start from 0, they will likely freeze again at some point before reaching completion. Therefore, to get them you are forced to ""cheat"" (Steam Achievements Manager), all because of the company's incredibly shoddy programming.Speaking of programming - this game is not epicly high quality like Defense Grid or even Defender Quest. A lot of the time projectiles or magic don't even register. I've landed an 8-wave wall of fire down on groups of enemies, then watched in bafflement as only the final wave caused damage, leading to leaks. For a few of the tougher levels, it can come down to luck on whether the damage you're causing actually registers. About a third of the time invis detectors don't even bother detecting invisible units, so for invis-heavy levels you have to layer quite a few of them all around or once again you may have leaks. (Or just use more electric towers.)The game is missing some important hotkeys as well, like a sell button/key to rapidly sell towers. Instead you have to click on a tower, wait for an animation, then click a tiny sell button. It also lacks an 'Auto-Send-Next-Wave' toggle for those that prefer the challenge of waves coming as fast as possible. Instead you're expected to mash the 'Next wave' button, wearing out your keyboard or mouse.Overall the game might be okay for a novice TD player, which doesn't get annoyed by engine bugs that are sure to ♥♥♥♥ off a veteran - but if you watched TotalBiscut attempt to play it, then you'll realize the difficulty curve is a tad too steep for novices. Quite unfortunate, as that leaves a very small audience that will fully appreciate the game.The paper voice acting is also far below the standards of much older TDs like Defense Grid. Overall it left me uncaring about the storyline.5/10 or 6/10 seem like fair ratings for the game, until they patch some of the engine glitches. But the company does not seem interested in doing so at this time. Every time I see a changelog I get hopeful, but then I check and everything is still just as broken.-BikeHelmet			"

												Prime World Defenders is a good game in it's base but is unfortunately crippled by it's progression system making it an absolutely unrewarding grind to play.  When completing a mission (the first time) or playing one of the ""random"" side mission you are rewarded an item card, this can be a tower, a spell, an item that is a tad better for upgrading, or one of the game's currencies.  The issue with this system is that you getting the cards you need is completely random, so you can find yourself in a situation that you do just not have the cards you need. And even when you get the card you need, it will be so underpowered in comparison to the cards you started upgrading that they are pretty much obsolete. Speaking of obsolete, some towers even when fully upgraded get straight up outclassed by the ""rarer"" ones, that is after you started upgrading those repeating the cycle.  It's a horrible system that turns the game from enjoyable to frustrating.   Unfortunately that is not the only issue the game has. The magic system for example (again cards you need to upgrade) is completely useless since the spells do not scale with the waves, hardly making a dent some waves in.  There also is the issue that there are no fine controls in the game for the towers, you can not set a tower to attack the enemy the furthest along, or maybe the weakest. This adds another layer of frustration especially with the boss fights where towers tend to lock on to the boss and les all the weaker minions pass.   It is a shame really, the base game is good and with some minor tweaks it could have been darn solid. But do yourself a favour and don't loose yourself in this frustrating mess.			"

Feel the free to play It's obvious this game was built around an economy that intended this game to be a mobile free to play game. There is no micro transactions here (that I've noticed), so don't worry about that, but you will notice how grindy this game is, and the multiple currencies required to shop and progress skills, which are ubiquitous in mobile f2ps. It feels very hard to progress without MASSIVE amounts of grinding, and feels as if they made it that way, intending to give you motivation to buy the special currency and speed things up a bit. I typically love a little grinding to get an advantage in games, but this is ridiculous. Also, the forging and evolution parts of the game are a little clunky and confusing. You may love this, but while I intend on finishing it, I can't bring myself to play more than a few minutes at a time. I don't hate it, I just don't think it's more than a decent mobile game on your desktop. Buy this on a massive sale only.			"

												The game is a good bang for your buck. If you enjoy TD, and need a good 10 minutes of free time, this is the one to pick up. There are skill points, evolving towers, and an enjoyable card system. There is currency which allows you to buy random chance drawings at different tiers.  The graphics are very good considering the price. The towers are not very balanced, but the tiered system allows basically three levels of rarity. The metascore is not a fair score. While there is some grind, that is kinda the point of TD games. You grind for better towers and skills. You can still progress far without having to grind as much, but you need to get at least 1 or 2 ""pink"" cards (tier 3) to really shine in grinding/progress.I have about 50 hours in the iPad version as well which seems to be better in terms of log-in rewards but worse in terms of glitches/freezes.

												I'm still playing the game, but it features a pretty manipulative game device to make you grind the same levels over and over. Like all card games, getting powerful cards is low probability. But this game makes it worse by requiring you to get 3 copies of rare towers to evolve them to red to get past the later story missions. Only by grinding extra ""optional"" hard missions endlessly can you do this, which is pretty tedious and it's very frustrating (another manipulative device to keep you playing). If you prefer new content and meaningful puzzles to solve, don't get this game.			"

												This game really feels like a free to play game stripped of all it's microtransactions. You might think that sounds like a good thing but what is left is a confused and horribly unbalanced game.I spent my first 8 or 9 hours breezing through the game at a steady pace before hitting a brick wall of challenge which is insurmountable without resorting to endless grinding. Your towers come in the form of cards. You need to collect several of the same cards to upgrade them and progress however the only way of obtaining cards is by finding them at random or by purchasing them with in-game credits. You can't choose which ones you buy with your credits though, that is also left to chance. You'll soon run out of credits though and In a freemium game you would be able to purchase in-game credits to top up if you wanted, in this game however, the only way to earn credits is by grinding. Grinding can often be fun in a game, here it is so ineffective that it feels like an utterly pointless endeavour. You grind away hoping to be rewarded with the cards you need to upgrade and progress yet all the end of level rewards feel about 3 levels behind where you need them to be, meaning the cards you want, the cards you NEED, rarely come up. By the time you've fully upgraded a few towers the game ramps up the difficulty and they are rendered ineffective. You need to upgrade the new towers. Your magic abilities are absolutely useless, the fuse and evolution function is over complicated and there are frankly just too many towers with too many different enemies with the same levels rehashed over and over. It's a mess to be honest and the in-game currency, leveling up system along with the grinding nature of the gameplay and 'daily rewards' and 'special offer's' on items all scream freemium. Yet this isn't a freemium game, so it's all a bit redundant. All in all then Prime World Defenders' as a game is basically thus: Want to obtain more towers? Grind. Want to unlock new abilities? Grind. Want to upgrade your towers so you can beat the level and progress? GRIND. Just don't expect grinding to get you anywhere.			"

												While this game has a good engine and is an OK start, this is a port of a free-to-play mobile game, and development on the port has ceased.The game is a bit grindy, (to give you incentives to pay for microtransaction in the free-to-play version) and features random drops and ingame currency to upgrade towers. Overall suffers from all the problems you would expect of a free-to-play port that simply removed the microtransactions.			"

												I played the demo (great, there's an actual demo! yai!) and I liked it. So i bought the actual game. Usually that means you just continue playing. While I was waiting for the download to finish I already noticed some recent reviews about the servers being offline. Once the game was installed I opened it to find my progress from the demo being lost. Apparently the servers have been taken offline, and the game relies on the servers to import the progress from the demo (which is quite likely stored locally).In other words: FAILI don't even care to find out if this can be fixed or my progress can be imported manually, if they intentionally break their game like this all i will do is request a refund. With 5 minutes play time. At least that's a new record for me. :-) "

												The game is decently fun at the core; I spent many hours playing. The card system and element of chance is an unusual twist to keep things interesting. The game gets a do-not-buy rating though for having the constant feel of a copy-pasted, mediocrely balanced, tower defense, and the bait-and-switch at the end.there are 2 dozen or so levels that you play thru with various goals for that level. Ive played and aced all but the last level, several times over.  The dificulty level of the last map is so rediculously higher than the other 99% of the game, you have to replay the same old levels just to level up your character to even have a chance at the boss. I finished the game, minus the last level, after 10-20 hours. I have 58 hours total play time trying to beat the final map. yea... great balancing.I got tired of grinding away (literally for hours) on stupid-easy levels just to have a chance at the one last boss level, so I just uninstalled the game in frustration. How ****ing disappointing!			"

												The game leaves a bitter-sweet taste of unpolished product with a potential to be great but also lack of attention to details and way to slow of a progress. The game simply does not feel rewarding.Pros:- cards mechanics- in the sea of many FPS/TD hybrids, this one falls quite close to a regular TD gameCons:- no enemies in current wave amount indicator- hard to select towers- unresponsive keyboard shortcuts (sometimes they work, sometimes you need to press them twice)- slow progress- repetitive maps- too much grindPerhaps try it..

												Pretty interesting and refreshing concept of merging TD and CTG into one game. BUT, since the developer/publisher is Nival, the game just HAD to have truckloads of grinding experience. And, of course, a pinch of bugs as well.I will recommend it, because it is innovative after all and fairly cheap (frequent on 75% off sales, been in couple of bundles so far), but when you get stuck at playing the same mazes over and over again in order to collect more cards, coins or stars, don`t say I didn`t warn you. Perfect game for the sadistic types, if your mistress haven`t punished you enough on your last session - play this game to fulfill your fantasies.			"

												One of the best tower defense games in steam at the moment.Top graphics for the genre, good mechanics and twists, it has an interesting story and lots and lots of towers (and upgrades).You use cards to defeeat the waves. Some of them are towers and some are magic. Towers/magic cards can be upgraded to  5/15 level  using other cards via fusion. Towers can also evolve using 2 of the same tower cards to give the tower more power and that extra upgrade inside the stage (3 Upgrade levels). While this game looks like an android/ios game, the pc version is proper and I can say I enjoyed playing this in my big screen.In each stage you need to farm so you can get more and better cards for fusion or evolution and in game currency for talents and while I've been doing this a lot, it never got boring. Stages are dynamic so that each time there are a few different positions you can set your towers.All in all it is one of my favourite tower defense games and what makes it so good, is the abundancy of the towers and upgrades it has. Play it. You will love it.			"

												How many of you enjoy card collecting games like “Magic: The Gathering?” How many of you play “Defense Grid” and “Sol Survivor” religiously like your life depended on it?  If you raised your hand to both of those questions, then there’s no doubt in my mind that you’ll take a liking to “Prime World: Defenders”.  This game reminds me a bit of “BattleForge”, a card collecting real-time strategy game that I was heavily invested in for quite some time.  In this case however, you’ll be collecting cards that will form your tower defense arsenal and be tasked with slaying mutants and baddies by the thousands. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience with this game.  I’ve thrown hours into this game and have been showing no signs of slowing down any time soon.  “Prime World: Defenders” is an incredibly addicting game that I’m glad to see has brought something new to the tower defense table.  Yes, it’s a bit grindy…but I’m finding it to be the good kind of grindy.  I also want to praise the game for not including any sort of real money store or microtransaction system, which would be very easy to do in this particular type of game.  Everything purchased in the game is done via coin, which you’ll be earning as you play.  The mission generator (which you’ll see after the first few missions) adds almost unlimited replayability to the game.  My only real complaint (if you could call it one) was that the combat and tower animations were a bit generic.  While pretty, I didn’t feel “wowed” by the towers I placed or the enemies I saw…they just simply served their purpose.  If you’re looking for the bottom line, then I’ll simply say that I highly recommend it, especially for the ten dollar price tag that it currently advertises.

												There's certainly some imagination to this game, I particularly like the idea of fusing turrets and upgrading them... granted, i honestly imagined 'combining' more than just gluing together the same cards to make the next level, and must every game stop at level 3?More importantly, while the game has been fun so far, i find myself getting bored and stopping a lot... the scaling of things is too rapid past a certain point, nevermind that the 'high speed unslowable' unit of the game has no business having as much health as the 'super heavy tank' unit 'and' swarming 6 waves in a row to ensure you can't stop them. the main missions are okay for the 'most' part, but the mere fact that you have to rely on randomly acquiring the cards from a shuffled drop chest by *shudders* 'grinding' these repeatable levels, means you're either really lucky and get just what you want, or go 20 rounds trying to get that one card or grind up enough silver to get an actually useful ability... and the shuffling...I get the distinct feeling it's not as 'random' as it likes to imply... 5 cards, randomly shuffled into 5 slots... i cannot tell you how many times I've clicked on the same spot as 100/200/400 silver card was before it was shuffled, and it was still there, and likewise, how many times I have clicked through all 3 attempts while trying to get a 'unique' card that showed up, only to have i never appear.I hate to say it, but while it's fun, this game is designed to 'push' you to repeat things and play longer to collect the things you need to max out your turrets... and i 'mean' grinding to max out, because by the time you pass the second boss, you're starting turrets, even maxed out, are practically useless, especially if you're trying to beat the 'hard repeatable'... which i might add, has this nasty habit of picking small maps with few tower spots, and then filling half the spots with rocks, or more.So, bottom line, entertaining, flashy, but overall grindy and boring... but, i paid for it, and i'm a hard head, so i'm going to grind on, at least until I've seen these half a dozen mysteriously empty slots in my tower encyclopedia that somehow after all this time have still not turned up even once.P.S. OH, and i almost forgot, if they ever update this game again, They should really program in a way to tell your towers how to behave, control of one's defenses is vital for strategists... honestly, just about every tower defense game has this these days, and friggen seriously, The way the enemies can fill the lane in later waves of the hard stuff, how do you expect things to go smoothly for anyone, when the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ turrets will waste 10 rounds of mortar fire on an already crippled scarecrow that would only take '2'? seriously.P.P.S. That's another one too! you're spell scripting is suffering, it has a habit of playing the animation but then doing absolutely nothing, aka, making you completely waste your spell... unless you programmed in some sort of 'spell dodging' percentage for the enemies, or a spell failure chance... both are which are stupid, as it's raining fireballs and giant explosions, as well as still looking like they're hit.Edited adition: And holy crap! now, suddenly, the 'biters', instead of running faster themselves, make the enemies around them run faster! yo game dun broked itself!Edit 2: Oh wow! you guys have some programming issues to fix XD now completely at random, trolls and shaman's are getting permanent speed boosts from my lightning towers!Nevermind that your descriptions lie so much... 10/20/30 point heal my ♥♥♥!

												I want to recommend this game, I really do. It has nice graphics, the sound effects and music is nice, the voice work is pretty good. No bugs that I've seen and nothing that really irks me.However, I can't recommend it. The game has been left for dead by the developers in favor of the Free to Play version on Kongregate.

												This game combines both fun and interesting towers, powerups, spells, static and tower mazing placements, and a very, VERY addictive card collection and upgrade system.Don't let the cards and the card shop fool you - its all FREE. No microtransactions here.If you enjoy persistant upgrades in the form of a talent system and card ""fusing"" to upgrade your towers/spells - you can even go back to previous missions with your upgrades and get those achievements you couldn't make before - then this game is a dream come true.The many types of towers means many different ways to kill baddies and that means a lot of strategy and planning to work out the best layout for every story mission and even for the randomly generated missions too. As for the baddies, there are a fair amount of them and almost all of them have a noticable trait that forces you to tackle them with the best type of tower or face falling behind.And lets not forget the boss battles.

												This game is not worth neither your time nor the money.It was supposed to be free to pay probably according to some game mechanics (two types of ingame currency, daily rewards, random loot, lots of grinding) and is simple not enjoyable enough as regular stand alone game.If you have no luck with cards, you will have to spend insane amount of time grinding 3-4 same maps for better cards (towers are cards, upgrades are cards, magic are cards) or money, or both. You need cards and coins to upgrade anything, so you will repeat same 3 maps all the time. And that is no fun. I gave up.			"

												prequel: i have tried to place this as a continuation of a review which as written by user noibn. here is his review:http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/Posted: 19 November.	 Last edited: 27 November. i will just focus on progression system while for the rest you can read his====================================I have to say that your review is the only one which shares my opinion on the game. Was planing of writing ""something"" ""somewhere"" and wanted to inform ppl about it. Basically my opinion is everything you just wrote + one other thing about the progression system. i am not sure how this works so if i am posting on only your wall let me know :)i do not have a clue if this game is on any other platform but it is clear that the initial design (progression system) was with micro-transactions in mind. During the game you are awarded with ""Stars"" (level up, optional ""quests"", random draw, etc.) which you can than exchange for the ""rare"" booster packs and final tier upgrades (which you will need to do for sure). If they decide to place this game on Facebook/Android/iOS (or something like that) it would perfectly fit in. You even get a free random card for every day you log in (this reminded me of facebook games). There is no microtransactions in the game, just my opionion is that the design the game and progression system was with transactions in mind, then decided not to have micro transactions but they forgot to remove the ""grinding"" part. Again, just my opinion and how i see it.i have played for 16 h of the game or so. Had a lot of fun, i quite enjoyed it, got my money worth (was on a discount).Now i am not sure if i will ever finish it (currently i am aware that i have to grind for a lot of cards/gold so that i can enhance my cards and progress further). I do not have time to grind anymore... probably just getting old :)My recommendation: - if you are searching for a TD game which you would play every day for 15-20 min than i strongly recommend this game to you (every 5th day you get a rare card so will probably keep your grinding to minimum). - if you like to play games in a 1 to 3 h sessions (like me) than the grinding will get quite apparent at some point... now do you want to grind or not its up to you... story could be your motive to grind to find out how it all ends..in general, if discounted than yes. Full price? No. Add 5 more bucks and buy Defense Grid.			"

												The first few hours of the game are fun, but quickly the game becomes a tedious grind.  In order to get the towers you need to finish the game you have to keep running repeatable missions over and over again in order to get the cards you need.  I thought that the card collection/combining would be interesting, but it is just annoying.  I would rather have the towers be at their full strength and have to make the selection of which towers to bring and where to place them than turning the game into a grind.			"

For dat price I got lots of fun :) The game offers lots of achievements, different quality of towers (normal, rare, unique...), artifacts, magic, store where you can buy random towers, awesome storyline with side quests, random tower drop after finishing a mission, exp, leveling, skills and much more! Really dudes I am so addicted :(Anyway The most disadvantage of this game is a random tower drop (ironically). Because in later levels  you should get the lighting tower and if not you will have to reset the whole game (account) and start over again... Dat was my case bcs i did not get dat tower :(For me 8/10!			"

												The most important thing about a game is 'is it fun?' All of the warts don't really matter if you're smiling a bit as you play.  Prime World: Defenders is fun, especially if you like tower defense games (TD). The UI is near enough to perfect that it should be standard to TD games the same way that WASD is standard to FPS games. Yup, its that good! The gameplay mechanics are pretty standard, the baddies come marching in, dumb and happy to a horrible end, killed by bog standard towers. Oh well, you don't fix what ain't broke! The innovation appears in the form of a random collectable card mechanic where you get random  cards as loot for beating a map, which are towers, artifacts, or magic. You can combine two of the same to evolve it, allowing towers to be upgraded or you can fuse multiple cards into one to increase its level, making it more powerful. Its more complicated than I'm explaining it, and its very satisfying.My only beef is with the voice acting, which is awful, but skippable. Now go away, I'm gonna play some more!			"

												Ridiculously underated on metacritic. This is a MUST play for fans of tower defense. It may be a little grindy but the tower leveling mechanic is undeniably rewarding. I love tower defense and I'm loving this game. The graphic novel ""cut scenes"" are also very good, the music works well, the enemy is varied, the game style is very appealing and the difficulty ramps in a reliably linear fashion. The selection of achievements challenge you to approach each level in different ways, often asking you to step outside any ""standard"" approach you may be favouring at any one time, which is a refreshing take on how to use achievement within the tower defense experience. Overall I say ignore metacitic! Buy this if it's a genre you enjoy...			"

												Pretty decent tower defense. It took me while to realize you need only a 3 attack towers and 2 utility to win every mission. All other towers are totally useless. You have to grind hard from the start to upgrade towers using cards but then it is easy game. You can just one shot every mission including heroic mode. The game is ported from mobile devices and sometimes it have very bad controls and I don't even talk about hotkeys layout. Which can't be changed ... + It tries to tell a story ...+ nice idea with cards system and upgrading towers outside of missions+ nice graphic and music- grind, grind, grind, grind ...- horrible hotkeys layout- too easy- dumb achievements ... 10000 towers and 500 wins, like really? I manage to complete a game with like 3k towers and 2 hundreds wins. Grind, grind, grindI will recommend the game but I played much better tower defense games then this one. If you are searching only for some time consuming game it is game for you, but not recommended for hardcore tower defense fans.			"

												A well executed twist of a tower defense mixed with card collection. Involves strategy, but allow different strategies to beat the levels, which is always nice. I hate games where you are given a bunch of options, but to win you have to chose a particular one. Never felt this was one of those games. You eventually will have to grind, but i found it an enjoyable grinding never felt repetitive. Mainly because, while ""grinding"" you can beat one mission you already passed trying new cards/spells you earned. It's like you are grinding but at the same time, you are training and experimenting the best ways to beat the upcoming levels. You get the feel that you are always progressing, which i appreciate a lot.The card evolution/fusing system it's also very interesting, and adds a lot to the game.The visuals and voice acting are also enjoyable, not great, but they do their job decently.

Most crucial among those is a progression system that allows you to level up your towers between missions through a collectible card system. You can buy additional cards as well as boosters with ingame currency (no microtransactions whatsoever in the steam version) and use those to evolve your towers, unlocking the ability to upgrade them during missions, or infuse them, making them more effective. Different tower cards also have different rarities, with some being straight upgrades from their common versions. This leads to the first major flaw with the game, as the card rewards for side-missions are random, leaving you hoping for a specific tower to drop because at some point in the game, about 10-12 story missions in, you will hit a brick wall of difficulty. Once you get the next 'tier' of basic towers properly evolved and infused it becomes easier again, but getting these towers is mostly a case of farming sidemissions in hopes that RNG will bless you with the right rewards. I feel the upgrade system worked well inherently, but adding tiers to the towers completely broke it.Difficulty tends to be all over the place in general. For example, finishing the normal mode of the game unlocks a heroic mode and two extra long survival missions. But with the towers required to beat the last level I had zero difficulty in the survival missions, often mashing the rush button to send in more gits because my towers ground everything to paste from start to finish. The heroic modes also felt hugely dissapointing, as I was able to blitz all of them with next to no effort up to the last level, which I overcame with two retry's and a bit of tweaking the tower placements.The missions themselves however, are well-built for the most part, with the only hiccup being the randomized levels you get for your sidemissions. The game essentialy re-uses previously finished levels and adds random buffs to some tiles and inpassable rocks to the other. This meant you couldn't rely on a single layout and had to adapt, which greatly increased their replay value. Admittedly it could benefit from removing the first few levels from the map pool, since they're so small you run out of things to build or upgrade halfway through the harder sidemissions and can only sit and cast the odd spell, waiting for the waves to inevitably overrun your defense.The towers themselves start out rather bland with the basic all-round tower, the slow tower and the anti-air tower, but later tiers add some much needed variety, with the highest tier offering some interesting options to mix and match into all new ways to make the Touched's lives impossible.The Touched is the generic enemy faction in this game and consist of a collection of fantasy villains like kobolds, ogres and trolls. The only remarkable enemy is the pink floating marshmallow... thing that occasionally teleports forward and suddenly sneaks past your defenses. No really, you'll know it when you see it... and then you'll rage.The game has a story and a linear set of missions to follow along with that, but it's cringeworthy at best. There's no major twists, even if the game tries very hard to set one up for you. The voice-acting is mostly terrible, with a special place in hell for the short snippets played during the missions.TLDR: the gameplay is good, but beware that the difficulty can spike wildly between missions and most of the times the only solution is to farm sidemissions. Also there's a story, but who plays tower defense games for the story?			"

												While this game is fun, the original developers have all left the company that is responsible for the upkeep of the game.  Achievements do not work and there is no guarantee they will start working again.  There is no developer support.  For that reason, and until the game is fixed, I do not recommend buying it.  Sorry to everyone that bought it in the holiday/seasonal sales; it's apparently been broken for months.  I didn't notice until a few days ago.Gameplay wise, the TD mechanics are solid and the card system makes for an interesting twist on figuring out a playstyle that works for you with the cards you have.  There are, however, a few missions along the way that simply cannot be beaten unless you and your cards are leveled up enough.  You simply won't have enough damage to outpace healing, for example, or you won't be able to kill the flyers and the ground units with the resources available unless both sets of towers are strong enough to hit the benchmark of cost efficiency necessary to kill stuff before it gets to the end of the maze.  That, to me, is bad design.  It isn't enough to prevent me to urge anyone not to buy it, but you should be aware of the possibility of needing to grind to get strong enough to beat certain levels.  Other than that, I recommend it.			"

												I feel the metacritic rating for this game is pointlessly harsh.I quite enjoyed myt ime with Prime World: Defenders!  The art style is pretty enjoyable, the towers are fun, and I really liked the CCG mechanics.  There IS grinding in this game, but I was never really afraid to grind.  Only once (to get a full dragon tower) did it feel like a slog.Anyways, it's a fun tower defense game.  The story is... well, not great.  The voice acting could use some work, but at least the art direction is pretty good.  There was a relatively decent selection of maps, and each time it's slightly randomized to add a bit of replayability.Anyways, I had fun with it and if combining CCG and Tower Defense mechanics is alluring to you, I think you'll like it too!

												I'm starting to see why the metascore is quite low. Despite it being low, the game has it's good moments. At start, I loved the game, I still play it from time to time. The idea of having different towers and magic abilities, which you can customize, is great. Towers and magic are aquired through cards. When it comes to customization, it means you can customize what towers you take with you and you can reinforce these towers with fusing different cards. The crafting isn't hard to grasp, you either improve a card or evolve a card. Evovling meaning, ie. a tower can be upgraded to the next level, meaning you can in-game upgrade the tower. There are 3 tiers when it comes to evolution, default, upgraded and max evolution.It is a great game, but playing and progressing requires you to play same map, again and again. At some point through the main story, you will get the next map which you can finish, if you can't you have three different challenges from where you get more cards, easy, medium and hard. These kind becomes your bread and butter, grinding these challenges for more cards, so that you can progress and make better towers.At some point, you will notice that there are very little variety to the game. Challenge maps will be recycled, which imo, isn't too bad. But you will see same enemies over and over again, in different colors. The challenge will be different, even though you have the same enemy, but the only difference is that the monster can tank more damage.If you don't mind the grinding and similiarites through the game, I would recommend this game. Good game with an good idea, but somewhat poorly designed. I think the metascore is true and correct, but that doesn't mean the game is bad or not fun. I would recommend watching some gameplay vids, before considering buying the game. Still a decent tower defense game.			"

												Positives:* Probably the most fun TD game I have played so far.  Lots of tower variety that lets you pick your strategy.  * I like the concept of using cards to help your towers get better.  Fusing cards to upgrade towers and their abilities.  Would love to see this aspect evolved more in a future game to create whole new towers.Negatives:* Small map selection leads you to play the same maps repeatedly.* Overall map size is fairly small.  Sometimes I wish for bigger map sizes like in Defense Grid where you can make the enemies choose the path. * No ability to go back a wave or two such as in other games like Defense Grid.  This means if you mess up tower placement or something else you have to restart the entire round.  * Developer seems to have abandoned the game for the android/facebook platform.  As such the main story leaves you hanging with a very incomplete ending to the story.			"

												A mix between a card-collecting game and tower defense is an incredibly awesome concept, but unfortunately this game is very poorly executed. The difficulty spikes are too steep, requiring you to grind ""challenges"" (which are really just previous levels) constantly. By the midway point of the game, you are literally spending >90% of your time just grinding. If there wasn't so much grinding, this would be a great game, but would probably only last three hours. As it stands, it's a bad 30 hour game due to the 27 hours of grinding.On the upside, the music and graphics are well-done.  The variety of towers is also pretty good.But oh lawd dat grindin'.			"

												Love this game, its a great single player defense game, it uses the basic defense game features, you position your defenses in specific locations to stop the waves of enemies reaching there target, you then collect resources by killing enemies, the more you collect the more defenses you can use against the enemy as the waves get bigger and stronger.You play alot of the same maps but they do change as you progress through the game.They also use a card feature where you use and collect specific cards for better defenses and upgrades etc, its good fun.

												A spinoff of the mediocre MOBA, PW:Defenders is a decent enough tower defense game.  A handful of maps become ""randomized"" with obstacles to change your strategy from play to play, but you will ultimately find a balance of towers to suit your play-style.  The acquisition of cards/towers being the hardest part, involving lots of grinding and luck to get what you need.  The crafting system is poorly explained, but with a little trial and error it can be figured out.  Or look to the forums and guides to tell you the two important things the game doesn't tell you.What killed the game for me is the constant bugs and sudden loss of data.  Towers don't always hit their mark, bonuses are either not correctly applied or explained incorrectly, daily rewards and store offers disappear/reappear randomly, and achievements will stop functioning after a certain level.  This prevents any further progress through Steam's system, though they can still be earned in game.  Not long after losing the ability to gain Steam achievements my data was completely lost with no hope of recovery.  Still not sure how that happened, probably an error on their server regarding saves.Looking to the forums shows absolutely no further dev interaction, patches, or support.  This is essentially dead software.  If you are hoping for patches or fixes, either the community will have to find a work around, or you're ♥♥♥♥ outta luck.  I bought this on sale for $2.00, and certainly got my money's worth out of it.  Even if I didn't complete it.  But at current full price of $10, it is definitely not worth it at all.			"

												Edit: It seems the free version on kong gets updated but not this. And servers are down, so no more achievments either. Pfffff. Changed to not recommend.---As a td-fan i general I liked this TD a lot. Maybe not the best TD out there, but far from the worst. Problems:You have to choose which advanced towers you want to level up first (since maxing them all takes a very long time) and you can gimp yourself badly if you ""guess wrong tower"". There is also a very non-intuitive way to combine stronger towers by leveling towers before you combine them (instead of after) - which you'll probably figure out way too late. And if you care about 100% achievments, don't even bother. The build 10000 towers is such a time sink you wouldn't believe. (Having finished the game 100% and maxed all tower cards, I still haven't finished the leadup achievment (2500 towers).  Dear god.But all in all. It's fun for one run-through. Takes a few days.			"

												Fun little tower defence game with CCG-lite elements - no purchasing using real cash, don't worry. Blow up mobs, use the cash and XP gained to pick up talents for yourself and level-up your towers. Lots of different towers to play with, though the ""random loot"" system means you may be hunting for the best ones for a while. There are a reasonable number of maps, and a semi-randomisation system - different building sites will be open and different bonuses placed each time you play a level - add a good deal of longevity. I enjoyed it a lot and sank quite a lot of time into it. It's certainly a lot better than its Metascore would indicate.			"

												Defense Grid meets collectible card games. It has exactly the mechanics of DG (I find this a good thing) but the towers and powers are randomized drops and craftable cards, so the levels aren't so much like pre-determined puzzles and there's the thrill of opening booster packs to get a rare tower. I get the feeling that this was going to be a micropayment F2P title, but they scrapped that and switched to a normal price tag closer to launch and made all the stuff accessible with ingame loot. It's interesting to play something that maybe was designed to squeeze you dry and then it actually lets you have all the toys and fun without gouging your wallet.

												Prime World: Defenders is a tower defense game where you face wave of enemies. Each level has set achievements in place so if you like achievements this is a great game for you to get stuck into. I think it has over 150 achievements though some are bugged which is a shame because it then becomes a completionists nightmare.Graphically for an indie tower defense game it looks really quite nice. Its clean and aesthetically pleasing though interface options don't have a great deal of options to fiddle around with in terms of graphic settings and such and the main menu is very bare bones, The game itself is ok, I enjoy it though there is alot of grinding you have to do to improve towers to progress in levels. As well as getting the max star rating and set goals/achievements, so that can turn some people away. Their is some form of story but its not fleshed out whatsoever so at points because your grinding so much you will forget their even is one. From a tower defense perspective theirs alot of better games (Dungeon Defenders, Fieldrunners 2 and Sanctum 2 to name a few) but Prime World: Defenders is still a better than average game although it just brings nothing new to the genre. Their are coupons which i think take 75% off the price bringing it to around £3.00 so if you can get it for £3-4 its worth it i'd say but overall i'd give it a 6/10.			"

												It's a nice Tower Defense kind of game but at some point you get the opportunity to farm before you decide to complete the level and if you farm too much, the challenge is kinda gone. If this happens, just use the ""next wave"" button a few times and perhaps it will become more challenging again. Besides that, I like the concept of this game and is has some nice features that I hadn't seen in other games before.If you manage to get this game for five bucks or under, it's a solid buy in my opinion.

												Defense Grid meets collectible card games. It has exactly the mechanics of DG (I find this a good thing) but the towers and powers are randomized drops and craftable cards, so the levels aren't so much like pre-determined puzzles and there's the thrill of opening booster packs to get a rare tower. I get the feeling that this was going to be a micropayment F2P title, but they scrapped that and switched to a normal price tag closer to launch and made all the stuff accessible with ingame loot. It's interesting to play something that maybe was designed to squeeze you dry and then it actually lets you have all the toys and fun without gouging your wallet. If this was F2P I'd have quit within the first hour, but now I find it very enjoyable and fair. Here's an example, devs!			"

												Prime World: Defenders is a tower defense game where you face wave of enemies. Each level has set achievements in place so if you like achievements this is a great game for you to get stuck into. I think it has over 150 achievements though some are bugged which is a shame because it then becomes a completionists nightmare.Graphically for an indie tower defense game it looks really quite nice. Its clean and aesthetically pleasing though interface options don't have a great deal of options to fiddle around with in terms of graphic settings and such and the main menu is very bare bones, The game itself is ok, I enjoy it though there is alot of grinding you have to do to improve towers to progress in levels. As well as getting the max star rating and set goals/achievements, so that can turn some people away. Their is some form of story but its not fleshed out whatsoever so at points because your grinding so much you will forget their even is one. From a tower defense perspective theirs alot of better games (Dungeon Defenders, Fieldrunners 2 and Sanctum 2 to name a few) but Prime World: Defenders is still a better than average game although it just brings nothing new to the genre. Their are coupons which i think take 75% off the price bringing it to around £3.00 so if you can get it for £3-4 its worth it i'd say but overall i'd give it a 6/10.			"

												Nicely executed, nice random card concept, nice graphics :) A good choice for TD fans. Some players report achievement (non) unlocking issues although I didn't experience this behaviour so far. The only thing I would gripe for is the excessive grinding required at some stages in order to upgrade your available arsenal. Metascore of 58/100 is definitely very much away from reality. This is a TD game not CoD or BF.			"

												It's a nice Tower Defense kind of game but at some point you get the opportunity to farm before you decide to complete the level and if you farm too much, the challenge is kinda gone. If this happens, just use the ""next wave"" button a few times and perhaps it will become more challenging again. Besides that, I like the concept of this game and is has some nice features that I hadn't seen in other games before.If you manage to get this game for five bucks or under, it's a solid buy in my opinion.

												Has lots of ""grind"" - suggest you buy it cheap and don't plan to finish it.This feels like it was designed as a free-to-play game - premium currency, random loot, destroying multiple cards to get slightly better ones, lots of grind on the same levels, lots of achievements, remote server - but they chickened out at the last minute.However, it is complete, and it is playable - albeit slowly. After the tutorial it has a ""hub"" design where there is a difficult plot level, and several easier levels you grind on until your cards/towers are good enough. This can take dozens of steps, but you only get rewards for victory so there is little incentive to push yourself. There are only a few different maps, but the monotony is broken up by randomized booster / obstacle placement.Despite the flaws, the combination of CCG and tower defense is very strong and there is a good variety of cards/towers. Looks good, performs well, runs stably. Writing, music, and sounds are okay, but not great.			"

												Update - The Game servers are now back online.Nival support is refusing to respond to any inquiries about an issue everyone is having with the pc version of Prime World Defenders. It appears the servers have been shut down again which prevents achievements and game progress from being maintained. I think it is in bad form to simply shut down the servers, ignore any communication from the player base, and continue to sell the game on Steam without indicating these features are unavailable. There are several discussions on the Steam forums about this very issue and it is not showing your company in a positive light. I would appreciate a response one way or another so we can know if this has been done intentionally or if you were unaware. Obviously we would like to see the servers turned back on.			"

												Best tower defense I've ever played. Addictive gameplay that actually makes you want to play it again and again, with different strategies and scenarios. Prime World: Defenders has some real balance issues, though. At some point you realize that less than half the available towers and spells are actually worth using and upgrading. When you finish the game you unlock the Heroic mode (same stages with increased difficulty) and the feeling of progress goes down to zero because the stages are insanely hard and grinding does nothing for you anymore. There's also some randomness in your rewards that can screw you really hard if you're unlucky.  Regardless of that I definetely recommend this game for anyone looking for a good tower defense (which is really hard to find). It could use some adjustements but it's fun and addictive in a way few games manage to be.EDIT: I changed my evaluation to NEGATIVE because the devs are a bunch of greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I had no idea they were ignoring the Steam version in favor of a FTP, ""pay to win"" mobile version.			"

												I just had to make a comment on this game after reading the other reviews and seeing that this game got a very low Metascore.Almost every negative post on this game complains about the ""grind"" yet has less than 10 hours total even played for the game. Yes, to get the ""legendary"" stuff in this game you must actually play the game!?!? A shocker, I know. To think the devs actually want you to play the game that you just got.    Zzz...  Sarcasm aside, this game really is pretty fun. It blends TD, char lvling to gain new skills and also the collecting of cards to gain access to new towers and spells. You then sacrifice extra cards to towers you like to make them stronger. I honestly hope to see more games like this. This game is just as ground breaking to TD as Dungeon Defenders was. The addition of actuall loot in my mind is what makes it shine, but clearly other lazy folks don't agree and just thumbs downed the game without even trying. Granted I've only had it for 1 day but I've logged 10+hours in that time & can't wait till I wake up later to play it some more. As far as the metascore I really am stumped, this is the most fun I've had on a game in awhile and all for under $10. If it goes on sale again it's worth a look.			"

												At first glance this game doesn't impress me - I don't like such childish sharp art. But I install demo and find out that it's fun and enthralling.There are some minuses, especially when you haven't necessary card just before mission, and should play additional missions many many times, before needed card drops. A disappointment for me was lack of Ukrainian localization, that was announced. Beta has it, but official release still doesn't. Also there was some problems with achievements synchronization with Steam, but now it seems better.In general it's very good tower defence and I enjoy it.			"

												I like tower defense games, but most suffer from a lack of originality or repetitive gameplay, or other things like lack of challenge/interaction. Prime World suceed as a 'prime' TD game on these points, the towers and spells are actually cards you can find, upgrade, combine, and so on, gaining new specifications everytime. How you play the game and customize everything can vary greatly from one game to another, as you may not find the same cards at the same moments. A must play in my opinion. i enjoyed myself. Oh and the game offer replay value with increased difficulty challenges and a form of new game plus where you can redo levels in harder modes.-Lost			"

Combines a unique RPG aspect to the game, with a fully customizable set of characters in which you must progress through and unlock.  Of course, as with any free to play game, you can always spend daddy's pay checks to further advance your progression within the castle, however, by doing this you really are eliminating one of key features that this MMOBA offers, in which it's competitors have yet to incorporate. 5 out of 5 stars.

												First off - the metascore baffles me, but then again, I hate the idea of ""scores entirely"". However, the important question is, is Prime World Defenders worth your time?Yes, I say, if you like tower defence and collectable card games. Prime World Defenders does an amazing job of mixing the two genres (two of my personal favourites) into one, a collectable card tower defence! I have had a huge amount of fun with this game, and I think any tower defence fan will too. It has some great mechanics and is aesthetically pleasing.One of the biggest gripes amongst reviewers for this game, is the grinding. Not going to lie, there are ""grinding"" elements to it, and you do replay certain levels, however they are mixed up each time, with different obstacles in the way, with just enough variety to get by. Personally I didn't see it as a big issue, however some might.Personally, I would highly recommend this game!+ Well pulled off merge of tower defence and collectable card games.+ Pleasing aesthetic.+ Great variety of towers.+ Some unique and interesting mechanics.- ""Grinding"" may put some people off.- Information on some of the ""Forging"" and ""Evolution"" GUI isn't explained properly.

												Minor problems make the game annoying for someone getting started.  Pet peave= If you hover your mouse over a tower or even select a tower in game, it does not tell you what tower you have selected or what tower you are about to build.  You pretty much have to learn what tower is what based on the picture or what the tower looks like.  I may be missing something, but I have been playing for a while now and always seem to build the wrong tower.  There are also places where if you place a tower there, you get a buff of some sort.  But there is no indication of what that buff does until you actually place a tower there, making it too late if you make a mistake.Other than that, the game is amazing!  Definetely recommend to the hardcore tower defense fans!  TD newbs may want to start with a more mainstream game like Bloons TD or Kingdom Rush.  All in all I recommend this game, but NOT WORTH FULL PRICE!  Wait for a sale!			"

												Prime World Defenders is the best tower defense game on PC. It combines a classic TD-game with a trading card game with many features, looks very nice and you can choose many different play styles, all what you need in a good TD-game. But you need to grind a little bit to get these cards or you buy booster-packs from the ingame-store, don’t worry, it’s not pay-2-win. If you are not sure, try the demo version of this game or the free version on iOS or Android.StoryThis game has not really a story with a meaning. It’s completely irrelevant and can be ignored, how all TD-games oyu play this for the gameplay and not for a interesting story. GameplayLike a standard TD-game you do exactly the same in Prime World Defenders. You choose a level and build your towers to defense your base against the enemies. There are fixed points to build the towers and some of them have special effects like more damage or areas that increase the range or the attack speed. There are also magic spells including freeze, fire, thunderbolt etc.To be able to upgrade your towers you must collect trading cards and to get them, you need to finish the levels or collect silver and buy some booster-packs from the store. Every Tower or magic spell is a card and you need two of them to combine them to upgrade them ingame. To level up your cards you can use very card, depending on how rare the cards are you get more or less experience points.After finishing all levels in the normal mode you unlock the hard mode. To beat this and maybe to collect all the achievements, you have to grind a long time.GraphicPrime World Defenders looks nice for a TD-Game. The game has a comic style with nice visual effects and is very clear, also the User Interface. The UI is very big because it’s just a port from mobile devices. Prime World Defenders is the best tower defense game on the PC. It looks very nice and clear, it’s not pay-2-win and you have a lot to do if you want. It is also the best TD-game on the iPad. If you have both, I recommend you to choose the tablet version. Unfortunately you can’t synchronize your progress between mobile version and Steam. That’s the only negative point here. "

The whole card idea and tower defense is an intersting concept.. so 2 stars were given for that alone.			"

												I am really glad I got past my first impression of PW:D.After a couple of maps I thought this was another hurriedTD wannabe, perhaps not as bad as Towers of Altrac, but in an adjacent league.  I was wrong.It's true there are not many maps, and it's true there isquite a lot of grinding involved, but that, together with a random handicap system lets you experiment with different combination of towers, of which there are a great many.Upgrading your towers can be performed by joining two identical ones or by fusing the base tower with any card available.Card drops are well implemented* and provide a near constantstream of new towers, spells and buffs.This has become my go-to casual game, as due to the aforementionedsmall number of maps I probably would not enjoy long sessions, but it's perfect for a couple of rounds while you wait for yourflying monkeys to come back to your hidden refuge... or whatever it is you do for a living.*When the games servers are up, otherwise you do get in-gamerewards but miss the daily reward or just the increment, getting stuck to day one.  Bummer.________Useful tip:if you should fail to get the daily card, try going back to the Main Menu and clicking on PLAY again.  It works for me...			"

												Prime World: Defenders is a fun game if you like tower defense games (or maybe card games). I like the speeding up function and I'm not sure about its cards theme, but the story and the style in which is told is also kind of cool, yet I can't help but feel that the game is a bit repetitive sometimes... almost mmm grindy. But oh well. When you're done with the game, you can start all over again thanks to its heroic mode... but by that time I had already had enough, so I'd say I'm done. Besides, the developers have not fixed some of the problems the steam version has, like, for example, the fact that some of the achievements simply do not work. Personally, I do recommend the game... as long as you get it super cheap and you know where you're getting into.			"

												A rather difficult and tedious Tower Defence game. Does it mean that it's bad? No ofcourse not. I enjoyed it quite alot. Lots of grinding required but it really helps you move forward so it's not pointless grinding to the point where you just become bored.A big diversity in towers, and while having completed the main game, I have yet to unlock all towers or fully upgrade the ones I have. Also, the types of towers are very unique for as far as my experiences goes in Tower Defence games. There aren't that many enemies but they all are different and each type has unique 'abilities' and strategies that are required to beat them. If you enjoy Tower Defence games that are rather difficult but also very satisfying when it comes to grind and strategy, then this is a good pick.			"

												Metascore of 58 (17/9-13) is way to low. This game is great on many levels.I love the single-player aspect of it, having you believe it's played online with daily bonuses, store etc. It's also a fun and good Tower Defense game. It's very grindy, but the newest patch has evened it out some and i'm happy as it is now.It's got a slightly steep learning curve, but read some guides and have patience and it pays off.It looks great, fantastic art and graphic-style. The story is awesome with cartoon cut-scenes draws me in.I'm perhaps 1/3 to 1/2 through the game now and so far i have no problem recommending it !			"

												Starts out good enough, but eventually turns into a ♥♥♥♥-fest where you simply don't have the fire-power to beat a stage if you haven't acquire the specific, epic-level type of turrets that you need to beat the type of enemies that the next quest deploys, and/or you've spent the upgrading materials you had unwisely (aka you were dumb to assume that the game was balanced and spent them materials on regular turrets.For example, next quest has small flying enemies, and you got a turret for land-based, big enemies? Too bad. ♥♥♥♥ you and farm the previous quests for another 10 hours until you get the turret. And don't you worry, the next one will be primarly BIG airborne enemies. But we'll also throw enough of everything else to ensure that you don't pass it anyway unless you have EVERYTHING improved.It reeks of p2w, but it isn't p2w, because it''s the pc version. At that point you can tell why the devs have abandoned it in favor of the mobile version.			"

Collecting new tower cards and forging to customize your experience. Has a ""log in each day"" reward, which is a bit odd, but since it's a great ""few maps per day"" game I don't mind.This is one of those games you keep installed at all times and boot up whenever you feel like playing a few rounds.

												My first impressions of Prime World: Defenders…I like it A LOT!!!  Yes, there is a lot of grinding to do and I am not that far into it, so I am not going to really review the game yet.  Just know that I play a lot of Tower Defense (TD ) games and so far Prime World: Defenders is one of my favorite.  The 3D graphics are superb, the gameplay is fun, but might be a bit grindy for some people, the sound is great with excellent music.  Every thing else is done right and very colorful!  All the menus are pleasing to the eye and the world map is awesome!  The choice of creatures is the best feature and they are all rendered in stunning 3D!!!  The towers and animations look great!  The list goes on and on...The only negative thing that I found was that you can only grind the maps so many times before you stop getting silver and experience points for beating them.  Then you have to move along to the next map and grind that map to it's max times.  I think you can grind each map around 10 times or so.  I haven't counted, but it's enough to get some of your perks leveled up.  The cards really only represent the towers and do not come into play during combat like the card game Magic.  You will stack them to level your towers and magic, so to speak.  There are special cards to find and add to your towers too.  This is all done outside of combat.  Combat is your typical tower defense setup, but leveling towers happens outside of combat.  Makes sense and is pretty cool! :-)The game is a little hard, but easier than some of the other TD games I've played.  I'll have to play some more and then come back and review it.  I do like it a lot so far.  The game is solid and has not crashed on me yet.Here are my system specifications: iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8.

												Pros:-fair graphics-fair plot-good music-combines Tower-Defense with TCG feel.-easy controls-Upgradable towers, spells, and talents.-Daily rewards-Fairly long campaign with corresponding subquests, all replayable.Cons:-It can get REALLY hard if you dont have the correct towers available.  On the flip side it can be too easy if you were lucky enough to get the more powerfull towers early and it makes it boring.-1/3 through the game you start wishing there were more types of towers/spells.-Minimal replay value.All this said:For a tower-defense game, it's quite good.  Better than most tower-defense in fact.Decent for the price if you can catch it on sale.			"

												Personal Rating: 4/10Kinda hard to put in words about what's good and what not. Overall it is a pretty decent tower defense game. You will need to collect cards and upgrade and fuse them for stronger towers and spells. It may give a refreshing twist to the game at first but down the road, the card system seems rather unnecessary and redundant because the towers and spells obsolete and replaced with a stronger upgraded version of it. Cards must be fused with the same kind in order for you to upgrade in-game. Again, this is a waste of effort due to the fact that lower level towers are practically useless. Each levels spawn 3 optional gameplay for you to grind levels and earn additional cards, stars and coins. All these features are prime example of mindless grinding and in game purchases including the daily log in reward (YES! this game has a daily reward system) which I think is great for mobile play (and YES! again this is a mobile port). If you really loved tower defense game, I would recommend Defense Grid or Kingdom Rush to this.			"

												This game is actually fun, but it smells like a former free to play game and therfore, has a huge amount of pointless grind in  it, which manifests itself in replaying the same 2 ""booster levels"" over and over again until you got enough money to upgrade your cards.As I said, it is a good game, but the grind makes it less fun to play.

												Prime World: Defenders was my first experience of a tower defense game on PC. The game will have you grind and grind to improve your towers. Yet, this game has alot of charm, I spent alot of time playing and kept coming back for more. Love the art style and tower cards. Defenders got me hooked on tower defense games. The holiday sale is almost upon us, buy it on sale. If your new to tower defense games give it a try!			"

												Fight off hordes of monstrous mutants created from a strange cataclysmic event in the new tower defense game, Prime World: Defenders. Join a group of exile treasure hunters who have ventured into the capital of an ancient empire, vast with mystery and danger. Prime World: Defenders merges classic tower defense gameplay with collectible card mechanic. Your towers, your spells, your traps - all are magic cards, that you can collect and upgrade. You'll have to develop your own strategy, because you'll get your random set of cards after each battle. Freeze, burn, poison, explode and slash countless enemies that will try to stop you from gathering artifacts of old kingdom. Choose your cards carefully, play them strategically and expect some heavy resistance along the way – from small and almost harmless mutated fungi to powerful giant goblins and nagas. Did we mention? In addition to story-driven single-player campaign Prime World: Defenders has randomly generated missions, newly added endless mode and New Game Plus!			"

												Decent tower defence game with few annoing rpg aspects and a lacking guiding the creeps feature on 80% of levels. You unlock towers at random and some point grinding for levels, exp and/or silver may be required, atleast it was for me. But if that isnt too big of a problem for you then this game will give you many hours worth of content.edit: Developer has disabled previously available features.

												After seeing the 58% metacritic score, I was hesitant to pick this up ... and now I'm seriously baffled what game the reviewers were playing.  User reviews over at strategy informer give it a 8.8/10 average, which is more in line with where I'd put it.The CCG mechanics are well implemented, the difficulty range for side missions goes from yawn inducing easy, to fiendishly difficult, with ample reward for toughing out those harder levels in the form of chances at rarer cards.It's well polished, excellent visuals, and adds interesting mechanics to a somewhat stale genre.  Features a long campaign w/some interesting boss battles, and repeatable semi-random side missions.  There's a vast variety of towers and spells available, and a number of ways in which to acquire and improve on them.  There's an in game store (using IN GAME credit, not a cash store), drops from side missions, drops from official missions, daily rewards and to top it off a crafting system of sorts for 'forging' and 'evolving' towers/spells, to make good use of duplicates or obsolete cards.I can only assume the 'grindy' complaints were people wanting ALL of the various towers and spells available *quickly* ... but then that would kill the replayability, knowing there's nothing new to drop - and no new strategies to be born from a new tower/spell in the mix?  I'd give it a 9/10 ... only complaints I can think of - back story was weak, and while the voice overs were done well, they could use more variety.  Highly, highly recommended hidden gem of a game - if you like tower defense, don't hesitate.			"

												Prime World Defenders gets a lot of flack for being ""unbalanced"" but I've never really gotten that impression from the game.  There were maps that were difficult, and maps that were easy; but none of the game mechanics lead me to believe that this game was inbalanced enough to hinder enjoyment.  In fact, the hardest part about this game was navigating the series of crashes that riddled the game towards the later stages.  These have since been fixed, but at the time they were very cumbersome.The premise of the game is like any Tower Defense game:  stop the zerging monsters from reaching your core by any means possible.  This game is different from others in its genre through it's use of currency and experience points to add meta-game character development aspect.  Use Silver or Stars (earned by completing levels perfectly and acquiring achievements) to unlock Talents which improve your abilities or let you hold more cards (which are Towers or Spells) in your hand or deck, and improve your cards by leveling them up throughout the game.  Upgrading Towers is a standby in all Tower Defense games; but in Prime World Defenders, you have to improve your tower's card before you can improve it in each match. For Tower Defense enthusiasts, this is a must-grab title.  It's not without faults, but it's one of the more enjoyable games that I've played this year.			"

												Great game!Solid TD game witout doubt.Pro's:-Card mechanic is great. You 'waste' many hours to get a clone for your unique card to evolve it.-Forging and evolving adds a bit depth.-Solid gameplay, good graphics and great towers.Con's:-Maybe a bit basic.Love this game, and recommend it to TD enthusiasts as well as beginners. Love the art style, and the graphics.Card mechanic is great and adds longevity, since you are constantly looking for the next great card.Evolving and forging is a great idea, but I want to see the game expand upon it. Maybe in a sequel?Where you can transfer random abilities (strength +10%, chance to stun 5% etc.) by sacrifying cards.All in all, highly recommended. Get it now! :)			"

												Prime World: Defenders gets it right by combining a solid understanding of tower defense concepts with a card game. You're not just strategizing tower placement but building and maintaining a 'deck' of towers and spells. The fusing system allows you to combine and upgrade the cards you win through victories or purchase at the store (using in-game currency.) This game is a fair deal at $10 and a steal at $3.40!			"

												Good game, it's fun, relatively easy to understand and the card system is well implemented but the grind required is absolutely stupid for a game like this. Really, it is some seriously ♥♥♥♥ing brutal grind, what makes it even worse is that the cards you need are completely random and you need 3 of them to make them anywhere near useful. In over a hunder battles i've recieved 3 unique cards as a reward. There is simply too much randomness to the games rewards. random selection of a random set of cards after each level, even from the shop the boosters and chest force eaither a random roll or a random selection fo a randomly rolled set of cards. It's fine at the start but it really gets old when you're relegated to grinding for stars (random chance of recieving 1-3 ~ every 20 levels, you need 20 for a 3 pack of uniques) for a random chance of getting the card you need.Still worth playing but don't expect to complete the game unless you're willing to invest a serious amount of time.

												This game is awesome if you know what to expect. It's basically like a tower defense game tied to grinding to get coins/stars to buy cards to improve your 'deck' of towers. It reminds me of a game I would find on mobile except the mobile would be a crappy ""freemium"" game that you wish was available on its own for a price. Definitely not saying this is a 'mobile' quality game, definitely much better than that, I just wanted to try and explain how it takes some concepts that freemium ""abuses"" and incorporates into the gameplay to make it actually fun.

												One of the best Tower Defense Games I have ever played, it has an awesome mechanics, the card and upgrading concept is just fantastic, it works random, so no one will have the same expirience at the start of the game (later it's possible to max everything), you will find yourself doing the same stage 3-5 times and enjoying it just to get the achievements, there are ""grinding"" stages where you will be able to boost your cards, after you complete the story there will be a real challenge, the INFERNO mode, where things will be really harder, so this will test your knowledge of the game. The game has a great replayability and you will enjoy it for many hours, and for sure you will want to max everything, it's really worth the price, 100% recommended.I haven't completed the game yet, I will improve this review later.

Game have really nice graphic, composed with nice soundtrack.  It bring so much fun in playing that! Actually i hadn't need to spend to much time on farming (while i'm writting those words, i have 2 ufinished map, 50% achivment compleated, and about 60% cards fully upgradet). There is only one wrong thing in that game: ballance beetwen cards: there are few, so OP cards that you can compleate game having only one kind of tower (!).All to all, i can give this game 95/100, and wait for continuation.

												Only played for 5 hours so far, but wanted to share findings to now.I read several reviews before buying, and if it hadn't have been reduced I probably would have waited until it was.That said, it is a good game - I've certainly found it quite addictive so far.  You will spend quite a lot of time playing the same levels over again (although there will be slight variations each time in terms of available tower slots, etc), but if you don't mind some more effort than in a lot of TD games, then you should still enjoy the game.Still plenty that I haven't found, but the game doesn't take long to learn, but getting used to the 'forge' system takes a bit of trial and error to begin with.Buy if it's on sale, maybe think twice if it's not.

												Solid tower defense game but requires a lot of repeating missions to grind money/cards/upgrades.Edit: Achievements have been buggy for months for some users (and you can't unlock them without doing a full profile reset- see guide).Edit2: Feb 2014 patch may have finally fixed some bugs. People still have achievement issues, though.			"

												Being a fan of tower defence games I have high standards for a good review. Well this game is getting a good review. Starting off can be very easy or very hard depending on your luck as new towers are won in random card draws. I was one of the lucky ones getting a great tower early on in the game. Upgrading towers outside of maps makes going back to replay lower level missions fun. Taking all you have learned (and upgraded) back to kick even more backside and finally 3 staring that one level u just couldn't beat.It does have a bit of a grindy feel to it but there is always a pay-off for playing maps over again. Even when playing one map multiple time it is always a new enviroment as tower slot get blocked by rocks changing not only routes of monster but also the way you have to set up your defeneces.This game is going to be one of the games that will stay installed on my pc long after all the Shooters have be removed to make space for newer and better games. If you're wondering should i spend the cash on this game, in a word YES!			"

												One of the best Tower Defense Games I have ever played, it has an awesome mechanics, the card and upgrading concept is just fantastic, it works random, so no one will have the same expirience at the start of the game (later it's possible to max everything), you will find yourself doing the same stage 3-5 times and enjoying it just to get the achievements, there are ""grinding"" stages where you will be able to boost your cards, after you complete the story there will be a real challenge, the INFERNO mode, where things will be really harder, so this will test your knowledge of the game. The game has a great replayability and you will enjoy it for many hours, and for sure you will want to max everything, it's really worth the price, 100% recommended.I haven't completed the game yet, I will improve this review later.

With magic you can fight too, level them up and kick a s s.Pro's:- Pick up your towers for each level- Level up and upgrade your towers/magics or sell them- Many types of opposide units- Gambling on treasuresCon's:- Short story, somewhat short game- Will become boring after 1/2 of the playtime since you have to GRIND MUCH sometimes items and artifacts to get your towers strong enough to survive. Especially at the end of the game you have to GRIND over again and again and again to beat the game: This is a bloody waste!- Since you will encounter some difficult or tricky enemy types you are left with a mini choice of your favourite towers. This means you HAVE to pick up often utility towers to replace your towers or leave you with lesser choices and fun (except you like challanges).That's pretty much about it! I wouldn't spend 100% of it's price but would get it on discounts. That's what I did.			"

Game have really nice graphic, composed with nice soundtrack.  It bring so much fun in playing that! Actually i hadn't need to spend to much time on farming (while i'm writting those words, i have 2 ufinished map, 50% achivment compleated, and about 60% cards fully upgradet). There is only one wrong thing in that game: ballance beetwen cards: there are few, so OP cards that you can compleate game having only one kind of tower (!).All to all, i can give this game 95/100, and wait for continuation.

												This game is awesome if you know what to expect. It's basically like a tower defense game tied to grinding to get coins/stars to buy cards to improve your 'deck' of towers. It reminds me of a game I would find on mobile except the mobile would be a crappy ""freemium"" game that you wish was available on its own for a price. Definitely not saying this is a 'mobile' quality game, definitely much better than that, I just wanted to try and explain how it takes some concepts that freemium ""abuses"" and incorporates into the gameplay to make it actually fun.

												Not the best tower defense, but not the worst either, this one is fairly decent.Main difference is that the towers are actually cards you can upgrade and combine to make stronger, so there is a small magic card collector aspect to it.The reason the end result is fairly average is that the game is more about collecting the right towers and upgrading them rather than truly being a strategy game where tactics, placement, and optimisation are the real focus.If you like tower defense games this is not a bad purchase, but I'd wait for a sale to grab it,			"

												This is a great game in concept, marred by some lack of thought in the execution.  I would still recommend it, doubly so if you see it on sale.  Expect to get frustrated and maybe not play through it all the way, but tower defense games are usually just time-wasters anyway, right?This is a solid tower defense game, made unique by the collectible card aspect which allows you to collect your towers as cards, and to upgrade them by sacrificing other cards.  Match two of the same card and you can ""evolve"" a card, and thus level it up (up to a max of level 3).  Burn a pile of otherwise-useless artifact cards, or some lesser cards that maybe you have too many of, and you can increase the level of your cards, making your towers do more damage and adding range.  The RPG aspects people speak of are pretty minimal, in my opinion.  You, as a character, do gain levels, and this allows you to buy some abilities such as larger card carrying capacity, passive buffs, and more spells/towers to pick from during a battle.  There are spells which, although pretty underpowered particularly in the second half of the game, add some extra bits of strategy when your towers are ALMOST good enough.  The comic-book-esque cutscenes are kindof neat, tho the story isn't exactly going to be the driving force for playing this one.The balance is pretty well thought out, with one very glaring flaw.  If you are semi-lucky and get some good rare cards early on, or maybe if you stifle your spending of stars on your stats and instead spend the stars to buy card sets, you can pound through a pretty intense game.  If, however, you don't get at least a lightning or dragon tower by about the third boss, the game becomes impossibly difficult because it's balanced for actually having these top-tier cards.  If you don't have the rare towers, you may find yourself doing a fair amount of grinding, which really starts to suck the fun out of the game.  There are a couple 250-wave levels which are a good means of getting cards and money and experience, but you can't access these until you beat the first half of the game, which really sucks when you just need to build up to beat the last few maps.  They definitely could have put more effort into making the game adapt to the cards they've let you have, rather than assuming you're just going to grind until you get them.A couple tips for this game: if you can hold off evolving a tower card to level 3, you'll get 5% more powerful towers if you evolve four level 1 cards into two level 2 cards, then evolve those into the level 3.  Takes four of the level 1 cards, which can be tedious to get for the top-tier towers, but that extra punch helps for the second half of the game.  Additionally, to help combat the wunky randomness of buying a set of cards for 3 stars and finding out you wasted your valuable stars, you can go to your %appdata% folder and back up the ""Prime World Defenders"" folder inside it, and restore it if you get dealt a bad hand.

												Decent tower defense game, but completely abandoned by the developers.  As a result, many steam achievements won't unlock (although they do unlock in game, they just have difficulty  syncing up), and this is likely to never be fixed.  End game grinding is a bit tedious, as you're stuck with one of two options to obtain rare towers -- endless survival grinding for a chance at a rare card, and then a chance to pick that card from a set, or logging in every day to get a ""daily bonus"" which has the possibility of being a rare card.It has a lot of card fusing and upgrading, which is kind of a side point to the main game, but it allows you to individually customize your tower set to only upgrade what you use, which is pretty nice.  The unfortunate part of this is the lack of a reliable method to get said towers.  As far as gameplay goes, it's a pretty well done TD, although your ability to path monsters via tower placement is virtually non existant, and your towers are confined to rails along the sides for the most part.  This is it's only real drawback, in that it's more like Kingdom Rush than Defense Grid.All in all, decent game, but it unfortunately will never be great with a developer team giving it any post-release attention.  8/10.  Good for probably 40ish hours, with some additional hours if you enjoy the grind to max out your towers.			"

You 'waste' many hours to get a clone for your unique card to evolve it.-Forging and evolving adds a bit depth.-Solid gameplay, good graphics and great towers.Con's:-Maybe a bit basic.Love this game, and recommend it to TD enthusiasts as well as beginners. Love the art style, and the graphics.Card mechanic is great and adds longevity, since you are constantly looking for the next great card.Evolving and forging is a great idea, but I want to see the game expand upon it. Maybe in a sequel?Where you can transfer random abilities (strength +10%, chance to stun 5% etc.) by sacrifying cards.All in all, highly recommended. Get it now! :)			"

												This game is a lot of fun.  There does tend to be a lot of grinding through previous maps to get the money or cards that you want, but it's still enjoyable.  The only downside is that there are only a few maps so they get kind of tiresome after you've played through a map several times.  The playing cards offer a different twist on the genre, and definitely add to the appeal of the game.  If you're a fan of tower defense games you won't be disappointed with this one.			"

												Prime World: Defenders is basically the same old Tower Defense game all over again; however, it's quite well executed. You have more control over which towers you upgrade and how; you have a talent tree, and you have some randomness as to when you might acquire new towers. Throw in randomized levels with the random loot system, and you have a lot of re-playability at various stages of the game - where you might decide to take a break from progression and go hunting for new cards on the side.Another thing I find awesome is the music - it's way better than what you usually find on video games, and compliments the gameplay quite well. There's a decent storyline, and the gameplay is rewarding - this game rocks. The only down side is that the makers of the game are no longer standing behind it (no forum activity or work on game) and some minor (but widespread) bugs are still in it. The bugs won't hurt you much though; you can still enjoy a great game at a great price.			"

												While not the best tower defence game out there, Its one I would recomend to any fan of the genre. Its diffrent in its approach to obtaining towers, and the pacing of advancement, and game tempo are really good. My only real complaint is that obtaining duplicats of tower cards to evolve them is a little too hit and miss, but definatly not game breaking♥♥♥ in all I kept putting this one off for a few months, but it went on sale finaly got it and a few hours later wished I had picked it up sooner.

												Prime World Defenders gets a lot of flack for being ""unbalanced"" but I've never really gotten that impression from the game.  There were maps that were difficult, and maps that were easy; but none of the game mechanics lead me to believe that this game was inbalanced enough to hinder enjoyment.  In fact, the hardest part about this game was navigating the series of crashes that riddled the game towards the later stages.  These have since been fixed, but at the time they were very cumbersome.The premise of the game is like any Tower Defense game:  stop the zerging monsters from reaching your core by any means possible.  This game is different from others in its genre through it's use of currency and experience points to add meta-game character development aspect.  Use Silver or Stars (earned by completing levels perfectly and acquiring achievements) to unlock Talents which improve your abilities or let you hold more cards (which are Towers or Spells) in your hand or deck, and improve your cards by leveling them up throughout the game.  Upgrading Towers is a standby in all Tower Defense games; but in Prime World Defenders, you have to improve your tower's card before you can improve it in each match. For Tower Defense enthusiasts, this is a must-grab title.  It's not without faults, but it's one of the more enjoyable games that I've played this year.			"

												Do NOT let the metacritic score fool you! This game is an absolute gem for Tower Defense lovers everywhere, but may as well appeal to a broader fanbase in that it has a trading card style mechanic to it. Parts of the game especially after the first few missions can seem kind of grindy at first, but doing missions over and over and collecting different cards and upgrading your towers and spells is what keeps me hooked on the game for hours. I have always enjoyed games where you have to slow down and power yourself up. Keeping you from running through the game altogether. There isnt a vast amount of maps but the replayability is insanely high. Really enjoy the game, the metacritic score is very innacurate. Dont believe me? do yourself a favor and check the user reviews and play the demo! I very well would have paid the 9.99 for the game but the Autumn sales price at 3.40 as of now should be an instant purchase for many! I would give the game a rating of 8/10.			"

												Is it perfect? No, it's not. But it's still a pretty enjoyable game with an interesting card dynamic. As others have said it can be a bit grindy while you try to level up your tower cards, but it's not so bad that I hate the idea of doing the side maps when I have to. The've recently updated the hardest level side mission so it's in three waves with rewards after each wave of 25 and this has made the side map missions a bit easier to take. If you towers are at a reasonable level you can get away with just doing the hard level maps to upgrade your cards. It's got a demo so if you enjoy tower defense games give it a shot, you might be surprised.			"

												Prime World: Defenders gets it right by combining a solid understanding of tower defense concepts with a card game. You're not just strategizing tower placement but building and maintaining a 'deck' of towers and spells. The fusing system allows you to combine and upgrade the cards you win through victories or purchase at the store (using in-game currency.) This game is a fair deal at $10 and a steal at $3.40!			"

												A must-have for any tower defence fan! I purchased because of my love for the genre and the neat card-collection mechanic.  After logging in 10+ hours, I'm only half of the way through the game! The randomized levels is a great feature, too. Certain aspects of the level are changed every mission (for side-missions), which keeps gameplay fresh while you adapt to each new scenario! My girlfriend watched me play for three hours straight the night I bought it. The next day I picked it up for her too because she had so much fun just watching/helping me play. Couldn't be happier with this game!			"

												The hottest new Tower Defense game to hit the Steam Store!  Colorful and a great art style, the game itself mixes classic Tower Defense with the advent of card games ( Think Magic The Gathering) with a unique blend of strategy and the right setup. Well worth the price of admission!!			"

												After seeing the 58% metacritic score, I was hesitant to pick this up ... and now I'm seriously baffled what game the reviewers were playing.  User reviews over at strategy informer give it a 8.8/10 average, which is more in line with where I'd put it.The CCG mechanics are well implemented, the difficulty range for side missions goes from yawn inducing easy, to fiendishly difficult, with ample reward for toughing out those harder levels in the form of chances at rarer cards.It's well polished, excellent visuals, and adds interesting mechanics to a somewhat stale genre.  Features a long campaign w/some interesting boss battles, and repeatable semi-random side missions.  There's a vast variety of towers and spells available, and a number of ways in which to acquire and improve on them.  There's an in game store (using IN GAME credit, not a cash store), drops from side missions, drops from official missions, daily rewards and to top it off a crafting system of sorts for 'forging' and 'evolving' towers/spells, to make good use of duplicates or obsolete cards.I can only assume the 'grindy' complaints were people wanting ALL of the various towers and spells available *quickly* ... but then that would kill the replayability, knowing there's nothing new to drop - and no new strategies to be born from a new tower/spell in the mix?  I'd give it a 9/10 ... only complaints I can think of - back story was weak, and while the voice overs were done well, they could use more variety.  Highly, highly recommended hidden gem of a game - if you like tower defense, don't hesitate.			"

												Zero developer support over long-standing bugs and too many small issues that plague the game compared to other Tower Defense games on the market. I wanted to like this so badly, as it's got great graphics and I really like the Talents and Cards mechanics, but sadly the actual gameplay isn't as good as can be found in other games of this type.

												A solidly built tower defense game. Starts well, then after the first hour it introduces grinding the same levels you've already beaten for additional drops. The grind is fun and introduces new content for a while. But ~2.5 hours in, the third boss is not able to be beaten without 'rare' or better towers, which only drop from the ""star"" currency, which you cannot be obtained other than route repitition (I predicted 5+ hours of identical repititions). This is where microtransactions were clearly designed to allow you to ""skip"" this grind. Steam does not have this option. This is where the game ceases being interesting which is too bad, because it had so much potential. Worth a couple pennies for the first 2 hours, a dollar is too much to pay for this in its current state. p2w model hides a good game. Shame on the dev studio to release this version of the game to steam.			"

												I see this has become abandonware in favor of the microtransaction version. I try to stay away from those.Not for everyone, but I really enjoy Tower Defense style games and building machines of slaughter that grind up everything that passes through them.The card mechanic is fun and sufficiently manipulatable that I didn't mind the amount of grinding I did.  I did most of it going back for achievements anyway.If you enjoy Tower Defense style play give this a try.			"

												I'm actually having a blast with this one. It has just enough RPG elements without seeming overbearing, and the tower defense elements are there. I don't neccessarily care for the forge aspect, and prefer the evolution function as it makes more sense and is more rewarding. Otherwise, it's a good tower defense game to play while your mind wanders.			"

												Nice little tower defense game with interesting tower progression mechanics. The resources are a little scarce and the forge UI could have been done better, but those are only minor flaws. The story is not interesting and I found my self skipping it after a while. Also I'm not a fan of having multiple currencies in a game, just streamline it to one, can't be that hard. Overall a positive experience.			"
