												The Good:Star Trek Online is a free to play game where you can compete at the highest levels with no cash investment. Purchasing items from the store help's support the game, however this is one of a few MMO's where those with money are not left totally behind.A lengthy story line is included that you can complete solo by filling the rest of your team positions with your bridge officers. Alternatively you can team up with friends and enjoy the experience together. The game contains a rich mix of ground and space missions in both the story line and the Special Task Force (STF) missions. There are also Zones such as Defari, Romulas, Voth and Nukara Prime where you can land planet side and complete a variety of missions. The developers are constantly adding new content, regions and special events. Anything can happen from free ships, a vacation to Risa or a visit from christmas Q.Once you have reached max level there is the repuutation system to earn further bonuses and equipment. Plus Elite STF missions to test you.The Bad:Star Trek Online experience lag when servers are heavily. The interface and options are overwhelming so is the depth of charecter customisation and training. Bugs do exist and most have work arounds, this is not uncommon in a sofware upgraded over so many years.Summary:STO overall for a free to play is robust and has held my interest as a long term game. Main factors in this are the customization you can make to ship and crew and the changing content. We recommend you give the game a try.			"

												I wish there was a middle-of-the-road option where I could recommend this game under certain circumstances. But since there isn't one, I feel like the most honest thing I can do is not to.I have a few hundred hours invested in this game, which I started to play in 2014. Since then I've gotten my main character to 60, and created a few alts that are on their way there as well. I've pretty much exhausted all there is to do in my main, and finally feel like I can do this justice with a review.So is this a bad game? I am inclined to say no. However, there are many negative things that will hold the experience back for you. The thing is that, mostly, they are not enough to stop you from playing once you've tried it and if you've liked it for what it is. But after a while, dissapointment might start to catch up with you nonetheless.STO is a bittersweet experience. I feel that most of the time, for every three good things this game has, there is also one bad thing to go along.Pros:-The episodes are really good. This game has an interesting story that kept me going from beginning to end to see what happens.-Space combat is not the most deep out there, but its satisfying and fun. Yes it's brainless and a spacebar smasher, but enjoyable.-It feels like a true Star Trek experience, despite some questionable things lore-wise.-Missions are repetitive, yeah, but more often than not many of them can be quite creative and entertaining.-There is a lot of room for roleplaying if you're into that sort of thing.-A good amount of content that will keep you busy for a few hundred hours.-The foundry allows for some welcome creativity and what I consider the most meaningful player run aspect of the game. It helps keep things fresh and going when you are out of episodes from the game's main storyline.-Getting in-game currency is not as painful as in other games, and the Exchange (a.k.a auction house) is great for fattening up your wallet.-There is a sizeable amount of voice acting (many of it from actors of the actual Trek shows) to help immersion.-You can customize your character appearance anytime you want, and as many times as you'd like.-The fleet (a.k.a guilds) system is good and has a lot of things going for it, from your own fleet starbase to many other cool things you can add and customize in it.-There is a decent amount of fan service and the tie ins between the tv shows and the game can be clever from time to time.-There are nice events that let you have neat things, as well as giveaways for the same purpose.-The game is regularly updated with content.Cons:-The game is designed to extract money from you. What I hate is that half of how it's done seems appropiate to me. The game seduces you to buy uniforms and packs from your favorite shows. If the milking would have stopped there, It would have been fine. But nope, the game asks you to pay up for the best ships of the game, or grind dilithium for around 2 months just to get one of the tier 6 ships (currently the best ones). And then theres the whole ""pay here for xp boosts, pay here to unlock more inventory slots, more character slots, and this and that, and etc."" which isn't as annoying as how it was on SWTOR, but still pretty out there.-Ground combat is terrible. At first, I accepted it for what it was, but after hundreds of hours invested here I have come to grips with reality and had to admit the truth: it is just horrible. Shallow, thin, counterintuitive, buggy, and just an overall mess. The AI of your companions gets the job done, but it is barebones basic. And enemy AI is just laughable. Patrols can be so bugged up, their walk will jitter and flicker around like a bad LSD trip.-The game feels like a singleplayer game that was slapped the MMO label because of some online components. There isn't really any need to group for questing and exploring, and end-game content is sort of shallow to even bother and fully experience it, so that pretty much erases any meaningful purpose to grouping.-Fleet actions (a.k.a. dungeons) are ok when they are space based but horrible when ground based. And even in space they can be boring, tedious and repetitive: fight waves of guys, protect some AI ships, and a small twist here and there depending on the particular one you're doing. There are different difficulties in which you can complete these, but considering you pretty much blow through everything with standard solo gear, the need to come together to get the best pieces seems like an aftertought. Don't expect endgame organized raiding here.-The community is just dreadful. The chat on Earth Space Dock really brings out the worst in humanity. I've actually created a special tab in the chat window that filters it out for whenever I visit. Players are not helpful, and every channel feels full of slander and insufferable banter. In groups, it's the norm to roll need on everything, even if you dont really need the gear at all.-This game is not noob friendly. The UI design is not entirely convoluted, but it can take a while to figure out. The map is a mess that will make your head spin the first time around. It is a labyrinthine disaster that will not be kind to a new player at all. Hell, I'm 60 and I still get confused looking at it.-The exploration factor is virtually unexistant, except for some random missions you can pickup when flying near some planets.-There is a lot of grinding, particularly with reputation, dilithium, stuff for the fleet, credits and many other currencies.-Bugs. Bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs. Little bugs, medium bugs, large bugs, game breaking bugs. Bugs everywhere. Sometimes they get patched. Sometimes they don't. Developers are not as terrible as people often say, but they sure slack when it comes to patching for fixing errors. Not to add content, though; they can profit from that.And despite having much more negative things to say about the game than positive and overall not recommending it, I feel obligated to answer the following question: is there any circumstance in which you would recommend the game? Surprisingly, yes.If you are a hardcore fan of Star Trek and videogames, and you are willing to depart from some money then this is for you. Or perhaps if you are one of those fellows that do not mind to grind for months. If you like roleplaying, this game can be hours of fun as well if you find the right fleet.If you're looking for a deep MMO with complex mechanics, don't bother downloading this. If you're not willing to open up the ol' wallet or grind your way through all the stuff you need, then keep browsing for something else as well.What keeps this game alive and running with faithful players that follow it, is that despite all the bad, it is fun. A lot of fun actually. Many of us stick around waiting for a miracle that might never come: for Cryptic to revamp the areas that need it, and to patch the game so it can be rid of the problems it has. Perhaps a bigger developing team, and a more humane cash shop.			"

												Damnit Jim, I'm a doctor, not a reviewer.EDIT: Time for a more serious review I think. I would change from thumbs UP to thumbs DOWN but this review is for some reason already highly visible.Delta Rising is a rapidly growing disaster due to several really idiotic decisions. The core content itself is sound. New episodes are fun and creative, with a compelling story and interesting T6 ships and mechanics.However there are a lot of persistent bugs, some over a year old, and swathes of existing content and queues in dire need of overhaul. Instead, Cryptic seem to focus on bringing out new, very poorly QA-tested, content and systems with associated P2W aspects and let the problems pile up.Throw in some very poorly timed nerfs, complete disregard for the sorry state of XP earning, and a total lack of dev communication, and you have a team so far removed from reality that they have the gall to call this the ""best expansion yet"". One can take a quick glance at the steam player numbers and see how it actually went down. Why not look at the dismal PvE queue numbers while you are there?tl;dr, still a great Trek experience, but some fools in Cryptic HQ seem to be going out of their way to make this game as unenjoyable as possible.""DO YOU RECOMMEND THIS GAME?"" - NO			"

												Where to begin?This game was my home for 5 years. I loved it and even when cryptic tried to run it into the ground, they always seemed to fix it at the last moment and restore my faith.not anymore. PWE has shown they are a greedy little asian company that only cares about fisting this game up the pooper and destroying the vision of star trek for cheap cash grabs and pay to get ahead. ruining players favorite ships everywhere in favor of pay to win ships...and turning a casual fun game into yet another mindless grind.As a long time TrekkieI am crushed, heartbroken and devestated to see this game being treated like ♥♥♥♥ by ♥♥♥♥ head companies.I will hold faith that one day someone will restore this game to glory.

												RIP STO. The game has turned into a grinding nightmare for players like me, who used to enjoy leveling up characters, buying individual ships i had ""ground it out"" for. Each new character seemed to get better and better as i learned how to make those insane DPS builds. However, they have trashed the value of all the ingame currency and even though i am a life time subscriber, i would not recommend it to anyone wanting to go all that deep with it. If you want to solo play and just enjoy the story line, why not, its perfectly good for that. But, for people like myself, the game killed itself with monolithic greed.			"

												By all means play this game so long as you don't spend money on it.For those that don't know, Star Trek Online (STO) is an MMORPG loosely based in the Star Trek universe. Canon is not followed that heavily however there are facilities to create your own story, involving roleplay communities and the foundry which is a tool to design your own missions. If you are a Trek fan I would personally leave your Trek canon feelings at the door as you might find they get challenged at regular intervals.That said it is a personal thing, and so work through the story because that is one thing that STO has done reasonably well for. The art in STO has always been very good and so that combined with the story missions has always made good time spent.Now pre-Delta Rising this game was pretty unique in that people who were casual, hardcore, in-between or even super-casual could play the game and be able to enjoy it. You could be competitve on less than an hour a day, and while some things required more commitment, it was something that would get you competitive with others without too much grief.However those positives mentioned I would be negligent to not go over in detail the severe issues in the game, and therefore why I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone who wants an enjoyable, sensibly progressive experience or doesn't want a second job.I am now talking post-Delta Rising for the most part, which is where most of the issues that now permeate the game originate from. I'll be talking about the bugs, which has been an ongoing issue anyway, the difficulty settings, the ongoing issue of the degraded state of testing and bad customer relations.STO is riddled with so many bugs it makes an ant colony look small. Two of the top developers have openly admitted to not listening to player feedback any more, which is very apparent. The beta test server is now mockingly called the 'exclusive preview server' as what you see is what you get, broken mechanics, bugs and game-breaking exploits with it.Part of the reason for this is that their QA team for STO is a measely 5 people strong (http://sto-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?p=20853101#post20853101). This has shown through the years as bugs have built up due to there never being enough bugs fixed before a lot more come in to replace them like a hydra's head. Some proof of the developers lack of regard for the player opinion:1) http://sto-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?p=13321451#post13321451This link is to the Star Trek Online forums. It has a message from Tacofangs that tells us that by the time they are putting out content it is basically set in stone apart from the odd tweaks here and there, and usually they are just tweaks.2)

			In this episode of STOked Radio we welcome back Lead Designer Al ""Captain Geko"" Rivera and get a surprise visit from Co-Host Nikki.		

An interview which enraged players when Geko says that there is no actionable feedback on the Duty Officer UI. Suffice to say there was plenty of it and they did back track in a small manner after the uproar the interview caused and did give an option to minimise the UI.3) http://sto-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?t=1224081&page=79Because a practical case in point is always good, this is the link to the Tribble Feedback post for the Upgrade System. This is by far and away the most recent poignant example of the effort Tribble Testers such as myself put in to be simply ignored. I challenge anyone to go through that thread and find a dev response that addresses the core concerns of that well tested feedback.As far as Cryptic are concerned, money comes first and retaining players second. Feedback is ignored unless something crops up that damages their profits, which is why the game is so badly riddled with bugs.A very recent example is the recent release (Delta Rising) had such a huge content gap that many of us had to run patrol missions to fill the levelling gap, Cryptic even recommend this as the way to do it. However a bug that was flagged up during testing was the patrols weren't all scaling. Of course because this wasn't fixed it made it the easiest patrol and so people used it to get past the absurd gaps.So what do Cryptic do? They roll back a decent sized number of the players, cut experience gains by 70% and call everyone who took part exploiters. As you can imagine, although some would obviously exploit, the vast majority weren't and Delta Rising is becoming a PR nightmare.The reason this turned into a PR nightmare is two fold, firstly and as I have said, they ignored tribble testers. Yet the big issue that started up was that many folks who got hit by the roll-back were innocent of any wrongdoing. Anyone who has had any serious experience with Cryptic's customer services knows their ability to read data is severely lacking. I have personally been quoted inaccurate purchase history, incorrect data on missing items and even had the representative show a critical lack of company knowledge about current events, even about new development blogs that I was asked to send a screenshot of to prove existed.Next thing I want to talk about is the state of the game in terms of how one participates in the end game content and how easy that is to do. As it stands now Ground Combat allows for a lot more build flexibility than Space Combat does. The closer you get to end game Elite level (the top grade) the more you have to build a ship that is focused on damage dealing and little else.So to clarify, Space Combat at end game has become a DPS Race (DPS = Damage Per Second), where having DPS more in the 20-30k range or higher is essentially required to complete the missions, simply because the devs decided ramping up the hitpoints, shields and resistances on enemies exponentially was the way to improve difficulty which has only led to a system where creativity is punished in favour of linear builds.On the other hand we have Ground Combat that is still accessible to build variety so long as the build is sensible and is well fought out, and in fact each profession can run at least 4-5 different base builds and all of them can be effective. However that being said Cryptics idea of making this harder was to increases the numbers of tough enemies in missions and make them hit harder, something that doesn't make the experience reinvigorating or challenging on ground maps.One thing that links both though are the awkward optionals. Advanced queues have timers or objectives that instantly fail the mission if they fail, which is bad from a player progression standpoint as a fresh 50 is going to struggle to get gear they need, as the gear materials come from those missions which has led to a sort of necessity of either having a very competant team or the chance to be carried through, both options of which are poor game design. However the sad part is anyone who has the gear already has a leg up and can finish the missions with relative ease still, however at this point in time Elite Borg queues are missing so using the old favourites as a comparison is not easy, however I will post videos of before and after in case anyone wants to look them over.A comparison:Old Elite Khitomer Ground:

Go right ahead, but when you start hitting the pay walls, don't ignore the fact you'll be paying literally hundreds of whatever currency you use to get competitive, it's not like before when newer folks had every chance to be as good as the older players.So would I recommend this to anyone? Of course not, play for free but don't be surprised when Cryptic ruins it, again.			"

												I've been playing this game on and off since it's launch and it has gotten better from those days. My perspective is from one who only plays PvE(Player vs Environment) content. I'd recommend you try this game if;1) you are not bored with the tradional WoW type MMO (hotbar combat)2) you are Star Trek fan3) you like to play doll with your character(s) (the character customization in this game is awesome)4) you can live with bugs popping up (The new VP promises that bugs will be fix fast but only time will tell)5) you can resist(or don't mind gambling) since there are lock boxes in the game which gives out a top prize of ships(basically classes in the game), etc BUT you can get all these things in game if you have enough in game assets to dabble in the exchange(auction house)6) you don't mind the usual MMO grindfests which can get repetitive to farm better gear, etc7) you are not a hardcore gamer8) your internet connection to the servers is not crapThe gameplay itself is nothing to write home about and the main reason I'm still playing it is because it's the only Trek MMO out there. The game panders mostly to the casual crowd.Contrary to some, the game in my opinion is not Pay to Win. You can have access to all the ships and gear if you grind enough currency to exchange for these items which other players put up in the auction house. Using real money is just a shortcut in the game.Also this game features player created missions, some of which, are much better than the official ones. Don't forget to give some a try if you decide to try this game out.In my opinion, Free to Play means demo and Star Trek Online's demo is surprisingly good in the sense that it's not restrictive like in some other MMOs. If your ISP does not suck and you can wait to download a 10GB or so game, give it a try and see if it's up your alley. Live long and prosper. \V/.			"

												The story line is VERY good, very trek and as you can see I've spent SOME hours in the game.It used to be very fun but lately the devs arrogance is increasing and theay are NOT listening to the playerbase.A great amount of players are unsatisfied at the moment and instead of communicating with the community all they do is deleting threads they don't like on the forumsNew content coming in frequently so you don't get bored, problem is alongside new bugs come in and in between there is not enough time/crew to fix them so the list just gets longer and longer.update 5.3.15:they are releasing new not canon high end tier ships now which are improved versions of thecanonships already ingame for more $$ - €€.

												Almost a year and a half and roughly 800hrs+ (1,600hrs total) after originally reviewing this game, I believe it's time to wipe the board and update from scratch. Having played this game for so long I think I have a pretty solid understanding of the overall state of the game. Originally I was very enthusiastic about the game and may have come off as a bit one sided. Now, I'm going to try to be as unbiased as I can. I thoroughly enjoy playing this game, don't get me wrong. However, my opinion may be heavily based off of the fact that I am quite a big trekkie. If you aren't that versed in the Star Trek series or movies then you may struggle through the storyline and/or a lot of what this game is offering in terms of general aspects of the game. You could most likely still get a good experience out of this game even if you aren't really a Star Trek fan. But you've been warned. The game starts you off with you being able to play as one out of three factions. (You can have a default of three characters which can pick between the three playable factions. You also have the option to buy more character slots if you desire) Each faction, the Federation, the Klingon Empire, and the Romulan Republic has a seperate storyline TO A POINT. After about half way through the main storyline you will be forced to play the same missions as the other two factions that you didn't pick. This may hurt replayability and/or having characters on each individual faction. The missions can become very repetetive as they follow pretty much the same idea every time. Kill something in space, go down to a planet and kill things there, come up into space again and kill something, done. However, that is just a very very very crude synopsis of each mission. There are definitely variations in this pattern and, if you follow the story and read the dialog, can be a very interesting and enjoyable experience. The storylines are quite long, however they of course stop at a certain point. After you've finished the main missions you can entire fleets. You may join fleets whilst still in the main missions, however they don't really mean much until you reach level 50+ or finish the storylines. Fleets consist of a group of players that donate and interact with eachother to help evolve fleet areas. Your entire fleet must work together to gather the materials needed in order to finish these projects. The higher tier a certain zone achieves you gain access to high end gear and equipment. Upgrading tiers just gives you ACCESS to the stores in which these items are located. And some items cost a pretty penny. (NOT REAL MONEY!) There are also Reputation systems. These use a very similar tier system to a fleet, but you are the only one that can work on your Rep systems. Reputation systems give you access to high end gear and equipment. This may sound exactly like fleets but they don't give you the same type of gear. This game makes you work long and hard for endgame gear. And what better than to give you this work than in the form of GRINDING. Yes, grinding. Lots and lots and lots of grinding. Grinding is pretty much the only way for you to get past level 50 and get to the levelcap, 60. PvEs (Player VS. Environment) or as a lot of people call them in STO, STFs (Special Task Forces) is pretty much all you're going to be doing if you want to get to level 60. Granted there are missions that you can do to get from 50 to 60 but they still leave some mighty fine XP gaps in between them that you need to grind in order to unlock the next mission. Now let's be real here. This is an MMO. It isn't uncommon to find grinding in MMOs. But what else normally comes with playing an MMO? Yep, microtransactions. Microtransactions can give you a shortcut if you don't feel like grinding. The C-Store is a large store with exclusive ships, weapons, outfits, and misc. items. All of these things I have mentioned are obtained through the ingame currency known as Zen. You can GRIND for dilithium and then turn refined dilithium into zen, but you can only refine 8,000 dilithium a day. And let's just say 8,000 refined dilithium converted into zen won't get you anywhere near the amount you'd need to get anything like a zen ship. T5 ships cost 2,500 zen and T6 ships cost 3,000 zen. You can convert real money into zen, but $1 is equal to 100 zen. So if you want a good endgame ship you'll have to either grind enough dilithium for you to get 3,000 zen or pay $30. Now, if you've been reading other reviews or been reading/hearing anything about this game you've probably heard about there being a paywall or that this game is P2W (Pay 2 Win). You can kind of understand where that's coming from now. However, I disagree to this as you can indeed get anything in the zen store without paying a cent. It'll just take much much longer. Paying in this game is just a shortcut, not a wall. Customization in this game is on point. You can customize your character so in depthly that you can even change the positioning of your cheekbones. You can change the deepness of your chest and even how wide your ribcage is. Multiple hairstyles to choose from for both genders and multiple eye colors, skin colors, and hair colors are available. You can get more uniforms and even alien outfits in the C-Store. (Most if not all of the outfit packs are 550 zen each) You can combine multiple outfit sets together to make a 100% unique play and attire. You can even customize the colors of your individual outfit pieces with dozens of different shades. You can even customize your ship. You may customize the material of your ship's hull and even add a paintjob if you want. You may also have different bridges for those of you who want to roleplay. The graphics aren't terrible but aren't incredibe at the same time. The optimization is pretty bad. So for those of you that like having a steady 60fps+ may be forced to run on the lowest graphical setting. And even then you may not get your beloved 60 frames all the time. I've come across many different texture bugs in my time and some have been fixed, some not. Animations in this game are lazy and in small numbers. Performance wise this game is laggy. Server lag and frame lag are relatively common. It's bad, but tolerable in most areas. Places like Risa where vegetation is everywhere is VERY laggy. I have to turn my graphical settings ALL the way down if I want to go to Risa and even then I can only maintain about 25 FPS.Space combat is fun and unique, it takes coordination and good gear to survive the PvEs and mission battles on maximum difficulty. It can be frustrating at times but in general the space combat is neat. Ground combat is iffy, some people like it more than space combat, but personally I find ground combat distasteful. The ground combat controls feel clunky and the HUD layout feels wrong for combat. It might just be me but that's my opinion. The Devs (Cryptic) don't listen to the community at all. PWE (Perfect World Entertainment) seems to be more interested in getting money instead of thinking about what the community wants and craves in the game. The devs don't even fix many bugs regularly.Overall this game can be fun. My final conclusion would be:To Me: 8/10 I like itTo Trekkies: 7/10 Worth looking intoTo MMO fans: 7/10 Nothing specialTo Average Gamer 6/10 MehFinishing Statement: ""It can be a lot of fun IF you're a Star Trek fan and/or MMO fan.""

												When I first started this game I'd recomend it to anyone interested in space RPGs, now: never.Why? Simple really, in the beginning this game was almost perfectly balanced, with ~30% content grind, but these things where optional and could be found as loot with % drop chance, bought from other players or simply a direct reward while you where exploring new areas etc.As it is now, there are HUGE power creeps, making almost all viable options of ships and skills bad-really bad, and a handfull few stupidly overpowered and all new updates and new ships they pour in makes the ship you grind for obsoleate before you even get it.There are 5 (main) types of credits. Three which you need to specificly grind for.And don't get me started on those damn Locked Boxes, you need a key to open, keys can be bought for ~1-2 000 000 credits (or just pay up real money). Each boxs has ~1-2% chance (stays at that % even if you pay) of holding ANYTHING you would like, most is just useless crap.And forgett the exploration they're boasting about, it's just the same thing over and over, go to place a and defeat three waves of really easy enemies, then defeat the really easy flagship, repeat. (Yes, I played on Elite setting.)Now let me explain where the grind element comes in, a base ship has ~20 slots for equipment.You will grind for:Space:- The ship itself. (Price for good ships ~1 000 000 ( very low end) - 100 000 000 (high end) ingame credits. One Elite mission will give you avarage ~100 000)- Weaponsx6-8. (It'll take you ~3 weeks to get ONE high level ship equipment from a Fleet merchant.)- Shield.- Engine.- Deflector.- Consolesx6-8.- Space crew skills.Personal: (You + crew.)- Weaponx6.- Shieldx5.- Armourx5.- Skill Kit.- Land crew skills.- Crafting. (Gods only know how long THAT will take.)- Passive skills.- Sub missions. (Duty missions.)- Events. (These will pile up quick and if you don't do enough to turn it in (100%), you walk away with nothing.)- Reputationx6-7.- Crafting XP.- Crafting material. (More kinds than you have slots in your Bank btw, and you don't find the ones related to each other in the same place, forcing you to scan every single quadrant to find those you need and end up with a ton of those you don't anyway.)Fleet: (Community effort.)- 5 buildings to simultaniously upgrade, with 6 subcategories each, all 6 can (and need to) be upgraded atleast 5 times. (All demands HUGE quantities the same resources as your ships and eqpts cost.)Don't think that's the end of the list, I just can't remember what more there where.So no, no no no no no no no NO, do not start this game, because it'll eat up all your time and give you nothing in return.Edit after New Dawn:Did you remove your pay-to-progress? No? Well, no change here then.			"

												Having thousands of hours played into this game, STO has been a bitter sweet experience. STO was a great game back when it was a subscription model, though it was still generic on all aspect of gameplay. The ship models are very nicely designed, ground game however; Very shallow, while the highlight of the game are the space battles, you cannot help but think it is a mere space bar spammer or clicker. Through the years the storyline has improved and the addition of voice acting has helped enhance the experience, however; that cannot save it from the harsh Development team strategy, which are time gates, lock boxes, extreme cost for upgrades, and lack of customer support. This is truly one for the most diehard Star Trek fans like me, but for serious gamers, avoid this one unless you love all PWE games & their business model.			"

												What once was awesome became a bad joke. Cryptic turned this game into a p2w asia grinder...- Since Delta Rising, there's ONLY grind left to do- No balance anymore- PvP is dead (there has been no update to pvp for many years anyway)- Queues are empty- Devs are lying, making jokes about players and even insult playersLast but not least: Newbies won't have any chance at all to keep up with long time players as long as they don't drop several thousand dollars.We've all seen it coming for a very long time, but it finally got worse than we expected!

 Space: The Final Frontier.  Space is vast, huge, unimaginably large.  Space in Star Trek Online is not so much.  The game takes place mostly in our Galaxy, with the Alpha, Beta and Delta quadrants split up into three largish maps.  Once you hit level 60, it'll take you around five minutes to get from one side to another on the largest of these maps.  You can transwarp, which is like teleporting, around which greatly reduces your travel time.  There's also a sprint option for getting around.  Basically, there's a large space to fly your ship around in but it does not feel endless.These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.This is where the game shines, in my eyes.  Like most MMO's, you get out of it what you put in.  Star Trek Online is unique wherein you don't just work to level up your character, but your ships and bridge officers as well.  With the inclusion of Duty Officers, it's like managing your very own star ship crew.  The Duty Officer system lets you build a crew and then send them out on little missions that will last from fifteen minutes to days on end.  Your voyages are a big part of Star Trek Online as well, with a large campaign on both the Federation and Klingon side and a medium sized campaign for the Romulan faction.  These campaigns are broken up into 'episodes', each segmented into different categories.  The writers certainly know their stuff, with little nods to the series littered throughout the campaigns.  A lot of these missions really make you feel like you are helping your faction though hard times or discovering new things. Its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds. Missions in Star Trek Online are heavily instanced, with a lot of the more recent content not playable in groups.  This can make it a little harder if you're trying to play though the lot with friends and there's no really easy way to tell which missions are single player only.  There are quite a few queues once you get towards end game and most of these are a mix of challenging and entertaining.  They range from fighting off a Borg advance to pushing the Terrian Empire back into their own reality. To seek out new life and new civilizations. Seeking out new life and new civilizations is something that Star Trek lacks a little bit in it's core gameplay.  Luckily, we've got the Foundry for this.  The Foundry is an easy to use mission creator inside Star Trek Online with the intention of pushing your missions to the live game.  These missions will be playable by everyone and with some creative thinking, the sky can be the limit with this tool.  People can donate in game currency to your account if they really enjoyed your mission, so creating something of great quality can be benificial to yourself as well. To boldly go where no one has gone before. Star Trek Online is five years old now.  People have been here before, aside from Foundry missions, you won't discover anything new here.  Though, I'll take this time to quickly talk about the Free to Play model.  There's been some argument over the 'Pay to Win' status of this game.  While you can sink real life cash into Star Trek Online to fast track yourself to the top, you don't have to.  In fact, with a bit of time, you can actually earn in game currency and covert that to currency to buy items from the cash shop.  Obviously, Star Trek Online is geared towards wanting you to spend money and there are some brazen attempts to pull some out of you, but with some self-control, you're able to enjoy all of the story and locations without spending a dime.  Premium ships and gear is locked behind a pay wall, if you're happy not having this.  Not one single cent needs to be spent.			"

												I enjoy this game. I don't write reviews,  I Love Star Trek and this is easy to get lost in and with all the negative reviews I've read I have to write something positive. I would absolutely recommend this game.  Kills me to see/read reviews that are thumbs down by players who have hundereds of hours in and speak all this good and try to throw out ""pay to win"" or that cryptic doesn't give back. ""it's pay to win."" Everyone who complains that you have to pay to win is just wrong. You can earn game currency(zen) by playing the game. you get dilithium just by playing. You have to refine that dilithium and exchange it for zen. You are only allowed 8000 dilithium to be refined a day. at this time I think the exchange rate in 236 dilithium to 1 zen. You can do the math, too early for me to do it. Sure it takes longer than paying but what doesn't and it's not difficult at all. I saved up 3000k zen by doing this and it seemed like it took no time. For reference, you get 500 zen a month by subscription. Bought the ship I wanted that was only offered using zen.In fact it comes easy just going through and playing you earn dilithium just doing the regular missions. You also earn by doing side crew assignments which run while you're doing missions. You earn different ships by leveling which is the other thing. Most of the ships you buy with zen aren't that much different than the ones you earn leveling, at least I wouldn't see it being a problem for a casual player of the game.Paying doesn't earn you any combat bonuses either. Paying really only opens up more slots for officers, ships, and gives currency each month. look it up on the site. It only expands those slots by a few. PLUS if you pay for a month subscription, cancel, and never sub again. you KEEP all the bonuses you earned while subscribed, with the exception of the monthly money, when you're unsubsscribed. Who else does that?I've been playing for a few years now, on and off, and all i've seen this game do is grow and develop into something awesome. I look forward to the new content or ""seasons"" and the devs always seem to do something to draw me back if I stop playing for a while. The map has expanded and grown to be awesome. If you're a fan, sometimes just flying around the map and visiting the places you recognize is rewarding enough. Cryptic has done nothing but improve this game step by step and continue to do so. They feature voice work by actual star trek cast and seem to be making this a truly remarkable and unique game. The thing I love most is the foundry missions. Which are player created missions that play as episodes in Star Trek. So you have your ship that you get in game, you have your crew, and then you get to take them on these episodes/missions that feel like you're playing through an episode that you're watching on TV. This is by far one of the greatest things this game has to offer for the fan who wishes he could watch a new episode. and as a plus, anyone can create missions through the foundry. The ""Fleets"" are like guilds or clans in this game. and I have found them nothing but helpful. Content is unlocked by joining one. Awesome features that I think are worth your while. !st column is recommended. The game itself is beautiful and any Star Trek fan has to geek a little to be able to take a character though all the places you've watched growing up. There are problems with every game and everyone is different in what bothers them vs someone else but to generally thumb down this game is rediculous. I feel sorry for those people because I'm sure they are having trouble finding a fleet or are frustrated with maybe the learning curve of all the content but if you give this game a fair chance, and are a fan of Star Trek, I think you'll find yourself feeling that same feeling you felt while watching your favorite episodes when they first aired just playing through and learning the game. I personally cannot wait to see what they do with it in the future.			"

												I love Star Trek, but I cannot recommend this game.Myself, my wife, and my 4 kids all have Lifetime Subs to this game, we bought in when Cryptic first introduced the LTS while it was beta.  But you know, it is what it is, they went free to play. I can get over that, they had to do what they had to do.Then they started selling outfits and such -- cool beans, they have to make money somehow after F2P.Then they started selling ships -- not ship skins but out-right ships that are 20x better than what you can obtain in-game without years of dillithium grinding.Then they added lockboxes which require keys only obtainable from their cstore (the p2w shop).And their latest scheme is making it a mechanic in game to need to expand your ship slots for admirality, which requires zcredits.You will press the ""buy now"" button more than you will ever press any other button in this game.  Avoid it.  This game is a whole new level of micro-transactions and pay-to-win.Want an extra character for farming? Buy NowWant more storage in your inventory? Buy Now Want even more storage? Buy Now (multiply that by 16 I think)Want more bank storage? Buy NowWant more shared bank storage? Buy NowAwe! You can't buy that new weapon on the market because your bank account can't hold enough money to buy it? Buy NowLockbox Dropped? Buy NowNew ships added? Buy Now (but you better check your bank account, they can get expensive)Want more bridge officers? Buy NowWant specail bridge officers? Buy NowWant more duty officers? Buy NowWant specail duty officers? Buy NowWant more ship slots?  Buy NowWant a new ship? Buy NowThat is just the start. This game will nickel and dime the hell out of you.Do be warned, there are many that have subscribed to this pay-to-win system, and they will tell you everything they can conjure to get you to play the game so that they have someone other than those who have sunk more money into them game than them in the game to feel significant.  These folks will give you the following excuses:1) If you grind long enough you can obtain everything in-game that you can in the cstore    - This is an ambiguious statement, your life-span isn't log enough for this to happen if you pay $0.00.  Even if you could, the markets are controlled by the people who CAN purchase things like ship modules, keys, etc from the cStore giving them a very clear advantage in-game by use of their wallet.2) You can gain the dillithium easy and fast to get everything in the cstore    - This is outright false.  In order to ""grind fast"" you have to either a) spend money or b) soak about the first 7 months of your play-time into grinding the dillithium to get 8 characters to grind this dillithium.  Once you do, I'm sure you'll be so sick of grinding dillithium you will have already uninstalled.3) Then don't pvp, there is no competition elsewhere!    - False, if your gear isn't to a certain spec, if your ships aren't to a certain spec, you can't get in non-pug groups. 4) It is a free game, what do you have to loose?    - Time that could be had having fun elsewhere, that's what you have to loose.  You will not see the paywalls in this game until you get to the higher levels, namely T6 ships.  Then you'll need upgrade modules or you will need to buy a c-store ship to obtain them.  These T6 ships make it possible to continue playing the game (else you will die, over and over again), and then, if you want the T6 perma-passive bonuses from the ship, you MUST purchase it from the Cstore.  I'll be very clear about this factoid: unless it is a specail event, you cannot obtain high-level ships in-game without someone spending IRL money and a LOT of it.To give you an idea, a ""ship bundle"", can sell for $200.00 or more.  So before someone says this game is free, reflect on what I just said.This is not Star Trek, it is Pay Trek to Win.The one thing I dread most about this game is pulling up the patcher to see they have a new lockbox or new ship, because if you want to keep your character updated without playing this game as a full-time job... Buy Now @ $150+			"

												Do not recommend this game. I am a lifelong Star Trek fan, and I even was a Star Trek online fan for quite a long time, but Perfect World killed this game. It is but a shell of what it used to be. They want money for every little thing. People will argue against this point, saying you can convert dilithium to zen and what not so no need to spend real money... DO NOT BE FOOLED. It is a deception. If you were to go the dilithium to zen way to purchase new ships and stuff IT WILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE LIFETIME. It's capped at 8000 Dilithium per day, you would have to spend every moment playing grinding toward your goal accross multiple characters to get what you desire.The Delta rising expansion made the game so much worse than my above description even. Ships you already bought and paid for, now require expensive money bought items to be upgraded to be kept up with the new level cap increase. They decieve you by saying these upgrades are optional and not neccesary to play, but it is a lie. You will be a scrub without these upgrades. No one will want you on their team in any serious content if you run around without a properly upgraded ship.All in all the only good part of this game is the roleplaying aspect in it. Character creation is pretty immersive. Biographies are possible, plenty of social map and an active community. That is the ONLY reason anyone should play but the game itself? It's horrible.			"

												I've been a fan of Star Trek for a really long time. I've been to conventions, I've seen every show and movie multiple times, I've played damn near every Star Trek video game out there, and I was even at the Vegas Star Trek Convention when this game was originally announced (back when it was still being developed by Perpetual Entertainment). If Star Trek Online was going to appeal to anybody, I think it's fair to say that I would be at the front of the line. And for a long while after Cryptic released the game, it did. Star Trek Online started off as a very decent piece of fan service to the core series. No, the stories were never the same level of quality that was seen in the TV series, but it didn't have to be. The game succesfully hit all the right buttons to be a succesful Star Trek MMO, and Cryptic legitimately seemed like they wanted to keep improving the product they had released. Then came free to play. I have nothing against free to play as a general concept, but so many games handle it incorrectly in an attempt to increase revenue. That didn't happen immediately for STO, but after Cryptic Studios was purchased by Perfect World Entertainment, it sure didn't take long. Perfect World is very well known for churning out game after game with obnoxious freemium systems, so I suppose it shouldn't be to surprising that they did the same with STO. And that's exactly what happened.All In all, there's still a part of STO that's good, but it's covered in so much money grabbing BS I just cant' recommend the game to anyone anymore. I would love to be able to revisit the game I played for 1000+ hours (I played on the standalone client before switching to the Steam client), but it's just not there anymore. TLDR: Used to be a fantastic game, but it's been bogged down by to much freemium BS.			"

												I loved this game. However, PWE has completely ruined it. If you can stay awake through the first 50 levels, then you will see that the game is actually rather fun. All the missions are completable and the ""Trek sense"" is here. However, once you hit the P2W walls, your forced out of the immersion and into your wallet. Even after buying some overpriced ships (off of other people of course; you have to gamble for the ships in PWE's system), I still was struggling with getting proper entertainment. Did I mention this game is a StarTrek casino? You want the new ship? Buy lock boxes and keys (keys=$2.00) and have a 1/256 chance of winning the ship you want. Being the good citizen I am, I actually decided to buy the keys from PWE, then sell them on the exchange for money to then trade / buy the ship I wanted. Even thoguh it was overpriced, I payed the money and got the keys. Oops! It appears that Steam and PWE are not integrated at all and my keys became account bound. This rendered them useless (for my purposes). I contacted PWE and said that they did not inform me that my keys would be locked and that I demand an immediate refund. They blammed everything on Steam and refused to refund my money. I contacted Steam which, being the dunces they are, blammed everything on me and PWE. I decided to dispute with the credit card company (and I won) which resulted in my cards (that's right, all my cards) being locked from steam for an unkown amount of time. PWE tried to blame me for not reading their forum about the currency. A game that requires forum reading is hardly a game at all. I play video games to get away from all the homework I recieve during school. I used to enjoy the game before it became a P2W, neatly dressed, pile of garbage. My advice, stay away before your tricked out of your money.			"

												I played this game for over 5 years. In that time, I watched PWE buy it and turn it to complete garbage. Before they bought it, the main complaint was that it was stale and had little content. The PvP was fantastic though. After PWE bought it and made it F2P, it was okay for a while. They introduced ships with fancy consoles, that weren't necessarily gamebreaking, but at the same time were aggravating to fight against. Then they introduced lockboxes. These had fancy new gear and ships. This opened the floodgates for more of this stuff. Soon it became apparent that anything other than the newest ships and weapons would become obsolete very quickly. They kept adding more and more pay items. Power creep ensued. Now the game is a mess and typical PWE garbage. On a side note, to those people that say you can easily grind for stuff with dilithium, you can but it takes way too long for any normal person. To get reasonable amounts of dilithium to be able to buy ships and items, it would require you to grind like its a second job. A lot of the grind is also timegated. It should be called F2P but P2-have-fun. You can still play through the story (LvL 1-50) and it's interesting. Going from LvL 50-60 requires a bit of grind as missions don't give enough xp on their own to progess. After that you hit the paywall, and at this point if you want to progress, you will either be paying or grinding... a lot.			"

												Star Trek Online is a very decent MMO that does a fair job at capturing the expansive Star Trek Universe. You will encounter a plethora of memorable personalities on your journeys throughout the game while exploring both the famous and uncharted systems across the galaxy. At the time of this review you can currently play as a Star Fleet Officer, a Citizen of the new Romulan Republic, or a Warrior of the Klingon Empire. There are three career paths that you can chose - Tactical, Science, or Engineering - which determine what skills you have access to as well as what kind of ship you will command. STO is one of my top 3 best MMOs and is the second best MMO for Free to Play Players as there are literally no content restrictions unlike games such as Star Wars: The Old Republic (End Game content + Expansion Pack) or The Lord of the Rings Online (all content beyond The Lone Lands (level 30ish) requires individual purchase or subscription). You can easily reach max level (50) and beyond without subscribing. That being said there are the common account restrictions for F2P players, such as a currency cap, limited character slots (3), no account bank, and limited character bank storage space. If you do decide to play STO here are a few tips:* Levels 1-49 are essentially a giant tutorial that helps familiarize you with the mechanics of the game. * At level 50 the game content changes from Single Player to Group as you take part in STFs (Special Task Force) missions and their Elite counterparts where you fight extremely tough enemies such as the Borg and Tholians for reputation items.* At End Game, Lock Box and Cryptic Store Ships are vastly superior to anything else. If you are serious about playing the game throughout the End Content you should consider purchasing one as well as a subscription. "

												STO at first had the potential to be one of the most in depth sci fi games in the MMO universe, sadly this cannot be said today. The disconnection between the playerbase and the developers is as wide as the East is to the West, and the game seems like it will suffer the same fate as Champion Online did, mostly going into maintenance mode soon, that is if the developers do not wake up to what is going on around them. Plagued with BUGS, power creeps, balance issues, an expensive upgrade system, lock boxes, dead queues, very slow leveling up process, and very expensive Tier 6 starships; has pretty much stalled STO on its track. To be fair though, anything in game can be obtained for FREE with extensive daily commitment and grinding.Here is an article with helpful insight on the new problem that the STO community is facing, I hope you find it helpful.http://massively.joystiq.com/2014/11/30/captains-log-why-star-trek-online-is-kind-of-a-mess-right-now/Truth is, there are better MMO's out there that rewards players for their dedication, with developers not as hostile towards the playerbase. I cannot fully recommend the game as it has changed into something entirely else, it's only saving grace is the game's ip, other than that, it is a mediocre experience with pretty ships. Play at your own risk.			"

												This game was good at first but now they do not care about the customer or their products they just want money. There are problems they don't seem to fix they just prefer to ignore them and add more stuff to the game. There are bugs that make the game hard to play like the power tray and the loadout don't work. I really can't tell you how much I hate this game and Cryptic Studio or Perfect World Entertainment.

												First off, I was a big fan of Star Trek.  To me it really wasn't about the characters, it was more abou the tech and the ships.  I can pilot the NX, Excelsior, and TOS Connie?  Sign me up!I started playing the game over 2 years ago, and honestly the direction is has been moving has made it so I no longer interested in the game.  There will always be grinding in MMOs, that's a given.  STO however takes the grinding to a whole new level of bad.  The game is set up to get you to 50 quickly so you can start grinding away.  You grind for reps, the traits of which you are now limited to 4 active space and ground.  You grind for gear that is now going to be worthless so guess what?  Grind for the newer gear.  To PWE/Cryptic, grinding = content.  Add the time gates to slow down any meaningful progress in the game, and you have what amounts to a second job.The last few feature episodes have been single player only.  So what's the point of being in an MMO if I can't run what little new content there is with friends?  This is the most single-player MMORPG I have ever played.  With the dwindling amount of players that probably won't be a bad thing in a while.Now after telling their player base there would never be T6 ships because they wouldn't want to make everyone's T5s obsolete (some costing $25.00 for a single ship), they are now rolling out T6s and giving people the opportunity to upgrade their T5s to T5Us, which will still be inferior to T6s.  In the case of fleet ships you will end up paying three times for the same ship, just to get a little better stats.If you play STO for any length of time you will notice the cash-grabbing.  I understand they have to generate revenue, but they way they do it makes you feel used.  I have seen it grow worse with every season to the point it is so obvious now you wonder if they will charge you every time you enter Earth spacedock. If endless grinding is your idea of fun, then this game is for you.  But this is not a Star Trek MMO.  They have moved so far away from the base material this is now a generic space MMO with a Star Trek flavor packet.  I only log in for the social aspect with my friends who haven't left the game.  It's sad, but I can no longer recommend this game to anyone.			"

												I have a few hours in this game, I've played it on and off for a few years and streched out over that time frame, my hours played aren't that great. All though ~I do have time on Arc as well.When the game was launched, many felt that it just simply wasn't good enough to merit the subscription and player numbers quickly fell, this is not to say the game is bad, it's fun in parts, it helps if your a bit of a star trek fan I think, there are good moments when you meet familiar characters from the shows and things like that, but these are moments.If there was such a thing as a casual mmo then I guess this is what it would be, there is a grind but it's mostly a grind that you can do an hour here or there on your own or with a small group, there are huge fleets but again it's not something you really need in order to participate in the content, you can solo and pug your way through it.It's fun, but, can quickly become repetative, ground combat is old and clunky but some space battles can be a lot of fun.It seems that from the start, This was nothing more than a cash grab using the Star Trek name though and it's only ever gotten worse, It quickly went free to play and is advertised as such with the assertion that you don't need to buy any ships from the store in order to play, well, this used to be true until the delta rising expeansion.At this point the company decided that it would totally shaft all of it's existing paying customers, the way the expansion was handled and the release of the new T6 ships is another post entirely, suffice to say that it killed the game, many players including myself stopped playing because of the way we were being fleeced for money, quite blatantly, it was either pay more or pay again, that was the choice we were given.The numbers trying to join STF's (instanced group missions) went from a couple of hundred and now struggling to reach 30 on a good day. They are well aware of this and have made efforts to address it, I feel their recent content addition has been very fun, fun enough in fact that I started playing again, I bought some stuff, I'm the sort of person that pays for things when I feel I am getting enjoyment out of it, I've spent a lot on this game.Why do I still play it? Mostly because of people who play it, I'm never going to make another purchase in it thats for sure.The other day after spending a couple of hundred pounds on their C store, I realised that there may have been an issue with some of the items that I bought, I sent in an in game ticket as a subcribed player I am supposed to get a better service of support apparently, I waited days for a reply and then finally found out the answer to my issue myself, I then tried to get help with that issue and this time decided to try their ""live support""The guy said hello and asked me what was up, I explained the issue and the dude in the live support decided all by themselves that my issue was with an ship bundle that I purchashed after I had just sat and typed out something quite different to that and then just flipped me off with the most redundant repsone.So if that was my thanks for subscribing and spending a small fortune on the game, I let them know that I was cancelling my subscription and that my wife would be too and that no more money would be spent on the company if their live support people can't even be bothered to read a parahraph before giving a redundant auto response.Since then I seem to have a strange bug where inventory items are going missing, the first I noticed was an old reputation reward shield, it was loaded into a visual slot and then one day I logged in and it was gone, I passed this off as maybe me being tired and discarded it by accident, then later I thought I had lost some beam weapons that I had made for an alt,But today I realised that it's not me that is discarding missing items, I made a whole load of low level warp cores, I put two with decent modifiers in my bank for an alt and the rest went onto the exchange, I logged out for an hour and when I got back, at least 10 of my exchange listings were gone, there was no mail or money in my account for them, the ones I had put in the bank for my alt were gone too.Now I've went ahead and opened a bug report about this but I can already tell you what the reply to that is going to be.""Tough ♥♥♥♥ mate, grind some more, have you tried buying some of what you need from our C store?""If that's what the company thinks of someone who has supported it, then what chance have you got?This could be a great game, but it only cares about your money.

												This MMO is nothing more then a F2P (Forced 2 Pay... Well okay rather a F2PFP2P, which is short for Free 2 Play Forced Pay To Progress) money pit which you will find out when you get towards L50. I have tried coming back to this twice now and both times it was much the same. Pay to Play model forced down peoples throats without mercy. With this new ""Delta Rising"" expansion however it becomes absurdely prevelent to the lengths of corporate greed this company will go just to try to ""milk"" potential new cash cow customers/players just for L60 gear. Now while yes you technically can get end-game stuff for ""free 2 play"" expect to take this on as a full time job if you do and give up whatever you currently call a life because in the end this is what this one realistically boils down to. Which is unless you feel like blowing money which is better spent towards other games or essentially a new PC, Rent, Bills, ect...Bottom Line, Essentially this is put out by a company that tried to force steam users along with non-steam users to use a data mining launcher which gathers ALL of your information to sell to 3rd partys, Ultimately early on it's a good way to pass the time and invest in if your a die-hard trekkie (which be forewarned prior to delta rising they gutted the core essence of the exploration aspect of what made star trek what it is by removing it all together!) otherwise your better off passing this one up as it will suck you in and suck your wallet bone dry with it's addiction forming factor. Essentially the norm for this is you'll get hooked, play it for about a few months, get sick/bored of it, and ditch it for about 6 months to a year or longer and just rinse, and repeat.			"

												As Cryptic Studios released the game 2nd Februar 2010 they had an idea of how to make a good Star Trek Game. I played in Alpha and Beta and ordered several copies preorder to gain a lot of ingame stuff that was different on every copy of the game. They did not make it perfect at start, it had its flaws, but hey were working on it to make it better over time. I really enjoyed playing the game. You had exploring missions. Yes at some point they repeated themselves, but that is how close you can get in a game to a Star Trek feeling. The ingame store had updates from now and then and I bought some stuff, like the Defiant Retrofit (Now T5). You could speculate how a game that demands monthly money to play it can have an ingame store that requires money again, but it was another time and technically you could unlock almost anything by playing. The design was  attracting a casual playing older/wealthy player base anyway. Prices were not too high and any unlocks were always account wide forever.This all changed as Arc Games purchased Cryptic Studios and everything went downhill. The chinese company turned the game really quick into a typical chinese pay to win game. With the release of the T6 Ships around 80% of players left, for obvious reason not being willing to pay real money for them. Only other way to get these ships was brainless grinding and playing every day. Didnt take long for the famous chinese shop in shop system appeared in which you could buy stuff that only was unlocked on one character for the double price. Yes I actually calculated everything. Ofcouse you can grind everything out, but getting a T6 ship from the Zen Store without using money will take you around 150 days with one character, depending on the dilithium exchange prices and you having enough unrefined dilithium.Anyway we went enough on the pay to win part now, lets get to the gameplay. Well every patch breaks more stuff than they can fix. This is not Cryptics fault. They actually work hard I think, they just dont get any money to repair and improve stuff in the necessary amount. Arc Games is sucking everything out. The warp out animation is broken for months. An animation Cryptic originally changed 3 times at release till it satisfied them. But look here, shiny, shiny new ships. Give us your money is Arc Games answer to that. There are several issues in the game right now. Game breaking graphic bugs and never ending glitches can be expected while you play. Be sure the server disconnects you around 30s per map you are moving.Now lets get to the part if you really have to pay money. Yes and no. Technically you can play with your free ship, but the enemies are getting stronger and stronger and standing a chance with a T5 ship against the Vaadwaur proves challenging, against Na'kuhl it is suiciding through the missions.If this still didnt convince let me you tell you that, besides having bought multiple keys for ingame items at release, I am a Lifetime Subscriber. We get free Zen every month, only reason why I still play btw. As I went back into the game after a break I had the problem I couldnt claim the T5 I bought some time ago on any other character. Wait there is a player support that I asked immediatly to get a message some days later, I just need to dismiss it on the character I own it and reclaim it there. Ofcourse I trusted the support and dissmissed the ship. Jokes on me, I couldnt reclaim it. Wrote another ticket explaining it, showing proof of the purchase. Guess what. They didnt care and didnt want to give me the ship I already paid for. I was supposed to buy it again.Conclusion: You can play the game, some of the original good content is still there. I recommend you to make a character and just play the story once. After that stop playing. Dont waste money on it. The game is close to being dead anyway. Not later than they release T7 even the hardcore fans will leave.Really sad what lifeless, souless husk this game has become. It had great potencial and it still has. I never expected it to be like the Series. Maybe one day a better company will buy Arc Games and make the game good again.			"

												After an obsessive Deep Space 9 marathon that left me yearning for more but unwilling to subject myself to Voyager/Enterprise, I decided to give this game a try to ween me off the resurgence of my inner Trekie. I don't regret trying it, and put a lot of time into it/might not be finished with it, but I also can't recommend it as a good game. While not exactly a 'pay to win' production, there does come a point in the higher levels where upgrading your ships to the current maximum level takes more 'Zen', the purchasable currency of the game, than a person could reasonably be expected to gather themselves in-game. Pros: - The game has great character customization. Few are willing to admit that most MMO's are basically complex dress-up games, but this game embraces that element. Not only are you afforded extensive personal customization, but all your bridge officers can be fully customized as well, ony their sex and their race being pre-determined. While there are many alien races to choose from, you can also select 'Alien', which allows you to create your own species, and gives you wildly versatile customization. Want to play as a bald, pot-bellied toddler running around with a Bat-leth? Go for it. Want your captain to look exactly like a Vault-Boy Bobble-head? No problem. Want your first officer to look exactly like one of those giant blue chicks from Avatar? Jake Sulley it up all you want. - Ship combat is fun, versatile, and very nostalgic. The mechanics mirror the way combat is portrayed in the show very well, with all the special abilities available being the go-to phrases of Captains throughout the Star Trek franchise. Emergency power to weapons, reverse sheild polarity, fire a full spread of torpedoes, activate the tacheon beam... all the technobabble of Star-Trek returns, all with unique functions in combat. My personal favorites? Ramming Speed and Self Destruct. - Uncannily challenging for an MMO. The game has the rare MMO feature of a difficulty setting, and the max difficulty is really quite challenging after the tutorial levels, and really quite crushingly difficult after around the lvl 40 mark. The ships you confront will be exceptionally more powerful than yours, often able to obliterate you in a single torpedo spread, making quick reaction time and well-thought-out tactics essential. Cons: - Ground combat is weak, and ground missions are often exceedingly annoying puzzles that don't so much challenge you to think as force you to do a lot of tedious reading while running back and forth between consoles. Many of the ground missions were a major chore to complete. -The crafting system is dreadful. Essential resources are incredibly scant, about 2 harvesting nodes present on about 2/3s of the missions you run, and 90% of those nodes being the basic common-grade materials, meaning you'll have huge stacks of those and next to none of anything else. The only decent way to gain experience in crafting is to engage in these 20-hour research projects that prevent you from building anything while they're active, and actually building things gives you minimal experience by comparison, and wastes your over-rare resources. The only way to really succeed in crafting is to buy crates of resources using Zen, I.E real world money. Otherwise, your crafting will never in a million years keep up with your leveling, or ever be of any real value to you except perhaps in the distant future of play. - It doesn't really feel like an MMO. Besides the occassional 'Borg attack' event to which everyone in a system is invited, playing with other people is a rarity in this game. You see other folks flying through space at warp, you run into other folks at the docks/space stations, but the vast majority of missions are all solo experiences. There are ques for PVE and PVP events, but they are so long that I've never successfully joined whatever it is they're queing for.- space combat, while entertaining, follows 2-dimensional rules. While I undserstand the need for set 'up' and a set 'down' while in space combat simply to keep directions and mapping viable, ships are far too bound too and bogged down by the imposition of 'up' and 'down' in space combat. You cannot dive, nor fly straight up, nor do a flip, nor fly upside-down. You essentially move like a sub-marine and not a space-ship. This puts annoyingly restrictive limits on manuevering and heavily detracts from a players capacity to use superior piloting skills to any sort of advantage. It's also highly annoying when travling to positions/enemies above or below you, as you have to slowly spiral down or spiral up in order to change your height position. This has got to be the single greatest turn-off for me.			"

												I have no idea how this game has so many positive reviews, Im a fanboy for sure, but I still cant bring myself to like this game since the company was sold, and I have played and do play mmo's Still. Im a lifetime sub and I am telling you this game stinks. The business model seems to be sell lockbox keys, Honestly haven’t touched it in 6 months at least but it can’t have changed that much. Flying between Sectors is the least immersive experience in gaming I think I’ve ever had, feels like I’m swimming in a kiddie pool... with 100 other ships in these tiny space sectors. Another disappointing entry into the Star Trek Video game franchise.			"

												After Almost 500 Hours, and the same amount of cash, this is a Star Trek fanboy dream, almost, after this amount of time in game, conclusion, needs to go the way of WoW in a big way, lot of hidden fees, and vague, unclear things, to make you spend even more money, some shady stuff going on here....if you are a Star Trek Fan be careful, you could buy quite a few games, with the amount of money you end up possibly spending, and you will want to spend money, cause the game is geared that way, would prefer a monthly fee for sure over the paygate to happiness here, free to play is a really bad thing, unfortunately if it wasn't for that we would not still have this game.....good and bad.....good Star Trekspace combat is ok, but you do not have full 360 which doesn't make any sense, with dx11, and physics, No Reward for Content, very limited Items, and rewards, pay to winyes you can get everything in gamebut they limit you to how much you can make in one dayso you will want to spend morewhich shouldn't beonce you spend 150 bucks lol you should have all you need for a yearbut doesn't work out that wayif you are easy to spend money they will get rich off you			"

												Star Trek Online. I have almost 2000 hours on record. But I do actually have way more than that. For a while I had a really weak computer and I played the game standalone on a the DVD cover release. Back when that still existed.Where do I start?Star Trek Online has been through two phases, one is now gone but I'll take you through it anyway. To see how it has evolved.When Star Trek Online was released it was driven by Cryptic and released by Atari. Both on their own site, Steam and through DVD boxes in stores. At that time the game was really weak and lacking. There was no audio dialog or fancy cutscenes and the graphics were already a tad outdate. New content was barely released because of how small the team was. But we still had a lot of fun exploration missions, you could visit every star system even if that ment just flying around the planet and looking around. You also had to pay to play back then. You could buy playing time online or buying ""month"" cards.Then the big boss ""Perfect World Entertainment"" came a long. Now this was a good and a bad thing. The good news is that since Perfect World has a lot more resources than small Cryptic. And Atari was just a publisher, this now ment that Star Trek Online had a big team with a lot of resources. This mean the game quickly evolved in a highly positive way. Such as missions getting better and more complex, the introduction of even more advanced audio dialoge and cutscenes. The general story telling of the game got improved a lot. There have also been way more updates and patches and they even just recently overhauled the graphics engine and it looks all quite nice. The ships have also been re-done since Beta days to make them look more realistic. Most even have brand new, made from scratch models and textures. So the graphics now compared to release are amazing.That being said. The game is now free to play and everything ingame can be accessed without real life money. Though it'll take you ages to do that. But since the game is free, and there's something you really want I don't see a problem buying it for real money. You support the developers.While the developers do not always pay attention to small bug reports that have been sitting on the forums or tickets for ages. They do fix serious issues. For example one time, I deleted my main character that I'd have for years and after 2 weeks I got a mail saying they managed to recovery the character. They are also good at cracking down mean players and annoying ""gold sellers"".While the story driven content and graphics have been improved, togheter with general gameplay some things have been ""broken"" as well.For example, most systems in the Galaxy cannot be entered unless you have a specific mission. Almost all systems have a patrol mission, where you enter.. Explore, kill some bad guys or something. But when you've done that once. You are NOT allowed to repeat the mission on the same character.The story arc is also ""shared"" for all the factions in the game. Each faction has some unique missions but in the end they follow the same line of missions but it's done in a way so it's somewhat different and okay in my eyes.They removed the exploration missions. In the old days the game itself generated a random star system, a random map and a totally random mission. So nothing was ever the same. Almost. Anyway it was a fun way to get some diversity in the game when you've done all your leveling and stuff. This was sadly removed because it did not ""feel up to the game standards"" but we have not seen a replacement.So when you're done playing all the story missions and done all the patrol missions. There are also some mini missions on Starbases and some planets, but again. These are non replayable. All you got is PVE and PVP. PVE is mostly dead but if you get in a fleet you can run private sessions. PVP is somewhat broken if you can call it that. It means the ""general"" player can't really compet here because of how out of control DPS has gotten. But that's something you can google. Of course if you wanna' get into DPS it can be quite fun for those who love that.But in short, Star Trek Online is an amazing game that brings the Trek universe to full scale in my eyes. You can visit and see all the locations from the show. All the starships are included in great detail along with a few new ones. The game also take place in 2409-2410. That's way ahead of Star Trek Voyager, Deep Space 9 and The Next Generation. That allows the game to have technology that wasn't in the series. For example personal shield generators and stuff like that. It works out great with the game setting and it does bring the feel of this is what Star Trek would evolve too.There is a lot of Star Trek lore in the game to enjoy, everything from food items to a name mentioned. Or just a location or event in the series. You can also meet a lot of Star Trek Characters complete with audio dialog from their actors. Like the Doctor played by Roberto Picardo, Tuvok by Tim Russ and even Neelix by Ethan Phillips. There are also some people from Star Trek Enterprise etc.The game also now focuses heavily on what happend in Star Trek Voyager, Deep Space 9, The Next Generation, Enterprise and even The Original Series. For example a lot of the deep episodes on the TV shows that was not really fully explained. Like Yeasterday's Enterprise.. The Temporal Cold War. The Iconians.. Stuff like that are explained in the game and it's just amazing.But you don't need to be a Trekkie to play. You can still pick up on a lot of the jokes etc. There is also a lot of customization involved in the game. You have a lot of options when it comes to designing your character. It even puts the character creator in Saints Row to shame, and that's saying something. You can also customize your starship and mix parts. For example a Galaxy Class can have different nacelle's.. (Engines for you non Trek fans).Anyway to this day, even though it's free the game gets new content quite often compared to other MMO's. The only other bad side is that the game community can be quite... Hostile. So it'll be hard to make friends and feel welcome. Try to ignore that, as some of the players including myself are awesome and nice.In short, this is an amazing game. Especially if you are a Trekkie. And the fact that it's free, it doesn't hurt to try. Does it?Also the game runs well on my system, though I have a very powerful system. Sometimes you do get a tad huge FPS drops if there are a lot of clicky powers etc. But that's just the game slowing down. Not you. Also on the Steam Page it's mentioned that it can run on ""Intel HD Graphics"" this is only newer generation. The game was developed to work on Intel HD Graphics so everyone can play it. I tested it on my laptop with a Core i5-5500 2.20 GHz CPU, 8 GB RAM and Intel HD Graphics 5500. The game runs quite well with graphics set to low. You can have things like character detail, high detail objects and textures maxed out. But fancy things such as lighting and shadows must be off. Still runs quite well on a ""non gaming laptop"".

												Star Trek Online I started playing this game a few years ago when it went Free to Play (F2P).  If your a trekkie or a scifi lover I recommend this game.  The different story lines are well put together.  And unlike most F2P games it isn't a pay to win game.  The reasons for that is you can achieve everything the guy that just dropped some of that hard earned cash on a ship or items through just grinding and playing the game.  Play as Klingon, Romulan or the Federation character.  This Star Trek Universe takes place after the Star Trek Nemesis movie. (cause JJ Abrams universe is an alternative one) Leveling your character is fairly easy think I capped out in about two weeks if not sooner.  There is both ground and space missions.  And once you have done all the story’s because you will there is the end content like Special Task Force fighting the Borg and few others.   One cool aspect of this game is the foundry where players like you create there own missions in the foundry and upload them so you can play there missions.  Some of the people creating missions for you are fantastic at it and creating missions and its is pretty fun to give it a go.  Also if your a lonely gamer and don't play nice with others this isn’t the game for you because a lot of content is only accessible if your in a fleet ( guild).  Now there are good fleets and bad fleets.  You will jump from fleet to fleet till you find one you like.  Now on to the four types of currency the pay Zen, Dilithium which you achieve by doing missions, or different events. Energy Credits you get just by playing the game and buying and selling items, and Fleet credits.  Each has its own role in this universe the Zen enough said you buy zen to purchase different items in the zen store.  Now the dilithium which is the most important because you can sell dilithium on the market to turn into zen there is a daily cap on how much dilithium you can earn each day because Perfect World wants you to spend money.  Now the fleet credits are earned by joining a fleet (guild) and helping contribute to fleet projects.   I do however recommend you subscribe for one month if you are getting into the game because of the added perks you receive like ship slots, character slots, inventory, bank, and also the 500 zen they give you for subscribing. Then unsubscribe and you still still have those added benefits.  I still subscribe to this FREE TO PLAY game because you also earn other perks.  But as you progress in the game you will see if its for you or not.  But STO is probably one of the best F2P MMORPG's on the market.			"

												How could I give a bad review for a game that has given me over 40 hours of entertainment for $0? And I know that 40 hours is only the tip of the iceberg. I am here for the story, I am a Star Trek fan, so I play mostly solo and this little game shines under that light. I can't say anything about the PvP, I have never done it. The PvE is pretty fun though. Anyway, as a single player story, for free, it's an amazing Star Trek game. Now let the negative reactions flow, for this is the internet.			"

												First off do I recommend this game??? That is a good question and I would have to say yes and no.Yes if you are a Star Trek fan and no if you are looking for a casual MMO with no pay wall. Yes I know nearly 800 hours in game… But there is no way anyone can play all aspects of this game,  getting 5 Toons (characters) to level 60, have full reputation, end game gear and all R&D at level 15 in less than 500. Unless you pay a boat load of cash and even then there are things that are behind time gates to max out all your crafting will take 4-6 months minimum.   Pro'sThe lore and story are really damn good and the major saving grace of this game. If you are a Star Trek Fan then you will love this, as it takes all cannon and moves on with it in its own universe. Introducing enemas new and old from all over the franchise. you can also play it your own way want to load your ship up with different colours of weapons and look like a happy rainbow of death then go for it. Want to be the next Picard and try to be diplomatic about things than strap your Toon into a Galaxy class, say ♥♥♥♥ in French and go bring peace to the cosmos. Space battles are well done and you will in the early stages have to think about how you approach things even more do on the elite difficulty with friends. Most of the story can be played with friends as a co-op.Graphics are starting to show there age but are still quite pretty.  Ship detail is very good.   Customization is a big strength from clothing to ship paint to various bumpy heads you can change it all including making your toon a midget with a hightist attitude. cons. PVP: let’s get this out of the way PVP is essentially dead in this game and is more between friends than fleets(Clans guilds). The PVP system in game is in major need of an overhaul.Bugs such as doing an episode (Quest) with friends only to have the game say. “Oh no you didn’t and you were never there.”  Beaming into solid objects, Reset to Boff (Bridge duty officer) powers. Yep those are important but hay it’s just to make getting that first place all the more difficult as your team gets murdered when you are scrambling to rest them so that you can helpCamera angle resets at the most inopportune moments, lagrubberbanding ""Boldly going to where you have already been""  can at times be rife.While you can put in a ticket to report bugs as I have many times… Do not expect there to be anything done about it unless it is extremely bad. Lag and banding  are normally felt if an instance has more than 35 persons in it or if your ping is above 90. Before you ask it is not my PC or internet connection my PC being an I7 4770K@4Ghz 32GB ram and 2 R9 280's  and the game is on an SSD the internet connection I have is 50Mb down and 3Mb up  and they system is kept very clean.combat in general is all pew pew pew.Lack of Cryptic love for the science class. Seriously Cryptic treat that class like the creepy uncle your parents told you to stay away from. Other elements. Community. For a game that has little to no official community managers, The games community For the most part are welcoming and helpful with just the few elitist or idiots that blame the noob for their own misgivings Chat is normally quite active and some are always willing to help if you get stuck. There is a forum reddit and various online tools to help with the game. In game currency is split into four parts. Energy credits EC (main), Dilithium, Lobie crystals and Gold Pressed Latnum (GPL).EC can buy you almost anything from ships to weapons but the game suffers from greed a hell of a lot so it may take you time to get what you need with some items costing in the hundreds of million range. There is also a 10.000.000 EC cap on the free to play characters. Dilithium is your life blood for R&D it is needed to upgrade weapons with good procs hoard that pink crap as much as you can and never spend it to get out of a time gate. Lobie is used for some nice to have not need to have consoles and is gained from opening lockboxes.GPL is pointless and not really needed. Is the game pay to win. In the strictest manner no not realistically unless you have more money than sense $5 would get you one fleet module that will sell for about 10-15 mil EC on the exchange one epic beam bank with the best procs will sell for about 100 mil and you would need 8 of them . Cannot buy power or your way to the top of the DPS tree unless you spend a hell of a lot it is easier to grind out than to spend. Ah but what about tier 6 (T6) ships.  Aren’t they more powerful. “NO”  It is the weapons, consoles and the person’s ability to pilot their ship other way around I have in PVP taken down T6 ships with a T4 free ship a T4 is viable at end game so long as you have a dps of over 10,000 you would not hamper your team. Anyway the game is free to play so give it a go just don’t spend cash unless you really want to   "

												First things first, don't let my play time fool you.  I've been a player of Star Trek Online for about 5 years now and I gotta say; it's not getting any better.  That said, let's start out with the good...(TLDR At Bottom)You can't talk about a Star Trek game without talking about immersion.   This game does draw you in and make you feel like you're a part of the 24th century universe that began with Christopher Pike and continued for decades after.  You feel like you’re a  part of an ever growing galaxy, doing missions to better the life of those around you.  That said, it’s only good immersion for one pass through.  Starting a second character on the same faction finds you instantly bored and upset with having to perform the same exact story over again.  Thankfully there is more than one race, which means more than one story.  If you want to stay the same race though, just take a different route (Assault/Science/Engineering) you’ll find yourself performing the same story over and over again.  In addition, the additional content that is added after the 3 main storylines is pretty much identical no matter what race you are.  Thus, you only get one playthrough of the additional content before you're repeating it with your other races. Anyway, back to the good stuff…Sound and graphics are well done in this game.  Arguably the best Star Trek experience yet.  Game play adds to that experience as well.  Large ships, while having more firepower and armor, actually feel bulky and slow while smaller ships are much faster and more maneuverable.  You have to customize your equipment/ship to the style you play or you’ll quickly find yourself in a lot of trouble when an enemy race locks its weapons on you.  There are also a HUGE array of ships you can use, of all classes and sizes, bringing a high level of variety, sort of...Now let’s get to the bad.  This game is distributed by Perfect World.  That means the game is free, but not really.  The game has been slowly converted from a very balanced system to what exists today, a heavy “pay to win” system.  The best ships are only really available on the marketplace and every new ship has a higher price than the last newest ship.  Now, I’m not going to say I haven’t purchased my share of ships, because I have.  But it gets extremely frustrating when a ship you paid good money for is suddenly made inferior by the next ship released, with that ship then being made inferior by the next, and so on, and so on, and so on.  This has quickly become the biggest money grab in the history of MMO’s.Today, if you want the latest collection of “Tier 6” starships (9 in total) you’ll have to fork out 12000 Zen (the store currency) for the bundle, which equals around $130 of real cash.  Believe it or not, that’s actually a deal!  Buying just the tripple bundle for a specific race costs 6000 Zen ($70, roughly).  Buying each ship individually for 3000 Zen would be an astronomical $315!  For virtual ships in a game where said ship will probably be inferior in less than a couple months, that’s a lot.In all honesty, the pay-to-win scheme has literally destroyed this game.  On top of all the crap available in the market, which includes inventory expansions, expanded ship storage, upgrades, clothing, bridge layouts, shuttles, and so on, you start to hate looting ships/people because of all the drop boxes you’ll collect.  Of course, the drop boxes are locked and require you to purchase keys (from the market) to unlock them.  I remember, at one time, having my inventory filled with nothing but drop boxes.  Like an idiot I paid for about 30 keys (can't remember the cost, but it wasn't cheap) and got what I expected.  The boxes either had absolute junk or items that would become useless within a very short time.  There was always a very rare chance of getting a starship in a drop box, but I never did.  That said, I've heard of people spending hundreds of dollars on keys just to get those rare ships.  (Maybe Perfect World isn't stupid, because people are)  After my 30 keys were used I started dumping the drop boxes in the garbage, as selling them on the auction is totally useless.  Trust me, if you go to the auction and type in the name of any drop box you’ll have no less than 50 pages of already existing auctions at stupid low prices.Some players might argue that you can trade in-game dilithium for Zen, and it’s true.  That said, all this has done is pushed the cost of the items in the marketplace higher.  In addition, you can only convert so much dilithium every day, and the exchange doesn’t guarantee how much your dilithium is actually worth.  Honestly, it’s worse than gold farming in other MMO’s.  Not worth the time or effort you’ll have to put into it.TLDR :  So, do I recommend this game?  Absolutely not.  The pay-to-win scheme has pretty much destroyed this game and the massive amount of drop boxes you’ll end up looting will annoy the hell out of you.  It’s got a fairly good story, which continues to expand, but the game just feels like a Ferengi designed it.  So no, I don’t recommend it.  Why then is my play time is as high as it is?  Not really because I enjoy the game.  I was one of the saps who got suckered early into sinking money into this P2W pit of decay, before we saw it for what it was, and I wanna be sure I get my money’s worth before the final nail goes in the coffin... That's why.			"

												I have to say this game has really taken a turn for the worse in the last few years. It feels uninspired nowadays, with everything that comes out just more pay-to-win type stuff. What's worse is the lockbox system, which I vehemetly opposed when it was first introduced a few years back.I've been playing since closed beta. I've logged quite a few hours over a long span of time. Going FTP promised us so much, and for awhile, things were good. For a brief, brief time.Now, this game is just a giant grind. It's not even fun; just repetitive and uinteresting. And that's so sad to me, becuase I love Star Trek so very very much.Perhaps most disappointing is how bad DS9 still looks. After so many years since launch, they still haven't gotten right the one setpiece I love the absolute most in all of Star Trek. Seriously, they dolled up ESD and added Utopia Planetia and a bunch of other stuff, but still haven't fixed DS9. ""But HEY! There's a bunch of crappy new wannabe Star Trek ships to buy! OOO shiny!""STO is one of those games I now just load to see what's new, jump around a little bit on any of my 20+ Vice Admirals, and then quietly delete the game files.Star Trek fans deserve a better game. Save yourself the trouble. The only thing that's Star Trek about this game is the title.			"

												If you intend to get one or two characters to 60 simply to expirience the story get right ahead but if you intend to get decent gear in order to face off in pvp events then turn around right NOW! this game has no pvp any more.  This game is nothing more than grinding up gear by playing the same groups of missions every day simply to prepare for the next set of missions for which you have to grind endlssly.  THERE IS NO POINT ANYMORE.  Yes the the story is decent and the voice acting is neat getting to hear the actual actors from various star trek series such as voyager and the next generation come back to voice there roles here but other than that this game has  nothing. People need to stop handing moey to cryptic for recyclign old ship designs and making them into a new tier.  I see no point of adding a sixth tier of star ships except for them to make a huge prophet.  I cant believe I'm saying this but The Farengi could learn a thing or two from the guys down at cryptic.

												Space.The final cash grab.These are the voyages of the starship ~xX ElItEgAmEr420 Xx~  It's continuing mission; to explore new cash avenues and exploit them.  To seek out your wallet and remove the benjamins.  To boldy crush cannon like no one has before.Update 2/2/15: The above was originally posted almost 2 years ago.  Anyway...I still don't like the cash shop, or the lock box of the month, but I can't deny this time vampire has me somewhat interested again, but probably not for long.  The rewards for doing the missions seem less and less interesting as they divert all that good stuff to the in game rep or dilithium grind.For a now free to play game, it's not too bad all things considered.  Due to the way the player run economy works, you can grind for cash shop items by converting dilithium into in-store currency, so technically you don't have to pay a cent and still get access to everything in the store.  It'll just take a good long while.  It's a good skinner box like that.TL;DR: It has improved since I last played, but I'm still not recomending it.			"

												Let me start by saying that having played MMOs since they were a ""thing"", I HATE free to play games. They have single handedly ruined the MMO genre. Instead of buying the game like Guild Wars 1&2, or paying a monthly fee like WoW, it's considered totally normal now to be nickel and dimed to death while you play a shoddy bug ridden game until the developer abandons it to go make another WoW clone and start the process over again. It's even leached into the single player market with needign day one DLCs to play the damn games. All these free to plays should have stayed sub based with unending trials, free accounts limited in level and gear, or should have gone the buy to play route. Thats said, nothing I can do about it, the market is what it is, here is my review of STO:I've played this game off and on since launch, before it was on Steam and went free to play. It's gotten quite grindy at endgame, but what MMO isn't. You'll probably love this game if you like Star Trek. Ground game is decent, ship combat is a lot of fun. Character creation is very good also, as per any Cryptic game, play as any of the iconic races or an alien of your own creation.Very fair free to play model also, imho one of the fairest. Expansions are all free. Everything in the cash shop can be earned ingame with time. The cash shop consists of mostly cosmetic items, along with ships for every tier, and quality of life upgrades, such as inventory and bank space. The only must buy item would probably be a tier 6 ship for endgame. Up until then, you get a free ship every ten levels. I only say must buy because you will hit max level long before you have saved up enough to buy it for free.They do go on sale, and the in cash shop currecy ""ZEN"" will go on sale once in a while also. But, you can wait and save dilithium, the main ingame currency, for a few months and trade it for ZEN to buy a ship. Why not wait til a sale, drop 20 on the game, and buy a ship and a costume? You've paid more for games that only provided 20 hours of gameplay I'm sure, and the developers really do deserve money for their work. Now, about the pay to win calls claims from people..Yes, it works the other way and you can also trade ZEN for dilitium, which is used in upgrading your gear. It's less ""buying"" gear, and more about speeding up the upgrade process. The thing is, it's not required. You can do all endgame with the highest available MK gear without upgrading it. It makes it so you can do daily mission and reputation grinds a little faster on alts and it makes your wee-wee feel bigger. But really, why spend real money so you can upgrade all your gear to max, skipping most of the game, to then cry you have nothing to do in game? The grind is there for a reason. Don't like the grind? Maybe you should rethink playing MMOs.Call it pay to win if you want, To me, pay to win is paying cash to obtain items that can't be earned in game, or buyign gear that is locked behind raid progression. That's not the case here, but whatever. If you think speeding up what is basicly crafting pay to win, I will never be able to change your mind. Stay away from the game.I think there should always be something you have to pay for in a free to play game. See the games that try to be super fair and only put comsmetic stuff in thier cash shops? They are either suffering from no income or already dead, because if people don't have to pay, most will not pay. Since when does free to play mean free to access all content anyway? Why would a company make a game and then expect nothign in return? Yet, when they do want something in return of thier product, they are villianized by cheap spoiled children. If that offends you, stay away from the game.8/10, Probably a 7/10 for non Trek fans, but it's free, so at least try it. Only game I know with ship to ship space combat that isn't Eve.			"

This review is a thorough and comprehensive breakdown of what is in Star Trek Online. I fully expect it may make some want to play the game, even though my personal opinion is negative. I explain this in the conclusion.An Overview of Star Trek OnlineStar Trek Online (STO) is an MMO set in the Star Trek Universe created by Gene Roddenberry. This is the universe that started with Star Trek: The Original Series back in the 1960s and included The Next Generation as well as many more TV series and movies. This is NOT the Star Trek from the 2009 movie, Star Trek: Into Darkness, and Star Trek: Beyond.tl;drYou thought I would just put it here and let you skip my whole thought out review? The NERVE. JK: it's at the bottom if you really don't want to read this.The Story GameplayYour character, which you can go to extensive lengths to customize (more on that later), begins as an acting officer aboard a vessel. Almost immediately, they will become the captain due to an unfortunate series of events. From this point forward, you take permanent command of the vessel and complete missions which unfold into a story. Each season of missions covers a new storyline. This part of the game is what I found most enjoyable.The MMO ExperiencePut simply, there is little in terms of actual MMO gameplay. You fly around at warp and can see other player-controlled ships flying by on their way to other destinations. In addition to that, there are PvE events which you have a fairly decent chance of filling up the mission queue to get it to start. But PvP is ABSOLUTELY DEAD. In all my hours of playing STO, I've never EVER been able to engage a PvP event because no one wants to play (and to be honest, the controls aren't exactly good for making this a PvP game anyway). And as far a co-oping missions, if there is a way to do it, no one told me. The missions, story or daily, seem to all be single player only.Character Creation/CustomizationBoth when you first create your character and any time you're at a starbase, you'll have the opportunity to modify your character's outfit and appearance with an amazing amount of freedom. Pick from dozens of outfits (less if you don't spend ZEN on them) and use any color scheme you want to (Just a recommendation: make your character an ALIEN. By doing so, you'll be able to give your character almost any features from any race you want, other than a cat tail, and you can much more drastically alter your character's appearance later on.). Also, not only can you modify your own captain, you can also modify the appearance of any of your bridge officers.The ship customization is also surprisingly liberal (no, not the political orientation). Your ship typically be configurable with parts from at least three classes of starship, allowing you to make starship combinations that never existed in movies or on the wiki. In addition, you can choose what type of windows you want, as well as painting your ship with a variety of decals, in the colors of your choice (though only some of the decals are actually good, and only on some ship classes).The Progression SystemAs you complete more missions, you'll earn experience points that help you rank up and acquire bigger and better ships. At every 10th level (at least up to 50) you earn a free ship of the next tier, in any one of the three ship classes. However, to claim each bigger and better ship, you'll need an open ship slot. If you don't have any, you'll have to give up one of your smaller ships for it, and unless you bought it with ZEN Tokens, you'll have to pay to get it back.The Currency(ies)Energy CreditsAt the start of your Star Fleet career (or Klingon or Romulan career), your missions will all award you in Energy Credits (EC). These are useful for buying basic upgrades for starships, low level healing kits, and basic weapons. Because of the upgrades you'll either collect as loot or be awarded for completing missions, this means that you'll rarely spend any EC outside of the Exchange, what you use to sell items to other players. In addition, they are also used to pay for appearance changes (to player and starship) that don't require the use of ZEN Tokens. These latter uses are what most of your EC will be spent on.DilithiumThis will be what you both loathe and need during most of your STO gameplay. Dilithium crystals (DC) are the currency that is not only used for purchasing most starships, but also for fleet projects, purchasing ZEN on the Dilithium Exchance (DEx). As a result, you'll always be somewhat short on the stuff. However, you cannot get  DC directly. Instead, you complete missions which award you Dilithium Ore (DO) that then has to be refined to DC. It occurs at a 1:1 ratio, but you can only convert a maximum of 8000 per day. In addition, the missions you can complete to earn DO are long, tedious, and low reward. It's difficult to even hit the maximum-refined-per-day. This is where the DEx comes into play. Some players will pay with real cash to get ZEN, then sell that ZEN on the DEx to get DC directly, with no daily limits and very little waiting.ZEN TokensThe paid, real-world based curency of STO, this annyoing gold coin is necessary to buy some higher tier items in STO. These include the refit and retrofit starship variants, as well as ALL Tier 6 starships and most small craft (except the Danube Runabout). As with all real-world-based currencies, ZEN is cheaper per-unit as you buy in larger amounts. However, by using the DEx, you can obtain ZEN without ever spending a penny on this game; it'll just take a long time. This is to do with how much grinding it takes to earn DO. It also doesn't help that the price of ZEN on the DEx is always increasing, since there's always more demand than supply. When I started playing STO, the exchange rate was around 80 DC per ZEN. Now, it's at 400 DC per ZEN, and it's only going to get higher. That said, if you can take advantage of a slow period of buying in the market, you can get ZEN a little cheaper and turn it around for a profit of DC. It'll only be a minor victory though, since you'll always want more. More for more character slots, more ship slots, more advanced ships, a character rename, a cool outfit, The Original Series ships and outfits, ... I think you get the idea. No matter how much ZEN you earn through the exchange, you'll have to buy some with cash at some point if you want to buy more than one or two things with ZEN during your STO career.ReputationThis one is the most confusing and the last to worry about. Once you reach Level 50, you'll be able to take part in reputation missions for a variety of factions, including New Romulus, the Dyson Joint Command, and the Delta Alliance. These missions will give you Reputation Marks (RM) that you can use on projects for that specific faction. On completion of the missions, you will earn Reputation Points (RP) that can be spent in combination with DC on highly advanced equipment. There is also a similar system for Fleet advancement, but Fleet projects can be contributed to by anyone in the fleet, and only started by high ranking members.FleetsThe closest thing to a community or faction this game has, fleets are groups you join for a few small benefits. You get another daily mission, and when the fleet is big enough, access to another dilithium mine (and DO mission) which you can transwarp to from the fleet's starbase. If there's more to fleets than that and the projects, I never experienced it.Conclusion/TL;DRIf you just want to play this game for the single-player story missions, go for it. I enjoyed the story. For a fun multiplayer MMO experience, I'm sorry. It's not here, and that's why I don't recommend this game.Fun Fact: Character Limit -->			"

												What once was an interesting and fun game that I played for a couple years, has been tarnished beyond redemption.  I flew with one of the game's top pvp fleets (Sad Pandas) for a long time and now can't stand to even keep it installed because glitches, one-shot-kill weapons, pay-to-win powercreep and the developer's blatent disinterest in creating deep balanced gameplay in lieu of the latest cash shop money grab have sucked all fun from it.

												It begins as a great game if you're a Trek fan, but unless you're willing to grind obscene amounts of Dilithium to convert to Zen, or just buy Zen from PWE, you're eventually going to hit a brick wall where progression pretty much stops.  I can confidently say that a good 80% of the ships in the game, the best Bridge Officers and Duty Officers (the former of which, no joke, are where most of your real power comes from) are only available through Zen or lockboxes.  Even if you get the Fleet version of a C-store ship, you won't get the special consoles or abilities that make that particular ship type good.While it's possible to purchase some ships on the Exchange, the fact that you have a cap of 10 million energy credits ensures that you're going to have to pay Zen to lift that cap if you want to purchase any of them.  Only the cheapest ships on the Exchange won't set you back more than ten mil, and most typically run into the 9-digit range.  You either get a ship with good bridge officer seating and either the durability to withstand an entire squad of enemies shooting at it, or the firepower to obliterate enemies before they can deal appreciable damage, or you're eventually going to hit a brick wall where you won't be able to damage enemy Cruisers and Battlecruisers faster than they can self-heal, or you're going to get obliterated by science vessels, which have abilities that can either damage your hull underneath your shields or just delete your shields entirely.The game looks good for its age, and I have few faults with its storywriting (most of it's faithful enough to the source material that only the most discriminating Trek fanboy will find fault with it), but it's so heavily over-monetized that it will get frustrating unless you're willing to pay.  I run by the old adage - ""If it ain't worth playing through, it ain't worth paying for"" and boy is that ever true here.			"

												Do you like star trek? do you like exploring the galaxy in your starship? discovering new species? settling diplomatic disputes? well than this is not the game for you!First a recount of my latest encounter with this games support:After playing this game for years and having beyond hundreds of hours into it, a glitch in the game deleted one of my ships and with it all of my gear, after contacting support and going back and forth for several days they ultimately told me there was nothing they were willing to do to help me... nothing at all.The bottom line is this is a dying MMO with nearly no effort put into it, there is NOTHING to do in the end game, which will only take you about a weekend to reach max level. The whole game should just be put out of its misery and cryptic should learn how to \ re-evaluate how the currently treat the long term players and supports of this game, especially that still pay money to play a free to play game... They are an inept company that doesn't care about its customers If they didn't have the star trek IP they would have gone out of business when Atari dumped them and part of me wishes they had...The game play is weak, pretty much all you have to do is spam the space bar until you win, the writing and acting in the game are some of the worst i have ever seen, almost every ""new"" mission involves either time travel, and let me sum up ALL of the games story lines in one phrase - ""The iconians did it"" - This hardly mentioned in the show race is apparently responsible for every single event that has ever happened in the galaxy and has become Cryptic's all purpose excuse for poor writing and zero imagination every story line just leads back to an : it was the iconians moment...There is nothing that makes Star Trek so wonderful and enjoyable in this game, no interactions with crew members, no dramatic writing, no exciting moments, no diplomatic responses to anything... simply power up shields - hit the space bar and pew pew to victory...I think my time with STO has come to an end, I recommend if you are a current player you get out before what happened to me happens to you and if your considering playing it please don't, or at the very least don't give them a single penny of your hard earned money it isn't worth it and Cryptic/Perfect world simply doesn't care about any of their players and sadly I don't think they ever will.

												Every gamer has ""The game"" that they play. To some, it's COD. To some, it's Minecraft. To me, it's this game. This is one of the few games I was dedicated to  playing even before I got steam.  When a glitch occured that stopped steam from realizing I was playing STO through it, I didn't play any other game until i solved the issue.  I've spent more than twice the time on this game than my second most played game. I've spent literally more money in this single game than the rest of my steam library, and I'm willing to spend much more.  However, what made it be my favorite game if all time? Well first of all, it aged very well for me. There were of course times where I took breaks to play other games, but no other game had me come crawling back as quick or kept me around for as long. Content is always coming out whether it be the actual developers producing a new episode or event to keep me occupied, or the immense community that is constantly pumping out new and custom-made missions, some of which last for over an hour and some that have an entire series to be played.  There's also so many different ways to play the game. You can craft any career to do practically anything within the game's limits, and I've over 20 characters in the game, each with their own unique build, or at least their own unique twist on one. And the cahracter customization's the greatest I've ever seen in my life. Over 20 different species, spread over 3.5 factions and each species having their own unique ingame traits and character design options.  There's even an option to create your own unique species, if you want to take the time to do so.  Another thing that's kept me around for a long time is the Roleplay Aspect.  While this is more personal subjectivity, Not a lot of games I've played give the freedom and room to create your own entire roleplay series, which me and a few friends have taken as much advantage of as we can.  Of course, this'll only apply if you wanted to roleplay.  Another great thing about it is that the game is completely free and not at all pay-to-win.  You're given full access to all the story and gear, and if you had enough time and resources, you could theoretically buy everything that would normally be bought with actual money through ingame currency alone.  The stuff you DO buy with real cash however can be costly, however I never regretted a purchase I've made in this game (Probably only because I'm dedicated like hell) The game's also been pretty faithful to the official Star Trek universe, so much so that the developers have brought in actual actors from the series to voice their respective characters in game, Including the legendary (R.I.P) Leonard Nimoy. The gameplay is also something I've always enjoyed. While a lot of my friends jopke about the ground combat, I didn't have any trouble with it personally. For the SPACE COMBAT however, it's been universally praised as engaging and loads of fun, which is something I have to agree with 100%Ultimately though, most of the content is only subjectively good, and this is all about Star Trek.  If you don't care for the series,i can't say whether or not you'll like the game, This is because despite actually having a lot of content from the Star Trek universe (Including many of the actual actors reprising their roles) This game doesn't entirely follow the core ideas of Star Trek.I've always been a huge fan of Sci-fi in general, so if you're a general fan like me I'd say it's at least worth a try. it's completely free to download and play through, No story or gameplay is locked behind any paywall, only gear and stuff to either extend your immersion or improve your gameplay.  Again, i'd say it's at least worth a try, you've got nothing to loose, and so much to gain if you find it enjoying.			"

												Once upon a time (~2010-ish), there were two Sci-Fi MMORPGs.  One merely had a ""rough"" start - that was Star Wars: The Old Republic.Star Trek Online is an MMO with a few very interesting ideas, that could be so much more than it is.  First, it's the only MMO I've seen with a level editor.  Second, it takes the idea of character customization to its logical extreme.  Lastly, it's set within a very rich universe.Why am I not thumbs-upping this game?What WorksFirst, customization.  Your ship can be absolutely yours, from the outer hull to the bridge itself.  You can be yours, in that you have 'a few' customization options for your Captain.  Lastly, your bridge bunnies have the same degree of customization that you do.  Want a 2410-version of a battlecruiser with bridge bunnies in TOS miniskirts?  Doable!This game has combat at two levels - ship-to-ship combat  and ground combat.  This is something that, again, I've never seen in an MMORPG, and combat at both levels feels reasonably good.  It's a shame the downsides so outweigh this.While the writing is questionable (this is Star Trek, after all), the missions are more than manageable, and are usually set up to be about the length of a TV episode (and, the official quests more or less fit the TV episode format in some ways.)  In this way, you *can* just set aside 45m-1h for a mission, and walk away satisfied.  Time-boxing in an MMO is something I've - again - never seen before, and like.What Doesn't WorkMicrotransaction.  God, oh God, the microtransactions.  This is the poster child of an Allegedly Free Game.  Sure, you cna download it for free, patch for free, but to have anything resembling the ability to be competitive, you'd better be willing to shell out real money.  Certain buy-only ships have special consoles (sort of like Trinkets in World of Warcraft) that can be equipped on other ships, but have to be de-equipped from the bought ship, first.'But...you can make Zen in-game by exchanging refined dilithium!' You can't make Zen in a reasonable amount of time.  On 4 June, 1 Zen exchanged for 380 Refined Dilithium.  Lowbie ships are 500 Zen, better ships can be 1500 or 3000.  Using that rate, 380 * 500 = 190,000 Refined Dilithium.  Now, sounds good, right?  Just a lot of grinding?  ...That would be too easy.  There's an artificial limit on the amount of dilithium you can refine - 8,000 Dilithium per day.  190,000 (for our lowbie ship) / 8,000 = 23.75 days.  For that newbie ship.  I would define 3 days to 1 week as reasonable for a low end ship, 1 week to 2 weeks as reasonable for a high end ship, and a bleeding-edge ship as being able to be sorted within 2 weeks to one month.Missions.  This game tries to make you feel like you're free to explore, and you (sort of) are...but your freedom only goes so far.  There's a number of missions where you cannot see through obvious deceptions (yes, the Ambassador really is an Undine infiltrator, and it's not subtle) or make otherwise reasonable decisions.  ""But Thou Must!"" is very much in play in this game.  If you want to be a Dangerously Genre Savvy Captain, look elsewhere.Ship selection is another sticking point for me.  If you're Federation, you're fine.  If you're KDF, you're sort of OK for ship selection.  Romulans can just go screw themselves, unless you want to pay out to buy a Federation or KDF ship instead.  The balance of selections is pretty lopsided to the point where I can only conclude you're intended to actually play Federation, regardless of Empire choices.This game is all about the grinding.  If you absolutely must play, join during an XP boosted weekend, to rocket through as much of the early grind as possible.  It won't save you from the mid-to-late game grind, or worse, the Admiralty grinds...but it's something.I love PvP and more or less stopped when it became apparent that the developers share neither my love, nor the interest in keeping PvP interesting.  The game is set up so that there's only really one PvP build per ship, and even then that exists within a very strictly controlled overall strategy.The TL;DRNo.  Just no.  Not recommended, I award Cryptic/Perfect World no points, and may God have mercy on their souls.  This could be an awesome game...but it's just not.  I once compared StarMade, a game with some seriously bad design decisions, to this one, but I wound up taking it back and apologizing, because comparing nearly anything else to this is unnecessarily harsh, and not at all different from saying highly unflattering things about all of a persons' female relations.I would like to not only decry this game, but call upon the indie community to give us a game based loosely on Star Trek, maybe an MMO, that does what this game sets out to do, better than this.  This game is the example of how not to do a game set in space, whatever good points it has.			"

												So I've given STO the old college try and have come to the conclusion that, while I personally enjoy it, I just can't recommend it in good faith to most people. I love Star Trek and that's one of the reason I've played it this long and will likely continue on and off in the future. That and I've learned to tolerate the poor ground combat and some of the game's other weak areas and there are a lot of weak areas.  However it's not all bad. Some of the few good things include:- Star Trek setting and lore- Starship combat- Starship look really good- Voice acting (Where it's included. Most quests aren't voiced)- Character customizationThe bad is most everything else. Very poor ground combat, poor quest design, currency grinding, clunky interface, ugly ground textures and dated special effects accentuated by a patch work of development suggesting a lack of resources and focus. There's also an extremely heavy emphasis on paid content and little attention given to free and pre-existing content that needs work.However despite all that the game is free. If you like Star Trek, if you like Space ship combat then maybe give this game a try if only because it will cost you nothing to do so. Maybe you'll be able to overlook the bad for a while and get some fun out of it. I know I did, maybe you will too.			"

												Ground combat is ♥♥♥♥ing boring, the whole crafting dynamic sucks, you need to pay to be competitive in PvP.That being said, if you're like me, and you want to fly around in starships in the Trek universe and blow ♥♥♥♥ up, I fully recommend this game. Don't buy it to have a great MMORPG experience, buy it to have some fun playing around in starships and mentally reenacting your favorite episodes.Personal advice: don't spend money on this game, just level up until you get the starship you want (for me it was the Sovereign-Class cruiser), play around for a bit, and just quit whenever you start feeling bored. Rinse and repeat if you want to try out different factions/classes.			"

												Having played this game since release. I can honestly say this is the worst is has ever been.I'll keep this simple by making a list of the good and bad.Good-1) Great story, the production quality of the missions has grown since the walls of text in 2010.2) Graphics, the game still looks good even after so long. Consistant updates to the engine have only just started but the improvement is very noticable.3) Largely free-building. There is no class locking, anyone can fly anything (Even if there is only really one class worth using)4) The galaxy map has been combined, even if the instances are now huge and still only have 75 people in them.5) Space combat can be fun, ground combat isn't to bad.Bad-1) Aging engine, graphics aside, expect some serious graphics lag as the old 32bit engine can't deal with the huge particle effects.2) No game play veriety, tanks and crowd control are not in the slightest uway useful, the game is fully focused on DPS. If you like playing a tank or healer, there is no place for you here.3) Class balancing, there is really only one class, Tactical. Science officers are ok, engineers no use for you here, tanking is easily done on a ship, the class is redundant.4) Toxic community and devs, from the dev team that had is public relations person call all PvP'ers '14 year olds in thier mums basement'.5) No end game content aside from repeating grinds.6) Almost literally no PvP content.7) Bugs, Bugs, Bugs and more bugs.8) Wallet warrior friendly, the game used to allow people to earn ingame curreny and convert it to money to use in micro-transactions. To fix that they just made it cost hundreds of thousands of ingame currency with a cap of 8,000 per day.9) Money grubbing, lockboxes, promotional events, speeding up crafting, speeding up skilling. Everything could be done with real money.To sum it up. STO was a gem, it required skill, you needed to really know what you were doing, work as a team. Now its a laggy, spammy, unbalanced mess, and I would not recommend it to anyone.Let this game die people, that way CBS can give the IP to a competent dev team that isn't being ruled by it's asian money grabbing overlords.

												Generally speaking, this game had the potential to be a great Star Trek game.  Sadly, the studio that developes and runs it has turned out to be profit centric to the point of ignoring things like constant spamming by asian players in chat asking you to pay them money for in game currency (which you can't block out until they've spammed you), server disconnects that are rampant (7-12 times per day on average), content that either is tempermental or flat out doesn't work, fleet options that seem to get broken after every other update and content push (which defeats the purpose of having a fleet), etc...Having put nearly 100 hours into the game itself, I'll admit that aspects of it are quite fun but over the years the quality of the game has been declining.  What I find interesting is that again, this game could be fantastic if it was supported and maintained better.  Sadly, it doesn't seem like this is the goal of the developement team.  I suppose when they had the opportunity to do more as a pay to play format, they did what many of the smaller developers do and soaked up profits while neglecting their product.  In the end, what we have is a game that is more of a tease than a pleasure.I'll continue to play for now simply because the game isn't completely broken, but I would STRONGLY advise any new players to NOT spend any real cash on this game.  If the developement team would be willing to fix outstanding bugs, content and servers, I would consider revisiting this review and possibly stating that paying for it would be worth it, but as it stands I simply can not encourage anyone to spend their money on this game.I would caution anyone from complaining on the actual cryptic forums as they have been known to ban people for posting negative reviews on their forum.  If you're going to post anything against them, I would recommend doing it here since Steam isn't beholden to Cryptic studios.			"

												In my experience, a solid 7/10.Star Trek Online is a pretty damn solid MMO, especially if you're a Sci-Fi fan like me. Its combat is pretty good (especially the space combat which is fantastic and could almost be counted as one of the game's best features, in my opinion), the character customization options are also pretty good (especially for Federation players who get a metric ton of playable races to choose from ranging from Vulcans and Humans to the parasitic Trill and the warlike Andorians and telepathic Betazoid). You can even customize your star ships! Many (if not most) of the available ships have alternate parts you can use to replace the default stock parts (ex. all the Federation ships I can think of have alternate engines and saucer sections you can choose from) and different paint-jobs you can apply to further differentiate yourself from other players. You also custom-name every ship you acquire (Federation players can even give their ships their own custom-made registry numbers [ex. the Enterprise's registry number is NCC 1701]).A lot of reviews will highlight the number of microtransactions in the game, but I think they blow it way out of proportion. Does STO contain microtransactions? Yes. A few of the cooler ships available in-game are behind a microtransaction paywall (ex. the Federation Constitution-class is a replica of the original Enterprise and is available for a fee), however, the vast majority of the most powerful vessels in STO cannot be purchased via microtransaction.Are there better MMOs out there? Certainly. But this is, by far, the best Sci-Fi MMO I've ever played. STO's free-to-play model is fair to those who pass on microtransactions but accomodates players who don't mind shelling-out some cash to gain access to some of the ritzier playable races, outfits, ships, and bridge layouts.I highly recommend Star Trek Online to any fellow Trekkies out there who're looking for a decent Sci-Fi MMO since you get to rub-shoulders with awesome characters like Spock, Worf, Sela, Seven-of-Nine, and Tasha Yarr. There are even a few instances where you'll fight allongside iconic ships like Voyager, Defiant, and at least three different Enterprises!If you're a Trekkie, give it a whirl and I don't think you'll be dissapointed.

												An amazing game all considered!To me it's just incredible to see how much it has grown and improved since three years ago when I started playing. It has it's defects, I won't lie to you. But it's definitely the most original mmo experience I've ever had, the most vision inspired and honest endevour!There's plenty to do, space combat is great, complex and exciting. As are the mechanics of gameplay, in general. Ground combat is ok, but improvents are constantly in development. Also, to be honest, pvp play falls a bit short at the moment, even though after just a first match you can realize that there's huge potential, and the community around pvp is remarkable (they even started an open school!). Gameplay is very story-driven, and most of the narrative inside it's absolute TOP NOTCH Star Trek fiction -they have brillian writers. It is, I think, the only place where new Trek episodes are being made at the moment. It's been showcased in many mmo rpg reviews and also won a ""best free to play"" title a year ago. If the game is not enough for you, and if you feel like it, there's an integrated editor called ""The Foundry"" where every player can create their own episodes (=quests, pve campaigns), and upload them into the game for everybody to play, review and vote (there's a periodic competition with prizes for the winner)! The content is limitless! What else can I say... I just loved it from day one and I will keep playing it, as I know Cryptic is committed and passionate about making it a little better every day!Just try it out and decide for yourselves, it's free to play for crying out loud!! :DLive long and prosper!

												I love Trek, and I loved this game for a long time. I played this game OBSESSIVELY from launch until not too long ago (not all through Steam). The devs need to grow a pair and balance this game. If the bottom line is all that matters, and it's making money, then good luck to them, but it's no longer for me.First time around, the stories are interesting and quite fun to play, and if you're into it, then some of the player created missions in-game a fun too, but that's all solo stuff, and the devs WILL find ways to make even the newest player play through ALL of them several times so that not even solo players can escape grinding.When it comes to anything you do with other people, it's a ridiculously REPETITIVE, and intolerably EASY grind fest. Sure, you need to know a little about the mechanics, but however good or bad you are at the game, you only really need two of the five players to know what they're doing, and there there might as well only be one end game mission in the game with random enemy spawn, as all the maps are essentially the same.With the addition of JJ stuff, and the rest of the frankly silly Agents of Yesterday expansion, I will never play this game ever again. GG Mr. Captain Lizard Man - You know who you are.You'll either love it and turn into an uber fanboy/girl for whom the devs can do no wrong, or you'll play it for a month, max out your first character and go play something else.Free to play? Yes, that I will give them. You pay to be impatient, not to win, and it is possible to get everything in the game (barring a few items that won't affect your competitiveness) without paying a cent. Be prepared to spend a long time grinding for it all though, or else start with a plan to have several characters in order to speed up the process. I can't fault the F2P model, as it is one of the more player friendly models I've seen, but end game is so utterly boring once you've done everything even a few times (you'll end up running several maps more than just 'a few times') that it's simply not worth investing the time in as once you do max up, there's a real sense of 'OK, what now?', to which the Devs answer seems to be 'Buy this new OP ship and make the end game stuff even easier' or 'Make a new character so you can enjoy all our solo content ALL over again'. There little to no PvP, and like I said above, a team of monkeys and one half decent player can tackle most of the end game content.And lastly, they talk in their trailers a lot about Exploration. It's total BS and there is literally nothing like that in the game. Let me repeat that. In a STAR TREK GAME, there is NO EXPLORATION element AT ALL.Meh. Big rant from a long standing, money spending player who is really disappointed with what this game has become.			"

												If you are a Star Trek fan and/or enjoy MMORPGs, you will really enjoy this game and may end up spending a lot of time here.The character customization is fantastic, I can lose myself trying to detail each member of my crew. The aesthetics are very good, although there may be some lag if you enter a high player-vs.-environment area. The lore is very good, and you can teleport down to countless planets and walk around, doing missions on the ground. There are vehicles too and the combat is pretty standard for an MMORPG. The grinding and item drops are reasonable, and you can grind HARD to get a good ship, but that will take A LOT of time.The coolest feature is when you deploy your squad into an enemy ship, however, I really wished it could be like Pirates of the Caribbean (the XBOX original, buggy gem) where you could take it over and use for your own, but you cannot (would take away from the grinding aspect of the game).There is a massive variety of missions, both in space and on the ground.The space battles can be very, very fun when you go into an area with a lot of activity. Watching an armada of ships trying to destroy a Borg cube can be intense and rewarding.Would definitely recommend giving it a chance if you were interested.Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												Just as enjoying the original series demands you forgive the rough edges and quirks, so too does STO. The graphics are generally outdated, the ground combat/movement is quite clunky, there is a bit of a  lack of compelling gameplay options for late game, the story delivery/UI is very outdated and limited, and there are many bugs and graphical glitches.BUT, the newer content, and ships in particular look quite beautiful, the space combat is fluid, intuitive, and rewards trying out different builds or ships (of which there are many), and there is a large amount of different gameplay aspects to focus on so that you're never stuck for something to do or tinker with.Generally though, it is quite a laid back MMO experience. STFs (STO's dungeons) reward you for playing well and completing optional objectives (meaning more marks for reputation/fleet), while giving you a base amount if your team can't complete their goal. The emphasis is placed on improving your performance and getting more rewards, rather than having players being locked behind a gear/skill wall they might struggle to get around. If you want to do your own thing without feeling compelled to group up to see all the game's content, you can do that, and if you want to min/max your builds to complete elite STFs, you can do that to.While this means that you won't get that euphoric rush that you might get from doing dungeons/raids in other games (wiping several times before fianlly downing the boss for example), it does mean you are always progressing. There is however a satisfaction in seeing your favorite ship and build strategy come together and improve in subsequent runs.Outside of the combat based gameplay, you have a lot of ""UI games"". Things like sending duty officers and your ships (great addition that might give you reason to fill your ship roster) on missions to gain xp/credits/crafting materials/equipment etc, as well as R&D to craft items. Finally, it is free to play but nearly every aspect of the game is affected by micro-transactions. The good news is that for the most part everything purchasable is either cosmetic (outfits/ships), for convenience(more bank slots/balance cap), or to decrease the grind (xp boosts/buy Dilithium). This means you can see all the game's mission/story content without spending a cent if you so desired, albeit in a slightly less powerful or exotic ship. As I said before though, given the nature of the game's content, this is adequate.It's free to play, so there's really no reason not to try it if you're half interested or a fan (you have to at least try some of the space combat).  Most importantly though, if you can handle some bugs and the archaic story mechanics you might find that you've found a bit of a diamond in the rough.			"

												Ill keep it short. Ive been playing more then the record time on my accout due to when I was first playing I was playing throught the games direct client etc. Anyway game is mostly free to play till about level 50 and then its harder to find free ships. If you use to paying 50 bucks for a game or even 30 you should have no problem buying a ship and flying it around. Ive seen some negative reviews but the reason i personally come back is I love star trek and the game is really the best thing we have as fans of the series to play with. Arc games has some.... Issues but there is alot of content to find in this game. Not as much as WOW or even Runescape in terms of size but more so custom ships and different builds. Ive been playing on and off for about 2, 3 years and you cant go wrong if you want to play the game. Have a open mind and just have fun. Heads up though if its your first time go with Tactical. The game focues more on DPS and choosing this class first with give you the best chance at knowning the game and having fun at first.			"

												After sinking the better part of my university career into this game i came to the conclussion that this game is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bar you go to with your friends. When your with friends its the best, the conversations with the fleet (guild) or random players kept me up late but when your there without your friends you realise its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bar. The PVP is dead or woefully unbalanced and despite the three ""classes"" (the three departments in starfleet, science, tactical and engineering) the holy trinity does not exist here. It is all about DPS numbers with all group PVE actions requiring high DPS to have a chance. The story up to end-game is enjoyable for both of the main factions (fed and klingon) and the sub-faction (romulan) but when you reach max level the game boils down to run the same mission over and over and over to gain currency to buy better gear to make the same mission easier to complete. There is no depth to this game beyond character creation (which is surprisngly robust) and it suffers from pay to win to an unbearable degree.			"

												If you have more than a passing interest in Star Trek, this MMO is worth trying out since it's free; you don't need to shell out any money to reach the level cap or to have fun while you level up. The F2P model feels fair since you can grind for the in-game currency that allows you to buy any ship or NPCs in the game. There is no paywall to speak of since as a completely F2P player I managed to get ships and equipment good enough to do endgame content.My favorite part of the game is building up the roster of capable Duty Officers that you can send on missions, just like what a real captain of a starship is expected to do. Your duty officers can even come back injured if the mission was particularly harrowing, and take time to heal in sickbay. Want to see Seven-of-Nine as a Bridge Officer on your own ship? You can do it in this game.So why did I stop playing? It's not the F2P nature of the game, which I still hold as a gold standard for F2P games. It's the lack of immersion which I crave for in games that finally drove me away. First and foremost, there is an insane number of loading screens. Moving from a room in my own ship to another room can result in a loading screen that can take up to a minute to load. Also, the art direction does not feel like Star Trek and the textures on some of the ship are very low resolution, such as my favorite ship in Star Trek, the Intrepid class. The new ships made just for STO did not feel like Star Trek. Other graphical infidelities kept grinding at me: the phasers on a starship do not fire out of the phaser strips, the bussard collectors are static, the ceiling is way too high inside a ship. And last but certainly not least, I have to pilot the ship myself all the time where a captain in Star Trek leaves the piloting to the helmsman. I signed on to play as a captain, not a helmsman. Immersion gone. I would return to the game if they fixed this but this is impossible without a total rewrite of the game, which will never happen. Perhaps in the next Star Trek MMO we will have a more immersive experience, but don't write off this one just because it's not perfect. It's a great experience while you level up and enjoy the stories in the missions, all without spending a single cent.			"

												I'm a Trekkie, always have been, always will be. Star Trek Online seemed like it was going to be the be-all and end-all of Star Trek games. For the longest time, I believed this to be true...I deeply regret that it has taken me over 1000 hours of gameplay and several hundred dollars to come to the conclusion that this game blows. It is a poorly ""slapped together"", savage abomination of an RPG, with a Star Trek licence.The space combat is quite fun but it is not ST. The ships don't move in 3D, you're on a 2D plane. You spend your time casting a bunch of buffs and debuffs and the ship auto-fires. Where's the fun in that? You can't warp unless you're in ""sector space"". The entire galaxy is mapped and explored(sorry Enterprise, you're redundant now). You can't target subsystems like a warp core or shield generator. Standard ST ship systems, ie. a tractor beam, don't exist unless you have trained a bridge officer in that ability. You can't capture enemy starships. I mean, even the damage physics are severely lacking; your ship stays in one piece until it explodes. I could go on but the list is near infinite.The ground combat just plain sucks. I'm not even going to elaborate.The story is, however, quite interesting.This is a typical ""freemium"" game. It claims to be free to play but you'll be coughing up a lot of dough if you ever want to feel like you're getting somewhere. Don't be fooled, once you're maxed out they'll release another $150 expansion just to keep your wallet from looking healthy.In my humble opinion, the absolute worst thing about this game: It is highly unlikely that we will see another good ST game in the near future, thanks to these licence hogs.Overall I give the game a ""blegh out of ten"". Rather play Bridge Commander.			"

												I've got over 500 hours into this game, still have not earned enough dilithium to buy one of the ""premium"" ships. To buy a ship costs $10-$20 or more FOR 1 F'ING SHIP! And there is no way to buy through steam. Long story short:PAY-TO-WIN or GRIND-AD-NAUSEUM.         As a trekkie myself, I found the game quite enjoyable, for the first few hundred hours. The last couple hundred hours have been a painful, repetitive, attempt to grind for something I know is not going to be worth it in the end. The game is free, but only limited amounts of it. Your inventory is quite limited, you are limited to a few of a certain kind of characters to play as. You cannot access the higher class ships without paying cash or grinding for literally months to earn dilitihium (which you must refine, but are limited to only 8,000 refined per day) then finally using it to buy ""zen"" in an overpriced player driven ""zen"" exchange market. After buying additional inventory slots, and banks slots, and character slots, you can forget about buying a ship through ""grinding"" in anything less than a year.          I had hoped to at least earn ONE higher class ship before writing this review, but have gotten tired of the monotony of this game, and with so many other good games out/coming out, this one is soon to be obsolete anyways. Perhaps that is why the dev's are charging so much for their content, and trying to make it pointless to try to earn anything through ""grinding."" That is why I say this game is PAY-TO-WIN, and that is why I cannot recommend this game to anyone other than the hardcore Star Trek fans. And to them I say this, enjoy this game until level 50-60. Thats it. Unless you want to repeat the same content literally thousands of times to maybe earn a ship. Do not spend your cash on this game. You will have to go outside of Steam. This game is years old, and on its way out. Spend your money on a newer, better game.			"

												I use to love this game, even gotten the life time sub when it first came out and played the heck out of it, the hours here on steam dont even include the many hours i played before it went to steam, but now the game is ageing and its gotten a bit boring. nothing new is really comen out, exept maybe a reskin of old crap. and of course it feels like its turned into a pay to win type game. alot of areas are preaty much dead and game feels like its on life suport.  I just feel that they should just let the game die and give the STO title to someone else to make a new and updated star trek MMO			"

												If I had reviewed this game a few months ago, it would have definitely gotten a thumbs up... but now that I have over 700 hours into the game, I've started to see cracks in the facade. To start with the positives, the game plays like a single player game. I myself do not really care for MMOs in general as I generally don't like being forced to deal with the toxic communities of games, but STO is much different. Sure there are jerks, but by in large the community is willing to help you if you have a question. The game plays just like a single player game, just incase you really don't want to deal with other players.Also, the ships are pretty well modeled, and space combat (especially with a lot of ships) really gives you that big battle feeling of the Star Trek TV shows.Unfortunately those are the only positive I can say without adding negatives, so lets dive into the rest.The story lines for the Romulans and Klingons are especially strong (the Federation is rather generic), unfortunately very early in those two races stories, you end up having to do the same exact missions you had to do as a Federation character. To me it seems to be a huge cop-out by the developer. If you play at an average pace, you will be done with all of the story missions up to current day. When you consider that this game debuted almost 6 years ago, that is quite disappointing. In my opinion, rather than getting any wash-up actor who made a guest appearence, or had a supporting role on any of the Trek shows, they should forget about that and focus on more frequent releases of storyline missions. Speaking of missions, there are a few gems that are well written, creative, and fun to play, but by in large every missions consists of an opening space phase where you fight to reach a planet, you then beam down and have to fight on the ground and accomplish an objective, and then you beam back to your ship and have to battle in order to leave. Those types of missions make up a good 85-95% of the game. Also, the major story arc the game has been leading up to for years (fighting the Iconians), has been a complete disappointment since it has debuted. Almost as if the developers didn't know what to do with it now that it has finally arrived, and now they are in a big rush to end it and debut their new story arc for the game.Thankfully the new story arc seems to involve more exploration and less shooting, which is what Star Trek is really supposed to be about (in theory). Everyone loves space battles, but after the five hundreth time of doing them, it is nice to have something different. There is a system in the game where people can create their own stories and missions, and make them available for everyone else in game to play. It is a good idea in theory, but even the top rated ones I have sampled are amateurish and dialogue heavy. After 5 minutes of playing one you will just want to get on with it and start skipping dialogue. One of the biggest universal complaints about this game are the microtransactions. Yes, this is a ""free to play"" game, and they need to make their money somehow. I don't have a problem with it, but I do have a problem for the ridiculous prices they charge you for the smallest stuff. Want to rename your character? That will be $5. Want to respec your skills? Another $5. Want a cool ship instead of the neutered free ones they give you? That will be $20 AT LEAST. The norm is $25-30. Anything cool, from ships to uniforms, that you may want will no doubt cost you money. Yes you can get the TNG Enterprise D or the Enterprise E from the later movies for free, but they are the much weaker versions. Fortunately you CAN get through all of the storyline missions with the free ships. You may have a bit of trouble in the later stages of the game, but it can be done. I will give the developer credit for how masterfully they've made the game to convince players to pay money. The longer you play the game you can really see how things like daily dilithium refining caps, lack of inventory space, bank space, etc is all crafted to steer you to spend money. It's very sad that the serious players have to have one main character and then several other characters that all essentially farm and supply the main character with enough resources/in game currency to accomplish things in a reasonable amount of time.Also, it is worth mentioning that the Klingon faction is essentially dead in the game. The majority of players either play Federation, or Federation aligned Romulans in the game. Also, doesn't anyone think it is odd that this game which is mainly about the Federation, who are essentially space communists, is centered around an in game item selling system? In order to make any decent amount of money in the game, you will have to work ""The Exchange"" and sell items to other players. Which brings me to the end of this long review. Once you finish the story missions, have joined a fleet (this game's equivalent of a guild) and have gotten decent gear, you will be able to handle anything in PVE (PVP in this game is essentially non-existant, not that it isn't there, people just don't really play it). It is at this time that all there really is left to do is to grind for every so slightly better, and more time consuming to get, gear. When you stop and think about it, and consider that PVP in this game is almost a non-entity and you can already beat most things in PVE when you are in the ""end game"" with ease , what is the point of grinding? If you continue to grind for better gear, and drop lots of money getting the top tier gear, you're only essentially doing it for bragging rights.So anyways, to sum all of this up, if you really love Star Trek and want to try this, go for it, play through the storyline missions, but don't spend a dime on it. Also expect to run out of things to do, other than grinding, within a couple months (depending on how often you play). It's not so much that STO is a bad game, I do think they have gotten a lot right and did fairly right by Star Trek, but that it has fallen victim to the micro-transaction model of making games and is very clearly a cash grab at this point in its life.One final thing, if you do think you want to spend money on this game, consider that someday the game's servers will be taken down permanently (like all old MMOs) and you will be left with nothing to show for your money spent.

												This game has a lot of charm for people that are deeply into retrogaming.  The engine is fifteen years old and it shows.  The visuals are primitive and great fun for the Playstation 2 enthusiast crowd.  However, because the game is built on Cryptic's ancient proprietary engine, the game suffers tremendously.The early (first two weeks or so) of play, this game is very entertaining.  It may be prehistoric, but the pew pew is mildly entertaining.  The earlier storylines are pretty good, but many have been revamped recently, and the revamps are utterly awful.  The dialogue reads like it was written by a middle school student that watched too much scoobie doo growing up.After the leveling ends, however, you are presented with the reality of the game.  Since being bought out by Perfect World Entertainment, Cryptic has lost most of the rights to direct the development of their games.  As a result, Star Trek Online and other Cryptic IPs like Neverwinter have recently begun losing players at a dramatic rate.  The honeymoon after going FTP has reached it's inevitable conclusion with this game as Perfect World Entertainment has turned this game into a thinly veiled scam and gambling interface that utterly diminishes the intellectual property and is pretty offensive.  There is a common excuse used by Cryptic apologists that 'well, all FTP games are like that these days'.  Hogwash.  That's no excuse.Because Perfect World has so drastically reduced Cryptic's resources to develop the game, there has been little to no real content introduced since early last year.  Ever quarter or so, Cryptic is able to scrounge together a 'featured episode' that evidently has never been edited or run through any kind of quality assurance, and call that 'content'.  At the same time, the bulk of their resources and development is spent on introducing more 'lockbox' ships.  These 'lockbox ships' are quickly thrown together reskins of earlier ships and don't really introduce anything to the game.  You have the privilege of paying for lockbox keys in order to open the boxes that contain them if you feel lucky, as you have less than a .005% chance of getting the ship in the lockbox.  The entire game runs off of this mechanic.  Where a valid and reputable game has a crafting system, Star Trek Online has a gambling system, where even if you spend the 8-12 months (yes, an entire year) maxing out a single crafting skill, you can't actually craft the gear you are trying to.  Instead, you are permitted a minimal 'chance' to create the desired gear.  So in the end, Star Trek Online is a good game to play for a few weeks.  As the lead developer has stated the game isn't really interested in retaining players.  They rely completely on gamer churn.  There is no endgame content, there is no meaningful progression, there is no reason to invest a single dime in or continue playing past the level cap.  Everything after that point is a sad scam designed to get you to throw out those dollars.  And we're not talking three or four dollars here.  For the ships gated by Perfect World Entertainment's Zen (ingame currency) store, you are expected to shell out between 25 and 120 for what you're after.  120 dollars for a ship in this prehistoric engine on a game that is just a thin veneer for a gambling simulator.  I would have recommended this game to people about two years ago.  But now, as the population is disappearing and the ingame community is dwindling to nothing, as well as the development team holding a very public scorn for the remaining players, I would have to say 'save yourself the heartache'.  Watching what Perfect World Entertainment has done to the Star Trek intellectual property will break your heart if you're a Star Trek fan.  According to rumor there is another Star Trek MMO in the works.  Wait for that one.  This one isn't worth your time.			"

												I started this game with a strong distaste for MMOs and a love of Star Trek, hoping the gameplay might be interesting enough to support a decent story. Well, it turns out that the gameplay is pretty great (once you level up a bit, of course) and the writing is fantastic! If you don't care about Star Trek, you most certainly won't care about this game (as the best parts are fairly story-centric) but if you do, there's a good chance you'll love it. The ground combat is pretty mediocre, but after the early-game bits the devs clearly realized that, and instead lean heavily into the space combat (which is *awesome*), leaving weirder, more puzzley elements for the ground-based mission bits.  The only real problem I have with the game is its unfortunate need to use MMO trappings sometimes. With the occasional fleet battles notwithstanding (see: recreating The Battle of Sector 001 ad infinitum) there is basically no reason for this to be an MMO. Apparently, once you hit the level cap there's not a ton of stuff left to do besides fleet-based raids, but each of the three factions has a unique story progression, so while I can't speak for the quality of any faction's story except the Federation, there's an easy 100+ hours of story-based game here to play for absolutely no money. That said, it's totally worth a few bucks to get some of the unique ships or costumes from the shows, if you want them. The game is structured around three different specializations (basically buff/debuff/healer, tank/warrior, and minion master), but you are never locked from acquiring a differently-optimized ship and can make up the difference with bridge officers, as well as getting a respec token every few levels, so you're never really 'locked in' to a particular playstyle. Anyway, I just like this game a lot more than I thought I would, so, recommended.			"

												As a Founder, with a lifetime account I will admit up front my opinion may contain a small amount of bias. Since I have not had to pay for the game, following Beta, I have had the fortune of enjoying it off and on at leisure. STO, has evolved since the beginning, with a whole new research and development system, additional episodes with a magnificent ton of canon content, STO allows players to experience up close, old favorite worlds, species we've grown up with for decades, and new, powerful enemies of ancient Trek lore, back to cause destruction. The graphics are mid-level, but the game makes up for those shortcomings by allowing players to fully customize their ships, officers, characters, and more. One evil little caveat, this game is notorious, and I do literally mean Notorious for it's legion of micro-transactional content. I do not agree with the level the current owners of ESO take micro-transactions. I believe that paying out of pocket for the chance to wear Star Trek: The Motion Picture costumes, is a little overboard. This is just one example, there are hundreds more. Each has to be bought separately with coins from the in-game store. Coin's can be purchased with real money. As a huge fan of Trek, up until about 2 years ago I had purchased everything the in-game store allowed, and the sheer volume of new content available by micro-transaction was so high, I didn't have the hundreds or even thousands of dollars necessary to keep up with it. Sadly, there is a lot of content, including actual pay to win ships, consoles, etc. which may be out of the casual gamers reach. If one can overlook this glaring and elephant in the room sized flaw the game has, the game can be fun. The episodes are like playing an interactive star trek series. It has a lot of room for growth and potential. I would recommend giving it a try if you haven't already.			"

												Yeah, the game serisously needs to be revisited, and yeah, all the pay to win stuff is maddening, but it is a free game. Go ahead and enjoy it if you are new to this whole thing. You technically can get almost anything in the game for free, if you are into taking an hour every day for several months to get one ship. I actually managed to level my KDF characters free ship to be fairly powerful. It's no t6, but it still packs a punch. If you are new to it, or just coming back because it hurt you so, it's a free game in which you can play decently and enjoy the ""story"", and the community.7/10			"

												Star Trek Online is a very fun and enjoyable game, as a single player. The multiplayer part of MMO leaves a lot to be desired.

Agents of Yesterday, More like Agents of 2 Hours of GameplayDon't be fooled by the The Original Series stuff they have been pushing, you get to create a brand new character and start in the 23rd century with your own TOS era ship, guns, uniforms, and Missions, Sounds fun right? well it is... for about 15 minutes.I begin to create my character to my preferences and finish with the accept button to start my journey... oh wait Character Creation Failed, i try again multiple times and finally get in the game by not putting my First,Middle,Last name, and enter a bunch of random letters for my ship name.First mission is going well untill I get to the shuttle bay of the crashed constitution class to find that it is closed before i can even get in it. I log off and back on to fix this issue.I check the mission logs to find there are only 6 missions available for the Agents of Yesterday Expansion.... wait what, i team up with a friend for the rest of the missions but was only able to complete 4 with him because every time we loaded together in the turbolift on the way to save Captain Kirk i would fall through the wall only able to beam up and restart the mission over and over. I had to do that mission alone.I come to find out at level 10 you die and have been sent to the 25th century to be a temporal agent, wtf?All of the TOS Ships besides the starting ship are only usable through Zen purchaseAll of the new T6 Ships that are inspired by TOS ships can actually use a TOS skin, but yet there still isn't a T6 Constitution class. lol okBasically this ""Expansion"" is catered to the ""Alt-Aholic"" players in the communuty, this wouldnt be a problem for me to create an alt and do it all again but i have already spent a lot of real money on my current characters ship including upgrading it to a T5-U just for the developers to release a T6 version of it later, not to the mention the amount of grinding for in game currency to upgrade all parts of my ship to the max. I AM NOT going to restart all of that.Anyways the game has gone to ♥♥♥♥ long ago when everything became greedy, i mean they even de-saturated the color on the TOS EV Suit you use in one of the mission's to sell a Re-Saturated and well colored version on the market for 550 Zen LOL..But you know what pisses me off the most? TOS era ships get the freedom to name their registry number from 1,000-999,000. but not regular starships. "

												If you are looking for a fun, zany, free-to-play game that involves spaceships blowing each other out of the sky then you can't really go wrong with this one. A lot of people complain about 'paywalls' or the game being 'pay-to-win'. Yeh, it is, I can't argue with this as I've spent quite a lot over my 400+ hour gametime. HOWEVER, if you only take part in PvE, the story and the endgame reputation system then you have no reason to buy anything. You can earn everything in game. Once I realised this I stopped throwing money into it and I've since had a blast not paying for anything. Granted it all takes a lot longer and some things, like saving for the late game ships and equipment, can take hundreds of hours as well as careful resource managment.I should say at this point this is also not Star Trek, at least not for me. If you liked the TV series for the tense diplomacy and starship standoffs, you probably won't like the 'story' aspect of this game (which involves throwing your starship at wave after wave of opponents in never-ending explosive battles - which tbh is awesome :p). If you liked the films, epic, all guns blazing space battles, (see above) then go for it, you will love this game.The community is pretty good, all fairly laid back and the fleet actions  and STF's are a fun. One final point about the 'pay-to-win'. The ships you can buy with real money are hit and miss, some are worth it, some aren't and they are all upwards of £15, the really good tier5+6 ships are around £25-£30. So... if you are thinking of buying a ship, my advice is to only buy the endgame ships (tier5+6) as these are the ships you'll spend the most time in, I wasted money on a middle tier ship and now it just sits doing nothing and didn't really get me anywhere I couldn't have gotten by just playing the game. If you are wanting to buy a ship do some research, ask around and ask yourself 'Do I really, REALLY need this to enjoy the game?' - Most of the time the answer will be no.Despite the paywall, I would recommend this game. It is cheesy, spacey, laser-battlin' good.			"

												Back into the game after many years away to find a game still going strong. Iffy graphics but a ton of content, and devs keep pumping it out with a pretty huge update.People claim the community is toxic (honestly only Fleet chat is the only chat i really spend time in). But I met only good people in my old fleet. There were people who were totally dedicated to the game and helping other players. My fleet leader was one of them. Ex-Navy vet giving out tips to an eager new cadet, in-game advice and life advice. After he was killed in a car accident his wife got on in the game to continue playing and let us know what happened to him. She kept his profile going on for a while at least.While i was/am the best player, the community here was one of the best i've encountered. RIP. Miss ya bro.			"

												Star Trek Online (STO) is a free to play MMORPG for Windows PC.  I have been playing on and off since the start of Star Trek Online,  Just added STO on Steam just long enough to write the review.  I have 1 account that i paid money on and 3 accounts that are Free to Play.  I use the STO standalone game client only.Positves:STO is great if you want to play for FREE as a simple starship captain in the Star Trek MMO universe.  You don't have to pay any real money to experience the complete Star Trek universe.You can make 4 different faction captains ( Federation, Romulan, Klingon, 23rd Century Starfleet ) on 1 account.  The level cap is now level 60.  Plenty of extra specializations and traits you can add to your captain to improve ground and space combat.  It is easy enough to get to level 50 in a short amount of time, but going to level 60 will take some grinding and time.  PWI does give away stuff for STO, Check the website news often, check the store, attend in-game events, check you email, check google for codes.Basic gear is plentyful in mob loot drops and mission rewards provide your higher tier gear.Plenty of free cosmetic customization is available for your captains, bridge crew and ships.Plenty of PVE missions that are soloable and a few Co-Op battle areas.  Plenty of missions and areas for you to explore with you and your 4 bridge crew. There is player created missions in the Foundry to try out.  Plenty of Events to play through out the year.  Free players get a ship each rank up to tier 4. You can buy some extra ships from the exchange, if you can earn enough energy credits or if you find free giveaway codes or earn enough dilithium.  3 types of ships: Escort = DPS, Science = Support, Cruiser = Tank.Has a mini-game that you can send your duty officers and your fleet of ships on their own missions offline and you reap the rewards of their success.STO is Free to Play friendly, not as bad with limitations added to free accounts as other games. Usually the e-mail / chat unlocks with 20 plus hours in-game.  Inventory and bank is big enough, has in-space access to bank and email.  Free players have many slots in the Exchange to sell items.  PWI does give away a few ships and stuff, in event, in the store, reward codes to your email and find reward codes giveaways or for donations on other websites.-------------------------------------Negatives:Free to play accounts are limited in number of bridge officer slots.The game is still very buggy, but it has been Expanded, nerfed, simplified, reworked and changed over the years.  The game is pretty laggy at times, it has not always been.  Lately, The devs keep breaking old things and not fixing anything.  Game client crashes and disconnections happen often now.  But when the game works for you, it is great.If you are into playing PVP, forget about PVP, it is dead because of power creep, new players will die everytime in a match with veteran whale players.PWI is milking this game for money, but if you can buy PWI money cards they can be used to buy STO stuff.  You have to spend real money to play in style or be competative at elite end level content.  Give it a try. Play it for FREE only.for more info:

												Since Star Trek Online is now free to play, there is no real reason to buy it other than to save yourself a 4 GB download. This is a massive multiplayer online game that is part role playing game, part over the shoulder shooter and part star ship navigation and combat. I love Star Trek as we probably all do to even be here reading this. I've always wanted a game that gives you the total feeling of captaining a star ship, commanding an away team and interacting in a universe. Star Trek online feels shallow and hollow in some areas, yet needlessly cumbersome in others.The game is shallow with interactions and choices. The game delegates talking with characters down to a portrait and written text. No voice acting, but maybe I have been spoiled. I take that back, there is some horrible voice acting from Leonard Nemoy to start the game and the holographic doctor that acts as a tutorial is one of the flattest and worst voice acting I've ever heard. Especially when the EMH doctor on Star Trek Voyager uses the same lines with a pop and snap. The dialog is so bland that I just skip through it because everything you need to do is marked with an exclamation point. It would have also felt better to be able to interact with more random objects like scan flowers that are not marked and have a 1% chance every hour to find something. There are still interactions like anomalous readings that open up a wave pattern mini game that is very easy to say the least.Right off the bat it is a disappointment as you are thrown into a conflict with the Borg who in the Star Trek universe should not be for beginners. Nor should they fall easily, but you might as well have a fly swatter for all the Borg you'll encounter.Luckily if you have a problem with the missions, there is an actual mission editor. You can submit your missions and have them put into the game which is a nice touch.Like any MMO, you get to pick a race, pick a class from three (red, blue and yellow). Everyone seems to pick red. Each race has special traits and you can customize your look with excessive detail. It all feels very superficial.When you're not walking around and talking, you're either flying a ship or shooting things. The shooting is good and pretty easy even if its one dimensional. Point your phaser at the target you want to die or blow up and keep firing til its dead. Shooting civilians doesn't matter... and it should. You get an away party that you make up of crew members that you find or recruit throughout your play. Its a fun micromanagement thing and your allies are pretty competition and takes away from a MMO when your party is made of computer characters. The ability to just jump into someone else's party to replace the computer would have been nice.You have some basic controls to fly around, but it seems a little cumbersome, throttling up to go forward and then going to impulse... Flying around objects and toward objects to blow them up or beam off survivors. The visuals are beautiful here, but the fact you're over dead space makes things seem pretty lifeless unless there's a space battle going on.Space battles are where the game excels. You have 4 ""power"" settings... attack, defense, speed and balanced. They all do what you'd think to make it easier for you to survive. In a space battle, your star ship has 4 shields, front, rear, left and right. Taking too much damage to one shield will leave your ship vulnerable and easy to kill. So you need to maneuver around the ship you're facing firing off phasers to drain their shields and torpedoes to finish them. Oh and aft weapons as well. The weapons have cool down times just like any MMO. Some space combat missions feel like a slog when you're on your own... kill 4 enemies here, fly there, kill 4 more enemies, fly there, kill 4 more and go back and they respawn... 1 ship vs 4 quite frequently. There are no quick battles until you level up. Then there are massive battles MMO style where its 10 players vs 1 super ship or 10 players vs 10 ships then 10 more then 10 more then 10 more. There is a noticeably slowdown on my laptop for those.You can visit your bridge and ship interior from your vessel, but there is little life there. There are plenty of NPCs and big hollow areas, but no one speaks and its more of just a little head nod that... yes we have your ship interior. Perhaps in further stages of the game the bridge opens up, perhaps when your ship is boarded by alien hostiles... but that is just a prayer that's what happens. Perhaps drama of your ship filling up with deadly gasses and you and a party need to save everyone. Oh and another glaring detail is the fact that when you start the game you pick how your uniform looks... why is it no one else from my crew is wearing the uniform I have chosen? Am I the rogue ensign captain that does as he wishes?The missions greatly vary but after a while they feel very copy and paste. Some missions are well thought out with plot twists. Other missions seem one dimensional, like space battles where you need to destroy 4 satellites protected by a squad each... then fly to pick up dilethium that is guarded, then drop off dilethium but you can't, because your transporters are being blocked by a jamming station that is guarded, so when you return after destroying the jamming station the dilithium drop point is guarded. Constant space battles are not a good thing. Neither are the missions where you are exploring random planets where 2 of which have been baron and devoid of life or action. You are sent down to scan 4 objects on one with no enemies and barely anything to look at. Another planet had me in a cave with no enemies downloading audio logs that I couldn't listen to... what? Those are the bad missions and the missions seem to each take 40 minutes with sections that take 10 minutes.5 or 6 hours into the game, you get duty officers that you get to send on away missions. These are not missions that you do, but rather as a captain you need to assign the right people for the job. Its a nice little add on, but not needed for sure. The officers have jobs and personality quirks like stubborn, a team player, logical and so on. The missions specify what traits and jobs are best suited for each away mission.In all, with no voice acting for the flat characters and bland dialog coupled with mediocre missions I can't get into it and I'm a big fan of the lore. I really think that the game makers missed the point of Star Trek and that wasn't space exploration it was drama. Sure you travel to far away planets and dogfight against other star ships, but the point of the TV series and movies was the characters and this game has flat characters. The game doesn't really feel like an MMO. After 15 hours I've never really interacted with anyone except for seen them flying by and the big boss battles. Nothing seems to have consequence, there could have been factions and alliances instead of just Federation vs Klingon. Or your own personal alliances like Morrowind.			"

												I have been waiting for a long time to write a review on sto as my years of playing from before F2P up till now has been a love hate relationship with this game but year after year Cryptic gives us less and less end game content and more lockboxes and broken promises. Whats really sad is how the playerbase seems to have little to no problem with this trend that turned a once solid star trek mmo, into a star trek theme park with cash grabs at every turn. AoY I think was the last nail in the coffin for me. I'm a big fan of TOS and was very happy to hear about it being added to the game. Sadly yet again Cryptic has dropped the ball by making what could have been a great new area only useful up to level 10 and a few missions. I would say its a waste of potential but it seems STO itself is now a waste of the Star Trek IP.			"

												The Game itself is ok, but I found it buggy. This wouldn't be so much of a problem if it had acceptable customer service, which it doesn't. Perfect World's Customer service does nothing for you, except have you jump through hoops, and give you cookie cutter responses. I played the game a year or so ago, and left because the customer service was lacking. I came back to the game a few weeks ago (to discover my old toons, were wiped away, but thats not my complaint) Due to a bug, I lost access to the captain level ships. The GM I contacted was unable or unwilling to do anything to address the issue other than telling me that it would take development time to fix the issue, and then told me to submit a bug report, but that QA wouldn't repond to me. After leveling for several weeks, I found my character unable to proceed with the game, and I couldn't bring myself to continue playing and supporting a company that treats its customers in such a way. There are plenty of other games out there, from companies who know what customer service is supposed to be. I will never play another game with perfect world's name attached to it.			"

												I've always been a fan of Star Trek, and this game offers another path into it.  Its great to see that some of the actors in the series have been part of it by supplying thier voices.  It's definatly a commerical draw in the aspect where by you need to pump a lot of real life money into the game to have some of the cool things, but so far I've been happy with the choices Ive done on a limited budget.For those of us who like single player games, its a good mass multiplayer game to play single player, yet have more than enough real players to make it not feel like a SP game.I also like the development of constant new content and updates.

												Oh Star Trek Online, a game I have WAY too many hours in... I bought the lifetime sub at launch back in 2010, which I've more than gotten my value out of. Though my roommates soundly mocked me at the time (and still do). Anyway, the game is overall pretty fun. You're a Star Trek captain flying through the galaxy, exploring strange new world, seeking out new life and civilizations, and becoming the largest mass murderer in the history of the galaxy,  committing genocide on a scale untold. Seriously, you are probably responsible for the deaths of millions, possibly billions of people. All because they know people like to shoot things.The space combat is FAR better than the ground, though ground has come a long way since launch. This is an MMO first and foremost, and to some extent it's pay to win, but as a F2P you can still do everything. The game has been well maintained by the devs over the years, seeing active development and updates. I highly recommend anyone who starts the game to check out /r/sto regularly and join a fleet, specifically the Reddit Fleets are great to start and the RedditChat as a chat channel which isn't filled with garbage, it's actually pleasant and social. I enjoy the game, would recommend it to any Star Trek fan, and anyone that wants a fairly low skill space MMO. 8/10			"

												I played this game at release with a buddy of mine cause we are dorks.  I'll admit it didn't captivate me at release and we only played for a few weeks and then moved on to other games.  With this lul period of MMO's we are in now (2017) I decided to get my account updated and linked to the new owners of this game and i've been playing everyday since.  I'm really enjoying the complexity of all the skills and traits (something MMO's have moved away from since they want to appeal to larger audiences) and have been really happy with it.  I even started watching some people stream this game and was given a T6 ship in a giveaway!  Community seems to be really nice (which is pretty rare in MMO's today).  10/10 will recommend this game to as many nerds as I can find.			"

												As many have posted in their reviews, after the game went Free To Play, it started to go downhill, and fast. The introduction of lockboxes, and the quickly escalating spam of premium items, made it nearly worthless to try to buy things using ingame currency, since all the best ships require real money (or, at the very least, a substantial amount of time mining dilithium). I lost interest long ago.However, the reason I'm writing this review is to not talk about the gameplay or how it rates as an MMO, but rather how it measures up to its IP, and whether it's an MMO with a Star Trek branding treatment, or it's a Star Trek GAME that HAPPENS to be an MMO, because I haven't seen any reviews that cover this angle. Unfortunately, in this regard, it fails catastrophically at being a game that honors and respects the IP that it represents.Even back in the very early days, this game pushed my feelings on the Star Trek lore a fair bit; though the storyline at launch was somewhat compelling, it was also pushing against what was invisioned by the creators of Star Trek. The storyline at launch was basically, Romulus gets blown up (as per the 2009 Star Trek movie), Species 8472 (called the Undine in this game) decide to infiltrate the governments of the Alpha quadrant, and as a result the Klingons declare all-out war against the Federation. Though I was iffy on the Species 8472 involvement, as I felt that Star Trek: Voyager wrapped up that thread peacefully quite well, it does feel like Star Trek.Much later on, I also had to give praise to the Second Wave content release, which brings in the Dominion, based on the Star Trek: Deep Space 9 episode ""Sacrifise of Angels"", which asks the question: What did the founders do with the 2,800 Dominion ships in the wormhole, on the way to crush the Federation fleet during Operation Return? Answer: Flies out of the wormhole 40 years later in 2409. Ultimately, it proves to be a rather entertaining arc, and it felt like Star Trek.However... from there, things get pretty sketchy. For one, it introduces enemies that shouldn't even really be around. For example, the Hirogen, who are in the Delta Quadrant, based on Star Trek: Voyager, would need to fly over 30 YEARS to reach the Alpha Quadrant. Though that is feasable since STO takes places about 40 years after the Dominion War (which is roughly when Voyager was launched into the Delta Quadrant), consider that the Hirogen are a species that only travels in very small groups. To fly so far, and to show up with enough numbers to make a significant appearance in the Alpha Quadrant, escapes the suspension of disbelief.Another problem is that there are a lot of enemies. Even when fighting the Klingons, the Federation would have its hands full; previous wars has always pushed the Federation to its limit. Yet, we have the Federation fighting the Borg, the Romulans, the Hirogen, the Cardassians, the Dominion, the Iconians, the Undine (!), the Tholians, the Gorn, the Breen, and I'm sure there's more. Let's recall that, during the Dominion War, it took the combined efforts of the Federation, Klingons, and Romulans at full strength to fend off the Dominion, Cardassians, and the Breen, and to fend off one borg cube (and not a tactical one, don't forget). By the end of the war, the Federation, Klingons and Romulans were completely spent, with most of their fleets, and many billions of lives obliterated. And, let's not forget that, had the events of ""Sacrifise of Angels"" ended up with the 2,800 ships arriving instead of being erased from existance, the war would have been lost. Now, consider that the Federation alone is facing a full-on Borg invasion, plus everything else, and have no real allies to count upon, and you realize how silly this entire game is, in the scope of the Star Trek universe and canon.And, finally, this leads to my third and final problem with this game, and that is this game completely lost track as to what Star Trek is all about. Even in Deep Space Nine, where the Dominion invasion takes up half of the series, and involves many epic conflicts, there was always some time to explore, some time to have interesting political intrigue, and some classic Trek-like storylines, that showed that, even when things looked bleak, that the heart of the Federation, and Star Trek as a whole, was still vibrant as ever. Even when the Star Trek: TNG-based movies had fights in them, most of it wasn't even fighting, but the crew trying to figure out diplomatic or otherwise creative solutions to solve the crisis of the day.Unfortunately, in this, Star Trek Online fails. Though, yes, there are missions that focus more on tasks rather than combat, they are the extremely rare exception to the norm, and almost every mission will have at least one fight, and of those fights, there are almost always more than one starship. Think about all the lives you've killed from your tours of duty; even in Star Trek: TNG, the destruction of ships was always a last resort. In Star Trek Online, you're basically shooting on sight. On top of that, most of the missions involve some sort of war-against-species-of-the-area and trying to eliminate the threats. It gives the feeling of hopelessness, like, will the Federation (and/or Klingons) ever see peace again?(RE: Star Trek Movie)Sadly, the new Star Trek movie series from 2009 and up also follows a very similar path, and involves some sort of epic-level threat, and absolutely no intrigue to make it feel like Star Trek. Though they're great popcorn flicks, they're terrible Star Trek movies.(/Movie)It is these reasons why I can never play Star Trek Online again, and that I hope the new Star Trek TV series completely ignores the canon established in Star Trek Online. It would be interesting to see the storyline of Star Trek in the prime universe post-Romulus, and I hope that when it comes out, it's nothing like Star Trek Online.TL;DR: If you're a Trekkie, save your soul and avoid this game. If you're an MMO player, avoid it because it's pay-to-win.			"
