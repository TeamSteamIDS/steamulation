												This has got to be... The best game I've ever played!How have I gone without playing this game before?I am just speechless at how magnificent this game is.Sometimes, this game haunts my dreams with its beauty.Generally, I refrain from reviewing games. As you may have noticed however, I MUST review this gem.My life would be incomplete without the Vigil Experience(tm).Every time I view the game in my library, I tear up a little.So, for those of you wanting to buy this game, I leave you this:Usually, take any review you read with a grain of salt.Carefully read between the lines each for review, even this one.Keep in mind, I'm not recommending this game.Sorry reader, but read the first letter of every line.

												Well what can I say about this game?Lets start on how to run it:Compatability to XP/2k, play now in steam, that will take you to ""RIP-Trilogy"" page.  Hit the download demo button (even if like me you already own the full version).  Don't download, just keep the pop-up up. Hit play now again and there you go.  Hit ALT + Enter when it locks up.  If you hit F12 for a printscreen it will lock up.Now the good:It's usually free in a bundleIt's weird and abstract lookingWhen it runs ... it runs.The bad:Hard to get to runCrappy controlsGood concept, but the actual game sucksHow would I rate this?Better than getting a prostate exam by freddie kruger.About as useful as a penguin with explosive diarrhea on a school bus.I now know to avoid anything by freegamer or meridian4 "

												Don't waste you money on this. I really don't know if they game is incomplete or is mean to be like this...  when i installed it it send me to the page of the game ""RIP - Trilogy"", i did have to clic on the download demo to be able to start the game. A lot of black screens where you only hear weird sounds, poor graphics, my monitor was constantly attemping to adjust resolution. Could get to the first level trying to click some parts of the scenery, send me to a dark screen... go to the menu, click on clues, the game crashes.I suppose my PC is not compatible with this game... i suppose it may work on olders machines.. i suposse the dark screen are the pre-render videos... do you want to try your luck?

												This game definetly is.... Unique for sure. No other game quite has the gameplay or graphical stylings that this does. However it soon becomes apparent WHY no other game has these. The camera often hides vital gameplay elements or vital elements are obscured by other similar looking black and white pieces. The controls are confusing and just buggy, the story is... somewhere. No idea where but wherever it is, its consuming a large amount of LSD.Just avoid.			"

												Avoid... it's garbage. Look up a playthrough of it, you'll see you're not missing much for not being able to purchase it. This game had potential by the looks of it, but lost it the moment it took its first breath. Nothing makes sense, you have to figure out the controls yourself, you make one mistake and you have to start the level over. It's dull, it's dumb, creative, but it's like biting a sandwich of ash, crap, and old people sweat.If you see this game in a pack, avoid buying the pack as you'll be stuck with this game. If you want to remove this game from your library, be sure it's not tied to a pack you bought it with or you'll lose access to those games as well!-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												So, there are a lot of reviews joking about this being a link to ""RIP Trilogy"".  That's absolutely true, but since I was determined to have this game function, I downloaded the ""RIP Trilogy"" demo.  After that, the game launched!I figured since I got it running I would give it a fair chance, and so I started up the first act of the game.  Only, the game decided it was the right time to change resolution, and the video did not play.  I followed the tips and tricks about using the common Alt+Enter screenshot to drop the game from full resolution to watch the videos.  Hurray, solved!  I kept on, and completed the first area... then the game froze!  Last straw, game!From the bit I played, it was a pretty abtruse point-and-click adventure game.  Not helping it was the art style -- there are ways to do a minimalist visual style well (see Killer Is Dead) and there's oversimplification that makes it uninteresting.			"

												I like unique and creative games, and that is certainly what this game wants to be, but it falls short on every level.  The art style is so abstract that it is very difficult to understand what you're looking at, especially as the camera changes to extremely unusable angles with each new room.  The voices and sound effects are just painful to hear.  Beyond presentation, the game progression is completely arbitrary.  Randomly clicking around is your best way to determine what actions are even available to you.  There are game segments which want to be puzzles, without any indication of your goal or the pieces.  Finally, the story is ridiculous, less than one dimensional, and completely unrelatable in any way.  I hate to talk poorly about a unique game, but this one has earned it.			"

												Many years ago I got this game in some kind of bundle. The game looks weird which isn't a bad thing but I didn't know what to do. Now after all those years I wanted to try this game one more time to see if this was really that weird. Sadly, the game is no longer playable. When trying to open the game, you will get redirected to another Meridian4 (dev) game called ""R.I.P."". Besides I'm pretty sure the game is not even being sold on Steam anymore, but that's no real loss.P.S. I did not spend this many hours into this game, the game got stuck in the background.			"

												Vigil: Blood Bitterness combines a unique art style for gaming with some interesting sounds and wraps it around a bizarre story. Although it is a simple point-and-click adventure at heart, it is far from being intuitive.I ended up getting frustrated to the point where I just went to YouTube and watched the entire story instead of playing it myself. The whole game can be completed in about 30 minutes and I didn't feel like I missed out on anything by simply watching it unfold.The most annoying thing is that there is a known issue on Windows Vista & 7 systems where you are only able to see the videos when the game is in windowed mode. This would be fine if the game didn't force fullscreen every time you exited to the menu or returned to the game.It's weird, but there's nothing here that I can really recommend. As part of the Puzzle Indie Pack on Steam, it is a great ""freebie"" considering all the other games in the bundle are decent.			"

												After installing Vigil: Blood Bitterness, clicking the ""Play"" button redirects to a Steam game called ""RIP - Trilogy"".  In order to get V:BB to run, you must install the Demo of ""RIP - Trilogy"".  Once I was finally able to get V:BB running, the in-game cutscenes which are prevalent and apparently provide the only progression clues did not work properly.  I could hear what was going on, but all that was visible was blackness.  I was really looking forward to this game because of the graphic style.In the forums, some people have found a workaround to get the cutscenes to work in compatibility mode, but I'm not going to waste any more time on a game that solicits other games as a requirement for play and doesn't work right out of the box.I purchased V:BB as part of a 4-Game $1.00 Indie-Pack, so I'm not too concerned with my loss.

												This is ridiculous.Let's begin with starting the game:You launch it, and instead of showing up, the game will take you to the Steam Shop site of RIP - Trilogy.A short research told me, that I have to install the demo of RIP.Luckily, it's enough to click on the download button and then cancel it immedatlely.Once the game is started, I had a black screen and some noises, then a screen showed up where I had to choose between three 4:3 resolutions.Once done, the game starts: Another black screen with weird noises about a minute long this time.After that I was finally in controll. After clicking the first clickable thing: Black screen, weird noises.Okay then, another quick research.The black screens are supposed to show videos. Since they seem to only play in windowed mode, you have to activate it manually via alt + enter, since there is no option for it.That fixes another bug too: The subtitles only show in windowed mode.So I finally began to play, noticing that the window goes to fullscreen again very often, so I missed still a few cutscenes without anythingI could do about it.After few minutes of this frustrating gameplay: Random death.Or at least it seemed random.After I died three times in about 20 minutes, without being able to tell why, everytime starting from the beginning of the act, I managed to progress a bit more through this black and white nightmare.Then it happend again. Automatic switch to fullscreen, so I switched back to windowed mode. Only this time, my surroundings disappeard, leaving me with only my character visible.A little bit confused, I tried to click on the ground around him: Death animation.At this point, I just couldn't bring me to play anymore and uninstalled it.0 out of 10 points for this pile of garbage.

												This game is quite weird from my personal experience, and I didn't really get much to go on but it's fairly straight forward as is. I would not recommend this game if your not on Windows XP/2000. Reasoning for this is, I guess this game is probably a pretty old engine 2000 based game? (Idk) So due to this running on Windows 7 for example your going to notice you won't be able to run in fullscreen, you only have 3 resolution options, and 9/10 for a avg screen,it's not going to really fit.. especially if you have a big gamer screen. This game will attempt to run fullscreen despite this and you have to ALT+ENTER to force Window the game,this will require repeating every time you reach the next 'Act'. As a modern gamer, I don't really like this game at all. I never finished this game fullthrough,I got to Act 2 and apparently fell off the map and 'Game Over', not really interested in pursuing the game further. The second and major thing about this game (May be just for people not on XP/2000) is that on first-launch it will redirect to RIP Trilogy 3 Store Page,it requires you to own the game and or demo. Sure the game demo is 30MB,small, but the principal of it is quite surprising,why do I need to have your other game just to play a game of yours I already purchased? (Or at least 'try' your other game). From what I've read online this game appears to be pretty short, I can't really confirm since I never finished but I'm never going too, not interested.			"

												After playing this there is a great amount of bitterness running through my veins, so I guess it lived up to it's name in that respect. I played this game to see if the reviews were exaggerating (I got one of those Puzzle Indie Pack coupons), so the first thing I will say is: They were not exaggerating. Not at all.  I'm not entirely sure what to say, like as with the other reviews the design idea seemed cool. Y'know until you actually put it into practice and realise that walls and doors and open spaces are basically the same colour: black (yay!). The cutscenes for me were broken, so I was probably more confused than most of the already confused people playing this (or less, you never know). The movement is awkward, the camera angles were frustrating...I think what I'm trying to get out is this game was so confusing and so poorly designed that it felt like less of a game and more of a chore.

												There are times when Metacritic gets it wrong, and this is most definitely one of those times.  A score of 61 would put this game in the ""Meh, it's OK"" category, though with Vigil:  Blood Bitterness, that decimal point needs to go about 1 or 2 places to the left.  Even a score of 10 should have triggered a federal investigation of payola over at Metacritic.The game's one novel feature, the developer's apparent tweaking of the Dark Engine's texture filters until only black and white remains, is a one-trick pony that wears out its welcome within minutes, and becomes simply glaringly, wince-inducingly annoying.Gameplay is nothing more than an exercise in frustration, as clues are cryptic without being logical, solutions are arbitrary and often linked to timers tuned so short that anything less than following the developer's intended path and timing, without an  angstrom's width of deviation, will result in certain death and banishment back to the last checkpoint.  Bugs are game-breaking and interspersed with the wonky puzzles in such a way that there is no way to tell if you are simply approaching the puzzle ""incorrectly"", or if the game has broken itself in such a way to make the puzzle unsolveable.I had played through a section with a long walkway outside and ""airlocks"" at each end.  If you remained outside on the walkway, you died, suggesting vacuum outside.  If you didn't open, run through, then CLOSE both airlocks, you died.  If you ran through, opened and closed both airlocks, BUT didn't run far ENOUGH into the next room, you died (That's right: if you did it correctly, and were standing inside the safe room -- but too close to the CLOSED airlock -- you died).  If you ran through, opened and closed both airlocks, ran far enough into the next room, BUT didn't do it quickly enough, you died.  Fine.  Except that a few puzzles later, backtracking through this area, one could now stand anywhere on the outside walkway indefinitely.  The airlocks were now open and inoperable, presumably because that section was now ""solved"" and no longer necessary.  So, really, just suddenly no more vacuum of space?  But as soon as I stepped through the inoperable airlock into the next room, I was immediately killed by asphyxiation, judging from the death cutscene -- a cutscene by now in furiatingly familiar to me in this area.  Finally, giving up after about 36 tries, I looked up the solution on YouTube, only to find that I had done everything correctly, but the game had jiggered itself up so completely that it was now  impossible to ""solve"" and progress.I generally make a strong effort to complete every game I begin, but this game had played me like a cheerleader plays a nerd on prom night, and I had had enough.  I never went back.  I swear, as I clicked ""Delete local content"" I heard myself let out an evil little giggle.So don't do it.  Just don't.  Browse away from this page and never return.  If I can save just one of you from the torture that I endured trapped inside this ♥♥♥♥ of a game, then my suffering will have been worth it.  Look upon my trembling, twitching form and mutter, ""Wow, that could've been me"".  Now go.			"

												Steer clear!  First off, this game will not run properly on Windows 7, and I'm guessing Windows 8.  You have to run it in compatibility mode and it still doesn't work correctly.  In addition, the game tries to force you to install the demo for another game before you can run it.  You can trick it, but this is still extremely shady.  After you finally get it running it's just confusing and barely playable due to many graphical erros and hiccups.  Avoid it completely, even if like me you were suckered into buying it in a bundle.

												It's confusing! It starts you out with like only using the mouse to click around (The only way to navigate) and you just wander around a castle or church I don't know! No introduction or anything, just a main menu that is just a blank picture of black and white, you create a save file, and just start playing.			"

												No. Just... No. I have absoutely no idea what is going on, and the game makes no sense. I never finished it. Play the demo beforehand and see if you can find out what in the world is going on in this game. My reccomendation... don't do it. Nor do I suggest buying any of the Merdian 4 games, except for like shadowgrounds and a few of the other good ones. They make just strange Indie games.			"

												AwfulMalwares its way to the RIP trilogy steam page instead of actually launching it.If you have to you can still launch it (see the other top review for how) but even then it's a pretty horrible game experience.""Played"" this for 5m just so I could review itNo settings other than screen resolution at startupThe colors...jezusVideos don't workAvoid like the plague, even though it has the Meridian 4 sticker.Not being sold anymore, that's a big plus!

												If you like games where the concept art takes precedent over gameply, this is the game for you.My favourite bit was when I started the game and realised I'd wasted good money on a game that looked quite fascinating but the developers had forgotten to actually make it fun to play.			"
