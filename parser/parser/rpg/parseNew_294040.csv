												Missing Content, the name of the game attracted me, i expected a game where you can collect items and not only money and 2 kinds of potions.Art is lovely but you have seen everything in 10 minutes, i have played 70 minutes and unlocked almost all archivements just missing one that wants me to grind to level 100(64 atm) compared to the price, you can get much more for that, plenty of game with lots of content in steam. You should avoid this game.And for the developers, i assume you want to make money, since steam offers refunds to games played less than 2 hours.  "

												Incredibly addicting at first. Head right, auto kill enemies, boost your stats, slay the dragon. It's by the second time you kill the dragon you realize what you bought. You stare at the screen as you power through for all achievements, running left and right through the same set of stages, one after another, until you're a literal mutated overlord that simply cannot be stopped, curb stomping the dragon and other monstrosities with your hammer sword into oblivion as you gauge the direction your life is headed in when you realize you sunk in three, maybe three and a half hours, you don't know cause Steam says nearly four but the phone rang a few times and your girlfriend shoved your cat in your face to awaken you from your salivating catatonic state of disbelief that you are sitting here just running right or maybe left and right to rack up some loot to turn yourself into a being perhaps stronger than god himself - nay, Odin himself! - who slays the abominations and mythical beasts all to save miners you IMMEDIATELY put to work in a slave labor strip mine to obtain more riches that, by the time you kill the dragon a second or third time, prove to be absolutely worthless, turning you into a sadistic sonofa♥♥♥♥♥ because you kept increasing your defense and speed ability to run around the screen like a five year child mid-sugar fuelled ADHD fit who refuses to let them go incase a future update requires that maximum of 99,999 currency despite there being no actual level cap beyond the final achievement of obtaining level 100 as you yourself rock back and forth to the rhythm of enemy destruction and jewel drops/acquisitions that will haunt your pathetic soul well past your own nightmares but rather deep into the grave!!!!!!!!!!!!!In short: Fun at first but 20 minutes in is boring. Not enough substance for continuous replays. Only for achievement hunters. Would not recommend outside that reason.			"

												This game has very nice art and music, but neither of those can save the game itself from being one of the dullest experiences I've ever had.Gameplay is thus: 1. Enter a level. 2. Hold right. Maybe go back and forth a bit to farm for money and XP.3. Repeat until monsters are too strong to easily pass.4. Buy upgrades (+atk damage, +crit chance, +def, +movement speed) at one of the multiple shops in each level(You can't do this on the level select screen). If you don't have enough money, go back to an earlier level and grind for it.5. Hold right some more. That's it. There is no end goal. Well, the first time you play, the goal is to kill the dragon at the last level, but you can do that in half an hour, max. After that, you just play through the same levels again at a higher difficulty, and beat the dragon again. Then you do it again. And again. And AGAIN.NOTHING changes, except the numbers.Every time you beat the dragon, the game tells you the difficulty has gone up and encourages you to keep playing. However, there's literally no reason to. Defeating the dragon is the only goal given to you, and you've already done that. You've seen the entirety of new content the game has to offer at this point. Why do the same thing over again? Here's a hint: There is no reason. Exit the game.What about the achievements? Well, the only ones you'll be missing after beating the game once will require you to do the same♥♥♥♥♥♥listed above over and over again for hours. It won't be worth it. Avoid this game unless you love being bored senseless and then patronized.			"

												At first the game seems enjoyable enough, with a nicely-done art style, but quickly it devolves into a rather boring achievement hunt. If there wasn't a Level 100 achievement, I would have stopped playing an hour ago.The nice art style doesn't even matter once your character's speed makes everything a blur, and later on even the loot shop loses it's novelty when all you need to upgrade is defense in order to progress.The miners are also pointless, since you can grind a max level of loot in less than a minute.Overall it isn't terrible, just you'll be completely done with the game before the trading cards even drop.

												Loot Hero DX is a Beat 'em up side-scroller game with gorgeous graphics, that can be described in just two words: walk and grind. You literally only walk from one side to the other in each level, that's all the gameplay you'll see, there are only 10 levels, which wouldn't be a problem, if they weren't all less than 30 seconds long each, and after beating the game for the first time you don't unlock harder levels, you just unlock the same levels with higher difficulty (more HP and more damage from the same mobs). There are only four basic upgrades, but you can use them unlimitedly, the same applies for the harder levels. You either are overpowered to pass a level or you go back to the previous level and repeat it until you're powerfull enough, so for 10 minutes of entertainment you can repeat those same 10 minutes for ever, but with higher numbers everywhere.★★☆☆☆ | Disliked it "

												Just finished this game with an easy 100%, but beware the game is very GRINDY. All you do is run left or right to grind up loot and xp points, but go right all the way and you kill the boss, and rescue a miner. The miners will mine for gold, while you are playing the game, and also while your not playing the game they will still mine for gold, so check when you log back in the game for your extra gold to spend.You can only acumulate $99999 gold max, so spend it up at the house's you pass, as you upgrade it costs more gold.There is only 6 levels maybe 8 I just grinded through and did not count them, then I Uninstalled the game when I finished.This game is not bad, but not great niether it needs a side way's thumb I think so Im rating it a yes anyway, because I enjoyed playing it, but it did make me very sleepy.If your having trouble sleeping this game could help, I sleeped well after playing this game. If your considering buying this game, I suggest wait for a good sale or bundle. The game is just to short and simple for the asking price, even with cards and achievements.What you see on the store page regarding this game is what you get, enjoy :)			"

												What an odd game! I'm really on the fence about whether or not to recommend it, so I've decided to recommend it but with a huge caveat.Firstly, this is the most mindless game I've ever played in my life, and I started playing video games in the 80s. Even mindless clickers involve the player more than this game does. There's literally nothing to do except for moving right and left and upgrading your stats. Combat and looting are automatic, and even your stats max out or become redundant at certain points, minimizing the value of upgrades. I found no obvious benefit to a speed in excess of 100, and while your critical stat allows you to keep dumping gold into upgrades, it goes no higher than 100%. I wasted a lot of loot before figuring that out. I also found no benefit to an excessive attack stat. There came a point where I just started dumping all my loot into defense, because that was the only stat that made any difference to me after the critical stat was maxed. This is not a game for someone who is looking for storyline or character development, because this game includes none of either. It's also not a game for someone looking for clear objectives or an endgame. At the time of this review, I've defeated the dragon 55 times, and the game hasn't finished. In fact, I don't think there is a finish line to this race. I've unlocked 100% of the achievements, and my stats at this point are: level 106; attk 180-359; crit 100; def 1376; and speed 126. I have no doubt that there is either no completion point to the game at all or that the ceiling is so ridiculously high as to call the sanity of anyone who would attempt it into question.The graphics could be a lot more clear and defined, especially since you're dealing with increased speeds, and the soundtrack is just average. There's not a single element that would motivate me to continue the game at this point, and I see zero replay value.That being said, the game does what it's meant to do very well. The controls are responsive, and no tutorial is necessary. It's an obvious choice for someone looking for an easy 100% game, but beyond that, there's not much else to say about this game. It offers no other challenge or benefit that I'm aware of. For me, it wasn't even entertaining. It was just something that I persevered through thinking that I was nearing the end.So my caveat is this. I recommend the game but only for casual gamers looking for a mindless game requiring absolutely no skill, or achievement hunters possessing a great deal of patience.			"

												1) Level up and beat the dragon (fun)2) Do the same thing nine more times to get 95% of the achievements (less fun)3) Do the same thing another 35 times to get the last achievement (not fun)Yes, I beat the same dragon 45 times to get a worthless achievement.  I spent a few hours on this and only enjoyed the first hour or so because I like to spend my life on boring fruitless activities.The sad thing is, this game could've been a lot more fun with just a little more to it.  Make it so you don't fight the same boss 45 times (yes, 45), make it less grindy in the later levels, add more equipment/stat options (Right now it's str/crit/def/spd and only def matters after a while), add mini-games, survival mode, anything to break up the monotony of doing the same thing 45 times.  Just so happens I paid $0.25 for this and I still wouldn't recommend it.  For achievement hunters though, if you're willing to brave the monotony it's not too hard to level up your speed, crank it up and go back and forth for a few hours.(Note: The entire 10 hours listed was not spent playing, active playtime was around 3-5 hours)			"

												When looking at the screenshots you could think 'Loot Hero DX' is a fun platform pixel game. The graphics look cute and characters and surroundings are pretty well made. It only takes a few minutes in the game to understand what this game is about and sadly, it's not that great. You've probably heard of the 'clicker' games in which the only thing you have to do is click with your mouse to score points. This game is pretty much like one of those clicker games, the only thing you have to do is either move left or right and kill enemies. No, you can not jump or fight yourself, the only thing you can do is walk left or right and you automatically kill enemies...... When killing enemies you gain experience points and money, which you can use to upgrade your character's speed, defence, criticals or attack. If you can not defeat an enemy, you will have to go kill the lower level enemies again or wait untill your health has replenished. There isn't really much more to tell about this game....The game is cheap and if you got the patience you can get all achievements easily. Anyone who is looking for a more serious and challenging game should look elsewhere.			"

												If you're thinking of buying this you should know that you would probably manage to squeeze half an hour play time out of it, the rest of the figure you see next to my tag is joyless grinding, required to get that last achievement.The game itself is pretty much about loot and that'swhat you get, lots of it; you will in fact get so much loot that any pleasure deriving from getting it is lostin the sheer numbers of trinkets you get from mobs.The game knows all this, and it will collect and sellall those drops for you, redirecting any earnings to your in-game account.  You will see that loot only briefly, but then you will be able to invest your cash in improving your character's stats.So, summing it up… click left, increase stats, next level.But hey, it's different, and I firmly believe we shouldencourage new ideas, even when they don't bring us a proper game, hence the Up vote.Lastly, in spite of the “retro look” and the fact that you won't probably notice, mobs and heroes are pretty well designed.  Another star, but goodness, if I am controllingthe game with a mouse, other controllers oughtn't be vibrating every time I impact a mob… one star off.			"

												TL;DR: A well-made but fairly pointless grinding game. Only recommended for achievement hunters so you at least get a trophy out of it.In a traditional RPG you usually start as a low-level character with little to no equipment and the only way to become more powerful is to complete quests kill monsters.Basically begin with a standard RPG. Take out quests and dialogues, reduce equipment to purchasable stats and reduce the combat to just damage-per-second and make it a side-scroller and you've got yourself Loot Hero. The gameplay consists of three parts: choosing a level, running left and right killing monsters and buying better stats at the towns in-between. There's also a short and pretty meaningless story: a terrible dragon has appeared and you, the hero, has to go and kill it to save the land.The first thing I noticed when I fired up the game was that there is no keyboard support whatsoever. The gameplay would be totally natural with keyboard, with the only keys being basically left and right (plus some extra keys for buying stuff at towns). I think this is a huge oversight from the developer, this being a PC game after all (even if you can play a version of it on the browser on various sites). After a minute I realized that mouse is functional: the guy runs towards the mouse cursor when click is held. This is fine but not as convenient as keyboard would have been.Finally I opted for a gamepad, which worked well. Furthermore it proved to be superior to the mouse: a bit more on the reason later. As the gameplay goes, the music and sounds are pretty good and running through and grinding monsters curiously feels quite satisfying. In addition to experience points and gold the monsters drop health and invulnerability potions, the latter of which makes you super fast and almost un-killable so you can easily grind through hordes of monsters with the music flowing consistently with the diamond tornado as the money gets sucked into your loot bag counter in the top-left corner.At first you have to play each level sequentially but after beating the first dragon you can skip any number of the subsequent levels to go even straight to the next dragon level. Usually you don't want to do that though, unless you have prepared: each level (called aptly Difficulty) is more difficult, i.e. contains stronger monsters than the previous one. It also provides a bit more experience (that is for levels) and gold (for buying better stats) than the previous one. There are different enemies to each level, but game mechanically they are identical, the only difference being visuals and their attack power and health.Thing is, it is so much more difficult to kill tougher monsters that you'll probably want to grind in a lower level until you can beat it consistently before going to the next one. Later on you can skip a few levels as you will develop an intuition of how powerful monsters you can kill easily. If you do a mistake, you are stuck in the level that is too difficult (well, at least I couldn't find a way to exit a level short of exiting the game). Then you can still grind, as diamonds drop even when hitting a monster once, so a boring left-right-left-right limbo can be issued right next to town for a slow but steady grind for better stats.You can heal (automatically) and buy stats at towns: there is attack and defence power, better critical strike chance and higher speed available for purchase. Critical strikes cap at 100% although for some reason you could still waste money on them afterwards. Speed seems to have a cap or I just wouldn't notice the slight change of pace after certain point. Then later on the only meaningful purchases were attack and defence power. Your stats get higher also when you level up the character.The speed upgrade caused some weird things when I got it at high values. I would run and then get stuck at some monsters (because I was not strong enough to kill them immediately), but the screen would continue onwards, leaving the hero and the monsters I was fighting out of the window. The monsters only spawn outside the screen, so then the hero would continuously fight monsters out of sight, usually dying eventually because if he could kill them, he'd pretty much run right through them and not be left behind. This is where I pulled the controller out: with mouse I can't retreat the other way because I can't get the cursor to the other side of the hero who is outside the screen. With gamepad I could at least do that.A minor bug occurred sometimes when the high speed also made me run straight past the boss monster, presumably because he was not spawned yet as the character ran past him.By the way, dying is of little consequence: you can immediately revive and continue grinding. You just lose a bit of experience and gold when that happens. It was not too much but enough to make me cautious.4.5 hours of grinding later I had 100% completed the game achievement-wise (I will still have to idle a bit for cards). I had defeated 38 dragons and thus saved 38 miners. The miners provide gold for you when you're idle, pretty pointless as there's a hard cap of 99999 gold. Frankly, the game was pretty boring. I get the parody of reducing the present-day RPGs to their bare bones of gold and experience grinding but the notion isn't worth a whole game. That said, it's mere 3 €: if you fancy getting a fairly easy 100%, it might be worth it at least when it's on sale. If you can manage, play it while watching a movie or similar. The rest of you: go play something better.			"

												Recommended for select gamers.This game is not for everyone, but if you like trying out experimental game concepts and ideas there is a gem here to be had.  If, however, you are looking for a fully fleshed out game with lots of immersion, choices, quests, story or depth then this game is probably one to pass by.Perhaps the king of casual gamers, there is some satisfaction in the mindless left, right, left action which results in the demise of hordes and hordes of baddies.  And . . . that's it, that's the whole game.  Move your mouse to the left of the screen your hero moves left, move it to the right and he moves right.  Stop on screen at a shop and you can tweek a few stats: attack, crit, armor and speed.  You play through ten levels each with a ""boss"" (more on that later) at the end, and after the tenth level is completed the difficulty slightly increases and you replay through all the same levels over again.  This continues on until you get bored and stop playing, or for many, until you reach level 100 and get the last Steam achievement.Why this works:  Mindless fun can be fun!  Plus you do get to plow through hordes and hordes of enemies in mere seconds.  And you can watch TV while you play and only glance back at the computer from time to time while grinding to that level 100.However, what doesn't really work is that there isn't any real game after that.  It really feels like a good first level for a much grander game, but it just stops there and then repeats itself.  Even with the ability to up skills I soon discovered that I really only had to up my armor skill to be able to beat any levels that momentarily detered me.  Also, bosses were pointless.  They aren't stronger than the other monsters in the level, at least not by enough of a margin to be noticable, so if you can sail through the level, the boss will be a one hit kill.  Plus there were a few balancing issues I came across; either I could sail through the level without a hitch including the boss, or I was beaten by the first three monsters I encounted.  There were no inbetween challenging levels.  I could either beat the level outright, or I repeatedly died and had to go out and replay the previous level until I had accrued enough gold to buy enough armor to sail through the next one.Then the main trouble I had while trying to level my hero up to 100 was that the levels never got any longer.  So, most levels are easy to beat in about 15 to 20 seconds, but you need to really grind the experience to level up your knight, meaning there were many times when I inadvertently finished a level instead of swinging back and forth to gain experience for my guy.  And finishing a level in only a matter of seconds means that the load times to go back to the main menu and then back into the levels seem much much longer than they actually are.  It would have been really helpful to lengthen the levels as they got ""harder"" then to just have them be exactly the same every time.I should mention that everytime you beat the 10th level boss you save a miner who then goes and mines gold for you, apparently even when you are not playing the game.  While this could have been a charming aspect of the game it actual was 100% pointless.  Most people will achieve 80% of the achievements in the first hour and then it becomes a grind fest for the last 2 leveling up achievements which really only take 2 or 3 more hours.  So, having a person mine gold while you don't have the game running isn't neccessary as you will probably play through the whole game in your first session.  Also, your gold maxes out at something like 999,999 or so which really only takes 40 to 60 seconds to accrue while playing in game, so the slow pecking away the miners do to get you 20,000 gold after 10 mins isn't even noticable, or needed.  Perhaps some other system of freeing different townsfolk to collect would have been a better end-of-level reward.All in all, I really did have fun playing this game, but its limitations means it really is for the experimental gamer.  If the previous description of the game did not deter you, then by all means I encourage you to purchase this game and try it out for yourself, because it really has a unique game design to it, but just know ahead of time that it isn't going to give you much more than that.

												Its not a bad game. But I feel like I wasted time on this game. without even having much fun.I completed the game with 100% achievments in about 2 hours.......yes, thats how short it is.Pros:+ the soundtrack is nice and fitting+ controls are fluent+ game runs without problems (its 2015......and I really have to adress that)+ its fun.....for 15min at least+ asking price is low+ your gear visually changes with progressCons:- it just wears out so quickly. You get to see everything the game offers in about 15min. After that it just repeats the same levels over and over.- there is no motivation  to progress in the game. Your gear gets better, but so do th monsters and everything stays on the same level with no gameplay variation.- monsters change in appearance but it doesnt matter, they are all the same- getting to level 100 was just a chore and no fun at all- the worst of all is, there are no rewards at all! If you complete the game there is nothing! No ending or a special mode, nothing!- the game has no replayablility at allIts not the worst and its cheap, but I would say do something else with your time. There are free flash games that are more fleshed out than Loot Hero. "

												9 Levels of Fun! First of all, let me say, I know it has more than 9 levels. The game play is you smashing your character into enemies and thereby killing them and getting loot. The loot you can then use to buy upgrades from stores which line the road endlessly like 7/11.  I recommend using a controller, if you're going to play.Graphics aren't horrible, it is meant to be simple, and it is, but still manages to look good doing it. Music, I don't remember, honestly. After level 30, I had turned down the volume and started watching Netflix, because the required NO attention anymore really. Gameplay is fun... at first... then monotonous... Seriously after a long time because I was achievement hunting, I kept nodding off and imaging my character could jump.... Sadly that is not the case.The game does just what it does, you kill enemies or be killed by them. If you want to achievement hunt, realize some of them will take quite some time. I didn't get to level 100 on my character till I was on difficulty 400 something?Overall: 4/10 - Amusing for about 20 mins. Even three dollars is too much... I respect that the game works correctly and functions as it should, but just boring after awhile. Go do something else.			"

												Half Minute Hero + Cookie ClickerSimple enough little game for a few bucks, maybe to simple, but hard to complain for the price you pay.Game plays just like Half Minute Hero, you move left or right, grind money to get stronger, keep going left and right, keep getting stronger, repeat until you get all the achievements. Fun for a few hours at least, you'll like this if you like 'clicker' type game and seeing numbers get bigger. It also has some catchy tunes.			"

												VaragtP is becoming a personal favourite of mine. Well, one of my personal favourites. Having played their newest game, Plantera and now this, I must say that this guy knows how to make satisfying pseudo-clickers.Loot Hero DX is definitely a fun experience to just 100% and then leave.The idea is that you're a lancer that's running through levels with some quick checkpoints. You buy upgrades and level up and in the end just get all of the achievements by progressing through the game.The game's not difficult and in reality, it's pretty damn simple. It's hard to really say more about it. It looks nice and the story is non-existant.This is a small experience. It's simple. But, that's what makes this so good. Overall7/10			"

That's it.As for graphics, the character sprites and backgrounds are well done.The soundtrack is catchy, but ultimately repetitive.I'd really liked to have seen a few more levels to reduce the amount of repetition in the content, and each level's music could have been a little longer to reduce how often it loops.

												The game is short, repetitive & pointless. I've got all the achievements in around 2 hours, of which at least an hour was only grinding for the last achievement.Tons of different upgrades? No no, 4 upgrades is not ""a ton"". One of those is actually cap'd, so you reach a point were you can't keep spending loot on it.A huge cast of enemies and bosses? Maybe, but to no point at all. The game goes at such speed that in less than 15 minutes you won't tell the difference of what enemy you're killing.No stats at all, whatsoever.I'm not an expert reviewing games, nor I do it often, but this game, looks fun, and it actually is, for around 10 mintes.Not satisfied with this game, at all.

If you want a mindless game with cute graphics and nice music to relax with, then this fits the bill, especially if you enjoy grinding levels in rpgs more than advancing the story or managing an inventory. The dev absolutely nailed the game they were trying to make, and it seems unfair to judge it for not being a different type of game.			"

												Review:Loot Hero DXA very short and simple game with a lot of replayability. You are a knight who kills monsters just by running to them (there is no attack button). To progress you have to upgrade your stats (damage, health, critical hits and speed) using the gold dropped by enemies. There are only 9 levels that can be infinitely completed in harder difficulties, and once the final boss is defeated you get 1 miner that produces gold in the meantime. It is extremely repetitive and grindy after a while, you won't play it more than 2 hours more or less.Gameplay:Genre: Arcade.Game Style: Adventure.Mode of View: Sidescroller.Theme: Fantasy.Game Modes:Singleplayer: Yes.Local multiplayer: No.Online multiplayer: No.New Game Plus: Yes.Level Selection: Yes.Sandbox: No.Roguelike: No.Features:Character Customization: No.Inventory Management: No.Collectables: No.Currency: Yes.Upgrades: Yes.Skill Tree: No.Safe Houses: No.Puzzles: No.Choices: No.Destructable Enviroment: No.Customizable Safehouses: No.Steam Functions:Leaderboards: No.Inventory Items: No.Achievements: Yes.Workshop: No.More Info:Aproximated total duration: 2 hours.Aproximated campaign duration: 20 minutes.Recommended age: +3 years.Controller support: Full.Pros: Its action is quick and simple.

												Loot Hero DX is one of a pair of games released by VaragtP that were previously available on smart phone and tablet and have been upgraded for the PC market, now credit where credit is due these games while basic are better than their original counter parts but remain seated in the casual games category with minimum depth. Arguably this doesn't automatically make them poor games and Loot Hero DX certainly has wonderful sprite work and music but overall there is a sense of lost opportunity as its gameplay resembles a clicker game more than the casual action RPG it claims to be.  


YouTube™ Video: Loot Hero DX Review AND walkthrough by Doominabottle 

			Views: 48		

			► Like and Subscribe! My gaming mate Doominabottle has made his very first video ever in which he looks into Loot Hero DX, reviews it and completely plays through the thing, making this a combined...		

For those who can't view the video the basic summary is this:You begin as a knight who moves very slowly and all the game play amounts to is walking left or right bumping into enemies until either you or enemies die. When enemies are defeated they drop gold which can be spent on upgrades to Attack, Defence, Critical hit Chance or Speed however only attack or defence are of any use, you also gain experience points which will eventually level your character which gives pitiful bonuses to these stats in comparison to the bought upgrades.The enemies do nothing to stop your progress other than act as a blockade and you can stand next to them without fear of been attacked or been pushed back, they also almost immediately respawn once you pass an area so you can grind back and forth through the same line without having to progress in the level.While there is minor story elements at the beginning the ending is little more that ""A winner is you"" before shunting you back to the menu and increasing the level of all the monsters and levels.You do gain a single miner each time who earns you gold while your not playing but because of the small gold cap you soon can earn the maximum amount of gold in seconds at the higher levels.As I say repeatedly during the review I love the artwork and this could of been made into a nifty little rogue light or platform RPG but if you need something to kill ten minutes Loot Hero DX is ideal but its not much use for anything else.

												I could almost go either way on this one. There's a lot of polish on what's here...but in the end, there just isn't enough here.Pros:Hard to describe, but it has a very satisfying feel when playing with a controller. The rumble, the sounds, it all clicks together. This feels very polished.I enjoyed the music, especially the Bamboo level.Straightforward, pick up and play, and feel like you're making progress constantlyCons:There are 9 levels that repeat over and over and over, in order.Once you figure out the strategy, there really aren't any more decisions to be made. Hold right, except for when you don't, then hold right some more.The load screen when going back the level select screen seems completely and infuriatingly fake, given that every level loads literally immediately when selected. It seems like small potatoes, until you upgrade your speed to the point that the actual ""gameplay"" for each level takes less time than the ""you did it!"" screen plus the load screen.Idle reward maxes out at 99999, and you can't leave the idle reward screen without claiming the reward. If you already have any money, then you effectively lose whatever you had when you claim the idle reward, which really helps defeat the entire point of the idle reward.I started out very optimistic, but ultimately the repetativeness and being forced to sit through the ""you did it"" and loading screens 75 times did me in.If this game looks interesting to you, I would encourage you to pick it up on a significant sale, with the warning that there is probably one hour or less of gameplay, all of which is extremely repetative.Note: I've seen this game promoted as an idle / incremental game, which is why I bought it. I could understand it being labeled incremental, but the idle mechanic is weak and flawed and does not make any significant contribution to gameplay.			"

I did get my money back with the cards, but along the way I had loads of fun! This game is a beautiful piece of art. I decided writing this review after getting all the achievements in a non-consecutive 4 hours, to get the full feel of this game.This game is unlike anything I have ever played before and it breaks my heart that there isnt a sequel or anything similar. Holding RMB to go right and LMB to go left? Upgrading character stats as you progress? Immersive Boss fights and unique monsters along the way? I dont know a single game that has any of these mechanics! Story-wise i thought it was breathtaking and inspiring. I dont know the last game I played that had a story so enthralling than this.I recomend this game, this masterpiece to anyone and everyone 11/10			"

Zero replay ability unless you are into repetitive things that give no rewards. There are 5 trading cards for this game.

												Note : I was provided a Steam key for this game by the developer. Loot Hero DX is described as a RPG grind-fest, and grind-fest it is. You assume the role of a hero who must stop an evil and legendary dragon by travelling to different corners of the world, and beating various enemies and bosses to collect loot and level up. Run to the right, kill, stop when you approach the boss, turn left, kill, and rinse, wash and repeat. There's a handful of achievements to earn, and can prove to be a viable time-killer. Loot Hero DX is extremely casual in terms of its action. This game isn’t for everyone, but if you’re looking for some casual, mindless fun, this game is right up your alley. Rating : 6/10

There's no action portion to the RPG, and the RPG is barely there. There's no talent system, and you just hold down a mouse button adn it does all the work for you.However, it breaks my heart to have to leave a negative review. It's clear someone put a lot of time into this game - the pixel art is quite pretty, and the music is pretty and well thought out.I really hope to see the devs update this game, it really does have a lot of potential.

												I bought this game back in an Indie Gala bundle and honestly, this remained the only game I got from Desura and kept playing on a regular basis.In the game you take on the role of a knight which has to kill enemies to level up as well as collect XP and gold to upgrade equipment. Now this game as a fairly simple gameplay as the only thing you'll have to do is to run from left to right (Or right to left as well if you are farming XP and gold) with an occasional stop at the store to upgrade your stuff. But let me tell you this: This game is addicting as hell. The game is split into multiple stages with different enemies and bosses, thus enough variety is being offered. After beating the game, you'll automatically restart in a New Game+-kind of mode. In the DX version, gold miners were added which you can save. They will farm gold for you, even if you don't have the game running. 10/10, definite recommendation.			"

												This game is basically Clicker Heroes without the clicking. It also manages to be even simpler, with absolutely no strategy whatsoever. Usually, the grinding in those games quickly becomes very addictive, and you're stuck in an endless loop where you're restarting from level 1 but much more powerful, letting you reach a few levels higher before you have to start over again.Here, the grinding never pays off. You never feel stronger since you're forced to run the exact same 8-9 levels (that can be cleared in less than 10 seconds each, no joke), and the enemies also level up at around the same pace as you do. You only have a single character so it gets old fast, and you have absolutely nothing to do except pushing forward and increasing your stats whenever possible. There's no way to try a glass canon build or a tanking build, you have to level up everything all at once, and clearing the game's 20 achievements will take you less than 2 hours.Even as a free mobile game, I wouldn't recommend this. Everything you do past the first 2-3 minutes is completely pointless, and that's coming from someone who has spent 100+ hours in Clicker Heroes.Sure, the game has ""Possibly infinite gameplay"", but it's about as fun as holding the space bar in a Word document and creating an infinite number of pages...

												I really want to like this game: it has really neat pixel graphics, lots of critters to kill, keeps stats, and has achievements and trading cards. But, the reality is that the gameplay gets boring after the first three minutes. Even the added concept of releasing miners to collect gold for you after every successful run through all levels fails, because it's just accelerating a timer event...it doesn't add to the gameplay at all. In the end, all you do is collect enough treasure and XP to buff your character, who kills the baddies by -- literally -- running into them. There is no learning tactics for combat or developing strategies by buffing your character a specific way. You just level up your stats evenly as you collect loot, enough that you don't watch your health bar go down much at all while you're running back and forth, grind away until you start taking damage as you continue through the levels, and then rinse and repeat. Gameplay does not change on any levels, nor do you treat any of the creatures differently...you just run through them.I did play long enough to get 100% achievements (and collect all trading cards), which is easy except for the final one of leveling up to level 100. That's a long grind, but I basically did it while in boring, listen-in virtual meetings for work since the game requires little to no brain power and I had almost zero chance of being distracted enough to get into trouble.  :DTLDR; this game is a left-mouse-button simulator, and it succeeds in that regard. Where it does not succeed is in being interesting or, consequently, fun. Only bother if you're an achievement hunter looking for an easy 100% or a hardcore card collector, and even in that case you should look to get it as part of a bundle or epic sale.			"

												Oh boy. Where do I start with this little gem? Guess I could do a simple pros and cons list.Pros:Good for about 5-10 minutes. Then you beat the game and get to start from the beginning all over again. With the same enemies, music, backdrops, etc. The only thing that changes is the enemies' damage and health.Has fairly nice art style, although gets a bit tiring after a while seeing pixelly blurs zoom past your screen once you've upgraded your speed high enough.Runs quite smoothly. (I'm looking at you, Batman: Arkham Knight.)Not incredibly buggy.Cons:Incredibly short.Incredibly repetitive.No challengePrices of upgrades doesn't go above 9999 ""loot"" (currency of the game)You can't have any more than 99, 999 ""loot"" at any one time. The number simply doesn't go any higher.You can continue upgrading your critical hit chance past 100. Well, when I say upgrading, I really meaning pumping another 9, 999 ""loot"" into the button, only for nothing to change.When you're ramming through a bunch of enemies, the enemies you just killed may spawn directly behind you when you ram into the enemy in front of you. When this happens, you can slam into the enemy behind you, which deals damage to you which could kill you. This only happens when you are running from right to left.Not really much of a story to speak of. You're a hero. Go kill these things by charging at them.Essentially a ""one-button game"".Eventually, once you've beaten the dragon and gone through the difficulties several times, all you have to upgrade is your defense to continue progressing.Despite all of the cons, I do feel as if I enjoyed it for a short while. Yet I can't quite get rid of the feeling that even with a small discount and a fairly small asking price, this game still wasn't worth the $2.70 I paid for it. I also feel as though, with the amount of work that seems to be put into the large amount of sprites for the game (which seem to be quite well done), the game could have been quite a bit larger and better than how it felt. Although, keeping in mind that this is essentially a phone game, I would still like for them to have added more content for the PC version.			"

												I admit, this game doesn't have much replay value at all (even with the 100 level achievement to snag).  It is fun in short spurts and can be used as a decent, mindless way to get out some frustration after a long day.  The music is wonderful and the art style is rather nice to look at as well.  As others have mentioned the miners, while a nice touch, are mostly pointless since the amount of gold they give you can easily be picked up with a single run through a level.  The game says that they continue to earn gold even while you are away, but if you've done much of what you need to on the first playthrough (like I did), the gold they bring won't benefit you much at all.  Keep in mind that it took me about 3.5 hours to run the game dry.  If the developer adds more later on, I would re-visit it (and might here and there for a quick run through of a level... with speed boosts, it can take as little as 6 seconds to complete a level for me now).Worth noting is that the DX version on Steam does add a few new levels, enemies in those levels and the concept of the miners to rescue after killing each dragon.  It's a small upgrade from previous versions found on Desura, but it is nice to see that they are adding a bit of extra content.While I do reccmmend it, it's a borderline pass.  It's certainly cheap enough and can sometimes be found in a bundle, so keep your eyes open for that, but for the current price of 2.99, it's hard to say that you're getting an amazing value for your money.

												Whether intentionally or not, Loot Hero DX manages to parody modern casual mobile gaming trends way too well. On the surface, the game has a decent art-style, variety of level themes each containing unique enemies and nice sound design, however, there's absolutely no actual content or challenge worth mentioning. The levels and controls are designed in a way where the player is either idling for regenerative health, traversing back and forth to grind for points or exiting the level by heading all the way to the right. After the first cycle of all the levels, it's a matter of grinding through the remaining achievements or trading cards.In conclusion, the game is an absolutely mindless joke not providing enough mechanics to justify its price tag. It does serve as a distraction though.			"

												Quick, fun and addictive.It feels like playing a clicker game without the constant need to click, here you just rush ahead (or back and forth if you want to grind), picking up gold, gaining exp and upgrading your stats to keep rushing ahead faster and faster.Great time waster.			"

												This game is quite repetative. There is no actual loot from monsters, you buy all your upgrades from the same shop over and over again. Challenge is non existant unless you consider endless grinding to be a challenge. I would save your money. This could have easily been a browser game.One minute review:

I never thought I'd blatantly cheat in a singleplayer game...This isn't worth your money, I got this in a bundle from Indiegala and I'm glad. The game looks pretty neat, that's why I even redeemed the load of bison spooge. The graphics are very fine tuned for a ""lol so retro"" game, the scanlines and shader are a nice touch and give depth to the graphics... that's all this game has going for it.The gameplay is holding the mouse button and sitting at your computer like the loser you are. You upgrade your stats, then grind more levels and coins so you can upgrade your stats just a little more. The latter is done for the next seven hours until you realize how much of your life you've wasted where you will proceed to waste more on TF2.I recommend just opening the save file in %AppData% and editing your stats for the achievements. Then idling for any trading cards, and putting the game in your trash folder in your library.			"

												It's a console clicker, that means you have to tilt the joystick sidewards back and forth to grind your points instead of clicking (you can play with mouse inclining the cursor to the sides but this doesn't feel so satisfactorily). The grubby pixellated graphics still look pretty charming if you have time to observe, I mean if you boost the speed parameter the character will move extremely fast, so you really won't see what's going on in detail. I praise the artist here, he's a funny guy! Especially I loved the hero's running animation (he's pretending he rides a horse) and his lance's erectile disfunction when you stop. You ask what's the point? I say the same as MMO's, except for the schoolchildren all over you! Sadly there's no story of adventure, so you'll have to fantasize your own.8/10 phallic lancers at full gallop!Сие есть приставочная щелкалка, в том смысле, что необходимо наклонять палочку веселья из стороны в сторону, дабы заработать очки, вместо того, чтобы щелкать (можно играть мышью, водя курсором в стороны, но это не приносит такого удовольствия). Грубая точечная рисовка все же выглядит весьма очаровательно, если найдете время ей любоваться, в смысле, если прокачать скорость, герой будет двигаться настолько быстро, что нельзя будет различить происходящее в деталях. Хвалю художника, забавный парень! Особенно мне понравилась анимация бега персонажа (притворяется, что скачет на лошади) и эректильная дисфункция его пики, когда вы останавливаетесь. Спросите, в чем смысл? Отвечу, та же, что в ММО, тольо без школяров повсюду! К сожалению истории с приключениями не завезли, поэтому придется придумать самому.8/10 фаллических рыцарей во весь опор!

												Loot Hero DX is a hard game to review.Occupying a niche alongside so-called ""clicker"" games, there isn't any gameplay to speak of. You merely hold right and your tiny knight dashes at incredible speeds into the enemy army. Monsters explode like obedient loot pinatas and then you spend some gold giving your knight incremental upgrades (hint: defense beats all).That's the complete summation of the game. The problem is that the developer(s) obviously put a lot of effort into the visuals and the engine. It's incredibly smooth despite the crazy speeds our metal covered hero sprints around at and the sprite work makes has a consistent and very pleasing look. Even the backgrounds have some serious polish.I'm recommending this game only for those who like ""clicker"" games and to support and encourage the developer to do more with this games art assets. Please spin this into maybe a side-scrolling RPG or something.			"

												OVERVIEWKill baddies with a few clicks of your mouse...And a lot of just holding down the LMB. :D That's Loot Hero DX in a nutshell. You can play it for free, or play this slightly updated version for a few bucks. Is it worth it? Let's see.PROS+ Decent graphics.+ Good music and sound.+ Cheap (as it should be).+ Trading cards.+ Difficulty is scaled reasonably well.+ Relatively amusing, and great for when you don't feel like putting any effort into a game.+ Miner system is nice.CONS- Too repetitive. A little design finesse could have helped a lot here - adding a bit more story, some randomness, etc. - The FPS rate drops pretty badly later in the game. It's also a bit slow loading in general.- You have to go to the main menu to exit the game.- Slightly glitchy; e.g., sometimes when you go to exit, you'll click, and ""Yes"", ""No"" will be left floating over the main menu, and it didn't really exit. It's also had issues where it didn't update the run speed properly. Also, muting the sound still allows this weird clicking noise to occur occasionally, just like normal; plus, the noise when you get knocked out remains present. Code is sometimes present at the end on screen when you beat the last boss.- You can't upgrade critical past 100%, but it will still take your money.- It would be nice if you could have it where it just goes from level-to-level instead of having to leave the level and selecting a new one. An infinite mode would also be a nice touch, where it just runs level-to-level in a seamless fashion - one big level that repeats over and over. It would make grinding for level 100 easier.- Your hero seems to get stuck sometimes; like he slams into the same enemy over and over, and you can't see him on the screen.- There shouldn't be a gold cap.- You should be able to mute sound without adjusting the levels.CONCLUSIONIt's cheap, decent, mindless fun, you get trading cards, and you're supporting an indie developer. It will give a few hours of fun over a period of time of your choosing, and seems like something that would be fun to come back to every now and then for some easy-as-heck victory. To me, that's worth it - and if you can get it on sale, even more so.Thanks for reading my review; I hope it was helpful. Have a great day, and Godspeed!			"

												This game is a different sort of clicker game, instead of spamming you need to hold down. Also, more strategy is required as upgrades are very important as the right upgrades would make it easier for you to progress. The design of the enemies and levels are decent and unique. There is nothing else to say but the fact that it's your choice if you want to spend your money on this sort of game and I had fun playing it.Here is some gameplay from my YouTube channel:

												TL;DR, stay away from this game unless you like mindless grinding gamesI noticed myself reaching a state where I was blankly staring at the screen while playing this game just running back and forth collecting loot. This game's gameplay loop consists of holding either left or right, interrupted every once in awhile by pressing another button to level up..... and that's it. However, if you REALLY like grinding, and I mean, REALLY REALLY like grinding, and you can't afford to play an MMO or something, then MAYBE this game is for you.			"

												Here's a game who's entire mechanic is moving right with your weapon and running through an assorted collection of monsters. When you aren't able to run through them without getting clobbered, stop at a store, upgrade your gear and start going right some more.   Really, all you do is run to the right and bump your stats at the store.  However...This is like an action variation on the clicker games that the kids like so much. I found it intoxicating and was a bit uncomfortable as it TOOK OVER MY ENTIRE BEING. Did the numbers keep going up? Absolutely. Was the pixel art astoundingly beautiful? Breathtaking! Was the music loop intoxicating? Yes. Did I 100% it? Of course. Was it spectacularly fun? You bet. Highly recommended for unknown and unexplainable reasons.			"

												Like other ""incremental games"", this seeks to allow you to pour hours of your time grinding away levels to upgrade your character in order to defeat endless waves of enemies and bosses with no end in sight. How it actually falls short of this goal in such a simple genre is incredible, really.As some reviews here have said, the game is simply too easy. You hit the end goal far too quickly, and your goal then becomes a mission to collect all of the achievements. I was able to collect all of the achievements the game had to offer in a few hours time... making continuous play pointless, but that's not entirely why.I don't think the game developers actually expect people to play this game for longer than an hour. You VERY QUICKLY hit a point in the game where your levels no longer go up visually, as though they didn't think a counter that works was necessary. Like saying ""Nobody is going to max this skill, so who cares?"", but you should care... because you can max the skill in under 30 minutes.The levels don't have enough variety either. I mean you can't expect much from these incremental games as it is, but when you start reading ""you've defeated the dragon 42 times"", being the end-boss, it's really depressing.There also comes a point where you gain so much coin from each level run, that you can honestly beat the final boss, load the next difficulty tier, and then jump straight to the end boss and kill it again... and again... The more you play, the easier it gets, which is typically the opposite of what these games are supposed to be about. You gain exponentially more coin which means you can upgrade exponentially faster. There is a COIN MAX of 99,999 and each upgrade costs 9,999 and will never cost more, no matter how much you've upgraded them. Again, they don't expect that you're going to play this game very long, so why increment higher than 9,999?? Yeah.... When you can gain 9,999 coins from hitting a mere few enemies, it's not hard to upgrade yourself beyond the capacity of the game.While the game is too easy and runs out of runway too early, there are also certain things that annoy me after the 40th time too. Once I've beaten the dragon boss 40 times, you can stop SLOWLY giving me the message about the increase in difficulty and you can stop SLOWLY showing me that I've unlocked another miner, and you can stop showing me that same loading screen to take me to the levels because I'm just trying to get through it so I can jump to the final boss again and beat him in 5 seconds flat.The miners... I reminded myself of these useless things. In the early game, once you beat it you unlock a coin miner which can, quite obviously, mine coins for you while you're away. The more you unlock, the more coins you unlock. Remember the coin issues I talked about earlier though... when you're making the max 99,999 coins within a few minutes, what exactly is the point of having several dozen miners also generating a max 99,999 coins for you?? Yay I can do about 20 upgrades to my defence and get through the end boss 5 more times for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON!And this is my last point: With other incremental games, they're difficult enough that you feel like if you sit there grinding, ultimately you'll reach an end result that is awe inspiring. You can unlock heroes to help your DPS, you can ""prestige"" your character to reset all levels and grind from scratch, unlocking skills as rewards for hours of play, but with this game there's no point! You hit the end within the first half hour, and you can reach the point of no more level gain within the first hour, and you can collect every single achievement (the hardest being level 100) within a few hours of play leaving there absolutely zero reason to keep going. You're as strong as you ever need to be, and you can safely uninstall the game never to look back.Of course it's a pretty cheap game on Steam, but this should seriously be a free app.... It's not worth the sale price and CERTAINLY not worth a full pricing.			"

												Simple farming game. To progress, you have to kill your enemies by moving from the left side of the map to the right side (and then back, and again, again, again...) by bashing them with your lance. For every kill you earn money, which you can put into simple upgrades: Attackpower, chance for critical hits, defence power, and speed of your knight. There are different maps and bosses, but all in all it takes you only around three hours to complete the game and earn every achievement. The soundtrack is great and makes the grinding sufferable. As mentioned before, the principe of this game is more than simple, and all you have to do is grind, grind, grind, and grind. You will be happy when you have finished Loot Hero DX. Only buy it if you're interested in a fast 100% game, and only buy it on sale.			"

												Gameplay wise there's not much to this ""game""...you hold right to move and slay monsters. You basically just hold right each level until you beat the game while occasionally pressing a button to buy an upgrade.Game legnth is about 10minutes (or less), and each time you beat the game the difficulty increases but that's about the only change.Graphically speaking it looks great, and music goes along nicely. The bosses and monsters are all unique and creative.IMO, it's a fun parody game, and you will likely get a good laugh at how insanely fast paced it is and how quickly you speedrun through each level without breaking a sweat. Is it worth the price? Ehhhh...... No.... but if you can get it for less than a $1 you won't be dissapointed.			"

												Consumer criticism first, then game review:Ahhhh, if there's any game on Steam that indicates how little research people do on their purchases, then it's Loot Hero.You can play it for free on flash games website.There you basically have your ""demo"".You feel misguided by the name of the game?You feel it's lacking content?You feel if's not worth the money?Why didn't you testdrive it then before you threw your money at the screen?---Game review:Loot Hero is your standard generic MMORPG / RPG endcontent grindfest in a nutshell.""Just 200 boars more then my hunting rank is 9001!""Just 20 more raids and i will get my purple armor!""""Doing this dungeon run 3 more times and i will have the armor set complete!""You know, it's always about grinding, always about numbers, always about loot.Loot Hero offers you exactly that, without downtimes, without emptying your inventory,without lengthy boss fights, without having to deal with kill stealers, just pure grind.You like MMORPGs, don't read the quest stories anyways and just love slaughteringhordes of mobs to see your level increase and loot flying all over the place?Then get Loot Hero ;)			"

												...Eh... erm... nah.I've played more than my share of ""idle"" and/or single-mechanic games.  Clicker Heroes, AdVenture Capatalist, Cookie Clicker, Tap Heroes, Anti Idle...  just to name a few.  Loot Hero DX is of the same lineage.The basics are easy to grasp.  Hold right to smash into enemies, grab the money that falls out, upgrade any of four stats at the regularly spaced checkpoints positioned throughout the level, and get strong enough to take out the boss at the end....And that's it.  Either you've got the power and defense to beat your foes...  or you don't, which means you hold left to beat up more dudes.  Passing each checkpoint refills your health automatically, so if you're capable of beating the monsters in a stage you simply walk back and forth to grind some cash for more upgrades.  It's worth mentioning that it's very easy to earn all the achievements, albeit a couple of them are just time sinks and rather grindy.  I don't mind simple mechanics, but this game is really brainless.  ...REALLY brainless.  Yes, I've paid plenty more for games that I spent less time with.  That said, can I recommend it to people?  ...Eh... erm... nah.			"

												(03/10) - Just BadWell... the game offers about 10-15 minutes of real gameplay until the repitition starts. It is extremely short, and i don´t mean until you beat, i mean until you 100% it.It merely took me 116 minutes of mindless grinding to reach that. If you think that´s worth your money, go ahead.Here is what i remember of the game:Pushing the analog stick to the left, pushing the analog stick to the right.Pushing the analog stick to the left, pushing the analog stick to the right....But hey, at least it has rumble...

												*Full Playthrough -- 100% Achievments*It's a shame how some people are treating this poor little game -- because in actuality and for what it is, it's really quite good!Now I have already beaten the iPad version several times and overall I have played it a metric butt-tonne in total.  But the graphics, music and overall feeling of power had me excited to come back to it again on PC.This is indeed the difinitive version of the game.  The iPad version had less levels and features (At least when I played it last.) and eventually with a fully powered up character it also suffered some bad framerate issues.  However, there is none of that in this STEAM version and it runs perfectly well and smooth.What you see in the trailer is literally what you get.  You traverse maps unendingly slaying monsters and endlessly leveling up.  That feeling alone is intense and satisfying and of course watching the stats going up and the feeling of forever getting stronger is quite fun.Yes the game is very basic.  It is esentially one large leveling treadmill, but, depending on who you are, you might really enjoy it.  I can tell you for sure that 100%-ing it will take you around 2.5 hours and after that the game does indeed go on for all intents and purposes -- infinitely.  So you can revisit it again and again and eventually you will become so strong that you cannot even see what is happening on the screen any longer.  Your little dude is basically his own Intercontinental Ballistic Missile at that point, and it is hilarious to watch.So if you like leveling up for leveling up's sake, buy it.  If not, don't.  Simple math really.It definitely is a shame that people are reviewing this mini-gem negatively and talking about refunds, because really, it's just a great little game that will take you no more than 2.5 hours to finish and that you may come back to and play again one day.  IT'S 2 DOLLARS PEOPLE!  Many shames-on-you if you're even THINKING about refunding it.  We are essentially talking about a bottle of pop here.  And really you're cheating the poor developer because their game costs next to nothing and can be beaten within the time limit that STEAM still allows for refunds.  Which is a pretty disturbing loophole as far as this game is concerned and if you end up abusing it -- that's pretty sick and rather low in perfect honesty.Oh well.  I'll be KEEPING my copy because I actually LOVE THIS GAME!			"

FULL DISCLOSUREI paid nothing for this game. I won it on steamgifts. Loot Hero DX is for all intents and proposes game of the “clicker” genre. (Minus the clicking) and despite its title there isn't any actual loot. Not in the traditional sense. The only loot is money. There is no gear or new weapons to compare and contrast which from my understanding is one the more apparent draws of the “loot driven game”. You can “beat” this game in about 20 minutes. Meaning kill the dragon in the last level. But the draw I suppose is that there is this old saying the kids are saying“this is where the real Loot Hero DX begins”. Each time you kill the dragon you save a little charmander looking thing and he starts work in the mines getting more and more gold. Even when the game is off. Money of course is the main resource in the game. Allowing you to upgrade attack, chance of crit, defense and speed. So, as you are slaying beasts by pressing left or right but mostly right; you go real fast and then you go even faster. There is no actual attack button, you just bump into monsters and some dice are rolled usually the monster loses and this repeats forever until you make it stop. If you do happen to die you are just sent back the shop when you can upgrade (which are about every couple of inches on every stage) The only penalty for dying is losing a very small amount of XP and a bit of loot that hasn't been picked up yet. Its all magnetically attracted to you so no need to slow down. I got to about level 73, one achievement left. Which was get to level 100. Why did I play it this long so begin with you might ask? Because I'm insane, a self flagellating masochist or possibly just bored. I started listening to a podcast after awhile. The reason I stopped was I accidentally pushed the game into windowed mode where it soft locked and I was unable to get it to launch properly without black screening. I'd also like to mention the music which I actually did rather enjoy quite a bit. It's surprisingly epic, it sort of makes you feel like you're fighting some sort of great evil; and the journey is long and harrowing but worth it. (of course is isn't though. I had already beaten the dragon 18 times before I decided to stop.) THE GISTAll in all, this is a small very wasteful package of time and money.Follow my curation for more "

												No. Seriously there isn't anything I can point about this game that's good... Except the dragon.Bias things aside, once you complete the level, you pretty much go back and do it over again. I was going to say it's nice for achievement hunters that want to get another complete game on their profile, but honestly once you figure out that the exp rate will slow the game's progression to level 100, you'll happily just be cheating for it... At least so you can spare the hours it would take just to hold the direction stick right forever. If it ended sooner, I would have maybe reconsidered it and say ""get it on sale"", but honestly this feels as daunting as any clicker game and those games are free (so really I can take that).Also cards aren't worth much.Also loading time for the level selection gets annoying. I don't even understand why you have a loading screen coming from the mine to the level selection, but not vise versa??əɯɐƃ sıɥʇ ʞɔnɟ			"

												Loot Hero DX is essentially a nice looking graphic + gameplay cookie clicker/clicker hero attempt. However it is extremely basic and will only last you a couple hours. I feel like the developer needs to add more content, as when you pass a certain point, it just becomes an endless grind for no reason other than 100%'ing it.For the price it's okay, could be a lot better. More content past level 50 would benefit the longevity.If you like clickers, you'll enjoy the grind for 1-3 hours before the fun dies off.			"

												Loot Hero DX is a side-scrolling action game that is all about grinding xp and coins. It's quite addicting and I find it very original and simple to play, It's a great casual game that anybody can play and enjoy within 30 seconds of opening the game.The game has got a different soundtrack for each of the 9 stage types and the retro graphics are enjoyable. The game plays smoothly and it's very fast paced.As you play you unlock a mine and whenever you kill the boss final level, you get a miner that gets you more gold overtime and you restart the game with greater difficulty and more loot! Of course, you also get the gold if you are offline, so the more you have progressed into the game, the more gold you get when you come back.You can level up your attack, critical, defence and speed with gold and it seems like you can level up your hero very far.The game is great overall, but after about an hour of playtime, it will get repetitive to most people. Then again, even if the game is short, it's well-made and the price tag of the game is extremely low, literally anybody that wants to try it out should purchase it! If you are into small indie games, I think you will like it. It's refreshing and it's fun to play.If you want to get 100% achievements done, you will get a few more hours of playtime out of the game.			"

Its all magnetically attracted to you so no need to slow down. I got to about level 73, one achievement left. Which was get to level 100. Why did I play it this long so begin with you might ask? Because I'm insane, a self flagellating masochist or possibly just bored. I started listening to a podcast after awhile. The reason I stopped was I accidentally pushed the game into windowed mode where it soft locked and I was unable to get it to launch properly without black screening. I'd also like to mention the music which I actually did rather enjoy quite a bit. It's surprisingly epic, it sort of makes you feel like you're fighting some sort of great evil; and the journey is long and harrowing but worth it. (of course is isn't though. I had already beaten the dragon 18 times before I decided to stop.) THE GISTAll in all, this is a small very wasteful package of time and money.Follow my curation for more "

IntroductionLoot Hero DX was orginally for android devices, with the way it plays the game is obviously ported over from mobile almost straight to Steam and then sold at a price after they add some other features to the game in the Steam version. This game is very grindy, so if you don't like games where it requires you to grind for money and exp then you're not going to like this game.GameplayFirst thing I think that most people will want to know after reading the introduction of this review is what's the difference between Loot Hero DX on Steam, and the free to play version called Loot Hero. According to the developer, the main purpose of putting it on steam and putting a price on it is the graphical side of the game, full screen 60 fps (the android version consists of small window with 30fps) better effects and a ""facelift."" I'm not really sure what the developer meant by a ""facelift"" but they have added a few more levels and a miner thing whereby you save a miner everytime you kill a dragon and they will collect gold for you over time. Now that's out of the way, I will briefly explain the way that this game is played. Basically there has been a dragon that has taken over the lands and you, the hero, have to kill it. You will be required to go through a few levels before getting to the dragon, whilst upgrading 4 main things a hero needs. Attack, Critical, Defense and Speed. After killing the dragon once, takes maybe 30 minutes or so you now have to do it again, but on a harder difficulty. This is basically the whole game. What are my thoughts? The game to begin with was fun, collecting exp, leveling up, upgrading my items over time and just generally running into enemies by killing them. After beating the dragon the first time, it did really restrict the replay value of the game a bit. But, I pushed on to defeat the dragon once again. 3 hours passed, I had totally lost interest in this game. It becomes a drag of constant leveling up and upgrading your items until you can kill the dragon over and over again. The game has some really great music when you are killing enmeies, and the slightly destructable enviroment was rather nice. But as you played more, and came back to the same levels they got boring, and I just felt no need to play through the game anymore.Pros+ Fun at first to play+ Nice music+ Killing enemies sometimes destorys enviroment+ Trading cards & AchievementsCons- Limited replay value- Constantly going through the same levels gets boring rather quicklyResult / Final thoughtsAlthough I have stopped playing the game because of it's limited replay value and repetitive gameplay, I still recommened this game. The reason for that is because the game is rather cheap, and the first few times playing the game I really enjoyed it. But now I won't be able to enjoy it because of the constant grind and repetitive gameplay.Rating: 7.5/10For more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.

												Too short and you just hold right and occasionallyy walk left for a second. It's really fun at first, but once you have leveled up speed everything just blurs together and gives me a headache. At that poin't the levels last like 3 seconds and it takes longer to go to the menu and select a level than it does to beat the level.			"

												A 'clicker' game done right: you actually get to do something and apply some light strategy to progression.Too bad that a game geared toward the speedy completion of later levels makes you wait at least 10 seconds between each levels... At some point you spend more time loading and selecting in the menus than actually 'playing' the game. Other than that, it gets my seal of approval. For what it's worth.			"

												if you feel like you have played this game already then you are most likely right about that since this is the steam version of a free to play flash game over at kongregate.as far as i can tell the steam version doesn't have anything over the free version except for the trading cards and achievements of course.so there is no real reason at all to actually buy this. on the other hand spending 3 bucks on this game won't turn you into a poorf4g, right?but that alone doesn't make a game bad so why don't i recommend it?well, the game is actually only 10 minutes long! or maybe 15 minutes at best if you are kind of slow with your mouse.after the game is finished you just start again at the first level but with increased difficulty.over and over again.it took me 4 hours to get this game 100% completed and i killed the dragon way more than 70 times.at least 3 1/2 hours of that i was just sitting here permanently pressing the left mouse button, rushing through levels and farming xp & gold for upgrades. tedious!this game is literally interesting for 10 minutes and boring for the rest of your life.

												This game was decently fun for a bit, but it got old and boring really fast.  It hurt to get the final achievement of reaching level 100 and now that it's over it has quickly been deleted.  Too repetitive.

												It's okay, if you get it on sale. You can sink a few hours into 100% the achievements while catching up on a tv-show or something, after which any challenge the game might've had (which, to be fair, doesn't amount to much) will be completely lost.So expect a few hours of idle, passive gameplay for whatever you pay. Once you get enough money to upgrade you character far enough, you'll be basically holding the analog stick right and mindlessly clicking through menus until you've achieved every achievement.The graphics, SFX, music and controls are all very nice and polished, which is the saving grace of this title. The animations look nice even after you've completely broken the game by basically maxing out all of the stats for your character.tl;dr: the goal of the game is to basically unlock all the achievements. To get an idea of how difficult this task is: the most tedious one has been completed by a whopping 20% of players. Get it on sale if you enjoy mindless pixelart fun.			"

												Despite the addicting gameplay this feature offers, I feel that there is not enough replayability and silly flaws that make this paid title one you should avoid at present time.  If this game was free I would totally suggest it, but as a paid title I see no reason to invest in it.  The gameplay gets stale after about 30 minutes and it is simply mind numbing attempting to get all of the achievements.Feel free to watch my video review for more in depth review

												Why pay for a free game? Free version exists in Kongregate/Armorgames and iTunes. Sadly, I came to know this after paying for what I believed to be a new, up and coming game.The developer did not want to expand a two year old game and sought out a last venue to derive profits from, which happened to be Steam. And that I find to be shameful and disgusting.1-2 Euros isn't a whole lot. But I would certainly not like to throw it away on some used, expired goods.			"

												I actually really like this game.I've always had a softspot for Pixel art, the Loot Hero DX ticks all the boxes. It's rather simple though, you run from side to side impaling enemies with your lance, collect the loot they drop, upgrade your items and speed and repeat. You do this over and over through different areas, and monsters until you finally reach the dragon and dispatch him.Afterwards the game restarts and you continue on, with the same game, but more difficult each time. Killing the dragon does rescue a single miner though and it unlocks the mine. They'll slowly collect loot for you, but honestly it's not needed. As shown in the second half of my little video, you can become utterly god-like and just demolish everything.Now the game does get extremely repetitive, unless you simply can't get enough, or you need all the achievements available; but I still enjoy it. The music and art is lovely, and I do hope the developer will expand on the game and later turn it into a platformer/sidescrolling adventure game. I would really enjoy it.As it stands, is it worth the asking price? I personally think so. It's great for bouts of fun, and I couldn't help but giggle to myself as I essentially turned into an armour wearing jousting sonic of death.

												The soundtrack is nice.that's about it, the game is 2 hours long and the achievements are zero effort time sinks.It feels like someone started a game and gave up halfway through production and this is what we got. I wouldn't call it awful as I'm told it's a mobile game port, but it's really not worth spending money on something that could easily be seen on Kongregate.			"

												Expect a half hour out of this tops, unless you're one for achievement hunting.Everything starts well, the tiers do give you a hard to notice kick in the pants, the cost of things feels justified, and the grinding isn't too bad.And then I beat the dragon for the 10th time and I realized that despite my efforts, nothing new was unlocking.I continued with some hope until I maxed my tiers and had to start grinding for 9999 cost upgrades constantly. And I do mean constantly, to get to level 100, you're going to have to grind a lot.The game's recently released as I type, so I REALLY hope for an update to give us some more content... If you must play, I recommend being either exhausted or drunk. Whatever it takes to make you not realize this game is short and you're just repeating the same content over and over. Actually kinda therapeutic then...			"

 #LittleLycanOnSteam   Hello Reader  , If You Are Reading This Review, Don't Keep Your Hopes High As It's Not A Review As Such But My Feelings About Any Games Including This One. I May Have Played Or Not Played This Game, Still I Will UpVote It As I Know How Much Efforts, Blood And Sweat Is Used To Make Any Sort Of Game, Irrespective To Big Or Small, Branded Or Small Devs. I Personally Do Not Have Time To Play All Games, So I Just Idle Them, No Offence, Just For The Cards But I Know That The Game Is Worth Shot Even If Not Worth Our Time As It Requires Tremendous Efforts To Make Even The Simplest Of All Games. God Bless All The Game Developers, You Guys Are Great Because You Guys Make Games And Games Are Life For Gamers And Stressbuster For The Working People. Thank You!- #LittleLycanOnky #January2017			"

												Nobody should be able to do absolutely everything a game encompasses in an hour. I have every achievement except the unnecessarily grindy get to 100 achievement (more on that below). Give people this in a humble bundle for a couple pennies, that would be worth it.This game has the same set of 7 levels that you continuously repeat, prestiging them over and over within a matter of minutes, and changing the XP/GP drop algorithm. The problem lies with the algorithm not changing quickly enough to warrant any reason playing after level 60. Add that onto the fact that you're playing the same 7 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ levels over and over, and you will never want to see this game again. I know I don't.			"

 Fun idle clicker that makes you addicted to it and will make you lose your precious leisure time in a very stupid way *A game that is very similar to the ""clicker"" genre. *Instead of clicking you are running from left to the right and kill foes with you lance. *By collecting diamonds, gold coins. etc. you earn money to upgrade your attack, defence, speed and critical damage. *After finishing you get so called miners which allow you to collect gold in a classical idle mode.*Game is best played with a controller.*Games runs even when you do not have on your screen.*As well as it has an idle offline mode.*Easy achievements.*Steam Cards. Great idea for a ""clicker"" which allows you to collect in an easy way 100% achievements. Recommended! "

												FeaturesA huge cast of different enemies and bosses;All of which can be killed faster than it takes you to pass gas.Tons of different equipment upgrades;Which are all cosmetic.Includes Idle elements where your miners collect gold while you are away from the game;A feature that is so pointless I forgot it was there. It takes 10 seconds to max out your gold in one stage so I'm not sure why you would need a miner to gather 10 gold an hour. Lovingly crafted Retro graphics;So when you're running at 100+ speed it will look like a giant blur.Achievements to unlock;20 total. It takes 5 minutes to unlock 19 and hours to unlock the last. Bestiary to fill out;Another pointless feature. This is like having a checklist for your Chess game. Cards to collect;Only good thing about this game. You can sell the cards so you don't feel entirely cheated. Controller support;YES, the ""Right"" direction works. I never tried any other button since this is all you need. Possibly infinite gameplay;They use the word ""Possibly"" because all people who have tried to reach the end killed themselves before that point. Ridiculous amounts of Loot and XP!By ""loot"" they mean ""gold"" because there is nothing else to collect. As for XP, I'm not sure why it's even there. You can gain levels but it has no impact on the game since everything scales with the upgrades you buy.My final note: I almost fell asleep while playing this. Not even worth $0.50 since you wont make that back from card sales.			"

 Personal Review for Loot Hero DX Personally this is a game that i love to play!I play this game since it are a free web game,much much time ago!People complain,why i will play this game on steam,i can play it on web?The answer is simple,Steam version gets huge content(since web version is small in content),trading cards,achievements,and much more but the principal fact is that you will help the developer dude!The game is cheap and addictive and you won't get out of it until you get all the achievements!The best of this game is the upgrades(i love upgrades games too! <3),you going to get bigger stronger and defeat many many enemies!10/10 absolutely great in all ways!

Great and innovative but classic clicking game.After playing the amazing Plantera ( same developers ) i was wondering what other games Varag had to offer, and i came across this game.Classic, pixel-styled clicker with alot of fun, achievements and content.In this game you fight against hordes of enemies and try to improve your loot hero to the max ( if that exists at least ).You come across several taverns which offer you upgrades for your loot hero, you can upgrade your attack, crictical hit chance, defence and your movement speed.I prefered to upgrade my critical chance alot in addition with a good defence.It worked out greatly and i finished the game once, after you finish your game ( when you slayed the dragon at the latest world ) you will start all over again but your enemies are way stronger and so are your rewards aswell, you will also gain 1 miner with every completition of the game.The miners will gather gold for you while you away and you can collect when you're back in the game, you can use the gold you collected to upgrade your loot hero with the mentioned upgradeable perks.Let's continue to the ratings:~~~~ Positive Points ~~~~ Great innovative gameplay Great pixel design A good bunch of achievements Trading cards support Good controls, nothing to mention.~~~~ Negative points ~~~~ Resolution could have been higher, but not really much an issue It's always nice to have a bigger amount of achievements, like 100 or 200.Summary:There is nothing to rant based on gameplay, controls or nice additions like achievements and trading cards, and that's why this is a good game, a clicker game yes, but a really good clicker game.I recommend you all to buy this game if you liked Plantera, keep in mind that it is different than games like Clicker Heroes, games like Clicker Heroes have no clue or sense about playing since you do the same things over and over again, this game made a difference in the clicker genre, just like their newest game Plantera did.Happy Clicking and Happy looting to you all !** This game was provided for me by the developers for making a in-depth review.

The game pretty much fights for you, all you have to do is move left and right, but it's one of those games where if you are just in the mood to quickly kill some things, it's worth looking into. Comes with trading cards and achievements, so it's not a bad price for a simple little game. Soundtrack isn't bad for the type of game it is, either.			"

												The game has no game-play. You hold down your mouse-button and that's it. With the occasional upgrade to buy there is simply nothing else to do.I give it a 2/10 and those 2 points are given as thus:The first point they get for the ""Well it's something"" award.The second point is for the graphic style. Though very pixelated I do like the style and colours of the game.If they had only added real controls and real actions for your character I might actually have liked this game.If you are thinking of buying this game and have 7 minutes to waste you might want to check out my review here:

It's faster to get all the achievements then all the card drops.The game is just holding the trigger either right or left.Sometimes you might need to stop and regain life or upgrade.The graphics in game are pretty straining to the eyes but in the bestiary they look pretty cool.Music is okay but repetetive.It's easy to get all the achievements.It seems to just be and endless ""clicker/leaning"" game.

												It's odd I normally bash games like this, but I enjoyed my experience.  Despite a lack of meaningful content and repititious gameplay, it was fun.  Though it would lose its fun if I were to try to complete, but there's no real reason to.  I've already basically beat the whole thing, it was just more like your princess is in another castle, do this again with harder settings and faster rewards, 4 times over.I think it was due to the game always having progress.  If you die you're just respawned and you continue, you just grind and grind away to save the kingdom.  It's basic yes but its also quick if you dont like it, and the price tag of 3 dollars normally is alright I guess. The only issues I really noticed for is a glitch where it showed controller controls on startup and the streched out graphics looking blurry on a 1080p Monitor.P.S.  I see all these other people just talking about trading cards, really THAT's what you use steam for.			"

												It's a fun game to play for around 15 minutes, however it is very, very limited.The gameplay consists of you running to the left or right, killing enemies on the way (this is done automatically), provided you're strong enough to kill them. If you're not, either wait for your health to replenish, or run to the left or a previous level so you can grind.There's only around 8 levels which loop with ""increased difficulty"", which really isn't, the enemies just have their stats increased so that you can, in turn, grind some more to be able to take them on.It is a very easy game to 100% though, provided you have some patience to grind all the way to level 100 (prepare to run from one side to another)If you got it for free like I have, go for it. Otherwise, avoid this. "

												I had fun with this game. I really liked the concept, it's a well executed clicker. It is somewhat addictive too. What was the problem then?It's not worth 3$. This game is extremely lacking in content and also ridiculously easy. At 2hrs of gameplay I had beaten it 10 times and gotten 19 out of 20 achievements already.In this current state it's just a mobile game ported to PC (although its actually not). It also needs a resolution fix for 1366x768 monitors.			"

												5/10Decent fun, but incredibly repetitive. Recommended, but if you don't like repetition, stay away.Loot Hero DX is a mobile-to-PC port that isn't free but also has no in-game purchases. The premise is simple: move right, defeat a boss in the end, move to the next level. Your character auto-attacks enemies on the way and you use your gold to purchase upgrades. Between each ""wave"" of enemies there's a house/building where you recover your HP and can buy upgrades. Once the game is finished, you free a miner who will generate gold passively for you and move on to the next difficulty. This goes on endlessly - there is no limit to how far you can go on the game as there's always the next difficulty level.At first, the game is quite fun as you start out slow and progress through, buying upgrades, making your character stronger, faster and more resilient. However, further on as you've already finished the game a few times, the game loses a lot of its value and becomes a grindfest. The levels are the same over and over so there isn't anything new to work for too, so it's just replaying the same game over and over. Eventually you'll have reached max speed for your character and as you continue to upgrade your character, you'll find yourself finishing entire levels in less than 5 seconds, until you hit a difficulty barrier which then forces you to grind for a while to buy more upgrades, then continue to push through.And specially, if you're looking to get all achievements in the game, prepare for a lot - a LOT - of grinding.Overall, fun game but loses its value very quickly.

												Clicker becomes Tons of Fun!!I have only a single playthrough for this game, but it surprised me in that single play.  I expected to run this game about an hour, just enough to get the feel for the game.  What I didn't expect was to find myself grinding the game to try and finish all of the achievements.  I stopped being just a few levels short of the 100 level achieve6ment.  This was the only achievement that I did not finish.  Why did I find myself propeled to do this?  The game was fun!  I found myself wildly addicted to the speed of this game.  I even feel that I can become more efficient, and put up some record setting game finish times.  I do recommend Loot Hero DX.  It's a simple system that provides quick skill ups and clears.  I even managed through the entire game without using my miners!  If I had realized that these guys would help me, my progress would have been that much quicker.  This is a family friendly game that you can feel safe letting children play.  There is not excessive blood or gore, just a nice and clean arcade-like presentation.  I want to thank the developer for allowing me to test out this game.			"

												Loot Hero DX is a simple yet addictive game. It's basically a clicker, but without the clicking. Instead, you control a guy to the right, killing enemies, gaining gold, upgrading your stats, rinse and repeat. Yes, the game gets repetitive after a little while, and your only reason to keep playing it is to collect the last achievement, which takes a few hours of grinding to get. On sale, i can recommend it, because although the game is simple and repetitive, it is addicting. But yes, it's a time waster.			"

												I bought the game on the Lunar Steam Sale for 1,49 euros and I managed to complete it including all of the achievements in somewhere between 2 and 3 hours of active play, but it would have taken me longer had I not been used to the fact that most games have areas in which grinding is more productive than in other areas. I really enjoyed this game. The game plays as a side scroller where the player only controlls the hero by way of the mouse to go from one side to the other, hit enemies and then makes upgrades to advance to bosses and better areas. I enjoyed the game because it's straightforward mechanics and progression really got me hooked in the first part of the game. However, the game does become repetitive later, with the same areas being used having the same exact monsters but with bigger levels and rewards. If you are looking for a few hours of active fun or want something to play in between work, this game is good, especially for the price, however, if you play very actively do not expect it to keep you hooked for a long time as after finishing it and getting all the achievements it just becomes an infinite level and repetition of the steps done before.

												Loot hero is a fun side scrolling game where you have to plow through the levels running into enemies to kill them and upgrading your stats to get further.  Its a fairly simple concept and easy game, which is great for a little time waster. BUT the biggest issue is just how little there really is. There is no replay value and only a hand full of levels, which you have to repeatedly run through over and over and over. You will get most of the achievements within the first like 15 mins. All except for the last one. Reach Level 100. which you will have to sit and painfully grind out for like 70 something levels. If more was added to it. It could be a great little game, but unless you are looking to waste just like 15 mins or grab all of the achievements and then put it down for good.  Then I cannot recommend this game.			"

												This game is the perfect example of two concepts.The first is difficulty vs. tedium. There is no difficulty in this game Anyone can beat it, given time, without the use of any skill whatsoever. I leveled up 20 times with my back to the screen while carrying on a conversation by idly moving the joystick back and forth.The second concept is the awarding of arbitrary milestones as an incentive to continue ""playing"" something which contains no actual gameplay whatsoever. I admit, that's what made me spend three hours in this game, even though it was a joyless experience after the first runthrough. I had to grind up to level 100 because that's the game's only real measure of ""completion."" Upon reaching that stage, I felt relief that I could stop playing without feeling that I'd ""given up.""To be fair, this is all disclosed in the game's description, and the price point is fair for what it is. Clearly many people enjoyed it, and there's nothing wrong with that. But I can't stand the thought of someone playing this while in the back of their mind remembering that I recommended it.			"

It's faster to get all the achievements then all the card drops.The game is just holding the trigger either right or left.Sometimes you might need to stop and regain life or upgrade.The graphics in game are pretty straining to the eyes but in the bestiary they look pretty cool.Music is okay but repetetive.It's easy to get all the achievements.It seems to just be and endless ""clicker/leaning"" game.

												It's odd I normally bash games like this, but I enjoyed my experience.  Despite a lack of meaningful content and repititious gameplay, it was fun.  Though it would lose its fun if I were to try to complete, but there's no real reason to.  I've already basically beat the whole thing, it was just more like your princess is in another castle, do this again with harder settings and faster rewards, 4 times over.I think it was due to the game always having progress.  If you die you're just respawned and you continue, you just grind and grind away to save the kingdom.  It's basic yes but its also quick if you dont like it, and the price tag of 3 dollars normally is alright I guess. The only issues I really noticed for is a glitch where it showed controller controls on startup and the streched out graphics looking blurry on a 1080p Monitor.P.S.  I see all these other people just talking about trading cards, really THAT's what you use steam for.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. The length is a bit unsatisfying, I wish it had more. This is exactly what I want out of a grind-fest game in some ways. It could use a better idle mode. It reminded me of when I played MinuteQuest on my phone. I am very hopeful that the developer will learn to add depth and replayability to his games.After playing through twice, there is one issue I must point out -- After progressing to a new set of 9 levels, you can't go back to the previous 9 levels. If you kill dragons when you are underlevelled, you will regret it and your save will be somewhat locked, normal enemies will destroy you and you won't be able to upgrade any more. Only progress if you're insta-killing creatures.This is an easy game to sink a couple hours into. There are trading cards and easy achievements too!			"

												There isn't many things that can be said about Loot Hero DX. It's really small game. You move from left to right, hunt mobs, auto loot drops, upgrade things and finish level by killing boss. And that's everything, on few small maps which you play over and over but on higher difficulty levels. I really like this idea. While playing Loot Hero DX it kinda reminded me about Half-Minute Hero, but that's all. It isn't interesting for longer sittings. Achievements are really easy to unlock BUT for that you will need little bit more time. If you are looking for small game that you can play for few minutes because you are waiting for something, then Loot Hero DX is good choice.			"

												Now most people think this is just a grind game where you just hold right click and that's it, but there's much more to it.There's different enemies and strategies for it.The soundtrack is great, thats what I love about VaragtP games, they always have good music.			"

												It's a fun game to play for around 15 minutes, however it is very, very limited.The gameplay consists of you running to the left or right, killing enemies on the way (this is done automatically), provided you're strong enough to kill them. If you're not, either wait for your health to replenish, or run to the left or a previous level so you can grind.There's only around 8 levels which loop with ""increased difficulty"", which really isn't, the enemies just have their stats increased so that you can, in turn, grind some more to be able to take them on.It is a very easy game to 100% though, provided you have some patience to grind all the way to level 100 (prepare to run from one side to another)If you got it for free like I have, go for it. Otherwise, avoid this. "

												Loot Hero DX is a simple yet addictive game. It's basically a clicker, but without the clicking. Instead, you control a guy to the right, killing enemies, gaining gold, upgrading your stats, rinse and repeat. Yes, the game gets repetitive after a little while, and your only reason to keep playing it is to collect the last achievement, which takes a few hours of grinding to get. On sale, i can recommend it, because although the game is simple and repetitive, it is addicting. But yes, it's a time waster.			"

												Loot Hero DX had an interesting idea for a game that works for a short while. It is satisfying being able to just run through enemies defeating them almost instantaneously. The artwork is pretty nice and the controls are really simple. The game gets boring and repetitive quickly though. The game is really short since it also only takes around three hours to get all of the achievements. "

												It's interesting at first. You have a couple of stats that you can improve and you may enjoy your first few runs of the game. The game will get crazy fast. But soon you'll notice how repetitive the gameplay is. It's just a huge grindfest. Basically the thing you hate in role play games. And nothing else. Even considered the cheap price tag, you can get way more content in a cheaper game of the same genre.			"

												EDIT: a couple years after I gotta change my thumbs up for a solid not recommend, after rereading my own review. Guessing I gave it a yes because I paid £1 for it (normal asking price of £2), but even like that this game has nothing other than cute art and I don't wanna mislead anyone about Loot Hero DX. There's no content, no challenge, no mechanics, nothing. Any idle game out there will offer you more for free. A big fat no, get a coffee with whipped cream on top with that money instead.ORIGINAL REVIEW: To make it perfectly clear, this game is recommendable if you like cute, extremely casual action with absolutely no depth nor complications. It's addictive and fun in short bursts, and the mechanics get repetitive in around 10 minutes. Loot Hero was born for android and many people, such as me, got it in cheap bundles or offers all over the Internet. But then again, for the price of an oreo milkshake you pretty much know that beforehand.You run towards the right side of the screen automatically attacking enemies with your lance, until you make it to the boss and kill it the same way, repeteadly bouncing into it, then go to the next level. At points during the levels you'll find inns in which you'll be able to spend gold obtained by your kills in upgrading your stats. There's only 10 levels, the last one having as a boss a dragon; once you slay the dragon, everything sort of resets, only with tougher enemies and bosses, and you keep your stats. And so on and on and on, presumibly without and end.So, long story short, Loot Hero DX will give you a few hours of fun, trading cards and an easy set of achievements, if you're interested in this kind of games and also in achievements that is. I  recommend it while making that very clear, as I'm a sucker for achievement hunting myself :p			"

												Loot Hero DX is a game to play for 10, 15 minutes maximum. There barely is gameplay: you literally press one button for move AND attack, then stop by shops to buy upgrades.The graphic style is nice, the sound is ok. The replay value is absolute none. After beating a few levels, there is no new challenges and no motivation to keep on playing.If you're fond of ""watch numbers stacking higher and higher"" kind of games, then you'll probably like it. Otherwise, avoid.			"

												For the first one hour, I've became addictive to this mindless fun game and I'd say this is brilliant time killer. Unfortunately, after one hour this game became chore because of HUGE repetitive. Especially if you a achievement completionist, grinding to Level 100 is insane for this repetitive gameplay, level & design.For gameplay, you can only click to go right or left by your mouse pointer. Enemy got auto kill, and you get the money. And you can ugrade attack, critical, defense or speed by spending money you get at shop. After kill enemies and pass 6 shop, you fight the boss of the level. In the next level, you doing same as the first one until last level to fight the dragon. Well, when you manage defeat the dragon for the first ... you enter the loophole of repetitive gameplay with increase the difficulty each previous level.If you a casual gamer, just stop after kill the dragon for the first time before the repetitive gameplay torturing your mind, sane and soul. But if you an achievement completionist, welcome to masochist torture chamber for the lost soul. Well, I've personally get 100% of this game and I hate very much this game for torturing me for mindless grinding over and over. Last word, I recommend this game for casual gamer that doesn't need to collect the grinding achievement. But if you completionist, stop wasting your time with this game. STAY AWAY !!			"

												So many negative reviews.  I actually really enjoyed this game.  It distills all of the aspects of grinding in an RPG into a single playable adventure.  I've got all but one achievement .  Not sure if I want to play it all the way through to get that last achievement but everything else was done within about 2 hours. Nice quick game.If you don't like repetative games, this game would not be for you.			"

But it was well worth it.With this strategy you will be able to complete this game in 10 minutes and unlock all achievements in less than 2 hours + you'll get all the steam trading cards in the meantime.
