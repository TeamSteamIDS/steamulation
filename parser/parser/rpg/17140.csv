												This game was a disappointment, and it weighed on me doubly so because it's based on an idea I love.Hinterland is one-part Diablo-style action game, and one-part village-management. Essentially, you go around a randomly-generated map, fighting monsters and trying to find resources to sustain a village. At the same time, you're recruiting villagers to your humble land who can then set up shop as tailors or blacksmiths or guards. These villagers, regardless of profession, can also be armed with gear and set up to defend their village during monster raids or adventure with the player in a party.However, it is SUCH a shallow experience. The graphics are visibly of bargain-basement quality (as you can see from the screenshots). Combat devolves to pointing and clicking, then watching your adventuring party (you can only ever control one) beat up whatever is in the area. Worst of all, the village you build up becomes supremely underwhelming when everything it produces are far outshone by loot from the wilderness. The loot itself is never visually appealing or causes satisfying effects beyond making damage numbers higher.Personally, I have always wanted a game village that takes an active part in the player's game. After all, has a NPC farmer ever asked you to kill 5 rats? Haven't you ever wanted him to kill his own damn rats? You have pitchforks! You have hammers! Fight with me against the enemy hordes! Don't just squat in your stinky huts with exclamation marks over your heads, waiting for Almighty Player to save your stinky hides!This game took a few small steps towards an interesting idea, and then plopped down and went no further. Tragic.			"

												Hinterland is pretty damn fun. Its quite enjoyable and addicting. I ended up playing 6 hours of it in one day to complete my first playthrough. I will definitely be coming back to play it on the highest difficulty. The combat is diablo-style. You dont have any skills though. You can only auto-attack enemies. They drop loot, and you get money for slaying them. A certain number of enemies guard specific locations on the map. For example, when you venture out of your base, you will come across a iron mine. Guarding this mine will be 7 enemies of a certain indicated (difficulty) level. After you kill them all, you gain access to the iron mine as a resource hub. In the same way, there are other locations populated on the map, such as a graveyard, herb field, portal, neutral point, etc. At the same time, you have to manage your base. Every few days, you get new visitors to your base. These visitors are of various trades: guardsman, craftsmen, herbalist, innkeeper, etc. You have to recruit these people to your town by paying them. After paying them, you build them their structure (guard tower, workshop, farm, etc) on a tile in your town. Afterwards, you can upgrade these structures for added benefits. Occasionally, the king will send you requests (similar to those in xcom: enemy unknown), and enemies will attack your base. Your job is to take over the whole map.As a plus, there are steam achieves. :)			"

												It's unusual game. Mix of H&S and city builder in oldschool style and in my opinion it's very good idea. What is quite unusual, when you play in this title, you feel like playing some board game. Interesting title for oldschool players.Might be more polished and potential is not fully exploited, but it is still good game. I wish that second, better part will be developed.VERDICT:If you're a oldschool gamer, you should try it. Maybe you will like it as me and will return to it for years.If you're fan of extra-modern games only, I'll not try to convince you for that title.Like this review?

												Amazingly fun game, I have beat it 3 times through so far with intentions to keep trying more characters and higher difficulty.  One definite thing, this game is not playable as is in my opinion.  You have to follow the instructions for DIY Camera settings.  This makes the game have a zoom in/out feature, so you can actually see things properly.

												Despite its flaws, Hinterland is a fun experience and well worth the ten dollar (non-sale) price tag.Positives:+ Good music (what there is) that fits the game's theme well+ Simple to pick up controls and gameplay+ Low system requirementsNegatives:-  Long load times at game startup or resume- Glitches are common and can be game breaking- Lackluster presentation and in-game interfaceHinterland is a game that is all about making your own fun. Pick your class and your rules, then begin your journey to conquer the lands around your village, bringing in resources and improving your town's standing as you go.While the game's overall concept and execution are simple, it is nevertheless an engaging experience. Many other reviewers have likened it to a board game, and that really is the best way to think of it, not as an adventure RPG, but more like a strategy game.While the game's general performance can be poor, it is never more than a minor nuisance, and the game features a great amount of  replayability.

												While not perfect, I enjoy this game.  Its more casual.  You can start a game and end it in a few hours.  More like a board game than playing Diablo.  Good elements for building and exploring, town managment and weapons.  Its a bit of everything thrown together and works well.  Grab it on sale if you dont mind a quick game.  Thumbs up for attempting this and having it actually work.			"

												A nice game to kill a few hours with. Do not expect deep storylines or sophisticated combat systems, it is all fairly basic in many respects. However, the blend of city building, resource discovery and classical action rpg point and click combat comes together into an overall enjoyable package.I find this game refreshing and will happily dive into it every six months or so for a few hours just for some nice, fairly simple fun.

												If a roguelike and a city sim had a baby, it would probably end up like Hinterland. Game generates a world on boot, you pick a class and start building your own little empire on the map as (depending on what you turn on/off) you search for resources to work, defend against bandits and raids, lure folk to town to generate commerce and the ever-vital food, and raise your own skills/fame to attract more interesting residents.The problem is that this will either appeal to you and you'll sink a whole hell of a lot of time into it, like most good strategy games, or, like me, you will die a few times on the permadeath mode, then beat it once, and have seen more than enough of the game to suit you. It's not bad, but it doesn't really seem to have much replay value unless you want to try some of the more challenge-build style classes.			"

												I was sold on the concept, but that's all there is in this game. Everything feels bare bone. The random world is mostly just random monster placement in a mostly flat world. Monster lair will spawn monsters that will run a straight line towards your town and that's about it. Town building is simply hiring people that show up and give them a building to live in. There is little interaction between people in town other than some people require some other building first.Ultimately the game feels too shallow to worth the price I paid for it (which is 20 USD at the time), it's now only 10 dollars, but I personally still wouldn't spend money on it.

												Hinterland is the strange marriage of core game mechanic that many would consider best suited for a hardcore audience and an execution that caters heavily to a casual audience. The result is a seemingly confused game. Action RPG with strategy elements that's geared towards 20-30 minutes gaming sessions.It's also a game that you feel is missing something. The gameplay has a very arcade feel to it due to the lack of any sort of metagame or campaign, every round being a one off attempt at a high score. The lack of any sort of proper tutorial or explanation of the various game mechanics is also something that severely hurts your experience, forcing you to guess at how things work along the way.Graphically and sound-wise the game fits squarely in the indie catagory, nothing impressive but functional enough that it doesn't bother you too much.Hinterland is a confused mess of wasted potential and it really is a shame because there's some good ideas hidden in there.

												At first I bought Hinterland because it was dirt cheap on the Summer Sale and I had a few bucks left in my wallet.. and I was kind of nostalgic for some of the old City Builder series that some of the folks at Tilted Mill had a bit of a hand in towards the end.. but really, I wasn't expecting much.I'm actually pretty pleasantly surprised, truth be told.  At first glance, it's like a kind of toned-down Diablo I, with a few city building/management elements thrown in..  And that's pretty much what it delivers.  Perhaps the younger set or the hardcore strategy or simulation players won't like it, but I'm finding it to be.. almost refreshingly nostalgic.  It has a pretty ""old school"" feel to it, and it's fairly challenging and moderately replayable.  I imagine the harder difficulties will prove much beefier to get through than the ""easy"" games I've done so far.. I could see very much how it can scale.I only have a couple modest criticisms.. The first and foremost is what I would call a ""bug"".. when attempting to use a rejuvenation potion, I frequently have to drag it to my character's face icon 4 or 5 times, if not more, before I hit the one *little* spot on the picture where it actually *registers* the ""hey, drink this"" command.  Never could get the Potion of Hardening to work, but the standard Potion of Healing worked without a hitch.The second is more of a general gripe, I confess. A lot of the ""city builder"" games have this feel of ""having to fight the engine when it makes no sense to have to do so.""  Which kind of breaks immersion. If you're a lord of a city in some kind of fantasy kingdom, I'd expect you'd be able to say.. place an order for goods that your citizens produce, instead of being held at the mercy of whatever random output they feel like offering up that day.   It leaves the situation involving a whole lot of ""Standing around waiting for product X to show up in the rotation"" when you need more of it..  In my case  it was  ""sit through 2 raids waiting for 2 doctors to produce enough healing potions for me to go take over another territory, but no, they would constantly  crank out at least 3 rejuvenation potions for every healing potion produced.  Likewise, 2 armor smithies set up specifically to try to get a decent suit of plate made before I expired from old age, when both of them had researched it and were dead set on producing wooden shields or some other useless junk.You'd think a Lord would be able to, you know, *commission* something. Or specify what is to be focused on for production.But those gripes aside. It's been a fun game. I've enjoyed playing it, and I'd recommend it to others, Perhaps not the really hardcore uber-competitive types.. but for casual gamers who like this sort of thing, especially with a bit of a nostalgic fondness for the oldschool, it's likely to be a pleasant time for a while on a few bucks.

												Hinterland is an underrated gem. It plays a bit like a simplified action rpg roguelike. Completing a session takes about an hour and requires a methodical approach to taking on the enemy camps, and building up your town and supporting party members. There are several classes to play as all with unique strengths and weaknesses. Though some classes offer a much harder challenge than others they also offer greater completion points. The systems in the game are very simple but come together to offer a rich, varied, and challenging experience in a nice short gaming session.			"

												As much as I love Tilted Mill's old city-builder games, I really can't find any way to enjoy this game.  Any depth in city building is gone in this game, you just plunk things down whenever you are able to get something you want popping up in the menu, and you get bonuses.  There's this wide variety of characters to choose from, but they're really just sliding a few numbers up and down.  (Start with more cash, but attack more slowly, etc.) The combat is basically Diablo if Diablo had no skill trees or spells or interesting items.  You just click on things to do basic attacks until they die.  Maybe drink a potion if it's a hard fight.Also, there are no dungeons, just an open field with the occasional rock or tree.  It's supposedly ""randomized"", but when you always get a flat field with just a few rocks lying around, then moving the rocks a few feet to the left doesn't make much difference, does it?There's just no depth to this game.  Go play a game like Depths of Peril instead if you're interested in a hybrid version of a Diablo-style game.  That game had some meat on its bones.			"

												WARNINGFor the love of everything holy, do NOT pick up this game. Glitchy as heck, and not always the fun kind. Supposedly its a city-building strategy game, but it plays like an arcade; there's limited enemies save some respawning raiding groups, so you can't level grind... at all. Early enemies drop in just a couple of hits, giving you next to nothing in terms of levels, and then suddenly enemies are WELL over your power with no warning. Raid groups are the same; either too easy to be worth anything or unstoppable game-ending apocalypse armies. Followers can APPARENTLY level up, but despite my BEST efforts and care I haven't seen one live long enough to level up past hitting with the might of a cricket with health to match.Resources are either accessible or not; but all of them are COMPLETELY critical to your survival. You *can* get stone, iron, fresh water, and herbs by spending HERETICAL sums of gold, and that can often be the only way to get it before the endgame itself. Of course, if mandrake or a crypt aren't nearby and lightly defended you can't get them until you level past the point of needing them.In summary, it tries to be a city-building strategy game, but horrible balance issues, glitches, and shoddy design make it an unplayable wreck.

												Hinterland is one of the games you normally wouldn't have heard of, if you wasn't searching through the RPG section.The game is based on city building, where you can settle any of the new people arriving at your bar / pub, but you won't get that many travellers until you upgrade it, so be careful that you get some good ones!There is also a combat part of this game, you take some villagers with you - or go alone, you level up, get good and bad loot. You need to carefully watch out for your base when you're away fighting, or else you will come back to nothing and GAME OVER.. this has happened a few times to me, due to not getting back in time.You can hire guards to live in your town, be sure to place them at advantage places, like near the borders. You can also adjust the villagers to respond to attacks, so that the guards are not fighting alone against a Dragon or Demon horde, although they are weaker if not equipped well.All out of all I give this 3.5 of 5.

												It's odd - Hinterland isn't the most polished game, and it's Diablo-inspired gameplay is not particularly deep (there are no branching paths of character powers, for instance).  Despite this, I've played and beaten it multiple times with a variety of different characters, who do play different enough to offer a somewhat varied experience.It's not the ""Dungeons & Dragons: The RTS + City Building"" game I've been waiting for, but it's close enough for a good time.

												A great little time waster for those who like older RPGish games.You pick your hero and start recruiting and build your town up while going adventuring in the wilds.Lots of loot, many classes and quite replayable.			"

												This game have given me several hours of enjoyable gaming experience.Its not so much graphicwise. No doubt about that.The game offers different paths to a goal. Its a bit of strategy and a bit of action. You can build up your town to get great killer helpers or to create a powerhouse of your own character.You can loot items or let them be created by your townsfolk.Quite a few classes to choose from. Also a decent amount of possible game settings.Challenge level is spot on.Dont expect a diablo type wacker or a civilitation. As long as you dont, this game might be a nice surprice.			"

												Hinterland, now where do I start with this exquisite jar of perfection? I would like to start inside the jar, natutrally. Inside this jar there are a lot of tiny little characters running about, all collecting rogue dust particles that have collected whenever it has been opened. The game has nothing to do with jars or dust particles, it's just a really great game. Really. Buy it today because it can actually cure carpal tunnel syndrome.			"
