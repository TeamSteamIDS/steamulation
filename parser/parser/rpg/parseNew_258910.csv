Bullet Points - Citizens of Earth Review 
A Video of Citizens of Earth
By: Geek Citadel

			Come and see what we think of the Mother inspired RPG Citizens of Earth! Website: http://www.geekcitadel.com Twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/geekcitadel Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/geekcitadel Twitter:...		


As the newly elected Vice President of the World, it’s time to do whatever the President asks you to do. The opposition leader isn’t satisfied with the results of the election, he’s started a smear campaign on the V.P. that has everyone riled up. Despite these problems he goes out of his way to help out the citizens with their problems. He’s embroiled in a mystery that includes strange animals wandering the forests, and coffee makers that attack the patrons. LikedEarthbound Style – The creators of Citizens of Earth were clearly inspired by the great Mother/Earthbound series. It capitalizes on the visual presentation of minimalist first-person battles with text flowing above screen. It has its own sense of wacky characters from the over-the-top Vice President to the insane ramblings of the school mascot. Gotta Catch Em’ All – Even with the resemblance to Earthbound, the game has a distinct similarity to the Pokemon series. As the V.P. you’re set to push citizens around with your powerful ways. Your job is to meander about town running into wacky personas and recruiting them to do your bidding. Each citizen has their own set of skills and strengths and weaknesses. They can easily be swapped in and out according to the situation, so there is plenty of fun to be had with each. Great Voiceover – Every person in Citizens of Earth has a voice and they’re all great and capture the characters on screen wonderfully. Not every person has spoken dialogue in every situation, but the 75 percent that do sure are great to listen to. Pricing – Citizens of Earth is a full-fledged RPG that captures the 16-bit era of games perfectly. It’s hard to argue with the price of $15 for hours of JRPG fun… even if the game has some drawbacks.Could be betterJRPG Essence – I like Citizens of Earth… but that’s about as far as I can go with it. It doesn’t really break any walls down for the RPG genre. It takes a lot of pride in its comedy which is hit and miss, but the recruiting of Citizens breaks down to the monotony of fetch quests. Find this, kill that, it’s all rudimentary after a few battles. Within two or so hours of playing, I was already bored of what felt like a “grind” and that’s just not right. Not only that, but the combat system is a little too basic for my tastes. It makes no attempts at differentiating itself from any other RPG that ever existed before it. I love Earthbound but somehow playing the same combat system in Citizens doesn’t have the same appeal. My only assumption to my feelings it that I remember Earthbound from 1994, and sadly it’s 2015 and I’d expect a staggering upgrade in the combat system by then.Load Times Vita – Loading is buttery smooth on the PC but the Vita takes some time to move in and out of buildings. It’s a 5 to 6 seconds difference, but it’s noticeable since you move through different zones constantly. Other than the loading issue, the games are virtually the same.DislikedSoundtrack – It’s not that I hate the Soundtrack per se, it’s just that it isn’t that impressive for an RPG. Seeing as this game was inspired by the Mother series, you’d think it could do a little better with the musical choices. Sadly, there were times where the music began to grate or simply cutout completely after a combat sequence. The world – Citizens of Earth has some great characters but the world is a bit too sanitary. The visuals are crisp enough to take a delicious bite out of, but the environments lack an artistic flair. At times I could confuse the design with that of a flash game. For a game that’s trying to capture the 16-bit essence, it lacks that artful variation that breathes life into different zones. The level design was clearly created for travel and not to stop to smell the roses. Can’t skip messages – There is one thing I can’t stand in RPG’s, and that’s not being able to skip arbitrary messages. You can’t do that in Citizens of Earth, you’re forced to listen to the V.P. make snide comments during battle and enjoy lingering messages of enemies dropping items. It’s a small little thing, but man if it isn’t an annoyance when grinding.Conclusion Comedy has a place in video games and Citizen of Earth does tickle that fancy completely. As an RPG… it tries to mimic Earthbound and Pokemon, but falls short of the heights that those two titles reached. I recommend you wait for a sale before becoming the Vice President of the World. Citizens of Earth emulates the Mother series closely, but fails to show its own heart in the process. I’m not saying it’s a bad RPG, but nothing about the story or the combat had me playing it for more than a couple hours a day.			"

												Rarely have I ever been graced with a Game I would consider Perfect.With the recent failures and patches of games, its outstanding to see a game as amazingly perfect as Citizens of Earth.But like many things my opinion can be taken worth a grain of salt, what matters to you is how much that salt is worth to you?So if you enjoy RPG’s like Earthbound and Chrono Trigger, and games inspired by Pokémon, this game is a must have and a contender for Game of the Year of 2015.If you didn’t know, Nintendo doesn’t show much love to the Mother and Earthbound series, only porting Earthbound to the Wii u due to the demands of fans.Mother 1 and 3 have still not come to America, so when it comes to more Earthbound, fans are left wanting due to the launch failures of the 90’s.However, you can trust me when I say Citizens of Earth is in every way shape and form a Spiritual Sucessor to Earthbound.The plotline is simple, As the Vice President of the world; it is your job to unite the citizens of earth agaist the crazy evil that is occurring.Now without giving away spoilers, this game continues to impress me.From the graphics to the music that graces your ears, this game through and through emulates everything I loved about the Earthbound series while improving on it.Namely allowing the player to recruit multiple citizens to fight in the party by solving their issues.For example to acquire the baker it is required to get rid of protestors.Normal everyday Citizens become the heroes of the game, with unique advantages and disadvantages, even your mother joins the fight by scolding and spanking enemies.It may seem quite silly and quirky, but the charm is not lost.The game is easy to pick up and start playing, and if you are having a difficult time with it there is the ability to lower difficulty early on, however if it is too easy, feel free to raise the difficulty for an XP bonus from every battle.And the leveling up system is ingenious, players get bonuses to each citizen depending on who is in the party at the time.Don’t like to grind your party up, don’t worry, there is a school where players can drop off Citizens for leveling up much like the daycare in Pokémon.The battle mechanics are very similar to Earthbound with one addition; Citizens have energy, and build their energy up each turn with various attacks to unleash stronger attacks.Controls are a breeze; there is no input lag or confusing button layouts and combos that must be memorized. Item management along with party management is simple too, touch support is integrated if players desire for a faster menu interface.Swapping Citizens is as easy as dragging and dropping at any time.As far as the equipment goes, there is only 1-2 things for each citizen giving them bonus’s in certain situations, so there is significant less item management. Graphics are crisp and the art style is very similar to Earthbound, the battle backrounds have been changed to not induce seizures, kudos for being able to actually watch the battles if you are prone to seizures. As far as the sound and music go, it is light and upbeat in many situations and many individuals during my stream of the game really enjoyed the music selected.The enemies are not recycled and all the citizens seem unique as well.With side quests and the main story line, this game should provide plenty of fun and entertainment for those who are hardcore RPG or those that have a passing interest.This game is littered with so many references to Earthbound, it is a joy to see them and just get that moment where you know it is definitely a reference.Boss battles are epic and fun, and require a good amount of strategy to win as well.So ladies and gentlemen, Citizens of Earth may possibly be one of my favorite games I have ever been permitted to play, it is like a late Christmas Present I was never expecting.And if that was it for the review, it would be plenty for the game itself.But the company Eden Industries, a group of 12 individuals, yes you heard me right, 12 people and only 2 full time produced this game in 3 years.This company, allows the free use and promotion of this game, from its assets to music, they have no issues with full let’s plays, reviews, streams, and anything else you desire to do.Citizens of Earth is published by Atlus and developed by Eden Industries, it will be available Janurary 20th 2015 on the 3DS, PS4, Wii U, PS Vita and Steam.Unfortunately it is unavailable to the Xbox due to the lack of Dev. Kits at the time.Please leave a like and let the gaming industry know, that we want more games like this. Quality, games that don’t have glitches destroying the game, no dlc patches, and no BS copy-right policies.We want more Citizens of EARTH! "

												***This review was written using a Key provided by the Developer for review purposes***Citizens of Earth is a comedic, top-down RPG where you play as the Vice-President of the world. As the World's VP it's your job to make the citizens of Earth happy folk and make sure they get what they want, after all that's what they elected you for. Over the course of your journey to make the citizens happy you'll come across many citizens willing to help you as well as plenty of people and monsters who want nothing more than to spoil your day.+Nice and colourful cartoon style graphics+Fantastic voice acting which fits perfectly with the game, in particular the voice actor who plays the VP himself+An interesting, far-fetched plot which will see you doing all kinds of things from trying to get rid of protestors to trying to track down a flying cofffe shop+A huge number of citizens to recruit, each with their own side-mission which must be completed for them to join you+Great humour and hilarious dialogue lines throughout+A wide variety of enemy types+Quite a few different environments to explore+Simple turn-based combat that often provides a good challenge, especially when fighting more than one enemy or when fighting a boss. Your party members also have energy requirements for certain moves (energy is built up by using your weaker attacks) which prevents you from using the same strong attack over and over again+Each character has a number of different attacks, many of which are unlocked as they level up and no two characters have the same moves which means each character has their own, unique fighting style+You are able to modify the difficulty during a playthrough by visiting a certain character or by talking to him when he is in your party, increasing the difficult rewards you with more money and more EXP while lowering the difficulty does the opposite+You can name your party members whatever you want which can be rather amusing if you like that kind of thing-The backgrounds when in combat are a bit strange and usually consist of moving colour patterns, I would have preferred the backgrounds from the environment to be used-There were far too many random encounters for my liking and they are almost impossible to avoid and fleeing from fights is almost impossible as you always have very low chances of success-Dialogue lines which repeat when triggered by doing something such as finding an item get repetitive and irritating very quickly such as ""Capitalism at its finest"" when picking up an item of foodWorth a Mention:-Not really worthy of a negative but the menus all have Xbox controller prompts even when using KB&M which I thought was a little oddVerdict:8A super fun comedic RPG, with a huge number of characters unlock, a funny plot and great turn-based combat, I highly recommend this game for fans of similar RPGs.El K.

Hits some nostalgia chords but falls well short of the games that inspired it.On two separate occasions I lost enough interest in Citizens of Earth that I took a couple months off from playing it. Today I've finally finished it, including recruiting all the citizens (I'm a completionist), and am ultimately left disappointed. Much like the character of the Vice President (VP) of the World that you play as, I found this game initially appealing but shallow once you dig in a little.My biggest complaint has be the direction they chose to go in designing the recruitable characters. Most are caricatures based on common stereotypes and much of the comedy is too. Some examples: the Car Salesman is a slick sleazebag, somewhere along the way the Cop will mention donuts and the Artist will talk about happy trees. It's predictable and, as I mentioned before, shallow. With such a large cast of playable characters it's not unexpected that many of them don't get a chance to build depth, but that doesn't excuse that I never felt attached to any of them besides the VP. This isn't to say that there aren't any good moments, there are, there just aren't enough of them.From a combat standpoint there is a lot of variation among the citizens, leaving you plenty of room to get creative with your party setup. Equipment is very limited but each has the potential to significantly change how you'll want to use that character and who to team them with. For example, an offensive character might be able to be equiped with something that doubles their attack but also halves their defense. You might accept this tradeoff if you pair them with a teammate that is able to protect them.Similar to Earthbound, battles aren't the highlight of the game. They can be enjoyable at times or tedious and repetitive at others. With the large cast you're bound to have many under leveled members as well as some potentially over leveled favorites. Difficulty is largely left up to you, either by directly altering it with the special talent of the Mascot character or by choosing lower level members for your party. That can make it tough to consistently find a good balance between challenging and cakewalk.Visually the game is pleasing to the eye. I'm particularly fond of the style of the citizens and enemies. The world has many areas to explore but loses some beauty points with its tendency toward vertical and horizontal lines. Also hurting the good looks was frequent screen tearing and no V-sync option available to remedy this. While on the topic of game performance issues, the game crashed on me numerous times throughout my time with it. The autosave feature made it so I rarely lost more than a few minutes of progress, but it's still distressing.The soundtrack is another area of great disappointment. It tries to emulate the quirky style of Earthbound. Unfortunately its tunes aren't able to breathe the same life into the places they accompany. None of the music is grating, it's just very forgettable.Despite some good aspects to this game and my appreciation for where the developers hearts were at in making this, I cannot recommend it. If you're dying to play a comedy heavy RPG that's not part of the Mother series then maybe give this a shot but keep your expectations low.5/10			"

												It's pretty much Earthbound/Mother meets politics. It's a great combo with a few flaws.Pro:- Charming hand-drawn graphics- Gameplay is unique and varies with citizens combo- Music is great and every recruitable citizen has their own voiceover.- Recruiting the citizens is half the game. The other half, the story itself, which isn't that long.- Light-hearted humor - A lot of hommage to Earthbound/Mother- Not very grindy (Unless you love it)Con: - Pretty ridiculous encounter rate (Like, a bunch of them all at once on screen)- Short, but that's expected from a $15 title- Some bugs that can crash your game without warning (switching out certain characters, teleporting, interacting with certain objects or even going to certain areas) It happens rarely at least.- Not very grindy (Unless you love it)Get it if you love:- Turn-based RPGs- Political satires- Earthbound/Mother and/or Suikoden- Something casual- HumorDon't get it if:- You wanted something more hardcore (Unless you adjust difficulty via a citizen)- You want something serious- You want a long game- You hate everything politics related.- You lack a sense of humor			"

												This game is just great, if you love Earthbound, this game is pretty close to it.Pros:The game is a good value with 20+ hours of game timeInteresting storyGreat voice actingFun, classic RPG gameplaySilly and Zany humor Tons of people to recruitVaried environmentsCons:Overuse of voices during battleTravelling through the world is a bit tediousSoundtrack can become repetitiveCitizens of Earth is a wide-open RPG with lots of exploration and options available. It is a classic turn-based style RPG with a huge cast of unique characters that keep things interesting and varied in and out of combat. The game encourages the use of all the characters due to the fact that many of their talents can be levelled-up, which opens many more possibilities. Citizens of Earth can be looked at as a love letter and an inspiration to roleplaying games of the past. It’s unique enough in its core premise and gameplay additions that I can’t see many long time RPG fans not highly enjoying this. If you’re looking for a title with both style and substance and a hint of nostalgia, Citizens of Earth is your next RPG purchase. The world may never get Earthbound 2/Mother 4, but Citizens of Earth is damn close to it.9/10			"

												People say this is the Spiritual Successor to the old SNES cult classic EarthBound, and I can see why.The plot is humorous instead of serious, you enter combat and fight  in combat in very similar fashions, and the game captures the heart of old school RPGs with its gameplay.This game is also not very linear.  You can follow the storyline to a T and go through it that way, or you can run around and explore the world you are trying to save and make your round about way through  the story.I'm enjoying the crap out of this game, and if you enjoy old school RPGs I'm sure you'll love this game too.

												If there was a more neutral vote then yes/no I would have gone with that, but there are enough little things I can't ultimately recommend this game.Pros: The humor is my humorFirst half of the game has good pacingWide array of likable charactersThe general look of the gameLiked the layout of the menuNo random battles, can avoid on screen enemiesCons: Too much grindingSome of the character unlocks and mini-games are pure luck.The map could be betterPacing suffers in second halfIt's a game that starts strong but loses momentum as it goes on.

												YES it's an Earthbound / Mother clone.YES it pays tribute and references Earthbound / Mother every chance it gets.NO it doesn't live up to our high expectations and NO it doesn't surpass the greatness that is Earthbound / Mother... like doesn't even come close.BUT if you're craving some Earthbound / Mother without repeating those same games for the 100th time, it's a nice change of pace.Citizens of Earth does pay huge tribute to the Earthbound / Mother series and for that I am greatful. Earthbound was a sleeper hit game on the SNES back in the early to mid 90's that capitalized on doing something different, making fun of Western culture and using the same sterotypes we saw in JRPG games at the time...Once the dawning of the internet occured and more information spread it obtained cult following status and at this point, legendary status as one of the best JRPG's of the Silver Age of gaming. This is exactly why Citizens of Earth tries so hard to emulate the feeling, it wants to be great. Does it reach it's lofty goal? Hell no... but it's still a fun game and a love letter to Earthbound fans across the globe.Should you buy it at 15 dollars? I'd say, if you're incredibly desperate for a retro style RPG and a huge retro style world to explore, then yes, definitely YES. I can already tell this game is going to need an entire weekend to fully enjoy properly. To those of you not in touch with your inner child, you've lived a sad and depraved childhood and for that I pity you... but there's always time to change. :)You can't really play this game in stints, you really need to sit down and make some time to be enthralled by it to fully enjoy it and that's exactly how Earthbound worked... You need to let yourself be absorbed by the world within, unfortunately Earthbound almost immediately draws you in where Citizens of Earth takes some time. The plot is rather weak to begin with and it seems like the fun comes from recruiting characters from the 40 character roster... There's plenty to explore and a lot of questing to do so the content to price ratio is fair.Where does the game fall short? The music is rather quirky, but not in the good kind of way like Earthbound was... It tries too hard to be weird and ends up kind of falling flat... Although some areas definitely have some pretty cool tunes, none of it is Earthbound worthy though.The character recruitment can get a bit overwhelming, there's a lot of characters to try and you really don't know who's going to be good in the long run.  I find comitting to a specific set of characters is fairly tough, especially when you have so many to choose from. The level up bonus' you receive from having specific characters in your group at the time of leveling up also really hurts the grind a bit. It's an OCD nightmare for hardcore gamers who love to min / max their characters... basically if you don't set up characters to synergize properly, it's wasted potential... over the course of 100 level ups, it could mean the difference of being able to conquer the 4X difficulty setting for the masocists.This kind of makes the game suffer a bit in the lasting appeal department, you really can't get attached to any one character other than your brother, who seems to be one of the best all around characters to have. You'll be constantly switching out the other two characters to work around your brother's strengths. I can tell a lot of work went in to the character creation so I can't knock it too hard but it seems like it could of been toned down a bit. I would of rather had 4 to 6 solid characters to choose from and left it at that but then it would of threw the entire theme of the game out the window so it's a bit hit and miss in my opinion.Either way, it's a meaty game, probably around the same size / length as Earthbound, except this game seems to be a lot less linear from the start. It's best to just follow the main quest line until you can get some quick travel going because walking around in this game is just abysmally boring which was another gripe of mine... There's plenty of places to visit but if you hit a dead end, expect to want to just quit and take a break because the hike back in the other direction is enough to just turn you off completely.All in all, recommended to those craving a taste of the good old days of gaming. Cheers.			"

												An RPG modelled after Earthbound in many ways, yet comepletely original in plenty of others.  The recruitment system is unique and fantastic, and the dialogue is hysterical.  The game looks and feels great.  Having played Earthbound, I'd say this game is pretty dang close to it.  Definitely would reccomend to anyone, even those who aren't RPG fans.			"

												For some players, Citizens of Earth may be exactly what they've been looking for to scratch their nostalgia itch.  For me, it started off strong but rapidly deteriorated into the opposite.The vast majority of characters are extraordinarily one-dimensional and never evolve in any narrative way.  The combat is old school, but in the way that it emphasizes everything that has been improved over the years as opposed to appealing to our rose colored glasses.  The story itself, in my humble opinion, couldn't even begin to compete with the classic games that Citizens of Earth was inspired by and involved far too much grinding to progress.It was enjoyable to collect characters, for the most part, and leveling them was exciting as far as abilities are concerned as each new ability tended to add something new role-wise that the character hadn't previously had access to.I can't recommend this game for the Earthbound fans who are looking for an exciting modern version, but as an RPG-lite this may appeal to some who are looking for something that has the simple RPG feel of years long lost.

												As most  games localized by ATLUS, this game is weird. Basically, the best comparision would be to a Earthboundesque game. Although, if your expecting a Earthbound game, this is not a replacement for it. The basics of the game is pretty fun too..you recruit everyday people and their jobs or how they live determine their skills. At first, their skills might not be that forthcoming in usefulness, but once you level them a bit, their skills turn out to be an asset. Some people are very hard to recruit, as i have had personal issues trying to recruit the weather woman, and finding her when it was raining. The dungeons are quite fun too in this game. This game does not take itself seriously though, and tends to break the 4th wall between the player and the game characters. If you want fun that is zany with actualy realistic jobs people work at with skills possible for their jobs and rpg playing, then this is the game for you. Thanks for reading!			"

												Citizens of Earth is a very comical, not to difficult JRPG that feels a little bit like earthbound. This game does some things perfectly and other things not so much. The voice acting is perfect, the writing is very funny, the music is great, there are a ton of different abilites you can expiriment with, and each citizen has a unique talent you can use out of combat. ( For example the musician will let you change the music to any music within the game at any time ) The way you go about collecting citizens is done very well and there are a bunch of neat side missions in the game too. However, the combat is kinda bland at times, especially later in the game, and its very hard to avoid enemys when you don't want to fight. They can see you from very far and will chase you down. This is probably the thing I hated most about this game. Luckily, after you beat an area the enemies run away from you when you walk by. The level design in this game isn't that great either, its usually some mazelike area littered with the same three enemies. You end up just constantly battling enemies until you find the right direction. Even so, I liked it probably way more than I should have. I'd recommend it if you like funny games or if you are looking for an rpg along the lines of pokemon, where the combat isn't to complicated and there's collecting to be had.			"

												My review from: ResPwnd[respwnd.com]If there’s anything besides zombies that is flooding the PC market at the moment it has to be cheap RPGMaker games. Not all are crap, but a lot of them. Citizens of Earth from creator Eden Industries (Waveform) is not an RPGMaker game, so one might wonder why I bring this up. Well, for two reasons. First of all it certainly does pay homage to the same kind of retro RPG titles as a lot of RPGMaker games do and the gameplay is in many ways very similar. The other reason why is the fact that in the midst of this over-saturated retro RPG market Citizens of Earth rise above this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and do its own unique take on the tired genre while also adding some interesting design choices. In the veins of PA Adventures: On the Rain-slick Precipice of Darkness and Deathspank the game is brimming with silliness and exercises in the bizarre.You play the Vice President of the Earth, a self-indulgent, unlikable, and incompetent politician (or should I perhaps just say “a politician”) who take to the streets and have to battle hecklers, stop signs, emo thunderclouds, heaps of leaves, popcorns, joggers, and hippies (just to name a few of the enemies from a very funny and quite insane ensemble) on his way to his meeting with the President. When the President of Earth soon thereafter turns up missing, the VP slowly realizes that something odd is going on. Suddenly that coffee franchise that took to the skies earlier seem a lot less innocent, for instance. This takes you and you compadres, a wide array of Citizens, on a journey through deserts, eerie (well, no, still silly) forests, cemeteries, camps, and a lot of other places on a quest to find the President and uncover a sinister plot.While in no ways a technical masterpiece, the game looks great for its genre. It has a clean and neat art style without feeling half-done or rushed. A lot of its design practically screams Nintendo with its smoothness and big and colorful buttons (that sometimes won’t render until you try to select one or the other using your controller or keyboard). The game is in fact available on the Wii U and the 3DS. Despite this, it retains the simple retro RPG game design that we all know by now. Citizens of Earth is an engaging game, but it suffers from some segments that involves far too many battles, something that can make the game feel like very “grind-y” (I’m looking at you, chapter 3!). It’s not fun when you can’t walk for more than 10 seconds between every battle, especially battles that are far too easy. Because I get that the game is a lot about the turn based fighting, but I want the battles to feel like they serve a purpose instead of just having them thrown in my face while taking a stroll in the big city. If I wanted to grind, I would grind! And on that note, you will have to grind to be able to level up the forty (40!!!) different party members, or Citizens, that you can recruit. Fortunately, if you have the money, you can put them in school to make them level up all by them selves. Every recruitable citizen has a talent, and while these might sound a bit odd I find some of these little talents very charming – especially the Beekeeper who let’s you zoom in or out or the School Mascot that let’s you change difficulty at the cost or benefit of earned XP. You can also fast travel using the Pilot, and avoid some of the more tedious battles (and a long hike) by letting the Car Salesman conjure up a car for you. Still, you can only drive on the roads and most enemies tend to cluster off-road anyway. Some of the game options you usually find in the “options” menu are actually citizen talents, with the exception of resolution, shaders, sound, the option to play in full screen versus windowed mode (there is no borderless), and using multithreaded mode. As stated, this is no technical masterpiece and doesn’t offer anything groundbreaking. Still it offers dynamic reflection and shader effect that a lot of similar titles don’t, and its somewhat unique art style gives the game a personality that manages to charm the player. However despite being patched both prior to (i.e. while doing most of my review) and after its release, the game still suffers from some unexpected crashes now and then. I will say they are rare but they can of course be frustrating and cause you to lose data even with the game’s functional autosave feature. And let’s face it – of course they shouldn’t still be there post launch.Citizens of Earth really hits the mark with a lot of its satirical humor but it is a pretty long game and one-liners and the repetitive combat oriented gameplay can become tedious after a while. Sure there are a lot of places to explore and discover but mostly it just leads you to Citizens that you can recruit. How is not always obvious, and some I found to be annoyingly vague (don’t get me started on the Weather Lady). The storytelling is however good and with a story that goes absolutely bonkers by the end it is still pretty damn funny and bizarre experience. So when it all comes down to it – did I have fun playing Citizens of Earth? The answer is yes. Sure, it’s tedious and frustrating at times and while you can recruit forty Citizens to join your party, chances are you’ll grow to like three of them and stick with them for as long as possible. In addition to those you might have some substitutes for certain fights as enemies have both weaknesses and strengths and some tactics are needed to beat them. Then again, the people you don’t use for battles still have those useful talents I spoke of earlier which can help you out in other ways, like the Architect and the Gardener who you will need to access certain areas. The wide selection of recruitable party members might also give players more freedom to play the game the way that fits them best. All in all, Citizens of Earth entertains yet at a somewhat uneven rate.Plus:Succeeds in its humor and satireSilly but nonetheless good storytellingCharming art styleMyriads of party members and features make for a diverse experienceMinusThe same myriads of features make some of them seem pointlessBecomes tedious grinding at certain points in the storyStill suffers from some crashes post releaseScore: 69 / 100			"

												This is a turn based RPG sort of like pokemon, but with a variety of 40 different people to recruit and choose from to have in your team of 3. And every character has different abilities based on who they are, such as baker can bake a bun to heal hp, throw flour to reduce AGI, use a heat based attack and the mum can scold to lower enemy defense etc. and they each have a different talent such as the baker has a bakery shop talent so you can buy baked goods that heal, revive, raise stats and the pilot who can fly you around the world.I like this game a lot, like the variety of characters and the different abilities they have. I like the gameplay, art style, combat and crazy JRPG  enemies and bosses style. The humour is silly and can be childish.Dislike there is no world map which makes it hard to know where to go at times leaving you wandering in circles and there are also plenty of locations without any area map and vague quest descriptions making you unsure what to do next such as go south of your hometown and whisperwood is directly south of hometown, but nope nothing happens or progresses the quest there and you have to actually go south of whisperwood to get to the Executive Retreat so the quest description should of been go  fartherest south of your hometown past  Whisperwood.Some of the minigames to recruit citizens require you to be very fast and accurate with button pushing, the only game I could not complete was the soda guzzling one and had to get the photon to slow time to be able to complete it.And it's annoying trying to recruit the weather lady as she will only appear and join you during a thunder storm, same sort of problem with the scientist.Despite things I dislike, I had a lot of fun playing this game, I've played plenty of old school RPG's and pokemon and this game has a simular feel, I like it a lot rate it 7/10.It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it sure is mine.

												Pretty fun JRPG-like game.   Never played Earthbound, so I cannot deploy the comparison everyone else is, but enjoyed my time with the game regardless.Combat seems simple at first, but the battle system becomes a little more complex as the game progresses and party members are added (never getting too complicated or difficult, though).  Characters are rather bland, never moving beyond the initial stereotyping of their names, but that may be by design.  With 40 party members to recruit and use, though, the game encourages you to try new things and experiment with different party combinations, which helps keep things fresh.Found the story rather bland as well, nothing beyond your typical ""mysterious-evil-slowly-destroying-the-land"" with a couple curveballs thrown in.  The setting was a nice change of pace from the typical RPG locales, given a bit of a modern, American flair to JRPGs.  Dialogue, however, is sharp, with excellent voice acting on a 15 dollar indie rpg.  The little easter egg jokes you find by exploring the world are good for a chuckle or two, as well.Replay-wise, they do offer an option for a New Game + when finished, though I didn't feel compelled enough to run it a second time.  All of the achievements can be unlocked in one playthrough as well, defeating the completionist's need to run through it again.  However, you may find it enjoyable enough to revisit it at a later date.Performance-wise, runs relatively smoothly, with a couple hiccups coming in larger areas late in the game, mostly when opening the map/menu.  Apart from that, the game does feature some nasty bugs which will often crash your game for you, but the solid Autosave system should prevent any serious data loss when it hits you.  And it will hit you. (Note, Devs are inquiring about bugs/glitches on the discussion boards, so they seem like they intend on fixing their game up at least. Bonus points, as always).Overall I'd give it a 7/10.  For 14.99 you get a light-hearted JRPG romp with about 30 hours of gameplay.  Definitely worth a glance if you're already a fan of the genre, but not exciting/different enough to win over anyone that doesn't like JRPG's to begin with.			"

												After having completed the main story line of the game, I find this game completely incredible in practically every way possible.Some may say it's bad as it tries to be a spiritual successor to Earthbound and not pulling its weight as people expect it to, I saw the game as a successor to Earthbound, but played it as if it was its own game, and enjoyed it immensley, From the music, to the art style, to the little tiny details in aesthetics, this game has near perfection, even if the glitches were a detriment, the amazing team of Eden Industries occasionally live stream bug fixes, taking in suggestions and notes.Onto the story side of things, the story flows perfectly, while there is minor sequence breaking by using the ability of certain citizens to get to areas you shouldn't be in yet, it's often blocked off until you should go to that area, and even then, you skip like one battle, which you can do anyway if you want to. The final boss though, is absolutely incredible, there is next to no buildup or clues to the villain, who it is, is incredibly obvious, and satisfying to defeat, and the actual final boss beyond that, cements the game's status as a Spirtual Successor to Earthbound. It shouldn't be treated as such while playing through, as to prevent Nostalgia Blindness, but should be recognised as such after completing the game to ensure how amazing the game isIt's only Feburary as of this review being written, and I already consider this game as my GOTY 2015			"

												Wow, I sat down and thought ""I'll just try this out.""  Eight hours later...This game is a love letter to Earthbound (Mother 2), even lines and situations are ripped directly from the game in amusing ways.  Every character is unique, light customization mechanics, and the game is firmly tongue in cheek.  The game is downright fun, in almost every way.  Some of the side-games/recruitiment games are designed for much younger players who can click the mouse like a spazatron, but that is pretty much the only bad mark I can give it.			"

												Citizens of Earth is a game that pays tribute to a game from the Super Nintendo known as Mother 2 in america known as Earthbound. The game revolves around you being Vice President of the world and after just winning the election and living in your mom's house still sleeping in your brand new suit you awaken to seeing your brother who gifts you a UTab this is used to keep up to date with your characters settings and everything. As you play the game you'll come across different enemies such as Telefawns, BubbleBees, HoneyBears, your rival running mate and even running into Hecklers and Protesters to name a few.The battle system runs in a almost exact style of the Mother series (More less of Mother 3 style but still revolving around a Turn Based RPG.)Atlus I believe has taken a great concept to a VERY underated style of gaming and recreated the style of the Earthbound way of gameplay all of us have come to love.  From the comedy cutscenes to the charming smile of you the V.P You and your crew of Citizens of Earth will help stop all the wrong that is going on and finally get to enjoy your cup of Coffee and your position as Vice President of the World.

												Gotta say I was excited to hear about this game, and I'm a sucker for the ""Inspired by Earthbound"" line, but since beating the game I've come up with an analogy that I feel sums this game up:A Candy Bar that's wrapped in pubes.At it's core is a great game, but there are so many terrible things about it that make it impossible to choke down. I had to force myself to finish this game, and I'm not proud of it.It's buggy, which is forgivable, but it's also poorly designed, which is not.You are forced to fight approximately 1,000,000 enemies at certain times in the game: the map is swarming with 20 groups of enemies, and you have to fight EVERY SINGLE ONE (Think Romancing Saga for the SNES.) You can't get around them, and the battles are tedious as they get. I wouldn't be suprised if 50% of my playtime was devoted to combat, and I'm not exaggerating. Long story short, you will want to like this game, but will end up hating it.			"

I got it at a discounted price of like $2 or $3 but this is totally worth the $15 based on my enjoyment.  I love the graphics. I love the characters. I love the combat system.  The music is so great. This has the look and feel of a hit game. Based on the number of reviews, it seems that not a lot of people have given this game a chance. Maybe it's not most peoples' type of game. I think everybody that likes Earthbound would want to play this game. This game is awesome! If you are on the fence, put this on your wish list and wait for a sale.			"

												Earthbound Ahoy!# time to completion - about 20 hours #Citizens of Earth very obvisouly takes some inspiration from the Earthbound series. It is a classic JRPG with a lot of personality, charm, and humor. The game takes place in and around a city and features a good variety of locations and enemies.Gameplay Premise/Loop:- The game is divided into 7 Chapters. Each chapter has objectives that need to be met to proceed.- You play as the Vice President's brother and go around the town fighting enemies and meeting other citizens that you can recruit into your party. Each of these have their own attacks and moves along with a special ability. Leveling up someone eventually gets them to better levels of their ability. For example, you can recruit a pilot to fast travel around the world. Leveling her up will allow her to take you to more places.Pros:- As I said before, the game has a lot of charm. Great art style, great sense of humor, characters all feel different.- Ability to name characetrs whatever you want.- Not all that difficult. Also one character allows you to make the game harder or easier.- Fun world to explore.Cons:- No world map. There is a map for the area you are in, but no world map. This leads to the game beign harder to navigate than it should be. I ended up having to search google for a world map to reference.- Objectives are sometimes a little too ambiguous.  I wish the game just told me where i needed to go.- Some characters are required to proceed and this isnt always clear.- I wish the game would tell me where to find characters again after i met them the first time. Example: I needed to find the gym to recruit the bodybuilder, but i couldnt remember what building was the gym. They are not clearly labeled.All in all, if you like JRPGS, i think you would enjoy this. It isnt nearly as long as most jrpgs and it is a fun game to play in the middle of other stuff.			"

												I love this game, I really do. However, looking at it from a critical standpoint, I have to categorize it as a mixed bag. The game really rolls with the concept of you coming off of earthbound or something similar, and it does a fairly decent job at being at it's attempt at being a successor, albeit focusing more on the comedy side than the emotion/nightmare fuel side. There's even a few blatant references and not so blatant references here and there, and the battle system doesn't do a bad job at capturing that feel.Outside of that, the game's humor is often spot on, and it's pretty fun to walk around recruiting new characters and doing side quests. The characters themselves are really colorful, and have no problem standing out despite the sheer amount of them. The story line really doesn't take itself very seriously, but does enough that you can at least get relatively invested in it. On the other hand, the enemy spawn rates can be highly obnoxious, and I often feel ready to tear my hair out after having to trudge through hundreds of repetitive enemies just for one simple goal. There's so much stuff to do half the time I don't even realize what I should be doing, and end up killing a bunch of things for no reason. Though this has gotten better with updates, the game still has a few bugs, the most common one I got being stuck and having to restart. The bosses are also often anticlimactic, since the hordes of enemies usually pose more of a threat.Overall, it's a game you can get a lot of fun out of-and a game you need quite a lot of patience for.

												I was going through my list of unplayed games and found this in there.  (That happens quite often and I usually don't know where a lot of these games come from, lol.)It's a fun game if you're into turn-based, humourous games where the story doesn't really matter.  I can see myself killing a few hours of time with this when I don't feel like playing anything that requires a lot of effort.  However, looking at the price tag of $14.99, I'm marking this review as a free product seeing as I don't think I'd pay that much for this.  I more than likely got it for free off-site and just can't remember.  If this is your cup of tea, pick it up during a sale and have some fun with it.			"

Absolutely fantastic! By embracing the old and implementing the new, Citizens of Earth sets a new bar for Turn Based RPG fans. You play as a self centered middle aged man who still lives with his mother, but no worries, as you were just elected the Vice President of Earth!Something fishy seems to be going on around town, and it's up to you to get people to fix it for you. Most NPCs you'll encounter in Citizens of Earth can be recruited on your side by doing quests or tasks in their favor. This gives it an interesting little mix between Earthbound and Pokemon.Overall, Citizens of Earth is such a fun little game. You'll be playing this one to bits!			"

												Don't let the cartoony aesthetic deceive you. This is a quality game. In the JRPG style (menu-based combat), you play as the Vice President of Earth, your typical blowhard politician. But you don't fight as him but as three of 30 or so characters that you collect through a variety of side quests. Each of the characters has different strengths and weaknesses, like elemental resistance, healing, powerful attacks or weaker attacks that hit multiple enemies. Also, each character has a ""talent"", which ranges from super handy (like transporting from one location to another, offering powerups, zooming out in the map and speeding/slowing down time) to the useless (changing the music, the weather, etc.) All of the different characters allow you to play to your own playstyle. Want to wallop your enemies? Do it! Want to play it safe with an on-hand healer? You can! There are characters who help you level faster, who restore your energy, and many who do wacky things that have big payouts later at severe detriments now.The story is silly and full of references to typical JRPG mechanics, Dungeons & Dragons, video games in general, pop culture. The baddies are equally silly, with mutant animals like a Catctus (a cat-shaped cactus) and the Decaffinator (a robot espresso machine). It never takes itself too seriously.Don't be deceived by the cutesy style. This is a well--crafted game. I spent nearly 40 hours trying to unlock all the characters, do all the sidequests, and unlock all the achievements.  IT's a super slick design, great interface. The map is huge with tons of secret areas and collectibles.Cons (very few and minor): There are certain tasks that can only be completed with certain characters (mainly unlocking other characters). And some of the character unlocking tasks are vague in what you need to do and require either great thought or an online cheat and are not obvious at all. (Es: For the scientist character, you have to just hang around until there's a thunderstorm, which you have no control over). Also, the world is SPRAWLING and there is no actual map that you can access, even to get a vague idea of where you are or where you need to go. There is a character that allows you to zoom out, but it doesn't go nearly as far out as the entire world. Some of the areas are not entirely obvious that you can enter (their ramps to higher/lower areas are often seemingly invisible). Thus, I spent a LONG time in certain areas going in circles, trying to access an area with a non-obvious entrance. You can go down into some of the oceans, too, which took me a LONG time to figure out. However, most of the game is clearly telegraphed with graphics or dialogue as to what you should be doing or going, though not always.Overall: Great game, especially if you like silliness and menu-based combat. Don't be fooled by its cutesy look. This is a quality game.			"

												I really like this game. My only real complaint is that they made it to easy to sequence break. In the begining of the game the police had barricades set up to stop you from sequence breaking. I assumed this or similar would be in the whole game, so I freely wandered around exploring and ended up unlocking plot points out of order. It was a very fun game, but I don't recommend exploring areas until the game directs you to go there. That way you don't accidently jump ahead.			"

												I'm going to ignore the fact that this game is Earthbound-like and published by ATLUS, because those things have nothing to do with this game (even if I bought this game based solely on those reasons).In Citizens of Earth you recruit/collect citizens and use them to battle evil/weird/stupid/creepy/funny/awkward things in the world. You swap these citizens in and out of your party based on the sitatuation before you, such as in Pokémon.And well, that's it. The voice acting is pretty great, the music is bland at times, the writing smart and funny usually, the art is.. not my style, and mechanically the game feels very Flash-y and low budget.For the price, I'm going to go ahead and recommend this. However there are more polished and engaging RPGs out there for this price such as Child of Light, Transistor, and Costume Quest 2. I would go check those out first. And if you were looking for Earthbound, then do not buy this game. Go download the Mother 4 fan game when it comes out instead.			"

												So here are my thoughts on Citizens of Earth so far. Destructoid was right, but I don't agree with their final score. You level up fairly quickly and with the exception of certain optional boss fights, the game never really feels like it throws you any major challenges unless you increase the difficulty.  However, I chalk this up to wanting to target a more casual audience, so that's not necessarily a bad thingIt also means you can fly through the game quickly if you want to or increase the difficulty for a tougher, more oldschool challenge. There really doesn't seem to be much of a penalty for death either.  They don't allow people outside the party to level up unless you enroll them in school, which costs money. Still an interesting option as I don't really use the money for much of anything else so far (you get a fairly steady amount of items through battle alone).However, this goes back to does a game have to be hard in order to be fun? No. No it doesn't. CoE is funny, cheesy, and silly all in one. There are a lot of groanable one liners, but ultimately it hits the mark in terms of weird and comedic values.  At the end of the day, if you liked Earthbound, you will like this title. Just don't expect it to actually BE Earthbound.			"

												While the game may have appealed to people with its 'earthbound' feel, it has a more sily/strange style than 'uncanny/weird'. The game does not try to make itself relatable and just goes full blown 'out there' from the start, although im aware earthbound was silly too, this game main character try harder to work with whats around, rather than be driven by the story. The only relatable thing in the game is the ""world"" leaders being incompetent and other nonsense you'll come across lol. The game feature a lot of content, often clearing a sidequest will cause you to come across another and oftentimes the reward wont be disapointing, depending on which characters you are using. Speaking of characters, there is a lot, the game replace developing 2-3 characters who wont usualy get much development at all.. by gathering a LOT of them, and everyone of them has a special skills that can be used out of combat usualy, a bit like pokemon. Some will let you access new areas while another one can downright change the game difficulty on the spot. Most characters are different enough so that using them and trying them all out is rewarding, but some seem clearly better suited for a long chipping fight vs bursting down easy targets. You can actually re-start any battle with different citizens midfight if you are having trouble. Each citizens bring its own stats boost upon level up as well so building a team becomes an interesting challenge after a while, a bit like leveling different class for stats in tactic ogre on ps1. The game is not too short and since you can turn the difficulty and the presense of a new game plus.. there is a lot of replayability down there for the big fans. Combats plays out like a standard turn by turn, but still has a few mechanic twists like the buff/debuff systems and the energy system.Enjoy!-Lost			"

												Chock full of EarthBound references, I'm only a few hours in, and it's solid gold. The gameplay is very similar to EarthBound and Mother 3, with enemies running away from you once you reach higher levels, and running towards you while you're weak. Even the warping colours behind the battle screens are EarthBound-y. It's not just subtle, either. Characters and places from EarthBound are referenced throughout. The key difference here is that your options for party members are MASSIVE. It's your job as VP of the world to hunt down citizens and get them on board!So far, so wonderful.			"

Tons of fun and lots of different party members. Naturally, as pointed out by other reviewers, the game did have some issues crashing at launch. Most of the crashes have been patched out, but a few still remain (I've only had one crash occur in my 10+ hours of gameplay).Highly recommended for fans of Earthbound or those who enjoy seeing lots of different kinds of characters.

												While I did enjoy the story and overall humor of Citizens of Earth this is NOT a game I would recommend.This is a game which COULD be good and worth playing but not in its current state. It just has too many small flaws that add up to an overall unenjoyable and frustrating experience.Combat itself can be interesting, however there are a number of things holding it back. Firstly and my major complaint is that death animations and the Vice President banter eat up a lot of time away from the player, you end up having to wait anywhere from 2-5 seconds for each of these things to play out. An example: You kill 4 bees with an AoE attack, each of them has to play an individual death animation each taking up a minimum of 2 seconds, so for the group you end up losing 8 seconds where you can't do anything, you can't skip it, or speed it up in any way. With multi-enemy battles being a fairly common occurance you'll be waiting a lot. The vice president can also randomly decides to say one of his voice lines, which causes loss of character control and again no way to skip or speed it up mid battle. So you end up spending a LOT of time just waiting for things to finish rather than actually playing the game. And combat is something you're CONSTANTLY doing in this game, there are SO MANY enemies in this game it is impossible to avoid them all!!! Grinding is another problem in this game. Be it voluntary or just the sheer number of enemies on any screen at a time you will be grinding or fighting monsters constantly. So you would think that with all this mandatory or forced fighting you would have some customization over your default actions in combat, this is not the case. There is no way to customize how your skills/abilities/actions are placed in the menu, nor is there a means to repeat your last performed action on a character. So you spend a majority of each battle just hunting down your most used skill/ability/action, This gets old very quickly with how often you're in combat.I was hoping that maybe a patch would come by and fix these flaws. However after taking several months break from the game and giving it another go just now this is not the case. So personally, I would not recommend this game and I would recommend spending your time and money elsewhere.			"

												Let me start by telling you a joke:3 game developers enter in a bar, a pokemon gen1er, a fuzzypickles and a pretty bland mobile Android designer, they sit in front of the bar-tender and ask for a beer, then they start at the same time:-Maaaaan, I wish I could make a game that let me put my nostalgia in one big love letter to that nostalgia.-They quickly see each other to the eyes after hearing that last sentence and all together run to the nearest net-cafe to start working on something.I'm sorry that sounded better on my head the point is:This is a good, loved game, its developers put a lot of effort and care in to making it, as always, is not for everyone, personally is not my cup of tea, but it is well made.Now, the fastest way to describe this game is:A gen 1 Pokémon with an earthboundish coat of pain and a modernized artstyle.If you buy this game in a nostalgia attack for any of the two titles I just mentioned you will be disappointed, and be honest, it looks ok, but you didn't come here for the artstyle.It's a nostalgic love letter for that titles but its just ok almost all the time and the rest is just meh, support the developer, but don't buy it with a lot of  hype.

												An RPG for the Ages. Citizens of Earth hits on a very unique setting and trope that is not common among many games. It is easily equated to Earthbound and rightly so. Similar wacky character/enemy designs, psychadelic battle backgrounds, satyrical comedy against capitalistic culture. All of this makes for a great experience with the game. The gameplay system does vary from the similarities with Earthbound though but not in a bad way. The gain/drain energy setup and large character cast provides every player the option to construct the party the way they enjoy playing. Some of the talents also allow direct manipulation of leveling and experience gain which lets you further customize characters to have different strengths as well as being deceivingly tough for their level.There are a few texture and graphical bugs currently but nothing game halting.At the end of the day, it is a must buy if you are fan of turn-based RPG's in general.

												I really want to like this game, but at the time of the review, I really can't recommend this game. The main problem is how unintuitive the control scheme is. While the characters are interesting, and the humor is good, I just can't get past the controls. The fact is for many games that are similar to this, the optimal control scheme is to use the arrow keys for the movement and the Z and X for your cancel and confirm respectively. Here the controls are set up for arrows and movement along with WASD, and for your cancel and confirm it is the J and K keys respectively. Coming from someone that plays a lot of games, this set up for a PC game is atrocious. I would save the money and get this more for either a tablet, or 3DS instead of the steam version.			"

I looked for a solution online but I couldn't find anything, so I put the game aside. Now I installed again, since I saw a patch update. I can finally save now, but 4 hours in the game and everytime I try to go up the map from the beach area I crash. I once again went online to find a solution and there was a developer post saying to email him a file from the game... wtf. Just patch the game correctly. Apparently people are complaining it crashes on PS4 and 3DS also, so I'm not even gonna risk my money on those version.Seems like a cool game, but too many crashes and unsuccessful updates.			"

The world is stuffed full of things to do and interact with. I haven't finished Citizens of Earth yet, but I only put it down when I must go to bed.

												Let me start with what I enjoy about this game:1) Great graphics, the drawings are a lot of fun2) Great story (so far)3) Love the VP, he's hilarious4) Battle system is pretty good, not fantastic5) Companion system is funThe problems:1) My game seems to be bugged out and I can't get the ""Special Brew"" to drop from the Decaffitators like shown in the guides and LP videos - I've killed them for about 2 hours now with no drop and I can't move forward in the story.2) Game seems to crash every now and again when loading from zone to zone.  This is annoying but fortunately the autosave function occurs when you zone so it hasn't been a huge issue3) Combat gets repetitive, and there are WAY too many mobs put on the field.  I like that you can choose to enter battle by avoiding creatures but in some places they're packed so densely that you have to go through a LOT of battles to move forward a small amount4) The menu screen UI is pretty shoddy, requires a TON of moving the cursor to get things done in talents/items/etcI'm enjoying the game and I would have recommended, but being apparently stuck on the story quest due to a bug (or an insanely low drop rate effectively making this ridiculous) pretty much ruined it for me.Edit:  I seem to have bypassed the bug and managed to continue with the story.  The bug prevented me from obtaining the Barista companion and I can no longer get the special brew.  No longer game breaking, just frustrating.Edit 2: Thanks dev - I actually read online that it was supposed to sell it to you but that never happened, and when I killed my first decaffinator I randomly got the secret brew immediately after that battle (and the same thing happened in the youtube vid I saw) so I assumed that was a typo.  Unfortunately the game crashed right after that so I lost the secret brew, so I tried killing another few hundred decaffinators.  I appreciate you responding to clear it up though.			"

												I have played this game to its full extent in terms of getting all achievements. Differences between this verion and playstation version.Playstation version 10 trophiesPC has 50 achievables. Pros:This game as intended is very reminisent of Earthbound.  With lovable characters that all have their own play style you are able to get some great combos going. Each main character has great voice acting.This game is very customisable as through the aquisition of characters you gain the ability to alter difficulty game speed and other nice features. The difficulty is not somehting to be laughed at, you can really amp it up we are talking from light difficulty ludicrous difficulty. You can even skip through dialoge. The art style is cute and the creatures you face have puns in their names.Cons:Being an early access game there are a few crashes, but its auto save backup can be used to recover its self with no problem.some small graphical issues can be seen in the tiling, nothing to bad though.Personal oppinion. I like this game, it was fun and delightfull and the acheivements while not that hard to get can take a little time but not too much, with one being get every character to over lvl 30 i upped the game speed up to 1.5 to insta kill sharks and used my gamble winning to pay the teacher to level up my other characters.I give it a solid 8/10 I had a great time and had a few laughs. The crashes were a bit annoying sometimes 1 happened after the first boss battle and I had to re do it which was not hard but cutscene. Which is not to bad as you can skip over text with its fast forward function.Finished it in 40 hours and at its price of 15 bucks it was basicly paying 2:60 an hour for entertainment which is fine in my books.

												Finally an RPG that is unique in a genre that is full of the same old stuff over and over again. All the special moves are fun and creative instead of the boring, overdone magic/spell abilities that every RPG ever made has. It reminds me of Earthbound and it is every bit as fun. There is no way a true fan of RPG's will not like this game. I have played 100's of RPG's and I would like to commend the team behind this game on a job well done. I supported the Kickstarter project that failed, and I am thrilled to see the game finally here. I wish there were two thumbs up for special games like this one.			"

												This game is playable.  The music is disappointing.  Battles are fun and have a lot going on, but because you are forced to wait several seconds for the VP to comment on every action you take, they quickly grow into a thing you despise. 40 characters is too many especially when many of them have little to no value.  The game crashes every few hours for no reason at all.  There are a great deal of graphical glitches.  Sometimes your character skips about on the screen.  Occasionally sprites or walls will be replaced by black shapes.  The dialogue is rather entertaining.  I would have played it through to the end if I hadn't lost four hours of gameplay due to a crash.  The game does autosave constantly, but I had forgotten about the crash when I pulled it back up the next day and I loaded my manual save.  The autosave was overwritten and I was rather upset when I realized what I had done.  Normally with games like this, I would suck it up and play through the stuff I had lost, but this game did not warrant it.  Maybe I will pick it up again when some kinks are worked out.			"

												There's a lot of good ideas in Citizens of Earth and because of my nostalgia I'm likely to try keeping at it until I finish it, but the incredible lack of polish and gamebreaking bugs (as well as simply gamebreaking) can cause some serious issues. The game has crashed out on me countless times already.Most recently was when I was trying to exploit the VR arena to power level a bit. There are some monsters in the game that don't actually attack and will summon an add every round and...that's it. So I summoned a full part of just those monsters and spammed aoe. In one battle I was able to get around 400 xp (at 2x xp) with minimal effort. That wasn't the problem exactly though--exploits like these are in genre and perfectly nostalgic.The problem was when the game summoned a monster a bit farther to the left than the game typically allows after I had killed a few of the adds. When I put in through my attacks, the game closed itself out.This was hardly the first time either. The game seemingly closed itself on multiple times with no readily apparent reason. There was a recent patch but this latest crash happened after it. The other crashes--I don't know if they've been fixed. Or what's been fixed. The update doesn't really say what it did.Combat isn't easy or anything but it is kind of...dull. Your good abilities require energy and it is balanced, of course, but the damage you do with your generators is often laughable and with a game as many encounters as there are here--whether just to level up or simply because you can't avoid them--it can be a bit rough. The real problem is that you can't speed through some combat messages. The 'item get' screen after beating an enemy is particularly egregious, not letting you click past it for several seconds which feel a lot longer.The humor at the expense of politicians gets some chuckles but is it really Earthbound humor? The big thing about Earthbound was that it was actually kind of dark at times and more importantly had a lot of heart, heart you could see right at the start. While I haven't reached the end of the game by this time in the review, I don't really feel like it has the kind of heart that made Earthbound so wonderful and that's a big problem when you're claiming it as an inspiration even if it's not meant to be a ripoff.That being said, a game willing to try some neat mechanics or unusual story--which, okay, I don't know of many rpgs that have me as the vice president--are worth checking out on its own merits  and I certainly feel like an rpg fan could do a lot worse--particularly if they fix the crashes and bugs.(kinda ironic that a bug spawning seems to have been cause for my recnet crash).Oh, and uh--when I load up the game, the options scream on pc before getting in is just kinda ugly you know?

												Finally an RPG that is unique in a genre that is full of the same old stuff over and over again. All the special moves are fun and creative instead of the boring, overdone magic/spell abilities that every RPG ever made has. It reminds me of Earthbound and it is every bit as fun. There is no way a true fan of RPG's will not like this game. I have played 100's of RPG's and I would like to commend the team behind this game on a job well done. I supported the Kickstarter project that failed, and I am thrilled to see the game finally here. I wish there were two thumbs up for special games like this one.			"

												This game is playable.  The music is disappointing.  Battles are fun and have a lot going on, but because you are forced to wait several seconds for the VP to comment on every action you take, they quickly grow into a thing you despise. 40 characters is too many especially when many of them have little to no value.  The game crashes every few hours for no reason at all.  There are a great deal of graphical glitches.  Sometimes your character skips about on the screen.  Occasionally sprites or walls will be replaced by black shapes.  The dialogue is rather entertaining.  I would have played it through to the end if I hadn't lost four hours of gameplay due to a crash.  The game does autosave constantly, but I had forgotten about the crash when I pulled it back up the next day and I loaded my manual save.  The autosave was overwritten and I was rather upset when I realized what I had done.  Normally with games like this, I would suck it up and play through the stuff I had lost, but this game did not warrant it.  Maybe I will pick it up again when some kinks are worked out.			"

												I have played this game to its full extent in terms of getting all achievements. Differences between this verion and playstation version.Playstation version 10 trophiesPC has 50 achievables. Pros:This game as intended is very reminisent of Earthbound.  With lovable characters that all have their own play style you are able to get some great combos going. Each main character has great voice acting.This game is very customisable as through the aquisition of characters you gain the ability to alter difficulty game speed and other nice features. The difficulty is not somehting to be laughed at, you can really amp it up we are talking from light difficulty ludicrous difficulty. You can even skip through dialoge. The art style is cute and the creatures you face have puns in their names.Cons:Being an early access game there are a few crashes, but its auto save backup can be used to recover its self with no problem.some small graphical issues can be seen in the tiling, nothing to bad though.Personal oppinion. I like this game, it was fun and delightfull and the acheivements while not that hard to get can take a little time but not too much, with one being get every character to over lvl 30 i upped the game speed up to 1.5 to insta kill sharks and used my gamble winning to pay the teacher to level up my other characters.I give it a solid 8/10 I had a great time and had a few laughs. The crashes were a bit annoying sometimes 1 happened after the first boss battle and I had to re do it which was not hard but cutscene. Which is not to bad as you can skip over text with its fast forward function.Finished it in 40 hours and at its price of 15 bucks it was basicly paying 2:60 an hour for entertainment which is fine in my books.

												There's a lot of good ideas in Citizens of Earth and because of my nostalgia I'm likely to try keeping at it until I finish it, but the incredible lack of polish and gamebreaking bugs (as well as simply gamebreaking) can cause some serious issues. The game has crashed out on me countless times already.Most recently was when I was trying to exploit the VR arena to power level a bit. There are some monsters in the game that don't actually attack and will summon an add every round and...that's it. So I summoned a full part of just those monsters and spammed aoe. In one battle I was able to get around 400 xp (at 2x xp) with minimal effort. That wasn't the problem exactly though--exploits like these are in genre and perfectly nostalgic.The problem was when the game summoned a monster a bit farther to the left than the game typically allows after I had killed a few of the adds. When I put in through my attacks, the game closed itself out.This was hardly the first time either. The game seemingly closed itself on multiple times with no readily apparent reason. There was a recent patch but this latest crash happened after it. The other crashes--I don't know if they've been fixed. Or what's been fixed. The update doesn't really say what it did.Combat isn't easy or anything but it is kind of...dull. Your good abilities require energy and it is balanced, of course, but the damage you do with your generators is often laughable and with a game as many encounters as there are here--whether just to level up or simply because you can't avoid them--it can be a bit rough. The real problem is that you can't speed through some combat messages. The 'item get' screen after beating an enemy is particularly egregious, not letting you click past it for several seconds which feel a lot longer.The humor at the expense of politicians gets some chuckles but is it really Earthbound humor? The big thing about Earthbound was that it was actually kind of dark at times and more importantly had a lot of heart, heart you could see right at the start. While I haven't reached the end of the game by this time in the review, I don't really feel like it has the kind of heart that made Earthbound so wonderful and that's a big problem when you're claiming it as an inspiration even if it's not meant to be a ripoff.That being said, a game willing to try some neat mechanics or unusual story--which, okay, I don't know of many rpgs that have me as the vice president--are worth checking out on its own merits  and I certainly feel like an rpg fan could do a lot worse--particularly if they fix the crashes and bugs.(kinda ironic that a bug spawning seems to have been cause for my recnet crash).Oh, and uh--when I load up the game, the options scream on pc before getting in is just kinda ugly you know?

												At first it looks a lot and feels a lot like Earthbound.  But get that out of your head, it's a completely different game.  In this game you recruit various professionals, blue collar workers, and public servants to fight evil.  You can control 3 people at a time and can recruit about 40 different people.  About half of the game is just completing missions to recruit people.  The main story line is actually quite short, but given how many side quests are in this game, you won't care.			"

												A Shiny Gem Among a Pile of Matte BaublesTo preface my positive comments, I'll mention some minor issues. After playing the ""tweak RadeonPro/try different resolutions"" game, I finally brought the game up to a playable level. Initially I had issues with crashes, lag and menus not showing. However, I was never able to get rid of the lines that you can see in the character models, battle backgrounds and occasionally on the world screen walking around. The reason I put up with it is because this game is awesome and it kind of reminds me of the grid lines in the battles in Phantasy Star II.I love Citizens of Earth and can highly recommend it for $14.99 (even though I got it on summer sale at $7.99.) The Mother/Earthbound comparisons are going to be inevitable in every review. It has the same kind of dream logic meets modern-day satire RPG feel that all the Mother games had. There is a reference on a police computer (APB for a spiteful boy with a cracked bat, I believe) and is referential in general gameplay. It may have even more of an open world than Earthbound. After the initial chapters, you can pretty much go where you want in any direction. It also has multiple traveling methods from helicopter to even sleep-walking.This sandbox of fun is what makes it stand above all other ""indie RPG"" or RPG-maker games. There's a level of detail to the gameplay that is unmatched by its peers. The game has a lot of ground to cover, and many things to do on the way. Every one of the 40 recruitable characters has a Talent. This could be ordering stuff from Fed-Ups and having it delivered to you after a certain amount of time. Different items take longer or shorter time to deliver. Or maybe you want to do some inventive farming and craft items. You can move blockage from your path with the Bodybuilder (feel free to call him Manwich like I did.)  The Programmer can enter the internet matrix to fight viruses, and while you're at a computer, you can arrange and fight VR battles to grind levels for your party. You can also travel between computers with the matrix.And you will be grinding. You can use the school function to have your characters gain levels while outside the battle party, but what fun is that? Also, they don't get the additional stat boosts characters can get depending on who they fight with in the battle party! I didn't mind grinding at all, I always had fun getting a new low-level character and grinding him up with some powerful guys doing most of the heavy lifting. The individuality in the recruits is amazing, every one has a widely varied set of moves and play styles. Some characters go together like peanut butter and jelly, like the Barista with her high levels of energy, and the Musician who can steal it from her and use the energy for multiple-turn blasts of either healing or enemy party damage. I imagine the minds at Eden Industries pored over the battles system and character sheets for a long time, making sure each ability mattered and each character felt unique.The humor is satirical, and aimed at the politically correct sometimes, at the vapid candidates that run for office other times. Kicking the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of protesters is fun. A scarecrow comprised of several crows is delightful. I felt no remorse murdering child campers in the woods of Camp Koo Koo. They were full of sugar and coming right at me! I had to fight back! It turns out a corporate robot candy executive was responsible for that anyway, so my hands are clean.If you are like me and find modern RPGs way too easy, this has an option to change the difficulty via the School Mascot's Talent. I wish the game would save these changes but it resets when you load a save file. I suggest cranking it to 1.40 for most of the game, and then up to 2.00 occasionally for the 2x Talent XP. Be warned though, it can be tough at 2.00, but it doesn't matter anyway because as far as I can tell there's no penalty for dying. If you are back in a starting area you can put it beyond 2.00 to make the enemies a decent challenge. Why anyone would LOWER the game's difficulty is beyond my comprehension, but you can if you want to.This not an Earthbound clone. It is an Earthbound Expander of Greatness: Deluxe Mother Meets Suikoden (♥♥♥♥ POKEMON) Edition!Buy it now or burn in hell for all eternity!8.5 / 10			"

												This is a game with classic JRPG charm, a ton of influences from games like Earthbound(which is always welcome), and a light hearted comedic tone that reflects on(and sort of embraces while picking fun at) culture in general. I love the fact that the politicians are completely useless, but the citizens are all awesome and unqiue( just like in real ife ;)  ).The great thing about this too is that you can play it in spurts or in a marathon depending on your mood. It doesn't force you into a corner with that. Favorite Music Track: Boss Battle "

												If you're at all a fan of traditional turn-based (J)RPGs, this game is a treat. You explore a large world, completing various sidequests to recruit a wide array of NPCs as permanent party members.The humor is there, but it's not enough to carry the game on its own. This is a game that you should only play if the mechanics interest you. The story is virtually nonexistent.The turn-based mechanics are top-notch. Rather than shooting spells out of a massive pool of MP, your characters all have a small energy stat, with 5 or less points (average is 2-3). Weak attacks raise your energy, and strong ones spend it. This gives the developers a lot of room to make each character different. A chef will use powerful fire attacks, but lack useful weak moves. Combo him with a barrista who can charge up your other members' energy, and you've got synergy.The mechanics dare you to find powerful synergies between the abilities of the massive cast of recruitable characters, posing an engaging challenge to a keen RPG buff. The energy system keeps you from becoming complacent in random battles, where you still have to pay attention to what you're doing. With the most strategic turn-based RPG system I've seen (and I'm a huge fan of the SMT series), I'd recommend this for any fan of these games.			"

A very good RPG game with many interesting game mechanics. RPG fans won't be disappointed.The most exciting part of the game that I really enjoy was tried to find and recruit all the citizens. Each of them has their own unique ability and talent, such as if you're hiring an Architect, she can build bridges to allow you to gain access to new areas, or you can adjust the time day/night with the Scientist, and there are 40 citizens in the game. 40 citizens!!

												Very fun game. If it looks appealing to you then you should get it. Pros:Collect lots of cool, funny citizens with different damage types. Figure out which citizens combo well together and you will have a blast leveling up your favorites. Funny enemies and a very cute story.  Fantastic artwork. Everything in the game is so alive and it was always enjoyable to see the next enemy or citizen. Lots of secondary quests/ treasure to keep you busy and encourage exploration. Enemies run away in fear from you once you complete the zone objective.Cons: Some areas have an unnecessary amount of enemies. In a game that you can change the difficulty at will it seemed annoying that some zones take you an hour to get from side to side due to the sheer density of enemies. Glitchy, still sometimes crashes out but it's much more stable than it used to be.Battle music gets repetitive, you can change the overworld music at will though. Quest log lacks a lot of information. Sometimes it just gives a vague few words and if you wern't paying attention earlier you will not be able to remember what you are doing.A huge amount of quests at all times. It felt overwhelming at the start. I think when I played I had maybe 40 quests going on at once. It's good to have content but maybe have some of it locked until later chapters next time.No access to an overall map. There were so many times I was playing this game and I had no idea which direction a zone was in. At best you can see a map for the area you are in. You also can not access the map while in a vehicle, minor complaint. Extra thoughts: I hope they make a sequel and expand upon the concepts of this game. Actual multiple citizen combos would be amazing. They could also re-design/remove some of the useless citizens or design encounters around their skill sets. Overall though I had a lot of fun playing it and hope to see more from them in the future.			"

												This is not a bad game if you like older style RPGs, meaning lots of constant fights. Theres a lot of different characters you can recruit which is the main strong point of the game. Alot of the characters when you go to recruit them youll have to play a mini game and some of the mini games even if not required it definitely helps to use another party members special ability to beat them. I cant say more than that without spoilers about some of the characters.The humor in the game is pretty cheesy as you can probably expect but i think thats what they were going for. Theres voice overs on some parts of the dialogue and others it will just have a sound effect and then some text, which is fine in the context of the game it seems to work. Most of the major story events are fully voiced. There is some crashing in the game but the patch seems to have fixed 95% of it and its perfectly playable now. All in all its not a bad game its just after beating it i felt like the main storyline was really lacking. I spent the majority of the game a little over 20 + hours collecting party members and leveling them up, only to get to the end of the game and wonder why id even did it lol, as it doesnt seem like there was really much point other than getting through the constant battles in the rest of the game. It has its flaws and its not a perfect game but for the price or if you can get it on sale id pick it up you might have some fun with it if you dont get too caught up in the details.			"

												The game is not bad. The gameplay is basically Earthbound with a story involving you as the Vice President of Earth trying to save the planet. It takes about 15 to 20 hours to get through the game, and then you will have to grind for several monotonous hours if you want to get all of the achievements.Several factors that lead me to give this a negative review:1. The game crashes sometimes (not too often, but even once is annoying in an RPG as it then forces you to save every few minutes out of fear) and there is horrible screen tearing/flickering in some areas of the game. Screen issues can be reduced (but could not be fully alleviated on my machine) by lowering the resolution of the game, but that shouldn't have to be necessary. There are also other random bugs, such as an issue with receiving Group EXP at the end of some fights.2. After the beginning, the game slows down, forcing lots of walking and unavoidable fights which start to become annoying. In addition, there is no way to skip animations and speed up fights like in other games, which doesn't help. This is especially cumbersome when you are achievement-hunting after beating the game.3. There is no difficulty with the game; I personally never used an item the entire game and I also never lost a fight. This is amplified through a ""feature"" associated with one of the characters in the game, which allows you to create virtually invincible characters with minimal work. For reference, after spending about an hour utilizing this method midway through the game, I ended up being able to one-shot the final boss when I reached him ... and this method is blatantly obvious. I have no idea why this character was thought to be a necessary addition to the game.4. I also found personally some of the ""stereotypes"" that they make fun of to be a bit tasteless. For example, the ""Sushi Chef"" character that says ""at least I died with honor"" in an awkward English when he dies in a battle was not my cup of tea, although perhaps that is the humor one must appreciate for this game.Overall, while I do not think this game is particularly that bad, there are enough negative elements that I am drawn to giving a ""No Recommendation"", especially at its price. I would recommend acquiring it through a sale or a Humble Bundle if you choose to purchase it.			"

												Fans of turn-based RPGs absolutely have to own this. If you ever enjoyed games like Earthbound, Dragon Quest, or Final Fantasy, you'll be hooked immediately. Citizens of Earth follows the exploits of the Vice President of Earth as he's thrown into a leadership role he was never prepared (or qualified) for: saving the entire planet from rampaging monstrosities. He never fights himself, though; that's what the citizens are for, all 40 recruitable ones. Along with the humorous story and wide cast of possible party members, there are a ton of quests and hidden things to keep you busy as you unravel the mystery of who or what caused the crisis threatening the planet. I played this game with my wife, and we both had a fun time trying new combinations of characters and enjoying the light-hearted story. At 15 dollars it's a steal.			"

Earthbound meets Suikoden for a hi-res adventure full of pop, colour, visual polish and charming humor with a cast of voice acting heavyweights and a nifty battle system. Worth a pop. Do force Vsync on as there's no need for reactive inputs and it suffers massively with screen tearing.			"

												This has all the makings for a very memorable RPG. Like LISA, ""collecting"" companions is a key element here. A top-down, polished RPG featuring some great voice acting and a quirky cast of characters. The hero is original, as is his relationship with his mother. The battle mechanics are very similar to Earthbound and the music isn't some mess of recycled JRPG garbage. The soundtrack is adventurous and reminds me of Donkey Kong Country/ Character design and animations make this a better standalone game than some big budget titles. It's easy to see the love put into this game by it's developers and the art team. There are many aspects of this title to admire, but the bottom line is that it deserves to be played. Get your feet wet. Vice President of the world looks good on you.			"

												I enjoyed this one!  I did not have terribly high expectations...at a glance this seems like an RPG maker with a sense of humor.  But they have definitely gone above and beyond that.  The atmosphere, characters, and music have a up beat 90s retro feel.  The variety of characters you will encounter will inspire you to create your own battle plans and strategies.  There is truley no ""best"" option for this game.  I found it fun to collect the various citizens to join my Vice President.Overall, I can definitely see the similarities between this and the Earthbound series.  Quirkly enemies and gameplay make for an enjoyable experience!			"

												I liked the concept of the game.  It looked fun, and after playing it I agree that it is indeed funny.  But I ran into some unnecessary technical difficulties.  THe developer says it's caused by big picture mode, but that hasn’t been my experience.ProsUnique concept for a game.Good humor, the game is funny.Cons The game is locked to 60 fps, not a big deal in this genre.While running in Steam Big Picture mode with the steam controller every movement input is marked as two inputs.  This makes the menus impossible to navigate.  The developer thinks it’s caused by Big Picture mode, but the game does this even if you launch it from the desktop mode of Steam. Further, xBox 360 users are reporting the issue too.  The developer says there is probably nothing they can do.The problem is worse because the game won’t let you switch between controller and mouse+kb.  Once the game detects the controller it disables your mouse.The game is crashing in big picture mode. "

												This game is fun at first but you'll learn soon enough that it lacks polish. While there is much love for detail, it doesn't make up for the bad gameplay. You have to do a lot of grinding. And if I say a lot, I mean a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of it. That is extremely annoying as it's an artificial way to stretch out playtime. If you however are kind of masochistic and are into dull grinding, go for it. The rest of the game is at least decent.			"

												Fantastic RPG that has been strongly influenced by Earthbound, but in a good way. A lot of customization and mechanics here, to play the way you want to play. Lots of characters, lots of side quests from what it looks. Fantastic story, honestly, this game is already a GOTY candidate to me. Yes, it's that good. The only thing that it lacks is music, but it makes for it in the sheer gameplay.For more information, more first impressions and gameplay footage here:

												I decided to rewrite my review now that I have spent more time with the game and actually have the time to write something a bit more decent.  Since this is Steam I'll leave you with some quick bullet points.Pros:-Excellent art style.  Obviously inspired by Earthbound but still manages to be it's own thing.-Expansive cast of playable characters with varying abilities and play styles that begs experimentation.-The voice acting is suitably cheesy.-Combat system is solid and well thought out without being overly complicated.Cons:-Some recruitment minigames are more tedious then challenging.  I particularly hated the Musicians.-The humor falls flat more often then it should tarnishing the game's charm.-Default difficulty is so far to easy, BUT this can be changed.-Some enemies are tedious to fight without offering challenge.I will probably expand this after I complete the game and see more of the main plot and can gauge the overall length of game which are the two final deciding factors for a real review.  In short however if this game interests you, then I suggest giving the developer some money, you will likely enjoy what you get and the cost is pretty low.  I wouldn't say this game is for everyone but I am definitely having more fun playing this then I have 80% of the other low budget RPG Maker games.			"

												[s]Can't believe I paid $7 for this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Battle is simple but complicated. Yeah, that confused you and me. The world is huge. Maybe bigger than South Park: The Stick of Truth, which sucks because SPTSOT was $60 compared to this $7♥♥♥♥♥♥ Not to mention the content. SPTSOT has tiny amount of contents and replayability compared to CoE. That's what pessimists(realists*) would say.The optimists(and realists) would say ""CoE has more amount of content and replayability than SPTSOT.""Dialogues are funny not because they are funny, but because every character is a stereotype. You might find Nicki Minaj from one of them. deymLevel up system is a bit complicated for noobs because of the different bonuses given depending on who are in your party when one of your characters leveled up. Mind = blown...Performance is a stable 60fps. I expected an eye-gouging 120+fps but well, meh. I had 1 crash during my 10-hour playthrough and that was when I entered a graphically-abused sandstorm map, after I left the game while multitasking for about 30 minutes or so. tsk tskAnd they freaking lied about the ""Partial Controller Support"". I uncovered the lie when I used a Logitech F310 so I found out that it should be ""Full and Partial Controller Support"" or simply ""Full Controller Support. *sigh*[/s]P.S.I haven't played SPTSOT for more than an hour using a, you know, ""free"" distributable copy. *wink* *wink* So, why am I even comparing CoE to that game? /facepalm			"

												So, it wasn't worth the wait, it wasn't worth the ""hype"" and it wasn't worth the money.It a generic JRPG with a identity crisis. It has some intresting ideas it throws around, but for the most part the game does what is 90% wrong with JRPGS. I am almost positive the biggest driving force behind ANY of it's sales is that it made an attempt to identify with Earthbound, which to be honest is ridiculous. It lacks the art, humor and soul of Earthbound. The game substitutes any sort of meaningful character progression by having 40-ish party members, none of them being interesting, meaningful or deep. All of the character abilities and commands are just re-hases of other ones under different names. Don't even get me started about the gear and equipment system which is obviously implemented to increase gameplay time, not enchance gameplay. The developers should be ashamed. Just terrible. I really wantred to like it, but to be honest the ONLY reason why I wanted to like it was because of the Earthbound name drops. Outside of this, the game isn't special, it isn't unique and honestly it's not good.			"

												Do you like Earthbound?Who am I kidding, you probably do. Citizens of Earth is a fantastic RPG akin to old console RPGs, but it has very crisp modern graphics with full voice acting and a wonderful Animal Crossing-mixed-with-Mother soundtrack. The gameplay is challenging and the multitude of voiced characters that you get to name yourself adds a ton of further charm.It's actually quite nicely done in that you can wander around X amount of areas you've unlocked and interact with things, but the added night/day system with weather isn't entirely cosmetic which is a neat addition as well. But I cannot praise this game's similarities to Earthbound enough, even the battle system uses strange psychadelic patterns and the enemies are rather imaginative. Its similarities aren't exactly a bad thing, though, and the humor of the game is quite nicely implemented into standard dialogue and combat -- it's even better if you name your characters.			"

												What an amazing game! Nearly everything about this game is perfect! Heres why.First, sound. Music is outstanding, but, mostly reused. Boss battles use this music, Even the final boss. All the voice actors are great. Mostly, the partners you choose won't have much to say in any random even that doesn't directly affect them. The usually have a set phrase or sound that'll play instead of reading off the words. I assume this was to save time and cost so that every actor did not have to have lines for every single event in the game.Second, gameplay. Gameplay is a turn based RPG and runs basicly like this. One, you have attacks that build up energy (ammount varies to character) and attacks that use up energy that are mostly more powerful. Two, attacks can have certain types, like heat, water, electric. Most (I assume all) enemies and partners have strenths and weakness to these types. Think Pokemon. Third, characters can have diverse abilities. Some are healers, disrupters, high damage, supportive and even can have multiple uses. So a strategy can depend on who you recruit. Fourth, there are statis effects and stats. Things like confusion and attack power or special attack power. Last, items, equptment etc. can affect what your character will do in certain parts of battle. Maybe a critical hit will heal damage or maybe all attacks physical attacks are heat attacks. There is no charater tree so it just depends on what charaters you want to train.Lastly, lenth. I played this game for 16 hours. I collected half of the citizen and got lost a few times. Generally, if you can find your way around easy and don't collect many citizens to fight with you, I highly recommend you get at least half since every citizen has abilities that can be used to interact with the world, it will take around 8-10 hours. Collecting everything with minimal retry will be around 15-20 hours.Overall, I recommend this game at any price. If it goes on sale for 50% or more, it is a STEAL! If you love RPG games with entertaining charaters, well designed worlds and fun story, get this NOW!BECOME VP OF THE WORLD!			"

												This is a 2D j-rpg where you have to recruit your party along various npc. all the characters have their own unique abilities, strenghts and flaws. the game itself is really good overall, good gameplay, nice graphic and style, funny dialogues good sound. there're some flaws however: the combat system is not so deep and once you have leveled up your favourite characters all the fights become similar (a series of attack-attack-attack), you can change difficulty to spice things up but then they become quite tedious since they're a lot. also, the feature tracker is not that good and often confuses the player. the main quest can keep you busy for at least 20 hours, while you'll need at least 30 to get to 100%.I definitely recommend this.

												This is a good game if you can tolerate the political rib jabbing and cliches.It plays well and the gameplay makes sense. It is basically an RPG with turn based combat.A couple notes:Because of the fact that the player moves around several characters there is the real possibility of getting stuck in a corner. It has happened to me. I lost the guide to the main game story line at one point. Got it back later. This issue is not unique. I've seen other games with this issue. Sacred 2 comes to mind. Unlike Sacred 2 I can't recall any crashing on this game.I did have what I thought was a crash but apparently it wasn't. Not good.I'm a little critical of mission direction system. It seems to like it points multiple directions for the same mission.There is some #$%$%#$#$$%#$ mind reading. But it is not too bad.			"

												I was actually pleasantly surprised by this game being good.Heavily inspired by Earthbound but not being the same game.Lots of citizens to recruit and it's fun (for the most part).You can make it as hard or as easy as you want.It looks like a flash game but it's actually pretty charming.

												This game was a tough one to give a positive review for.  Ideally I'd give an ""eh"" or neutral rating.  The game is an homage to Earthbound from the Super Nintendo, with a turn based battle system and even battle background reminiscent of that.  Unlike Earthbound this game distinquishes itself with the titular ""citizens"",  40 recruitable party members who all have different talents that open up areas of the world or changes to the gameplay.  There's a character who can speed up or slow down the game, change the time, allow you to fight any monster/boss you fought previously, etc.  Some of the later recruitable characters actually make the game a lot more enjoyable with their quality of life improvements.  Fast forward in particular is a must.Now why I didn't enjoy the game as much as I could've.  While the battle system was fun, too many enemies had no elemental weaknesses or resistances, so I ended up with a solid team I kept for most of the game.  Ideally each of those 40 characters would have a specific role in combat where you'd want to switch between them.  Instead several characters felt very weak in combat, and leveling up their talents was a bit of a pain.The game also suffers from a very bad map.  You can pull up a nice map of the area you're in, which even shows treasure items and recruitable characters and sidequests.  The downside is you can't see anything beyond that area.  No overworld map.  The most you get is arrows at the exits of areas indicating quests or characters exist beyond that border.  It was very difficult and the backtracking very tedious to get around simply because I wasn't sure where areas were.  Several characters enable fast travel and shortcuts that help, but at the end of the day getting from one end of the world to another was still more tedious than it needed to be.The story was also weak.  There's a funny moment or two, but for the most part the story felt like a bunch of ""go here, do this"" quests in order to keep you moving around the world.  At the end of the day the story can almost be summed up in a couple of sentences.Lastly, and perhaps most importantly: the game likes to crash when loading new areas.  Thankfully the game autosaves every time you leave a room, so most of the time I only lost a few seconds to a few minutes progress.  Some of the later areas are big though and I did lose at least half an hour in one area.  It happened maybe a dozen times in the 27 hours it took to 100% the game for me, so it wasn't the end of the world, but certainly not something I'm accustomed to seeing this day and age.Why the positive review after all the complaining?  Because at the end of the day I don't regret buying or playing the game.  If you liked Earthbound you'll enjoy the mechanics of this game, and with a googled world map you'll have a decent time.  I recommend grabbing it during a high percentage off sale.			"

												TL;DR The game is fun, but from a certain point in the game (about 28 hrs for me) it started crashing every 5 minutes, making it very frustrating to keep playing. I bought it cheaply during a sale so the cost of the game isn't an issue for me, just sucks to have spent 30 hours on a game I can't finish due to bugs...When I first started I really liked this game. Not perfect, but enjoyable. I really liked the cartoony graphics, I really liked that despite the gameplay being simple, the different citizens (party members) really play differently, so it's fun trying to use different teams. The only limitation is that due to lvlup bonus stats based on the other citizens in the team makes certain teams less viable (for example if a ""mage"" gets a bonus to his strength stat because of a certain teammember, it's basically wasted on the mage). But aside from this it's very fun trying out the different teams when you've recruited a fair ammount of citizens. And personally I also just like the idea of recruiting/collecting all the citizens. So for me that's a plus.The story is ok (barely though), it tries to be funny and occasionally it does, but sometimes it just feels too forced. What I dislike the most about the attempted humour is the VP (main character) during battles. Because he often yells the wrong comments during a fight, sometimes I feel like he's trolling me (citizen attacks but it misses the target, VP shouts ""good job""or  ""nice shot"" or something along that line).For an RPG like this that doesn't require quick responses most of the time it's less of a problem than other game types, but the controls are just bad. The keys you use to play the game are in places I don't like (far apart from eachother), and unlike almost any other game in this day and age, you're not allowed to change which keys they are. I honestly can't understand why the developer didn't allow remapping of the keys used. It doesn't make the game unplayable, but it does distract from enjoying the game.There are a lot of areas in the game, and there's a lot of freedom about where to go (but go to the wrong area and the mobs might be too strong and eat you alive). Annoyingly there's no decent world map or something. In the beginning of the game, you meet a lot of citizens telling you to go to a location to get a recruitment quest for them, but as a new player you have no idea how to get there. Eventually you'll get there at some point through storyline or just random exploration, but in the beginning of the game I found it a bit annoying. I wanna catch all the pokemo... uh I mean citizens ASAP, but they're telling me to go to locations I don't know of yet. Sad now.So the main problem with this game (at least for me) and why I gave it a downvote, is that after about 28 hours in the game, I'm assuming about 1/2 to 2/3rd done, the game becomes unplayable because every 5 minutes it gets a bug and shuts down. The first 25 hours or so I never got a crash, but then the crashes came and they became very frequent. Luckily there's a auto-save feature every time you enter/leave a map, so you can restart the game and not lose too much progress, but it gets annoying, very very annoying. I went to the community page for the game in hope to find a cure of this, but most comments were very old. I jumped in on an older topic that seems to be the about same issue (it happened to other people too appearently), and I wrote asking if there was already a fix for these bugs. A month has passed, and still no answer. I'm guessing either the developers stopped taking care of the game/community hub, or they just didn't care enough to respond.So basically, yea I enjoyed the game, and I would've liked to keep playing it, but not when it crashes every 5 minutes. That's why the downvote.			"

												If you love Earthbound, you'll LOVE this game~ Don't worry, it's nothing like earthbound play wise, but it certenly has that feeling and battle. Awesome humor and I still haven't finished it!I've only encountered one bug in the game that made an enemy glitch while running away from me, other then that, nothing serious so far.This game is a must play, so go for it citizen!

												Citizens of EarthAbout The Game: Ever wonder what our politicians do after their campaigns. Well you can follow our great Vice President of Earth around his hometown. Uncovering mysteries surrounding Moonbucks with his brother, and his mother. Of course no self serving politician would get his hands dirty fighting off protestors and hecklers, but his family and followers will do anything that their beloved leader tells them to. All he has to do is point and they charge off into battle. The unique battle system runs on energy orbs. Some skills gain you energy and some stronger skills use them. Getting an ambush attack refills 1 energy at the beginning of the fight, and being surprised takes one away. If you get an ambush on an enemy that is below your level there is a chance you will defeat them without going into battle. Leveling up grants bonus stat bonuses depending on who is in the party at the time. Equipment seems to be in the form of accessories that are unique to each character, granting them special bonuses.Pantsu's Rating (out of 5)Graphics: 3.5 Clean cartoony graphics fit well in the world, but the background of the battles looks like an acid trip.Playability: 3.5 Easy controls that seems to favor controler use but doesn't hinder keyboard/mouse use. Fun: 4 A comical, political, RPG that strays from the normal swords and monsters theme that you usually see. Sound: 4 Great music and good sound effects. The VP's comments during battle get repetitive. Some of the dialog is voice acted which is always great. Replay Value: 3 The only reason I can see to replay this game is to develop characters in different parties for different stat boosts. Final Score: 3.5 Final Thought: At $14.99 it is worth waiting for a sale. Extra: In the posted video I named the VP Dump (Trump), his brother Pants (Pence), and the baker G Hamsey (Gordon Ramsey).
