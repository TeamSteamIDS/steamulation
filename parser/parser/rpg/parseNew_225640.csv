												Personal opinion: Get this game instead of Sacred 3 if you're looking for an Action RPG!My first impression playing this game back in 2010 was pretty special. I started a Dryad (hey, they looked hot and I love Druids) and watched the fairly epic cinematic, after which I was placed on a beach with a kind of a mentor beside me. I guess the gods didn't smile upon him on that day though, because somehow I ended up having to tutor myself. First thing I noticed when gaining control was the graphics. One word. Wow. They are incredible, and the attention to detail is pretty much un-parallelled. Leaves being side swept, a little bird making his nest - hundreds of small things that leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling inside. Even now in 2014, it still looks great.I still have that Dryad - but I specced her so badly that she is broken beyond repair. I highly recommend using the Sacred 2 Wiki for help with builds. There is no respec option, and if you find yourself wanting to play it all the way to Niob, your spec pretty much needs to be perfect.The sound is good as well, although the voice acting is bad. Not terribad but bad enough that you treasure the fact that only the main quests have voiced dialogue. Moving on; most of the classes in the game are innovative and fresh. Whoever saw an ancient Egyptian-inspired Anubis-like robot thingie before as a class? Packing an alien blaster along with his hammer no less. Very fresh, very fun. You diversify a bit by choosing a god and one of two campaigns (good or evil), which adds a good deal of replayability. Rather annoyed by the fact that you can't select gender for the classes though. Some years ago I never touched any female class, for some reason. Thankfully I outgrew it, or I would have missed out on half of this game.The story is fairly weak, but the focus doesn't really lie there either, as it gives you hundreds of side quests left and right. In fact there are so many, I find myself skipping half of them. Many of them are kind of like MMO quests in a sense. Very generic; a silly story behind it and mediocre rewards. But it works, somehow. In one early side quest though, you are pitted against the game's first boss. This was a pleasant surprise - as once you engage a boss monster, the camera centers on the boss and the game spits out some cool music. He took a serious pounding too, so it was a good moment.The map is gigantic; as far as I know it has the biggest world in an action RPG, ever. I have still not explored everything after well over 100 hours of play (played it on a disc version most of the time), and there are several optional bosses where you can see how good (or bad) your build is. Bosses can be incredibly punishing, but they are also a lot of fun. Keep your thumb on the spacebar.The difficulty level when playing Bronze is extremely easy the first 2-3 hours. I considered re-starting several times and selecting Silver instead. But it's gotten more challenging. This really depends on the class and spec you want to play. I have one character in Platinum; a Seraphim, and I still find the class a lot of fun. I have chosen to spec her both with Sword / Shield and Ranged (for BeeEffGee). This'll likely hurt me quite a bit if I reach Niob, but for now it works well. I like being able to change things up now and then.Multiplayer is dead, unfortunately. Seems Ascaron went and got themselves bankrupt, and was forced to shut down their US servers. EU servers still worked when I started playing it back in 2010, but I believe they are shut down as well.All in all though, great game. Sort of a diamond in the rough but if you can see past some bugs, crashes and general hiccups, you may find yourself in love with this game, like me. I've played it for about 120 hours; I am on my third version of the game now, and after experiencing just one in-game crash in 14 hours of playing, I can finally, after many years, recommend this game. On the previous versions it probably crashed between 2-300 times in 100 hours of playing. Since I wrote the review the game has crashed 7 times in 28 hours of play. Still not too bad, considering I've had PhysX enabled all that time.			"

												Sacred 2 is a Diablo-style action RPG set in a truly massive world. Its largest selling point is probably just that – this game is almost excessively huge. Sacred 2 features an incredible world packed with nearly 600 quests and a sprawling map that you’ll be unlikely to have seen even a quarter of in 20 hours. Every building is able to be entered (many with multiple floors), every NPC speaks, and most containers have loot stashed away in them. As typical of the genre, Sacred 2 offers multiple difficulties to unlock for even more replayability.Looting is another huge draw – practically every enemy will drop loot, all with different stats and colorations. If one enemy doesn’t drop anything, you’ll soon have another 10 or more on screen anyway. Monsters, animals, and humanoids alike creep in every corner, waiting to swarm your character. To cope with this, you’re given a wide range of distinctly different player characters, each with an array of different armor, weaponry, special moves, and unique mounts (although all may buy horses as well). Combat is fast, though oftentimes mindless, fun. No matter the character, you’re always open to many ways to play, from magic, to ranged, to multiple forms of melee (sword & shield, dual wielding, axes, clubs, etc.). Your mount, whether unique to your class or a horse, also opens up another combat style with its own unique stats and, for some, attacks. Enemies range from normal humans to mythical beasts such as harpies and werewolves, each with variations in stats, attacks, and appearances, guaranteeing you’ll have plenty of new monsters to slay your entire journey.Sacred 2’s saving grace to the argument of it being “just another clone” is that it’s already fully aware of being a clone filled with various clichés. The game doesn’t take itself seriously; one moment you have men in bunny suits attacking you, another moment you’re fending off mutated sheep who’ve decided you should be food instead. Sacred 2 plays on its light-hearted silliness with quests such as those, jokes galore (cemeteries house plenty in particular), and fourth wall breaking moments – for instance, the Seraphim is fully aware she can’t proceed without the player and will make her grievances known quite vocally if you leave her standing alone for a short while. This both saves it from coming across as a simple clone and gives it plenty of character of its own.It has its flaws, like all games. The biggest irritant might possibly be its camera, which attempts to be both isometric and standard 3rd person at the same time, often leading to it spiraling around awkwardly. Another point to make is not necessarily a flaw, but could be a massive turn off for some: the bright colors, voice acting, and purposeful ridiculousness of Sacred 2 could easily put off someone looking for a serious RPG, or possibly come across as poor quality before it becomes more apparent the game is using its clichés as a joke.Overall, I’d happily recommend it to fans of Diablo style games, particularly those who love to explore, as you’ll have a lot to see, and hours and hours of combat-filled gameplay. Sacred 2 is truly an overlooked gem.			"

												Sacred 2 gold is an amazing game.   If you purchase t his game, you should make sure that you search for, and download the community patch.   You can also download a community addon patch, and there are some other mods out there.   I'd also highly recommend taking a look at the sacred 2 characters, their skills, and possibly  some guides on how to build them.    You can play through with any character in this game, but if you build them wrong, you will pay for it at higher difficulty levels.This is a very good action RPG/Hack N Slash.   It is a huge, beautiful, open ended world.   The graphics are incredible if you turn the settings to maximum.   The world is a living breathing world, like other reviewers have said, there are lots of small things like birds building nests, people talking to each other in towns,  etc in the game that make it feel alive.   If you have a Nvidia card with physx (however it is spelled), leaves will blow around and react to your spells.   This happens in all environments like in dungeons.Ignore the warning about not being optimized for WIndows 7 PCs.   IF you google Sacred 2 crashing windows PC, you'll get a guide on how to create a shortcut that has a few command line options enabled, while also changing the shortcut to run the game in windows xp SP3 compatibility mode.   If you do that you should be fine.   The game also frequently auto saves when you teleport or change areas, so in the even of a crash, just load the game back up and you'll be right where you left off.  If you have played this game on a console and are wondering if its worth purchasing on the PC, the answer is yes.  The expansion pack is included in this PC version, and with the community patch you can unlock Christmas island.   You also get a carrier imp included with the gold package which helps store extra inventory.If you download Tunngle beta (Free) you can play this with your friends CO-Op.   Endless loot, endless enemies, endless hack n slash action RPG adventure goodness.  What are you waiting for! "

												This is my favorite action role playing game! A huge map to explore with various landscapes and many hidden places. There are 7 different classes with different ways to skill. But the most addictive part for me is the hunt for massive loot... set armors, unique weapons and random roled rare items.But its highly recommended to install the latest Community Patch. It brings  more content and is fixing some of never solved bugs by the bankrupt vendor.Negative points are tricky camera handling and the very instable source code. Its often crashes because of memory leak.Multiplayer is only possible with LAN mode. If you want to play online use VPN tools like Tunngle.If you like ARPG's like Diablo combined with a large open world so go for it!8.5 of 10 points!			"

												Longevity. An incredibly huge map, which would take one hours to come close to uncovering, aswell as being a free roaming game(Thus, you won't be confined to a specific route).An excellent variation & customisation in armour and weapons.More than 200 levels for each character to grind, along with skills and attributes that make each and every character Unique. The difficulty level can be raised to such a standard, if one dies, it means you DIE and will not be able to play the character any more.Very unofrgiving, Which makes surviving so incredibly sweet.Overall, 9/10.There's only one thing I don't like about this, Not being able to see more. A limited viewing range. Somewhat of a half arsed camera. Though, That's just me.Anyone else should give this a 10/10.			"

												One of the best RPGs you can get your hands on - it absolutely can compete with genre kings like Diablo II.- Different classes with different play styles and a huge variety of unlockable skills in diversified skill trees - millions of possibilities to level up you char- A beautiful, varying and truely spacious world with an uncountable amount of main and side quests. And easter eggs. And easter egg quests- A story not taking itself too serious, a good sense of humour- Neat graphics and decent soundscape. WoW graphics in 2015 is still stone age compared to Sacred 2 back in 2008- multiplayable! Play cooperatively via the internet thingy, or head over to your partner and revive the good old LAN daysOk, if you havent figured out the resumé yet: Sacred 2's definitely a must-have when it comes to RPGs!

												It finally works on PC !! Whoopee !!!  There are way more to Sacred 2 than ""Hack&Slash"" action/rpg !  When the game first hit the shelves , I bought one copy for PS3, - and I`ve played it for countless hours. Then I bought a copy for PC that did not work, no matter what we tried.  The reason why I want it on PC too, is that the expansion never made it to PS3.  So when I noticed Steams version, I could not wait to buy it again ! And now it works , and I am one happy gamer girl ! And I am certainly not alone.I like my games to have strategy, stories, great character-development, humour,surprises, to have puzzles , be addictive, and to keep me occupied for hours and weeks - and months . The stories in Sacred may be a bit thin, but they are there , and all the other elements I mentioned are there 100% ! :)  It`s a Huge game world!   I want to mention a beloved detail ; I can buy my characters new stuff and dress them up in the weirdest colourful outfits, and new cool weapons whenever I want to - The choises are close to limitless! I don`t know about you all, but I love shopping and finding stuff ;) :) :)(My favourite weapon is the blowpipe - I really wish other characters could use it besides the Dryad.)Take a look at the gameplay :

												So a friend recommended this game to me while, by chance, he noticed it was 80% off. Never bought a better 5$ game. I am not, or have ever been, a big fan of Diablo style games. I just kind of missed that train. But this game broke my pre-concieved ideas about it in just the first few hours. The world is pretty rich and just when I thought I was making progress on the map, I discovered I had only uncovered a dot of it. Every level, while comes slower than my personal taste, gives back benefits you can see each time, rather than a ton of levels all the time with hardly anything to show for each one. Another one of the games strong points is customization. Oh man the customization. It's not as intimidating as 'Path of Exile' (a Diablo-style game I tried), though a tad confusing at first. Even with reading up I still had that ""trash first character"" with my points being in places that were less than helpful. The 'runes' you get to increase your skills are pretty abundant as well, but not always with the ones you need, which can be solved by trading in 1-4 runes of any kind to pick the one you want, increasing your power at a good pace (for a small fee). Combine all that with a rich world, much like Skyrim, open and with entirely too much to do, with so much exploring to do, and you've got a game that will have your style of play, with the story and pacing that you want. However the game's not perfect. Some annoying things like having to drop items and pick them back up to stack them, certain moves having a hard time targeting an enemy making you dance in place until you find that sweet spot, and not having a very clear chart of where your stats are coming from (though it does list which ones you have, just not if it's on your gear, temporary effect, etc). But if you aren't terribly anal about little bumps in the road, it's a great game to buy. 8.5/10, just a step bellow 9 for the minor issues.			"

												9.9/10 A HUGE world with quirky comedy, killer combat and EPIC quests. Detailed, deep, min/max-ing doable but not necessary. This is ""The Skyrim"" of Hack 'n Slash games. Champions of Norrath on steroids. FAR better than Diablo 2 and 3 in my opinion. For $20 it is a STEAL. Love it. I took .1 points off for crashing 3 times in 350 hours.Also I bought a new rig for this game because the GPU requirements were too much for my 2.4Ghz I3/ 9800GT gpu.I am running a 3.4ghz I-9 and the newish Nvidia GTX 750ti EVGA -OC- SC. All settings CRANKED with an HD resolutions pack and never dips below 60FPS.Best $1400 I have ever spent, this game is gorgeous when you can use all of the avaiable graphics.Just buy it and play it and love it.P.S. Sacred 3 was an insult to ALL gamers and should have NEVER been made !!!			"

												Let me say that I am not a ""main quest"" type of player. I love to wander. I love to explore. I love to be able to experiment with character skills without feeling like I have totally stuffed up any chances of doing stuff later. I like freedom and carefree play. Not necessarily easy play though. I dont mind redoing hard bits or going back and leveling up some more to take on a boss.While I havent sunk alot of hours yet into Sacred 2, I can already see that it is my type of game. Think of TitanQuest or Diablo meets Skyrim. We're talking a wide world to explore.Now, the graphics are certainly dated these days and there are some glinches.But as a casual ARPG, this has a lot to offer. I am no gaming expert or pro. I have sunk 100+ hrs in Titan Quest and am lvl 55+ on Skyrim. I suspect I will sink even more in Sacred 2. Well worth the cheap price (I got it on sale - and it is regularly on sale).			"

												This is probably my all-time favorite Isometric loot Pinata Action RPG (i.e ""Diablo clone"" - you can see now why most people prefer that term).   Set in a huge, beautiful Elder Scrolls-like open world, it is immediately set apart from its contemporaries in other ways as well - some good, some bad, some simply arbitrary.  The Good - The character customization/development is second to none compared to others in the genre, the loot/gear is extensive (the armor sets look incredible for the most part) and the art style is impeccable.  The world is varied and interesting, really a joy to explore as it is handcrafted with all kinds of cool side areas and vignettes waiting to be discovered.  As far as I know this is the only game in its genre to have mounts, and they are badass.  Starting off, every class has access to various types of horse, but soon can acquire unique class mounts (like the Seraphim's Tiger or the Dryad's Lizard) and later several advanced horse-types (flaming horse, unicorn, war horse) to ride and fight on.  Did I say fight on? Yes - this game has mounted combat and it's really not much different from the usual bipedal mob-mowing method. In fact, my shadow warrior fights exclusively on his Hellhound (while in the overworld, at least - in dungeons and other subterranean locales you have to hoof it the old fashioned way) The Bad - It suffers in a few areas that may matter more to others than myself - such as the writing - and although many quests are genuinely interesting, no one reads text any more. The actual ""plot"" is fairly abysmal and sparse but hey, this is a Diablo clone - we just want to click and kill and get loot.  Many game mechanics are not explained properly in-game so research or an experienced friend are recommended.The ""Could go Either Way"" - While the classes are, as always, unique and cool - they are still gender locked (as Sacred 1 was).  I personally hate this approach to class design but I put up with it because these games are so damned great.  The classes aren't as appealing to me as Sacred's were (where's the vampiress? she was awesome)  Also the voice work is inconsistent - but that is merely a minor complaint.  The game is a bit ""old school"" with a lack of respec and the ability to totally bork your character development, so lots of rerolls are in store for a new player. The usual Diablo-type mechanics are also thrown a bit on their heads in some cases, which may discomfort those taking the 'clone' portion of the genre name for granted.  There are no skill trees, but a set of skills you can learn from a pool (and put points into every level, up to 200 or so i think) that provide passive bonuses.  This is the open-ended aspect of character development here, taking a cue from the elder scrolls series; which skills you select and level shape your toon's flavor.  The ""active' skills, called Combat Arts or CAs; come as runes, loot that drops from enemies that you can 'eat' to improve each one's power. They can range from healing spells to gap closers to AOE attacks, etc. All the usual abilities we are accustomed to in ARPGs.  Like sacred 1, eating lots of runes increases not only their power but their cooldown time as well (which can be countered in many ways including the aforementioned skills) so there is a balancing game with power vs spammability.  Path of Exile took a version of this concept for use in their gem-based skill system, highlighting Sacred's influence and innovation.The Lowdown - Although the multiplayer servers were shut down, one can still play through a tunnelling service such as hamachi or Tunngle and I suggest someone try to utilize these as I'm looking for people to play with!  Despite its age I still feel like the graphics are among best in class for the Diablo Clone/loot ARPG genre.  The soundtrack (done by the band Blind Guardian) is a bit different for the genre - a power metal vibe to it, also giving you gentle pastoral pieces that help keep the fantasy cohesion intact.  Also each character class has its own flavor of battle music!  There are so many little details- evidence of the developer love that was put into this game - that it breaks my heart it never caught on as much as some other, less-deserving titles have.Also to note - for some reason, the screenshots in the steam store page are all stretched-out looking and strange.  The game looks way better than that in motion lol.  I recommend the community patch (now v.0105 or something) and the camera mod if that is not already included, but otherwise I use no other mods.

I'm telling you, if you like big games with tons and i mean tons of quests and exploration then this game is for you :) I spent 90 hours on my ps3 playthrough and only explored 35% of the map. Like, WOW! There are hundrends and i mean hundreds of quests. I'm not sure on the max player level but i got to 127 over the spand of 90 hours. The game might not be as polished as DIablo but i tell you. It is wayyy more fun. As far as the game goes it's 10/10 Don't expect anything serious because the story is crap and quests are not the greatest. But it is an amazing game.			"

Run as administrator.Find a ""PhysXLoader.dll"" from another game - search the ""\Steam\steamapps\common\"" folder for the file and if you have a few games installed chances are that you'll have one. Copy this file and put it in ""common\Sacred 2 Gold\system"" - the game should now run.I've played a boxed copy of this game years and years ago, and it's very good. I recommend it if you can get it to run.			"

												When the point-and-click genre finds itself bereft of recent hits, Sacred 2 is a breath of fresh air, albeit with the slightest of bad odors..By no means is it a perfect game. It's got a painfully complex UI that will probably be confusing to you for the first 5 or so hours, especially as you unlock whatever skill/items go in whatever slot and you're like ""oh, so THAT'S what that was for...""That said, it's a competent isometric along the same lines as Titan Quest, the Diablo franchise, Path of Exile, etc. Actually, let's just say Titan Quest, because realistically, this game is NOT a skill-spamming, screen-exploding, 24/7 fireworks-esque carnagefest like Diablo. Most of your actual fighting is with the weapons of the game, with skills supplementing rather than replacing it. Much like Diablo 3, Sacred 2 shrugs off convoluted skill trees with skills that grow redundant over time; instead, it adds in secondary effects that can tweak your skills. Depending on your class selection (of which there's 6, or rather 7 as if you're reading this you'll get the expansion if you buy via steam), you get a fairly normal spread of buffs, debuffs, single-target and AoE skills to use.Or rather... okay, rewind a bit. You acquire ""Combat Arts"". This is what the game calls skills/spells/whatever. These are your on-call abilities for damage, utility, and defensive purposes. Unlike most other RPGs, Sacred 2 doesn't have mana, or energy, or what have you; instead, each Combat Art has its own unique cooldown, with a small global cooldown for all abilities on top of that. This means you can theoretically use the same CA all game, if you felt so inclined, with the only limit on casting being its cooldown. Cooldown is affected by factors such as armor weight, with the heaviest armor reducing CA cooldowns, and lighter, more... breathable caster-oriented gear actually giving you a cooldown DECREASE; specific stats reducing cooldown that is an affix/prefix to gear; through points into the Stamina stat; or through the use of relevant skills.Now ""Skills"", as Sacred 2 views them, are actually a series of passive buffs that have their own progression (no having to wonder whether to give yourself +stat or more damage for that one spell you like). This is one of those convoluted systems I mentioned. See, you get this page full of assignable skills (assigned to get their effects, mind you, no other interaction required). They do all sorts of stuff -- buff damage with certain weapon types, increase status effect chance, gain new gameplay aspects (smith your own stuff out in the field, see what items will cost without having to be at a merchant, ride better horses (yes, there's mounts, and the world is huge so it's kind of necessary)). Think of these as perks, in a sense, with most being passive buffs, but a few unlocking key features -- everything from the utility skill Alchemy letting you use one-time temporary buff items, or the weapon specific Magic Staff skill giving you the ability to fire ranged magic attacks (without at least one level of this skill, you'll just bash enemies over the head with the staff, no matter how magical your character actually is). There's a set limit to the number of skills you can choose (note that Combat Arts are separate, and you could theoretically level EVERY CA if you wanted).Skills also, in addition to these catch-all generics, contain class-specific skills that buff one Combat Art Tree or another (of which classes have 3) with damage, duration, cooldown, and so on. It isn't just raw buffs, however -- you need these CA skills to level your individual Combat Arts (if you've played Titan Quest or Grim Dawn, just think about how you need to consciously level up your Mastery to unlock skills). And Combat Arts are actually acquired in a really roundabout way -- rather than 95% of other ARPGs, you don't gain points to distribute upon leveling up; instead, you have to find Runes, consume-on-use items that increase your Combat Arts by one point. Let me emphasize -- there is no such thing as ""end-game"" CAs, because you could feasibly find ANY CA as a rune at any one time. Unfortunately, you can only level CAs so far before needing -- you guessed it -- points in the Skill for that Combat Art -- still with me? Also, you have to have self-control, because leveling increases EVERYTHING about the CA, including cooldown timer. So you might quickly find yourself pouring runes into a skill, then realize you're missing the cooldown-reduction, late-game gear, or points in the Combat Art's governing skills, that would make using it at that level feasible.The aforementioned CA modifications are actually a binary system, where you have three points of upgrade for each Combat Art. Once you put a certain amount of points into the Skill governing that Combat Art's tree, you get an option to upgrade one of your 'discovered' Combat Arts. This modification is usually a choice between something like damage vs. status. It's not a huge difference, but its effect stacks with the baseline increases of leveling that Combat Art via runes, and offers some degree of customization.On level up, in addition to a few skill points (and a new skill slot unlocked every few levels per a set formula), you get to choose from 6 stats to put a point in. I'm not gonna run them all down (as review space is precious), but it ranges from health and health regen out-of-battle (Vitality) to chance to hit (Dexterity) to cooldown for Combat Arts (Stamina). Fairly normal RPG spread, really.Equipment-wise, the game is pretty generous. You've got a full spread of torso, legs, feet, arms, shoulders, and more; varying amounts of rings and necklaces (per character class); a few unique things like ""Batteries"" for the Temple Guardian (basically a cybernetic Anubis sort of robot thing). There are a LOT of places to fill on the inventory screen. On the High Elf I'm playing right now, alone, I've got 4 rings, 2 amulets, torso, legs, feet, arms, hands, shoulders, and I'm pretty sure I'm missing some without opening the game to look. It's crazy, really.All that said, there are downfalls to the game. Its graphical interface is, as mentioned, clunky, not to mention has very odd choices (transparencies everywhere, lots of ill-defined edges on UI elements, etc.) Animations are... okay, but not anything to drop your jaw at. Same thing with general appearance -- it looks fine, but it's not an eye-candy sort of game. The earliest few hours, on top of overloading you with stats and numbers and mechanics, will also be very slow, as a lack of skill variety (until you find the appropriate runes, of course) and a painfully-slow movement speed before you start getting mounts will make the game a tiring slog.And boy, howdy, is the voicework friggin' painful. The game does NOT take itself too seriously outside of the specific story arc, so you've got stuff like enemies going ""Arrrggh! I was... just an... extra..."" or 'pirate' enemies going ""I guess you weren't such a landlubber after all..."" Your character spews an unhealthy amount of lines, ranging from generic hero stuff (""You would dare hit a High Elf?"") to... 4th-wall breaking stuff (""Ugh, can we remove animals from the spawn table, please?"") Very fortunately, an option in the menu enables drastically, or even completely, reducing this commentary (that's even what the menu calls it), so that's an option if it gets a bit much for you.Besides the general usability of the game, though, the multi-tiered depth of character-building is a great change of pace from certain games that railroad your builds (-cough- Diablo 3), without forcing something like having to min/max a billion different passive buffs (-cough- Path of Exile). If nothing else, there's a demo available (if not here, then on the internet in general). Check it out, try to tolerate its rough edges, and you'll get a fairly competent and fun game, worth at least one or two replays.			"

Posted: April 12, 2016
												Isometric ARPGs are one of my top favorite genres of video games, and Sacred 2 is in my top 10 games of all time. Full disclosure, I own multiple copies of the game, including a PC version that is not on Steam, and a 360 version that I have put hundreds of hours into. Sacred 2 is the game that I compare all other isometric ARPGs to, and none have come close to its perfection for me yet.What makes Sacred 2 unique? Addicting? More memorable than others in its genre? Well, a couple of things. First off, it's crystal clear to anyone who has played the game for more than a dozen hours that the game is an absolute labor of love from a development team that has a love for details. The genre is not too well known for in-depth storylines or crazy memorable characters, and while Sacred 2 admittedly does little to change this, what the game does better than others in its genre is build a breathable, diverse, varied world full of detail. For video gamers who consider themselves explorers by nature (*raises hand*), Sacred 2 is an unparalleled heaven. The game map is 22 square miles (larger even than Just Cause 2's massive map) and can easily intimidate or overwhelm new players with the massive amount of things to explore and do. Many large games fall into the trap of having large expanses of nothing, or not very detailed areas of interest due to the map simply being large to take up space; Sacred 2 rarely falls into this trap. Each of the game's 42 cities is architecturally different or geographically unique. There are hidden areas of the map (including cities) that can only be accessed by traveling through cave systems. Each home in each city is decorated in the sense that it actually appears lived in (papers left strewn over desks, decorations unique to various homes, etc.). So while yes, Sacred 2 has one of the largest game worlds ever created, it doesn't feel as if you're treading through repetitive territory. This is a game for people looking to explore, find secrets, hidden treasures and areas, etc.Sacred 2 has a sense of humor that will be either hit or miss depending on your personality. Characters (both yours and enemies) have hilarious or corny one liners while fighting that change depending on who (or what) you're fighting. Delightfully over-dramatic rock music plays when an enemy catches sight of you and engages combat. The massive amount of enemies that try to fight you sometimes overwhelm the screen and make me laugh due to the simple ridiculousness of it all (or, it's also humorous to me if I'm running from combat for whatever reason and have a following of over a dozen enemies, for example). Depending on what class you choose, your character's personality can change, and she/he can have different responses to quests because of how she/he feels about the situation. Sacred's world is highly detailed and full of lore, but it's not afraid to let loose and have humor, and I love that.Multiple playthroughs can yield drastically different playstyles, and multiple playthroughs of even the same class can bring newness that few others in the genre offer. Sacred 2 offers so many upgrade paths and skill trees (all of which are impossible to pursue in one playthrough, even within one class) that it can, quite frankly, be overwhelming to a new player. Leveling up in this game grants you so many options that you probably are best off seeking a tutorial or guide to make sure you know what you're doing and where you want your character to go. After you ""get it,"" though, you get it...and you're set for life.What are some of Sacred 2's problems? Like mentioned earlier, the game is simply massive, and gives you so many options that your first playthrough is bound to be full of errors in judgment on leveling among other things. Also, the use of element weaknesses is crucial to the game, and renders some bosses nearly impossible unless you have the right set up for a fight. The game requires some light work to get to work on any system after Vista (update your PhysX and DirectX, both found handily in your Sacred 2 Steam folder, and everything should work fine for 99% of people). The game also suffers from occasional glitches (sometimes bodies of enemies flip around, quest markers ""stick"" to the map until you re-select another quest). The game has no loading screens (Edit: This is apparently just a glitch that happens to me; the game has the same loading screens as the 360 version), and so it can make new players scared that it has frozen and crashed when it has not (the screen freezes for a few seconds before loading up the new area). On the plus side, I'm running Sacred 2 on a non-gaming laptop on low settings, and it looks beautiful and loads like a charm in mere seconds. In summary, I adore this game. It has set such high standards in a genre that I love that I find myself disappointed in other games whose feats pale in comparison. It took the development team over four years to work on this massive project (and even longer to port it over to consoles) that they declared bankruptcy, and the only good thing about that is that you can tell this game was immensely cherished by those who slaved over it. (For those of you who don't already know, the critically panned Sacred 3 was not developed by the same people and is not really considered a true successor of the franchise to fans of the original Sacred and Sacred 2.) I don't have enough room to write all of the good things about this game that I'd like to, so I'll end this here. Moral of the story: if you enjoy isometric ARPGs, you owe it to yourself to at least try this game.			"

												Sacred 2 is a worthy succesor to Sacred.Things I liked about the game:+ its sacred 2+ nice graphics+ a fair amount of viable builds / diversity+ trashing tons of mobs for loot+ large world, scaling mobs in endgame make it possible to grind your gear in any area+ tough as nuts highest difficultyNeutral noteworthy things:- There is a multiplayer, I personally find it quite hard to have fun with this game in multiplayer. Iam not a fan of pvp and questing with friends is hard to coordinate and usually ends in chaos and frustration. Everyone has this one friend that needs 60 minutes to distribute 1 skill point on lvl 5, that friend that listens and reads every tiny bit of every quest. That one friend thats always randomly afk etc.Things i didnt like:- crashes and the endless search for a fix- this asspull atempt of a story 1/10 they tried- some builds / mechanic abuseAll the points the negative reviews list can be easily fixed by the user in the end except for the instability some users have. I personally do crash every 1 or 2 hours but on a bright side this does keep me from playing all day.I dont know how people get the idea that an Action RPG/hack and slash needs to define itself with superb story or lore. I like both sacred for their somehow very satisfying way of slaughtering tons of mobs and gettin rad loot. The combat mechanics work flawless for close combat. Ranged combat has some slight issues with terrain sometimes. shots getting blocked by hills, props whatever and some mobs have such a huge movement in their attack animation that they evade shots. Those are little flaws that dont matter too much since sacred is so smooth and fluent in its combat that it doesnt matter if a few shots miss or you misscast your spell out of bounds by accident.I dont say its impossible to put a good story into a hack and slay game, I am saying that a hack and slay game can be fun and entertaining even without any story. Now a list of issues other user describe and my thoughts:- game is too easy / outleveling quest areas: If you are seeking the challenge the game has to offer skip all guides and start your character in silver difficulty. Even if you do every sidequest there is its nearly impossible to outlevel silver before you have done every quest there is. If you happen to stumble upon really broken stuff like the BeeEffGee build just dont do it.- buggy quests: yes, there are some quests that dont function well or at all but so what ? there are hundreds of quests and for the density of actual content its impressive how few quests are actually bugged. Also quests do give exciting rewards like set items. In fact with the Bargaining skill at 75 quests are well worth your time in higher difficulties IMO.- boring story / lore: yep, lets be honest nobody plays this game for its quality story. If you are interested in a good told story go read a book or play some games that are actually made for that. If you dig deep and actually read the books that drop every now and then you see the effort of immersion or lore and sometimes its even slightly interesting to read. Just because Sacred isnt based on a 100 bands thick story like Warcraft it isnt automatically bad.- it doesnt bring the same charm as Sacred (the first one): well nostalgia can be a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I personally like both games. They are similar and I feel like Sacred 2 is in fact the better game concept wise. You have more diversion in your class. And I feel its not so punishing as the first for going trololo and skilling whatever. I however feel the Sacred genes.- hard to controll camera: yes the camera can be a nightmare but by fiddeling with the options you can live with it quite easily. Just disable follow camera and collision and you are good to go. Just use the rotation keys to keep the boss centric bossfights so that the boss is north of you and you wont have problems with movement or attacking.- progress loss by crashes / corruption: I dont see the problem here. The game has the option to bind save game. Just put it somewhere comfy and hit it every now and then. Never lost more than maybe 10 minutes. I always save after finding an item id like to keep, saveing the game doesnt interrupt the game at all. Atleast for me with the game on a SSD might be different on HDDs. It never ever happened to me to corrupt a savefile. Even if you fear corruption its easy to create a backup every now and then.TL:DR Sacred 2 is a good arpg with alot weighting on hack n slash. The story would be better off missing completely than this sorry attempt. Its still a good Sacred and its fun to build and play diverse characters. I can definitively recommend it to somewhat openminded Sacred fans. If you want it to be a Sacred clone with better graphics you are bound to be dissappointed.WARNING: Some people have so many issues with this game they cant even get it to launch at all. All I needed to do was making it run as admin, with XP servicepack 3 and the parameters -skipopenal -nocpubinding.			"

												A good game for fans of Diablo or the original Sacred. I can't say it does a great job of drawing you into the story, but there are a lot of fun things about the gameplay nonetheless with character classes you aren't likely to find anywhere else (like a Seraphim or Anubis) and the ability to create skill combos, as well as a good variety of weapons including some unique ones like energy pistols along with the typical medieval sorts. Tons of quests, monsters, and loot will keep you occupied for hours.			"

												Installing and running this game takes a little bit of tweaking as it will not run with later versions of PhysX. It's simple though, uninstall PhysX in Control Panel>Add/Remove Programs, then use the PhysX install file which is in the game folder, or download legacy drivers from Nvidia.I also have it running in WinXP SP3 mode, though I did this before reconfiguring PhysX so not sure if necessary. **The camera on default settings is annoying! Others have pointed this out but it's easy fixed. It moves for you at the worst angles. Don't worry though, three clicks in settings under Camera (untick them all) and you can control the camera angle yourself using A and D keys, and mouse wheel to zoom.Having said that, for 5 minutes of tweaking, this game is totally worth it. If you like Diablo, The Elder Scrolls, played the first Sacred or simply love RPG type ""kill, level, loot"" games, you will love this.The map is huge and free to roam at your Leisure. Everywhere you go there is something to battle and loot. You barely need to buy armour or anything because you can loot everything you need, unless buying something specific. So many hours of gameplay, side quests, main story quests, random exploration, whatever you want. Choose your character based roughly on the type of game you would like to play, for example, follow the ""light"" or ""dark"" path, choose a character based on their fighting styles, once in game the skills you give your character can complement the base skills you have or you can train something totally unique.I could go on, but, just buy it. It's cheap and with so much to do and so many ways to do it, you will get your moneys worth. I would go so far to say this game is essential for RPG lovers. Yes I would.			"

												I played this game a hell lot before it was on steam and recently bought the gold edition during the sale and enjoyed it once more. If you are burned out from other Action RPG games such as Diablo 3, this game will definitely be fun for you. I recommend getting the community patch to fix some crucial bugs as this game is not supported by the developer anymore. Online gameplay has been taken down some years ago aswell, but LAN is still possible obviously.However, if you reach level 50+ in this game (usually by the time you finish the campaign for the first time on silver difficulty), xp gain really slows down a hell lot, so I recommend tweaking balance.txt xp gain by x10 multiplier to keep the game somewhat motivating.Other than that it's a well designed game, the classes are very different from each other and deliver extremly solid character development and the loot system is very rewarding and motivating, even if the sets don't change from level 15 to 200 (max) they just gain higher stats which makes a 2nd, respectively third playthrough rather obsolete. The sound / voice acting in this game is brilliant and the enemies have some humourous / hillarious lines whenever you encounter / beat them. The heroes itself have witty and cheesy lines upon accepting quests / defeating bosses / hordes of mobs.Although the quests are as simple as they could be (fetch me X of Y, go talk to Z) and the story being basically only a plot device to advance through the land, the world is very big and you can explore a hell lot of content.I do recommend buying this game, if you want a fun timesink and like tinkering around with builds and combat arts (plenty of them available).

												Amazed at all these negative reviews. On my relatively modern system (intel i5 GTX 960) this game looks and plays fabulously. Playing the game from an isometric perspective (diablo style; you can also play the game 3rd person I believe) that you can rotate; this game gives you a HUGE map filled with quests, buildings, and dungeons to explore; randomised loot, mounts (with randomised stats for your mount lol); and lots of different characters to choose from with huge customisation possibilities.This is a quality and complex game with bucket-loads of individual character. Choose a simpler character like the 'Shadow Warrior' class for your first play-through. Do yourself a favour; don't write Sacred 2 off. Get the community patch and give this game a go. "

Also the Co op feature is not very good at all. It does work however its still not very good. Just a heads up for color blind people like me. This is the only game I have every played where I could not see something. I would recommend this for single player and for people without being color blind. I would give it a score of 7/10			"

												This is an extremely fun an addicting game. Brings back some of the fun from classics like diablo to champions series and all other sorts between them. The game is flawed with bugs (community patch will fix that for you). Does run on Windows 10 by just setting exe to xp or 7 compatibility mode. The only real problem with the game functionally is that it suffers from a memory leak which will cause the game to randomly freeze after about an hour. The game does save a lot so if you enjoy it, then you will be ok with restarting every once in a while. The biggest thing I hate is the damn camera angles, the world is so damn nice with color but you can't see hardly in any direction and unlike diablo and torchlight when you zoom out they would extend the field of view ahead this game crunches ever more top down and near sighted. Over all its nothing crazy like Torchlight II or Diablo series, but it's a fresh take on it even with its flaws.			"

Install the Community Patch and the game will work better.I played the hell out of this game on 360 and saw no reason not to get it for PC when I made the switch. What Ascaron did with Sacred 2 was marry two of my favorite concepts: a sprawling sandbox world and tongue-in-cheek hack and slash gameplay.What's not to love? The world is massive enough to require a mount. You get a sweet mount. The combat is fun. The loot system is fun. It's not a ""gritty"" ""serious"" game -I think there are quite a few games that can satisfy those who prefer such tone.Get it. Install the Physx driver. Install the community patch.

												A hesitant recommendation of this rpg as it reminds me a lot of Kingdoms of Amalur.  What I do like is there are many different ways to customize your character using skills, runes, buffs, armor enhancements, and even special weapons.  This is also a very loot-heavy game.  Unlike Kingdoms of Amalur, the combat is very hack-n-slash.  So what's left is the quests and anything off the main path is really substandard.  ""Go deliver this letter"", ""Go kill this guy"", ""My cat ran into a cave"" etc.  They are godawful, much like Amalur's side quests.  Unforunately you need to do then to get those sweet level-ups.  :(  It seems like a single player MMO much like Amalur did so if you like that game you may enjoy this one.  Just be aware the multiplayer servers were taken down.  I'd say it's maybe a 7 out of 10 but only for hack-n-slash RPG fans.			"

												The size and scope of the land of Ancaria is truly impressive. None of the areas are randomly generated, and the entire map (not including the numerous subterranean dungeons littered here and there) spans over 22 square miles of real-world distance. In a nutshell: it's freaking huge. Navigation in the overworld is seamless, and load times during transitions to the underground are very brief. All of the terrain is packed with detail and different regions have their own unique climates, inhabitants, and land features. Also, the characters, monsters, and other elements look excellent.Sacred 2: Fallen Angel screenshotOne of the downsides, which will likely be fixed with patches, is the game's general bugginess. There are times when the pop-up map disappeared completely, making it damn tedious to navigate. Sometimes clicking on people to speak with them had no effect whatsoever, and certain actions would yield sounds but no visual or gameplay effects. In one instance, a crucial item required to proceed in the main quest was not where it was supposed to be, making it impossible to proceed. Occasionally, the direction indicator that points to the next main object disappeared completely. Most of these issues were remedied by quitting and reloading the game, but they were a nuisance when they arose.A hack-and-slash RPG quest of massive proportion, Sacred 2 caters to the throng of players who are anxiously awaiting the eventual release of Diablo III. PC gamers who've been salivating over the prospect of the next Diablo will undoubtedly seek temporary solace in the familiar gameplay found in Sacred 2 and be willing to turn a blind eye to the title's annoying bugs and occasionally repetitious play mechanics just to get their fix. Indeed, overlook the few minor irritating aspects of the game, and you'll find Sacred 2 to be surprisingly enjoyable.RATING OUT OF 5RATING DESCRIPTIONGraphicsIt's generally a beautiful world to explore.3.8ControlIncessant clicking is still a winning yet repetitive formula.3.7Music / Sound FX / Voice ActingFunny dialogue.

												Holds the record for the longest and most content-packed ARPG in history. 100% playthrough on the highest difficulty is approx 300-400 hours. Awkward combat mechanics from an awkward game engine. Packed with little details and humour you could tell the devs put love into this game. Unstable without community patch, an old time favorite.

												Sacred 2 is still the best open-world/Diablo-esque game that has ever graced this earth with it's existence! There is a reason I spent 100s of hours within this game on my PS3 and why I still bought it on steam.... three words... Awe so me!!!			"

												Really good game with a huge world with hundreds of side quests and an intense main storyline. The game has so much in it that it can keep you playing for literally hundreds of hours. Also the class you get from the DLC is amazing, slightly challenging but very fun.Unfortinately, the game has caused many problems for many people. The game opens for some people but for alot of people, the game just does not open and it crashes instantly. If you buy this game, expect the game to not work, but when you look through discussions there are many methods to fix these problems which work for most people. (But not all) So just be warned.			"

												I did not want to bother to make a review, but, I felt kinda guilty if I did not give it a thumb up! What can I say? Where do I start at? An old game but an epic_ a true unsimple RPG that has not had disappointed me so far. 35 hrs, almost 30% of main mission is complete, and there is still more and more!!This is an RPG where you get lost into its pretty elements:Graphics 10/10 at that timeMusic: 8/10 pretty music, though inconsistent. Battel music sometimes get confsued with chating or shopping.RPG elements: 20/10 Steep learning curve,complicated, makes sense, workout your brain to perfect your own character.Tutorial 0/10 unclear on many things, you have to search online to understand a lot of basics of the gameClasses 10/10 decent mix of classesSome bugs and framdrop but would not prevent me from enjoying the game!!Worth it?? Hell yahh...			"

												The biggest problems with Sacred 2 is the fact it was never really finished, even with community patches the game is still extremely buggy, and its quite possible to lose hours of progress due to random crashes or because of black screen issues.   Many quests are still buggy, some of them can be resolved usually by reloading a save game but others are more messy, especially one quest I personally just failed (Hunting Fever 1) which was to kill 31 specific monsters within 10 minutes, normally that would be easy enough if there was actually enough of those monsters to kill in that time limit! I found 11..smh In a nut shell, Sacred 2 could have been a really awesome ARPG, I personally think it could have been one of the very best if it wasn't rushed to market.  There are many positive aspects, but the bugs, pathing issues and camera issues can really cause serious problems and that is the reason why I'm not recommending this game,   its a shame really because even by todays standards - I still think its better than Diablo 3 and thats saying something. ARPG fans can pick up this game for practically nothing these days, and if anyone has free time to burn then honestly, I'd still recommend giving this a play through, there is a massive gameworld to explore - literally 10x larger than all the Diablo series combined, granted that size and the amount of side quests added to the amount of bugs in the end but still, the games main quest lines are usually bug free at least...usually. + Large open world+ tons of items and customization- Very buggy- Possible to lose progress due to crashes- Possible to lose your save game entirely due to corruption - Pathing problems- Poor camera angles- Dead Multiplayer (can be played with 3rd party programs)* As a note, Sacred 2 is no longer working to constant crashing on start up (Setup managers phase) which has been a known problem for years -			"

GOOD: Absurdly big map. It's so vast that it could even put some of the MMORPGs (or Skyrim) to shame. But it's not that amazing - what makes it truly unique is it's quality. Repetitive scenery, reused parts of the map, areas that look like being done using procedure generation? Nope - totally not the case. It's astonishingly detailed. Character building. This game is a goldmine for people thinking that character building is what makes ARPG. 7 characters, each has around half a dozen of core builds, with unaccountable amount of stuff that could be tweaked ""to taste"". Doesn't feels too dated. It supports 1920x1080, special effects are an eye-candy, and it has autoloot - not many old ARPGs could boast with this.NEUTRAL: Very Bright. And by ""very"" I mean it's the most colorful ARPG I've ever played. Have to mention it, because currently there's a trend of people liking more gritty games.  Lore and Story. To be precise, this game has decent lore and terrible storyline.  Like, you start with delivering a parcel, then searching for missing elven expedition, then doing some laundry job for different parties, then some seemingly unrelated quests that just used to push you through locations - and voila, you're storming the final boss's hold. An excuse of a plot, just some side quests stitched together.   Itemization. Dull, but efficient. I mean, items are more or less good from the gameplay point of view, and this twist with certain items having unlockable traits depending on your character skills is pretty peculiar. But I'm pretty sure after going off for a year I won't be able to recall even one item/set - they are just not inspiring enough to me.BAD: Obscure game mechanics. The game is far from being keen to explain how stuff works. It doesn't help that it's mechanics are very different from other ARPGs, as well as knowledge of mechanics is more important in Sacred 2 by a noticeable margin. If you don't dig forums/wiki you'll probably be left crawling in the dark and screw up your first character (and second too) beyond salvation. Uninformative and misleading tooltips. Related to the previous, sort of. If you're choosing a perk between more damage or bigger aoe the game will never tell you beforehand how much extra damage or AOE you get. The only way is to check on the sacred wiki. Simplistic combat. The combat is what typically separates Action RPGs from Classical RPGs. Action elements usually involve kiting enemies, positioning, targeting skills, dodging enemy attacks or skills, avoiding area damage, etc.  So, back to the point. Sacred 2 combat is closer to that of a classical RPGs. It comes down to whether your character is strong enough to facetank and kill enemies, or not. There's no ""I'm on the weak side, but I can do it with my gaming madskillz"". Some bosses do possess an element of tactics, but that's it.   BOTTOMLINE:Sacred 2 is rather niche - it's not easy enough for beginners and not action-oriented enough for the ARPG veterans. People not used to the game will have a hard time shaking off the feeling they are playing some long forgotten MMORPG, alone on an empty server. I'd say it's worth a try if you're a fan of character building.			"

												RATS!!! RATS EVERYWHERE!!!Ahem...This is a huge game, and a lot of fun once you plow through the wiki and get the idea of how you should build your character. There are no respecs, but to finish the story, you don't really need to be paying much attention besides common sense and what the game tells you. If you want to finish Niob (hardest difficulty), you'll need a good build. So basically, like every ARPG ever.This one doesn't use mana however, the skills you have are based on a a cooldown, and managing that cooldown, choosing the skills to lower it and planning when to upgrade your skills is a big part of the game. Once you get the hang of it, it's pretty rewarding. Furthermore, skills can be chained in combos and blah, blah, i'm not here to explain the system in detail. It just works in a different fun way than most other ARPGs.There are TONS of sidequests in the game and the world map is huge. It's not randomised, but it really doesn't need to be for how big it is. Discovering every corner of the map and finishing all the quests will take a very long time. Sidequests are not needed beyond leveling a bit for the next main quest (if it proves to be too difficult), but if you want a lot to do in a game, you'll have it. They're a bit repetitive though, but only if you plan on doing all of them (which is not really the point).There are a lot of classes, most of which can choose a light or dark campaign (some are locked to either light or dark), and each class has 3 aspects of combat arts to specialise in, not to mention skills  and stats. If you like exploring builds you'll find a lot to do here, but it can be a bit overwhelming at first and take a bit of time to see what you like until you get all the combat arts and try them out.There's metric tons of loot to get here and some builds are designed to maximise the chance of getting good loot. Which you can then share with your other characters or other players in co-op.Co-op works over LAN only (older game so no more online servers), but you can get past that with some virtual LAN programs like Hamachi or the like.The graphics are vibrant and still beautiful, dynamic day-night cycles, weather effects and, if you have a Nvidia card, Physix effects. The graphics still hold up today, and while it isn't included in this version, search the internet a bit and there's an official high resolution texture pack. It's a minor difference, but if you want that, it's an option.The downsides are there too though. It's poorly programmed and while the fan patch rectifies a lot of the game's programs, you still need to fiddle a bit to get it running and it takes a lot of resources (for an older game) to get it to run smoothly. Running it as administrator and setting it to compatibility mode for Windows XP (SP3) is a must, and it has some weird regional settings that cause problems when running the game if everything doesn't match, but you can get around that by adding a registry key to the game's registry entry. The answers are easy to find just by googling, and any problems are pretty easy to fix. Still, the game won't run ""out of the box"" in most cases, so prepare to do some googling on how to get it to run.So, despite some issues at the start, when you do get it to run, what's not to like? It's an ARPG that's very self aware and almost a parody of itself and other games of this genre so don't expect the game to be too serious. The characters break the fourth wall with their idle cahtter (""I need increased attack and defense values"" says one character when casting a buff), and it's very entertaining. It's not over the top, but the details reveal the lighthearted nature of the game, and while it can get a bit repetitive and sometimes slow to level up, it's always fun to run through the world killing stuff in an ARPG that doesn't take itself too serious.

												Sacred 2 is massive. You want to explore? Just do that. You'll find it hard to explore everything, only because there is so much. Go it alone or with friends, Sacred 2 offers quite a large map, many caves and dungeons, lots of options for weapons/skills, and lots and lots of lore and quests. 2 Main quests (good or evil), hundreds of side quests, and each character/class has a specific secondary quest. Seriously, this is a big game.			"

Countless diversity of enemies. Dungeon crawling. Tons of Loot. An imense world to explore. I am 43 hours in and haven't seen 30% of the game map yet. The replayability is of value due to classes, skills and attributes in each character, that will make you want to try it out.The graphics are Ok, there is no-indepth story. This is not the Elder Scrolls. Besides that it is fun as hell. 4 player Co-Operative its very nice to play with your friends. Recommended. "

												This game was part of my childhood, and it's a damn good game still. There are a few problems with it, you have to set it to run in compatability mode for Win XP SP2, and the UI resolution isn't made with today's resolutions in mind leaving stuff hard to read. But it's got a sort of self referential humor and is a pretty fun thing to play. The dialogue and quest descriptions are a sort of 'must read' deal, since the writers apparently didn't get the memo that is was supposed to be some sort of 'serious' fantasy RPG, and that's one of the things I love. It starts slow, though, but it's worth the time to play.Protip: Read all the gravestones you can, they're the silliest parts of this game.			"

												I really did not want to write a negative review about it, but I have to. I will explain why.I have been a huge fan of the first one, i've completed the game on multiple characters, with most of the classes and told most of my friends about this awesome game called ''Sacred''.So several years later I was browsing the internet and found that the second one was released since a while. Few weeks later, luckily it got into a bundle! What a perfect occasion to buy this game which looked better than the first right? I was wrong.This game as quite a few bad things about it that wasn't in the first... The quest pathing is horrible, I kept getting lost and I had to reload/ check the map several times. The game dosen't run smoothly at all. The camera... Even with a lot of custom settings I gave up, it looks weird, either follows you around and switch angles or just gets stuck. Also I've read many people have issues with Nvidia graphics, such as crashes, personally I don't recall crashing but It feels a bit laggy.The graphics looks fine. The combat, item system and rune system is just as good as the firstl! You could easily like this game, i'm not saying it's bad, I am really sad because of all those issues I encountered. I will probably try it again one day, I want to like this game, but for now I still really prefer the first one... I just cannot recommend this to a friend, I would recommend Sacred 1 instead.I doubt the developers would patch a game that came out 6+ years ago but if they could make the camera any better, it would make the game so much more enjoyable.

												FIRST REVIEW! :DOkay so first off as a lot of people are aware, yes, there are a ton of bugs. The voice acting is par and probably just a tiny bit better than Two Worlds, but the things said in this game, especially in towns can be hiliarious. Just today I killed a turtle on the beach and it yelled like a man XD. But in all seriousness, I put probably 100 hours on Xbox 360, and am doing another playthrough of the game again on PC because this game is gorgeous. I don't speak from playing all Sacred games, because this is the only one I have actually put a lot of time into (Sacred 3 will never count in this franchise). The world is so immersive, ambience is definitely there within the world, exotic mounts, 3 sets of personal, exotic gear for each character (more with Ice and Blood) a **** ton of custimization, play as you wish (for example, I run a High Elf [because I have already done the Temple Guardian and Inquisior] with a pike for my melee, Bow for my distance, and have spells that I can cast in close quarters AND far!) You can choose to stick to a simple play style, or make it COMPLETELY your own! That's what I love about this game. Story wise, it's there, but again, voice acting is no where near perfect in this game. So would I recommend this game alongside the bugs and stupid voice acting? Absolutely. Would I say to get it at full price, I'll leave that one up to you. If you love RPG games and really love to get lost in something for many MANY hours within the confides of the games world, then I would. But if you Just want a game to play and experience to see what it's like, then I would suggest waiting until it goes on sale (I got mine for $3.74). (Here's a tip for all of you guys out there reading this and on Windows 10 if you haven't already figured it out. Once you download the game, verify integrity of the game through the properties, open the games file through Steam, open the system folder and find the Sacred 2 file. Right-click on it, go to properties and the compatibility. Choose Windows 7, then click OK. Open the Steam folder and the exact same. If you don't find a physxloader.dll file from NVidia, then you can download the driver from there website. Run the game, and ENJOY!!!!! :D)			"

												Well I've only played 40h so far, but I certainly like this game a lot. Pro- good selection of classes to choose from - funny quotes and humour- huge world to roam- option to be good or evil- lots of thing to do- crapton of questsCon- camera angle; it's bit restricting, but you can get used to it- ranged character moving towards mobs instead of shooting a bow- game doesn't really explain/teach most of the stuff you need to know for character skills/runes etc. (so bit of googling before starting to play is in order)- physX; yea I have amd gpu but I needed to install nvidia program to play the gameOther than that, I can't think of more to complain. Some ppl have mentioned crashes, but I've had like 2 crashes so far out of 40h playtime. So I don't see it as a huge problem. Saving is as simple as hitting F7, which I do at least once every 30mins (and game autosaves every time you enter/exit a cave or complete a quest), so losing lots of progress is odd complaint unless you consider 15mins as lots.Well worth the little money it costs. Also there seems to be some community patch to fix some issues.			"

												玩了那么多新游戏，始终都不会抛弃它——Sacred2虽说我是在2010年接触S2，但是我还没玩遍所有角色以及所有玩法呢。1、六翼天使主流玩法有双刀、大炮，主修第一系，以第三系作为辅助；也可以玩三系全修，以第二系为主，第一和三为辅助，这种玩法，可以使用第二系的魔法，也可以使用第三系的大炮，群怪用第二系的光柱、怼BOSS用第三系的大炮，配合第二系套装的百分比吸血，相当给力，当然这种输出没有纯大炮那么变态。具体攻略，可以到百度贴吧——神圣纪事的精品贴翻阅我的攻略。不管怎么玩，一定要记住六翼天使的2个神技：第一系的冲劲十足和第三系的神力防护。2、高等精灵主流玩法有冰电双修或者火电双修，高精妹妹是比较传统的法师，实力很强大。她的必学神技有电系的“强劲鼓舞”，是个很给力的BUFF，以及“驱散”。3、龙法师主流玩法有吹风流加炸弹人，两者组合，不管怼BOSS还是群怪，效率都是杠杠的。当然它还有辅助神技，在此就不再赘述。第一系的变龙，高难度没前途，弃之吧。4、森林女神俗称大妈，远程专家，第一系是精髓，主力输出战技，吹管简直逆天的存在，没有弓箭类的弹道，只要命中高，子弹秒到，拿着吹管施放多重攻击的那个CA，简直就像在用喷子，玩第一的大妈，装备就选第一系专用的套装，全凑齐以后出百分比吸血，铌金难度百分比吸血高达4%，相当恐怖，也算是弥补了弓箭和吹筒没有百分比吸血属性的遗憾，当然也可以用飞镖，一些飞镖带有百分比吸血属性，带上盾，闯铌金难度更安全。第三系树皮buff虽然丑，但是也是必学的，作为辅助，增加大妈生存能力。大妈还有一种玩法，就是双持，虽然效率没有使用远程武器高，但也值得一试哦。5、神庙守卫这个角色，上手比较难，推荐玩法，第一、三系同时修，如果偏重升级，先修第三系，源泉魔法中的冰火换着用，群怪效率杠杠的，特别是多倍怪MOD，经验值duang~~~，令你爽翻天，但是高等级单挑BOSS，恐怕就是第三系的弱点了，基本上没输出，这时第一系就派上用场了，用百分比吸血的武器去正面肛BOSS吧，第一系的护盾BUFF和战斗警觉都是神技，必须要学，在专注未精通前，战斗警觉最后一个进阶先留着，别转成BUFF，怼BOSS专用，开没开启，完全两个样，开了命中很牛，没开就是渣。详细攻略，可到神圣纪事百度贴吧精品贴翻阅。6、暗影武士学个第三系的隐身，猥琐得很，相当于无敌了			"

												Imagine Diablo 2 with higher skill levels and more-vast maps, more dungeons, failable quests.  It allows you to really pick and choose what you want in a character.  The downside is that it takes 75 levels before you can reap the hidden benefits of all skills that you pick.  Also, if you don't die, the monsters become insanely hard to kill.  In the first region of the map, I'm level 30, but the opponents are already 4 levels higher, which is a huge level difference.  The stash allows for you to switch items between your characters, like in Borderland 2.			"

												(before reading my review, my online time is low  because i play all my games offline and by myself and almost never play in online mode)Sacred 2 gold is actually one of the very first games i ever bought on steam and by far at that time the largest in file size! like 12-15GB and i had to install it using a 10GB per month cellular data plan, needless to say it took awhile to get it installed but i am very glad i did. Sacred 2 Gold is a hack and slash action role playing game with a focus on building your own character from a variety of classes and accquiring,using and selling insane amounts of loot from weapons to armor even jewels and everything in between all while being driven ahead by one of the largest asortments of quest that i have seen which will take you all across a massive fantasy landscape populated by never ending enemies. Now while this sounds amazing that is just the base game but this is a combination of all that plus 2 addons the most notable of which is called ""fallen angel"" which introduces new classes and gives you the option to play as a dark and evil villain choosing to plunge the world into the reign of a eternal dark god! In edition to all of this the overall general feel of Sacred 2 Gold is like that of massive MMO except all for you to enjoy in that reguard completely solo and offline in all of its simulated feelings of splender. So with all of the basis covered i am sure this can help you decide if Sacred 2 Gold is a ARPG adventure that you would like to embark upon whether it be on the PS3 version, the Xbox 360 version or the PC version all 3 are the same fantastic game and i guarantee you will not regret your time once you start looting and questing!

												Sacred 2 is an open world hack-n-slash RPG. While there are many games like that this one does it well. The game does not take itself seriously, first off. A lot of things you will come across try to wiggle a joke or a smile into it, though not to the point of it being immature... it just does a good job of letting you know its a game, if that makes sense.Its an open world so you can go [mostly] any place pretty much anytime. You are not bound to the regions. There is no level locking. Enemies will generally scale to you but there are indeed regions where you need to have serious gear and have a decent build to take them on.The other aspect of the game, which is my favorite, is its size. This game is 22 square ♥♥♥♥ing miles. Even the large area 'in the mountains' can be accessed by a kinda hidden portal. To put this in terms most gamers can understand: the world is about 5% larger then Skyrim. On top of that you don't move like a dart. This may seem daunting, but each location is PACKED with just tons of hand placed props. It creates a world that looks and feels alive. Tons of easter eggs. Tons of hidden loot caches. Tons of things to explore and see over 12 areas ... including 500 quests.Ya... lots of quests. Nothing very engaging, and if you take too many (which is easy) you can start to not remeber the details of the quest/ chain clearly. But I find the strong points of the game to be exploration, combat, loot, and character building. The combat is simple to learn and fairly simple to master. But somehow its just so flippin rewarding. The monsters you fight are well done and there's just so so many different kinds... I don't mean black wolf/ blue wolf. I mean detailed completely different. So that adds to the fun element of exploration. And bosses are exceptionally tough!On max settings with physics on high this game is PRETTY. And its amusing. And kinda addictive. But it feels laid back in a way somehow.-------------Now outta the box this game is buggy. The company who made it went under, so there are no online official servers or future patch support. HOWEVER! the community of super smart loyal geek fans created a community patch that fixed crashing, memory leaks, and overall stability. It adds new weapons, armor, item sets, and even quests. It does a few more things like always make enemies scale to your level (before there was a min/ max level enemies had... now everything is your level or higher!). If you buy this game then find the community patch. Its essential.You can play online LAN via a program that is free and simple to use: Tungle. There's not a HUGE community that plays active 24-7 but you can host a server for your friends or join up to play with some friends you didn't know you had!The other downside to the game is that if you wanna play on hardest setting (eventually) your build is essential. On easier settings (where you have to start every character) its hard to mess up a build. But as you level and start on higher difficulty tiers... ya, you can get squished easy. Why this is a downside is because you cannot respec your build. All skill points, attribute points, even combat art runes you use cannot be exchanged. I did a bit of digging and was able to find a caharacter editor. So if I get screwed later I can switch around my skill points. Its that or re-do 100 hours ^_^The last bit is the camera and movement keys... W and S move forward and back but A and D turn you. This can't be changed to FPS-like controls. Camera is top-down but you can zoom in a bit behind your character and look around. You attack where you click/ mouse direction. Was a little different for me and hard to get used to. Also the default camera angle is crap. You may wanna use google to change some settings in an ini file.-----------So despite the lack of new content for Sacred 2 its a sound game with TONS to do over 22 square miles and multiple difficulty settings. Randomly made loot... and tons of it! This is an RPG where its a lotta fun to both level up and spend time looking over gear to tweak your build. No official servers but LAN co-op is indeed fun still. But its shining achivement is the amount of detail put into every place.If you like huge long game worlds, loot, and action RPGs that are not too serious I would encourage you to buy this. A $20 price tag IS a bit much so wait for a sale. The game performs its best once a few tweaks (listed above) are applied.4.7/ 5  ...nearly perfect! I just wish there were more combat spells per each character class and a way to change item appearance.			"

												With well over 600 total quests in this open world it is still one of the most enjoyable game to play. To see as much of the world as possible it does take time, it was never made to be a quick hack and slash rpg but this is more story and adventure rpg. On newer windows it is quirky to start the game at times but even with the bugs it is still a great game.			"

												I'm not exactly sure how I managed to play this for so long, but apparently I played for nearly 50 hours before burning out on it. This game is basically a single-player MMO. I did enjoy the wide range of character builds and items, and how huge the world is, but.. that's really all this game has going for it. The plot is nonexistent, the enemies lack diversity, the battles are pretty much just you spamming the same skills repeatedly, and the quests are bland to the point where you'll pretty much forget what you were doing halfway through.Yet.... 50 hours. And I was hoarding items for other classes for use in future playthroughs. I may yet replay this, but I've no idea why.			"

												Not sure how to put this... Glitchy, terrible tutorials, not completely optimized for any system, horribly tacky story line... Cliche characters... Yet I loved this game! Paid $20 dollar for it to never work properly on the PC and yet I really don't regret purchasing it. I spent so many hours playing this game on Xbox with friends and simply couldn't get enough... Maybe it's dated, maybe it will never work on windows 10, but it's the nostalgia that having this broken addictive grind fest and memories of all the laughter and challenges with friends brings. Would pay $20 for a $14.99 game that never works again! Thanks Steam!			"

												One of the best rpgs I've played in a long time, I was astonished when I picked up my first copy on xbox360, and I'm happy to say I still think it's as awesome as I remember it to be!The graphics (on pc ofc) are actually quite good and even holds up against some rpg's to this day and the gameplay is incredebly addictive. And don't get started on the quests, over 600 side quests!! (most of which are what you'd expect though, boring kill this and that quests or gathering quests.) I played this a lot back when it first came out to the xbox360, but it's soo much better on pc. (actual keybindings etc..) Worth the money!			"

												This game has a crazy amount of side quests - hundreds and hundreds of little side quests. Most of them are rather uninspired, but some are really cool. You can really sink a lot of time into this game, and since your character develops new skills and you find new places with different monsters/enemies, it stays interesting for a long time.The world is huge! Loved it.			"

												I highly recommend this game.  Its jam packed with content, has a HUGE game world to explore.Theres even mounts you can buy to ride around the huge game world with that get their own abilities. The best way i can sum this up is its like diablo with actual quests and a storyline to it.Theres still all the hack and slash you love in ARPGs but alot more. I wont say its an amazing storyline or anything like that as i havent finished it yet so i dont honestly know ill probably update this review once i beat the game and let you know. I will say though I truly feel this game is a work of art and sacred 3 i havent played it yet but i heard they broke the formula from this one and the first one and thats  shame because this is a really great game. Now onto the downsides, there are some flaws its not a perfect game. If you alt tab out of the game and tab back in sometimes it drops the framerate a LOT. I solved this by playing in fullscreen windowed mode. I did this using a utility called fullscreenizer. You can find this also if you google it. Great utility.  The AI of npcs that follow you is pretty borked, they get hung on things, quests get broken etc. But theres a community made patch you can google and download that fixes most of the issues. Id post the link to it but steam would probably remove it. Its pretty easy to find if you google though. The game also has lots of hidden humorous things to find throughout the world. I dont want to say anymore than that because i dont want to give spoilers but some of its at least in my opinion is pretty hillarious. Youll be surprised what you run across in this game lol, thats all i can say. It doesnt take itself too seriously at all which is a good thing.  Also for a game that was made in 2010 it has held up really REALLY well as far as the environments, I think they really still look great for what they are. I know a lot of people will disagree, thats just my opinion like all reviews, just peoples opinion. Trying to think of what else i can say. Basically if you can get this game on sale, definitely pick it up or even at full price its worth it. It has some age on it but all in all a good solid game.			"

												7/10Not as good as Sacred 1 Gold.I liked how they upped the graphics but the view/camera mode in this game was horrible.The thing I disliked the most was the fact that there are no longer any big bosses like dragons all over the map for you to kill. The only way to kill such a creature is to complete the main story line which allows you to kill certain bosses. Which I personally thought was lame. There's less freedom in just roaming around the map to kill what ever you want since you're forced to do the main story line in order to kill dragons, golems, krakens, and other boss like creatures.

												Sacred 2 is a great game.I loved playing it for hours on the console and it's even better on PC.There are only two things wrong with Sacred 2.-It's extremely hard to launch, requiring fiddling with the files every time I want to launch it.-No multiplayer outside of LAN. (And it's still balanced for Online Multiplayer. I.E. No Reclassing)Still, if you don't mind plunging into the files every time you want to launch (Or your operating system can run it as-is), it's a great game.			"

												A long time ago I tried playing Sacred 2.  It was so hideously unstable that it couldn't be played, not with whatver setup I had back then.Time has moved on and I've managed a good five hours of play with only two crashes.  Once in the main menu and once whilst trying to defeat whats-his-name the giant kobold boss.  Unfortunatey it turned out that Sacred 2 seldom autosaves and I lost two levels and a whole lot of loot there.Now I'm not that upset about it - for four dollars I got a decent five hours of enterainment.  It's just that I can't easilly recommend it either.The camera is still a broken mess; even after editing the option's file.  The fog is too close, the voice acting is terrible (but in an endearing sort of way).  There's very little to the game beyond kill X number of things, go back for reward.  There's also very little variety between items: generally variations on damage or armour with maybe a change to a stat or two.This is grindy clicking at it's best.  You'll not find any tactical depth beyond left-click, right-click, left-click, right-click.  If you're not a completionist you'll probably get some enjoyment from Sacred 2 but if you're looking for the next Neverwinter or Diablo you'll only be disappointed.			"

												Best h'n's on paper and in practice.I played a lot of them in the last few years and can count maybe 3 best ones. Sacred 2 Gold is one of them.All classes in the game are good to play for me, even though I'm not a fan of melee anymore and mages are not fun in long playthroughs.I love the feature that make every lower level enemy neutral to your character. So much time saved... plus teleports access everywhere.Crafting is great (good support for Sets hunters), alchemy too,  all skills and combat arts useful, camera works as well (lot of game are ruined by camera control).And dungeon crawling part is really fun. Game is surprisingly more ""netbook friendly"" than other titles (that I don't dare to point out), especially with Community Patch. Only problem so far is that I need to shut down Steam via Task Manager because game still have Running status when you exit the game and nothing worked to solve this.EDIT: and it solved itself. Some people have that thing and either nothing works or it fixed itself or by using few tweaks (like reinstalling Physx).Honestly it's minor inconvenience and it's worth to get this game, especially when next ones (Sacred3) are...differerent and not that good.

												This was the first game I played on the XBOX 360, and i never saw any DLC, sadly. When i got back from Basic Training i had the money and I got this game. The 2 New Regions are kinda fun to play and, the Dragon Mage is a good character to play as. All in all the PC version is better than 360 cause atleast on PC The game doesn't crash when you have 4 characters at lvl 200. I don't know if the 360 has the Unique mounts, but on PC You can't deny the badassery of riding in to a hoard of enemies on the Hellhound. So overall I would get this game.10/10			"

												I bought this game as part of the Deep Silver Humble Bundle, and I didn't have any interest in it when I bought it. However, once I got into Diablo-style RPGs, I decided to give it a try. It was better than I expected, but definitely not as good as it's competitors such as Torchlight II or Path of Exile (though I'll admit I haven't played Diablo 3). The animation is subpar, and the combat doesn't have quite the punch that Torchlight has. The RPG systems are pretty good once you understand them, but they're a little confusing at first. Where it does shine is it's ludicrously large world map, non-linear structure, and mood. You'll probably notice in the above screenshots that this game is....over the top, to be nice. But rather than try and take itself seriously like most ridiculous medieval fantasy RPGs do, it's all very light hearted and silly, which works very well. The game would be really just stupid if it wasn't for the fact that the game KNOWS that it's stupid. The embracing rather than resisting of tropes saves this game from being an crappy Diablo rip off and instead gives it a tiny niche to fill, combining the action of Torchlight with the scope of the Elder Scrolls, failing slightly but not completely and succeeeding enough but not very much at both. 5/10, will probably complete and even play through multiple times.Edit: Better than Diablo 3.

												What can I say for an old game?  The graphics aren't the best but that doesn't matter at all!  It's up to the point where it's amazingly fun, and I actually do find it fun!  For being a game made from Deep Silver, or at least I think it was released by them in 2008, I'd still say this game is ridiculously fun.  If you enjoy a top-down role play game that is like Torchlight, or the likes I'd go for it.  Lots of classes to choose from with a variety of abilities for each.  Not to mention they all have their own path of the story and alliance to a god.  If I were you I'd give this game a quick look, research and all before you actually buy it, but if you want to try it out for yourself I'm sure it won't disappoint!			"

												When I first saw this, I lost my marbles and was looking for Sacred 1 so I didn't have to watch hours of video to get through the story. As far as I know, this is a standalone title.The first thing I noticed about the game was that despite everything it represents visually, the game had no remote support, thankfully, a little fooling around with the remote and some trial and error and I have it in good with the controller, The game came off as a bards tale, just because of the annoying camera, and this is hindered even moreso by dodgy mouse controls, in rare occasions you'll find yourself tapping at one stair to get out of a bad see through stairwel. After fiddling with the camera angles a bit and tweaking the zoom I realized this game is absolutely magnificent. Unlike most looting games, this one takes the form of every one of them in a way that gives you a morrowind feeling but all of the time, whether it's a lucky store visit or another cave run your eyes are always oopen for that rare grab that'll make you drop your inventory in front of enemies just to get the item for sure. The save anywhere do anything aspect really shines when you realize you have to take a long trek again and have to do a lot of walking.I only have about 9 hours in, so I don't have too much of an opinion but I'm pretty much camping in the level 3-5 area completing all of the quests. A big problem I may face later in the game is having that rare level 2 item that's way better than the items beyond. But I'm almost certain this game will have a very nice way to go about it.If the shared box works as I would hope, you may be able to share items across all saves, making the game progress in a fairly breezy yet new way, and since you get drops of all races from the game, you may be able to start a more serious difficulty after you get rick rolled about how easy bronze is feeling. I've had one bad encounter with an ally npc... he ran in the middle of a mob with a bow... I was so mad. However no other npc has behaved that way, the npcs that don't fight actually run away and know very well and how to stay back I could sit in the inventory menu in deep thought while trolls are running amok and the npc will be seen crossing the screen staying away from enemies. It's a very nice sight. For me, This game is a deliverance. You get that mmo feel of being strong and having loads of opportunities to make armor builds with great purpose, you have gear that differs by race that drop often and are sold on an average occasion, characters that look really sharp and have cheesy one liners that go great with the enemies, who have their own. and an all around experience that will go from bards tale to a point and click mmo just by changing the camera. Edit: After about two more days I decided to change the difficulty and wanted to flip out. All of the quests were reset but my stuff was still intact, map data was intact but no portals were active. I went back to bronze, and all of the data returned. In my opinion, you should use one data to complete the story and another to enjoy the quests, This feature is probably the best I have seen, thougrh the repetitiveness will probably make you sick, this is one of those games that even when you get finished... Lol in about 4 months, youre not really finished. I have 4 days of game time in bronze and i still have about 14 circles in the large city just sitting there. And I probably wont address them until I've caught up in silver, So I can speed through bronze. This is one of those games that would make you gain hope in an era of games just because of the sheer value it gives to you. Though it is not the era, It is only this game.In another light, the way that the quests are displayed will bring out the completionist in anyone... seeing failed red circles in select spots bombarded with green is sort of depressing, as well as a log book that has 2 red Xs among chapters of pure green. So if you do a quest, make it count and don't mess up if that sort of thing bothers you. Since there are two datas, (and possaibly more) You should do well to take at least one of them seriously in an attempt to wow someone with a pure green quest map. I would reccomend it it anyone who needs a game. If they like story they can do quests, if they like a challenge, tell them to just run ahead. I'm sure everyone has paid much more for way less in this day and age. And I would hope people would want a game they would want to play after they beat it, and this game emphasizes on concepts that make you okay with playing it again. Even if it's just to be powerful and slap monsters around for a chance at seeing an item with beast stats.			"

												I am a long time fan of the Ancarian Sagas. Whether your thing is character customizing, exploration or just plain loot lust, Sacred 2 has you covered. Never run out of things to do. Vast map to explore with numerous creatures and Strong bosses to encounter. A seemingly endless array of weapons and armor to choose from. Tons of action and combat (Ganking those little gnome guys never gets old). Rewards you for exploring with its many hidden easter egg stylings and secret quests (like finding the Halls of Ascaron). Even attend a rock concert. I have beaten this game many times and still finding stuff I missed.			"

												This game suffers from a very unfortunate amount of random errors, bugs and memory leaks most of which can't be fixed at all. Even though there are countles forum posts and youtube videos claiming they have a way of fixing random crashes - none of the ""fixes"" actually work on a x64 system (which is pretty much any PC that's not 10+ years old).And even if you're lucky not to bump into any major crashes (some people can't even start the game) - there's always the core bug that makes the game crash 100% when it reaches aprox 1,3-1,5 Gb of RAM. It's the way the game is coded and if running on a x64 system it WILL crash due to the way it handles RAM allocation for game assets. There is no way around it.At one point there was even a ""4gb ram"" fix which just breaks the .exe file nowadays so even that's not an option any more.It's so sad since the game looks brilliantly, feels epic and the maps are HUGE and insanely detailed with amazing eyecandy effects.So - if you're planing on playing Sacred 2 - get a x86 OS, preferably WinXP/7 because apart from crashes and mashing your head against the table - you won't have much fun :(			"

												The game has an obvious design flaw inherited from the Sacred 1 and multiplied. Loads of forced trash mob fights and level scaling enemies. I waited few years before playing the sequel to have all them patches and a calm look at it, but sorry. They did nothing to make the formula better - in fact they multiplied everything that was making Sacred 1 a subpar game.I've realised just how gamebreaking it is, started to run through everything... Then I asked myself: ""why bother?"" If the whole game is based on a flawed formula that was needed to be obviously fixed, implying the lack of sense of character progress. Almost every h'n's avaible today is better. Damn, even Torchlight 1 is more fun.			"

												A very charming ARPG with uncommon mechanics and a lot of bugs.The story is somewhat bland and the game is a little too repetitive, but I love replaying it from time to time. It's a fantasy universe making fun of fantasy tropes. It doesn't take the genre too serious.A fine game to kill time when you are bored. Its structure reminds me of a ""single player MMO"".I recommend installing the Community Patch.			"

												This game has a very big open world and alot quests to do. Main story quest is more of a key to unlock new areas however it doesnt make game less fun. You can roam freely around the world of sacred and await what other mysteries you are about to find. There is quite specific skill system that allows builidng character in diffrent ways and also lack of mana bar in this game makes it a bit diffrent. There is also a special accent of joke in the game. The developers made characters be sometimes even mean which is hilarious. There is also one more thing. Developers took care of slightiest details which makes this game have quite beautiful lanscapes. Lots of gaems in that genre or not that are sometimes underrated also use map system. The problem  is that most of developers have time and funds to do a proper job but skip most of details leving their maps nearly empty. Thats not what happened with sacred. What bugs me is escort quests and the amount of mobs that spawn. Sometimes i want to simply walk around but i end up with 20 mobs to kill. Additionally the battle music keeps changing alot, it could become annoying after a while. If you wanted to listen to area music you would have to stand still and better do it in a town. About the escort quest, the ai seems to be quite bugged. For me they only follow me and do nothing, but i heard that other players encounter overly aggresive ai who ends up running away from sight so far it gets teleported back.			"

												Sacred 2 is an okay rpg with a pinch of humour, tons of items to find and and what looks like endless quests everywhere, big map to explore and decent graphics to join everything togheter. However is in the quests themselves where the game feels dull, many quests dont make sense and most of the time you wont know whats going on, many are very dull making you backtrack a lot, and jesus the npc you have to protect and take somewhere will always find a way to get killed 10 seconds after getting the quest, even if they are supposed to be warriors (first ""companions"" tutorial), they just go in and try to melee things or just run into the middle of the enemy horde for safety... overall i think this game is a solid 7 diablo style game so it is worth for the low price tag it carries now.

												I liked this game and would ask everyone to try it if not for the myriad of bugs that plague it. It's fun but from windows 7 and up, you're gonna need to do some manual fixes to get it working and even then it'll often crash. I can't play for more than 15 minutes before crashing and sometimes less. It's a shame that the devs decided to ignore all the problems but it's a fun game nonetheless. I moderately recommend it.

To be completely fair. you can definitely tell within 2 hours if youll enjoy the game beyond that. so returning is an option. odds are if youre even looking at this youre interested in the game. i assure you its solid. try it.

												This game is great. It has a massive open world(see screenshot below) with tons of quests and so many different sets of gear and weapons. Customization of your characters is quit deep. It is surely worth picking up since it is so cheap. I own multipule copies of this, the original pre Steam version, PS3 version and The Gold edition on Steam(picked it up in a humble bundle for $1). Can still be played multiplayer with VPN tools. If you like ARPGs and are a loot hoe this one is a must have.


Sacred 2 Gold 
A Screenshot of Sacred 2 Gold
By: Stonerton




This section is to help those who are having issues with the game:2/23/15 EDIT: Reciently picked this game up again and had trouble starting it up for the first time in ages. For those who are having trouble with windows 8 and 8.1 like I was, what worked for me is running the .exe in compatibility mode for XP SP2 and as Admin and in launch options add ""-skipopenal -nocpubinding"" (without the "" ""). Aslo I am using the community patch(0150) so I am not sure if that changes anything in making it run on 8 or 8.1, but it does fix many of the bugs in game and adds more quests and gear.3/3/15 EDIT: Turning off Steam overlay seems to fix the game game random crashes. Tested with it on and off several times and I only had the crashes when it was on.  4/6/15 EDIT: Link to fixing game launch for win7 and win 8(works for 8.1 also) for those that the 2/23/15 EDIT didn't help.  Thanks to Zethell for the fixes.

A Guide for Sacred 2 Gold
By: Zethell 💤

			A quick guide with, hopefully easy-to-understand instructions, on how to fix some of the Windows7 and Windows8 related bugs with Sacred 2 Gold. Sacred 2 very rarely work on Windows 10, there are no known fixes yet.		


5/12/16 EDIT: If you can't get the sound or text to work at all, go to C:->User->Appdata->Local->Ascaron Entertainment->Sacred 2. Create a text document callen optionsCustom. Copy paste the following: locale.language = ""en_UK""locale.speech = ""en_UK""  Thanks to Bathroom for the fix.TL:DR:  Huge open world, characrer customization to op, and lots of loot. 10/10 One of the best ARPGs ever made.

												Another great ARPG here that ended up getting abandoned way too early.  So, by the devs leaving this game for the fans to take care of that means LOTS of unfinished work and bugs!  But the community's got your back.  There a massive patch (as in content not size) that addresses MANY of the issues that lie with this title.The game has beautiful graphics.  Many have complained about it being too colorful and/or bright.  While the game is kinda bright I really liked it.  Very vibrant colors and a lot of detail went into this game.  Speaking of detail.. the learning curve is quite high.  Do some homework before starting out in the adventure and start the game in Silver.  Bronze is pointless!Most likely you'll never run out of quests to do either.  There's reports of over 500+ side quests.  Initially I was running for 100% quest run, but after 15 straight hours of doing NOTHING but side quests I let it go.  It got very overwhelming and I lost interest.  The main quests are extremely short though.  So, in order to build your toon up you may want to tackle some of those side quests.  There's 10 chapters total and each chapter has 2 main quests and 1 boss.  Exploration is like an Elder Scrolls game if you will.  You don't necessarily need to go straight to the end.  you can venture out and see what's in that dark cave you just passed up.  :)Looking for a LONG and fun ARPG?  You really can't go wrong with this title.  That is.. if you can get it to work.  Windows 7 is iffy.  When I first tried to get it to work there was NO hope for it.  Two years later (yes, 2 years) it's up and running and playing beautifully!  Worth the $20, but if weary of bugs grab it on sale.			"

												Truly an amazing third person, semi-turn based, RPG. This game has gameplay mechanics like Diablo, but goes in a completely new direction. The game isn't very serious so it's fun for casual players but can get extremely challenging by upping the difficulty to the point where it takes careful planning and strategy to get through fights. Some of the dialogue is especially humorous including a couple of quest lines which are completely joking. The classes are diverse, fighting style can change radically, and leveling is amazing. It's very free form so the player holds the power as to what THEY want to do in the game. Graphics are awesome and very fluid. My personal recommendation, if you are looking for an entertaining RPG that is massive in size, playable for probably 100+ hours, and absolutely entertaining the entire time, pick this up.			"

												2/5 - Avoid unless you're really into the seriesCut through swathes of repetitive and somewhat uninspired monsters as a scantily clad lady weilding a lazer gun! If that's all you want from a game, then give sacred 2 a whirl. Some games do the b-movie thing well, see Typing of the Dead if you want a game that nails the vibe perfectly, and while Sacred 2's qualitative shortcomings are at times hilarious, these moments did not come often enough to really keep me entertained.I might be missing the point here, but the lack of strong narrative, the ambiguous quests, terrible voice acting and implausible technological gaps between the player and your enemies made me wonder how effort really went into this game. Everything about Sacred 2 either frustrated or failed to engage me and after a good few hours I simply gave up; I didn't want to just be clicking on an endless stream of monsters with no real interst in why for any longer.While Sacred 2's character designs and progression systems have always been genuinely novel, the world that your character inhabits feels a little underdeveloped:The open world vibe is totally subverted by linear quests and map design; when you get to a new place, you walk a set path around the area like you're on a go kart track rather than exploring and engaging with it. The side quests are uninspiring and revolve around the usual getting items, rescuing trapped elves and picking herbs.The monsters are repetitive and while there are often quite a few of them to cut through, there's not enough diversity to differentiate engagements or to create any real challenges. The environments feel devoid of personality; you walk through cities of people having randomly generated conversations which make little sense; it's like being trapped inside a bad parody of a game world, which can be funny at times but it becomes tiresome quickly.The camera is oddly positioned and always left me craning my neck to see what's coming up ahead. Either when zoomed out or in I just couldn't see more than a few paces in front of me. Given that the camera follows the rotation of the player it can get a little disorientating at times, kind of like being trapped in a tumble dryer full of orcs.Maybe I've been ruined by RPGs which either do the action better (D3 & Dark souls) or the story better (Dungeon Siege 3 & Skyrim) or both (the Witcher 2), but I really am starting to expect a little more substance from ARPGs. In a market as flooded as this one I really recommend looking elsewhere, it's a shame because this title has potential but it's let down by phoned in mechanics and a lack of attention to detail.			"

												Welcome to Skyrim of hack and slash games!!!Sacred 2 is to hack and slash games what skyrim is to rpgs. A grand world filled with life where every corner,every item and every npc can tell u a whole new story if u are careful enough to listen.One of the most massive sized games i have ever played, im really not ashamed to say i thought it wasnt worth my time (i got it on humble bundle sale long time ago for 1 euro - package deal), so it just sat there unused just to shine my library of games. Having finished fallout 3 i wanted something simple to cool off and since i saw it there, i said to myself lets give it a try. And that was the moment i realized how stupid i was all this time for not giving this game a chance.Where should i even start with this game... From the moment u enter, until the moment u log out those awesome detailed graphics are the thing thats in your mind. Flowers blossom, birds fly, water is so smooth and realistic, npcs talk to u and everything feels so damn alive and stunning. Whether its a forest zone, an island, a cave or frosty peak from the tinniest rock to the grandest cathedral everything has such detail that i can honestly say it works to perfection.If u have modern age graphic cards u are in a big treat i can tell u that much. Also the music and sounds are so deeply connected to the game , that u will feel u stepped in a real life market or in a god damned brawl everytime u fight. The game gets u and pumps you up or smooths u depending on the situation. Also the character design is so freaking awesome and even more so when u will finally be  able to ride all their unique mounts :P In terms of gameplay i cant say that this title offers anything revolutionary but it goes a step further than most rpgs of this kind dare to do. Offering a unique set of 7 playable characters, this game goes beyond in what u call normal characters. Here u will find the dragon mage(the guy can turn into a dragon or summon one so thats all u need to know :P), the dryad(druid style magic and range), the seraphim(the fallen angel that can do everything), the inquisitor(like the name suggests u will burn in hell mf), the shadow warrior(the most brutal close fighter u will see), the high elf(the magician) and the temple guardian(anubis dog warrior that can use a wide range of support skills and kick♥♥♥♥♥while doing so). Each character has a unique skill tree branching into 3 seperate styles and thus can be used according to your style and needs of play. Also depending on your morality u can choose what deity u will want to follow which adds a new support mega spell for u to use in time of need. Also note that u can either chose to play the campaign as the good guy or the bad guy which is really cool considering your choices matter. Now as u move into the game itself u will notice if u press m the map. And here my friends is where the strength of this title unfolds. Everything u see can be explored and everything can be opened. When i said above that this game is the skyrim of hack and slash games i meant it. With the addition of the expansion in the gold edition of the game there are over 600 quests for u to do meaning that if u want to start now u will approximately finish around some time next summer. The map is so huge that each player can walk round and round for ages and still not opening it completely. Thats why u can teleport from great town to great town and use monoliths that act as resurrection points and safe spots for when u log out. And if u think thats not enough u can buy mounts so u can run faster than before and if u are lucky prolly use the unique mounts of each class if u got what it takes. There is a magic feel when u see in my case an angel moving on mounting a sabertooth tiger :PNow like usual if  u play hack and slash games the idea is to use your char to kill/loot and then becoming the ultimate badass hero or in this case a villain too.Thats why this game offers u over 600 side quests so u can do everything and find everything this game has to offer. Be careful though cause as u lvl up the enemies lvl up with u as well. Dont be surprised when u see a rat lvl 30 killing u if u are not too cautious and think its an easy drill. Personally im not that much into side quests but truth be told there are some that u absolutelly must do like helping The Blind Guardian group make its concert. The game satire and real life references will make u lol especially in cases like this. And dont worry if u dont side quests. U can take all the gear u want just by following the main story and killing the champion monsters along the way. Sure the side quests reward with greater loot but u wont be disappointed by the stuff u get when u play the main mission as well.Now for the not so good...In terms of storytelling the story itself is not so good, not that bad just the typical u would expect in a title of this kind. It serves nice though cause it makes u see the whole continent and experience what it means to be good or bad depending on your choice of playthrough. Still it could have been better and more polished.And the most annoying thing for most players:the use of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera. U wont know how many times i swore before i looked into to forums in order to fix it to more standard hack and slash rpgs formulas. If u dont have a problem with it then by all means skip my previous comment, but if u do search online for various guides in order to fix it. Each guide offers a different approach so be sure to check if thats your way of gaming.Overall i think sacred 2 is one of the most underrated hack and slash rpgs. U always hear about diablo(now mostly bad comments, but 2 still rocks), titan quest and torchlight and this little gem is always pushed to the side. For me it has become a favourite and i hope that if u buy it u will enjoy it as much as i do. 9/10			"

												I got this game cause i was tired of playing these MMO games that are so cluttered and annoying some of them are a joke and you cannot enjoy a good story or game without people running around like chickens with there head cut off. so i got this game and  WOW! This game surpassed my expectations, deffenatly was not expecting this game to be this good. The interface and layout of the game are simple and clean. I was expecting alot of clutter and nonsince on the interface. The story and game play seam like its going to be a very intersesting and fun story to get into. Its hard to find games as good as this now days. It kinda remindes me old Dablo 2 but waayyy better lol I deffenatly recommend this game to the action die hard RPG fans out there . Its deffenatly worth the time and money. I have been very impressed with this game so far and i cant wait to jump deaper into the gameplay. Now i only wish they made JRPG's as good as this without it being MMO.			"

												I had originaly bought the non gold edition two years ago and it was wroght with crashes and freeze ups. I was unsure about getting the gold edition as I didn't know if the same thing would happen.I am happy to day that there are no lockups or crashes with this game. I loved it when I had it on Xbox360 and now with the gold edition I get the carrier imp and the expansion.If you really enjoy Diablo and Titan Quest action RPG's then you will enjoy Sacred 2 Gold Edition. If you had the non gold like me then I am happy day that it is much more improved in stability (at least for me it is).This game is worth a play.			"

												First impression, still a good game. Bit of a learning curve with the controls. At least for me. The camera is absolutely atrocious and they need options for the HUD, I want to be able to read, shouldn't need a magnifying glass for it.The camera controls suck horribly. It is kind of annoying, but the game is still great. If you are playing the Xbox version, the camera is actually pretty easy to handle, and consequently doesn't take from the enjoyment of the game overall.The game is still fantastic. I cannot believe that they managed to screw up the franchise with the third game, had such high hopes, haha.			"

												Took me a little time to get to like this game.  At first there are so many abilities, and equipment slots, that are so diferent from any other game I ever played that it was a bit off-putting.  But once I got the hang of the skill tree, the orb, and everything, I really started liking this game a lot.  the world is gi-normous.  There is a ton of EVERYTHING in this game, real estate, equipment, mobs, quests.  This game will keep you playing for a long time.  Ascaron has shut down the official servers, but if you download Tunngle, you can play online using LAN mode.  The music triggering kind of stinks though, it won't be long and you will slide the music volume slider to zero, it's just combat music being triggered over and over until you are sick of it by level 5.  My machine is none too stout, but I can put the settings to high, and it is smooth as silk, and I didn't have any crashes like some older games.  No compatibility mode or anything.  Sacred 3 will be out soon, so I gotta finish this one to be ready.			"

Once I learned to turn off the automatic camera, how the UI and controls work, and read up a general understanding of how leveling up works, I found myself wanting to play and progress more in this game. They really give each character class a theme and lots of voice work, in addition to little making fun it own world and packed full of easter eggs and refrences to other games, books, movies, music, etc.			"

												I picked this game up as part of a Humble Bundle and as such had no expectations to fulfil.  Essentially it's a Diablo clone, it's quite long at around 30 hours to complete the single player campaign - and that's with skipping the DLC islands and pretty much skipping the side quests from chapter three onwards.  It's a big old game, I'd uncovered about half the map before I stopped playing.  I hit level 41 by the time I finished it, max level is 200 (though that is only achieveable on subsequent playthoughs at a higher difficulty level)The comabt etc gets very repetitive fairly quickly, as there is no penalty on using the plentiful healing potions you gather - your main risk of dying is from not paying attention rather than any sort of tactical challenge.My main complaint with this game is the extremely complex mechanics and poor help/documentation that go with it.  Half the challenge in this game is understanding what mechanics interact with each other and what gear is best to use.  One example; I initially took the swords skill (one of ten slots you get, I unlocked 8 in my playthrough) and invested a bunch of points in it - I then took dual-wield; expecting that dual-wielding swords would provide double the bonus as it does in most other RPGs.  Instead I found that the moment you equip two weapons, all points in the sword skill are wasted and only the dual-wield skill provides a bonus.  If you min-max and read the (limited) guides on the internet this does become clear - but nothing in the game even hints at this.Played through as a Seraphim ""Exalted Warrior"" character, if you get it cheaply and like the Diablo/Torchlight genre of games then you'll get a solid couple of days playtime out of this I reckon.  There's lots to do, but its not a very deep game - it's mostly just hack and slash with courier/kill sidequests thrown in.  A special mention goes to the NPC AI, your companions which some missions have you babysit, are the most suicidal folks you'll ever come across - they constantly run in the wrong direction pulling vast swathes of enemies and dying - I gave up on any escort missions after the first chapter.

All the races have their own main quest, and unique everything, from mounts to armor to amazing abilities.			"

												This is one of the best RPG's on the STEAM market. It is absolutley amazing; its so well developed and just full of content. There is seriously hundreds of quests to find and finish, tons of weapons, hundreds of runes/armor/items and other things to loot. Graphics are for a game that is as few years old as this they are still amazing and the developers invested so much effort in detail like with animals, trees swaying in  the wind and just making the world truly feel alive. The quests are actually really fun and storyline can be confusing like knowing what exactly is going on with the main story line but, i guess that would happen if you dont really pay full attention to the quests. Its not like Skyrim where there is cinematics to tell the story at least none that ive had seen for the hours ive played so far. Enemy AI can be challenging at times and can swarm you in numbers and make you really have to evade and attack evade and attack. Combat is smooth and fast which is what I like in my RPG's (I hate slow combat systems in RPG's). Overall if you want a DIABLO style looting & fast paced combat, Dragon Age camera view and gameplay, and a huge world like Elder Scrolls then you should def buy this game. Its takes bits of each one of those games and makes it its own unique formula for a game. Also there is a really nice character skill/attribute & leveling up system that has a great ammount of skills to unlock and upgrade as well as character attributes. Anyways I just started the game today and I already been playing it for 11 hours now according to STEAM. So for a gam to have me playing for 11 hours in one day in one single giant session is proof that this game is freaking awesome!!!Only cons I have are:Finding the exact final objective for some quests can be confusing to locateMap is so huge that it can get tiring traveling all aroundAt times it can get repetitive with how each time you are traveling from one spot to another that there is constant run in's with enemies and there can be a lot of enemies.9.5/10			"

												Well let me just say i have this game on Ps3 and i rebought it on here. Why? Well the steam deal helped. But this game was vast and beautiful. The foilage moves in the wind. The animals and water flow beautifully. Its enviroment really captures you inside it. Although the gameplay can be a bit of an annoyance at times it's a game with loads and loads of hours to play. Why should you buy it? Well if you like diablo style game with some cool characters. Now it has coop and i have no idea if it works however i believe you can use hamachi to activate a server. I haven't tried that coop yet. It also allows you to share things in a box which gives it to your other characters. You can level and gear up everyone of your characters and share the loot between them. In other words... I have a Seraphim, my sister has a Dryad and my other sister has a high elf. Whatever i get for their classes i put into the box for them so they can level their characters faster. Sometimes the map and the quests can be confusting but it's truly a fun game with very cheesy lines and fun gameplay. Blindguardian plays in the game and has a music video which really sold the game to me lol. I love it so much. I really hope some of you grab this game and try it out. They're making a sacred3 and from the looks of it, it's not as open world as this one, but i hope you guys can give it a shot.			"

I have been having issues with other games and as such was basically testing Sacred 2 expecting to have lag and frozen screens.The gameplay ran smoothly even though the graphics are really wonderful, which usually implies that a computer's resources will have a struggle.In this sense, I think Sacred 2 is a good game. Of course, the story and maps are fantastic. The views from the ground level are very realistic too.			"

Sacred 2 need some patience with camera settings (camera is totally free, but need some tweaking in game options) . Probably best open world diablo like game ever.			"

												This type of RPG is usually not my cup of tea and Ive never heard of this game until a few weeks ago (Steam Summer Sale 2014). I bought it, downloaded it, installed it and played it and surprisingly I enjoyed it! What I like about Sacred 2:=The world of Sacred, Ancaria, is massive and is riddled with side quests!  =MOUNTS!=A variety of monster types.=The towns and cities is alive with NPC walking about and occasionally talking to one another.=In the options, you can set how often your character talks! (One liners and the things they say will amuse you)=Enemies doesnt scale to your level.=The game doesnt take it seriously! (Heck, a skeleton screams ""MEDIC!"" when I kill him!)What I dont like about Sacred 2:=The camera! (Although you can change/adjust the scales but it is still limiting. Fortunately, it can be fix by using custom option)=Story (I know there is a story...I just cant find it...Yet)I shall end this ""review"" with my favourite moment in Sacred 2: I was travelling to Tylysium and I noticed that the minimap was filled with A LOT of red arrows (its an enemy indicator). To my surprise Kobolds and Skeletons were fighting each other!  "

Sometimes the map and the quests can be confusting but it's truly a fun game with very cheesy lines and fun gameplay. Blindguardian plays in the game and has a music video which really sold the game to me lol. I love it so much. I really hope some of you grab this game and try it out. They're making a sacred3 and from the looks of it, it's not as open world as this one, but i hope you guys can give it a shot.			"

												First impression, still a good game. Bit of a learning curve with the controls. At least for me. The camera is absolutely atrocious and they need options for the HUD, I want to be able to read, shouldn't need a magnifying glass for it.The camera controls suck horribly. It is kind of annoying, but the game is still great. If you are playing the Xbox version, the camera is actually pretty easy to handle, and consequently doesn't take from the enjoyment of the game overall.The game is still fantastic. I cannot believe that they managed to screw up the franchise with the third game, had such high hopes, haha.			"

												I was happily surprised to see how well Sacred 2 played on my computer. I have been having issues with other games and as such was basically testing Sacred 2 expecting to have lag and frozen screens.The gameplay ran smoothly even though the graphics are really wonderful, which usually implies that a computer's resources will have a struggle.In this sense, I think Sacred 2 is a good game. Of course, the story and maps are fantastic. The views from the ground level are very realistic too.			"

												I picked this game up as part of a Humble Bundle and as such had no expectations to fulfil.  Essentially it's a Diablo clone, it's quite long at around 30 hours to complete the single player campaign - and that's with skipping the DLC islands and pretty much skipping the side quests from chapter three onwards.  It's a big old game, I'd uncovered about half the map before I stopped playing.  I hit level 41 by the time I finished it, max level is 200 (though that is only achieveable on subsequent playthoughs at a higher difficulty level)The comabt etc gets very repetitive fairly quickly, as there is no penalty on using the plentiful healing potions you gather - your main risk of dying is from not paying attention rather than any sort of tactical challenge.My main complaint with this game is the extremely complex mechanics and poor help/documentation that go with it.  Half the challenge in this game is understanding what mechanics interact with each other and what gear is best to use.  One example; I initially took the swords skill (one of ten slots you get, I unlocked 8 in my playthrough) and invested a bunch of points in it - I then took dual-wield; expecting that dual-wielding swords would provide double the bonus as it does in most other RPGs.  Instead I found that the moment you equip two weapons, all points in the sword skill are wasted and only the dual-wield skill provides a bonus.  If you min-max and read the (limited) guides on the internet this does become clear - but nothing in the game even hints at this.Played through as a Seraphim ""Exalted Warrior"" character, if you get it cheaply and like the Diablo/Torchlight genre of games then you'll get a solid couple of days playtime out of this I reckon.  There's lots to do, but its not a very deep game - it's mostly just hack and slash with courier/kill sidequests thrown in.  A special mention goes to the NPC AI, your companions which some missions have you babysit, are the most suicidal folks you'll ever come across - they constantly run in the wrong direction pulling vast swathes of enemies and dying - I gave up on any escort missions after the first chapter.

												Sacred 2 is very *exactly* the perfect hybrid of Neverwinter Nights and Diablo II. It plays basically more like the latter, but in terms of mechanics, it's a proper RPG (unlike Diablo), with skills like Bargaining and Perception alongside your more common combat and magic skills. Character builds are highly variable and extremely customizable, and the graphics are fantastic; the character models would not be out of place in a 2013 third-person game! I picked it up on the cheap in a Humble Bundle, but it's easily worth the regular Steam price.			"

I had to go hunt for the answer and the installation items needed are included in the game folder under sacred 2 gold \ redist.. and you have to run them in order to have the game run.  PAIN2. the words in the game are so small it is hard to read them and there is no way to resize them3. this game has glitches but not rage quit ones. 4. If you like diablo and questing and loot then this is the game for you.  The amout of quests are so many I stopped reading them as it was taking so long.  5. there is no tutorial or UI walkthrough, and no clear explanation of anyhing..6.This game is still fun with a lot of beginning headache to overcome.

												I've only played the beginning area, but I've done every side quest available and I'm level 22.  You can see I've played 25 hours.  Not bad for a beginning area only.  But that is my play style.  No rock unturned.I am playing with the community patch.  Since that is all I know, I cannot compare.This game hooked me.I think it is the dungeons and the loot.There is something about optimizing your loot in this particular game that is very addictive.There are many side quests to rescue someone who has been captured.  I can do rescue missions all day.Not as much of a grind as Diablo franchise.Excellent Graphics for a top down.I don't know how people have their brightness set on their computers or what games they are used to playing, but I never found it to be too bright.  I've spent over 600 hours in Skyrim too, which is almost colorless.  I have a really nice monitor, though, so maybe that's it.Negatives:1.  Crashed on me 4 times after 3+ hours of straight gaming each time.  Honestly, you should get up and do something else before that time period rolls around, but....  Rebooting the game is extremely fast, but it put me in a weird place with not much xp/ equipment lost.2.  You are gender-locked with your classes.  The class I really wanted to play was female only.  I don't enjoy playing a female as much, so I played a temple guardian (having a blast btw).  This is a major improvement made by Diablo 3 over Diablo 1, but not is this game.3.  Once you chose a skill upgrade at level up, it is permanent.  As in, oops my finger slipped...!  Too bad, that is what you picked.  No going back and no ""Accept changes"" type of button for confirmation.  4.  As others have said, camera angles are really hard to deal with, but I have gotten used to swinging it around using the ""a"" and ""d"" keys.Hope you all have a great time playing it.  It's worth every penny I paid for it (on sale) and then some.:)I price it at $24.99 in value and give it an  8.3 / 10.PS.  I just found one of Drizzt's old swords!  Woooohooo!  (I think that may be from the community patch) "

												Action RPG must be one of your favorite video game genres, otherwise you may have a hard time looking past Sacred 2's many flaws, to be able to appreciate it for what it is. But let's start with the good things:- huge open world with various regions (swamp, desert, jungle, etc.) to explore and lots of enemies to slay;- many quests to complete;- you can level up your character up to level 200 (or maybe even higher?) and you improve its skills all the time with rune stones you loot from enemies;- cool system where your character gets bonuses the longer he stays alive (better loot, tougher enemies, improved attributes);- very good graphics that hold up even today, 8 years after the release;- plenty of loot to get, which can be automaticaly picked up with a hotkey;- looting 25,284 Gold from a rat is strangely satisfying ;)And now onto the bad things:- I don't know what kind of genius thought that (awful) battle music in a game where you spend 95% of the time in combat is a good idea;- when you take a side quest from an NPC, the thing you have to do is spoiled in the first sentence of the text, which kinda ruins the story behind each side quest. So if you want to care about the story in this game, you have to force yourself to not read the first sentence of every quest description;- quests are pretty standard and boring most of the time (kill 20 of those, loot 10 of these, escort this person there, etc.);- constantly respawning enemies can be annoying in the early game;- you have to spend some time with the camera settings if you want to make it not awful (I was able to get it to the state I'm comfortable with after looking at some guides).Sacred 2 isn't the greatest game, but I still like it a lot. For me it's a perfect game when I just want to listen to some podcasts and relax, killing some mobs and getting some loot. You might want to give it a try if you already played through some well known action RPGs but are still looking for some more.			"

												Firstly I should get this out of  the way for windows vista, windows 7 and windows 8 users in order to run this game on your systems you will need to set compatability mode to windows xp sp3 then the game should run just fine. For those of you who have played the first Sacred I think you will find this game to be a very pleasant upgrade to the last one. Graphically pleasing to the eye along with nice game mechanics contribute nicely to a typical Diablo type rpg run. Charactor classes are varied enough to make wanting to try several differing class type a game in itself. overall I would give this game a 3 out of five.			"

Well aside from the basic Diablo type of gameplay, there's an open world the size of a small continent, multiplayer, mounts, secret loot, & music by Blind Guardian (power metal) plus a cheap price too. Only sad thing about this version is that there's no controller support, played hours of this on the Xbox360 & the controller makes it a lot better. That being said it's a ton of fun & recommended.

												One of the better Diablo-esque games out there.  A large and beautiful open world with suprisingly good performance acts as the backdrop for a well-designed loot-fest.  The loot is highly varied and interesting, a point many other games fail to achieve.  The character building is complex and interesting, although it is not explained very well making it too easy to mess up if you are not informed going in.  Mobs are varied, but few have interesting mechanics.  Bosses are easily the game's weakest point, doing nothing more than the typical over-sized, heavy-hitting bruisers.			"

												I know my current playtime SEEMS small, but the truth is I played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Sacred 2 Gold on a copy before it was released on Steam.  I played through the entirety of the vanilla game, over 60 hours, and let me tell you, I loved every single minute of it.This is hands down the absolute BEST hack n slash rpg I've ever played.  The graphics are smooth, crisp and well made, the combat is tight, the skill and combat art system is engaging and rewarding, there are literally THOUSANDS of quests to complete, monsters to slay, and loot to acquire, and there's a surprising amount of good, Larian-style humor here and there.  Did I mention that the world is MASSIVE, likely TWICE the size of the original Sacred, Undeworld included?Oh yeah, and the fan community is one of the best I've seen.  It is incredibly helpful and eager to help new players ease into the game.Speaking of which, let me end on a PSA.  If you end up buying this, DOWNLOAD THE COMMUNITY PATCH.  Not only does it fix a multitude of bugs, but it also adds a TON of new content to a game already full of it, such as new items, new quests, and new enemies to fight!			"

												If you like loot collection simulators along the lines of Diablo, you should appreciate Sacred 2. However, unlike Diablo, Sacred paints a world as whimsical as it is dark and menacing. Sacred 2 is also an open world game, and there is a massive world to explore. You can also obtain class based mounts, which really makes traversal a lot less laborious. Did I mention the copious amounts of loot? If you're a loot goblin like me, you owe it to yourself to check out Sacred 2!			"

												Sacred 2 Gold Edition stay one of the best hack'n'slash of all time.Highly recommended for all who want to play open world.+ Awesome huge open world+ Tons of quests : you'll probably never complete all quests in same run+ Complex leveling : build your rpg class with caution (you can't max all stats/skills/disciplines)+ Campaign : follow campaign quests to unlock all regions or do all side quests to level up fast+ Forging system : add materials/item into slots item+ Sharing stash : you can easily share your loots (except money) between your characters+ Set system : complete sets to gain extra benefits, exclusive sets by class depending on disciplines you use+ Mount system : basic horses & exclusive epic mount (1 by class with many variant)+ Bosses challenge : many bosses to kill+ Replayability : unlock more difficulties level on each sucessfull run.+ Achievements (in-game only that mean not on Steam)+ Multiplayer : local only using hamachi/tunngle, better XP in multi+ Community Patch (CP) : awesome CP 1.4 with many langage support, i recommend it greatly+ Enhanced graphics version : it exist one to enhance your visual experience from game.+ Last game from Sacred soul from Ascaron : Sacred 3 is just insult to all Sacred fan don't buy this♥♥♥♥♥♥- Bad mouse controls : better to move using keyboard than using mouse- Sucking camera : camera suck in dungeons- Limit character cap (level 200, 911 skills points max to spend)- Mobs level cap (can be modded to avoid or use CP 1.4)- Official servers down- Unfinished game because Ascaron bankrupted before Sacred 2 release (CP 1.4 avoid lot of problems from this unfinished game)Never buy Sacred 3 because it isn't Sacred soul created by Ascaron. Only fake to rob your money without open world.			"

												What can I say about Sacred 2? It's awesome? Yes! A bunch of loot, quite challenging and addictive, it will suck you in into its world and won't let you leave until you get to that point where you can no longer say ""One more level"". However, considering that Sacred 3 should be coming out later this year (2013?), I think you should wait and see. The only thing Sacred 2 lacks is that production value that other, more modern ARPGs have.			"

												Good things about this game don't completely outshine its faults in my opinion. So lets start with some good stuff, the game has plenty of monsters and dungeons with a lot of variety and they die nicely animated gotta love ragdoll effects in these type of games! Further more the world is plenty big with plenty of quests and gear that gives you lots of space to explore and to kill stuff. Also the combat is kickass and feels action packed and like you are really combining your best moves to kill the enemy quicker this includes the skill system and the combat system. Then there is mounts which i seperately mention just here. Bad things about the game are the boring quest, my god stop the boring quests please. Also a lot of walking around between quests and quests where people follow you and you just gotta bring em somewhere like wtf? Also the walking is slow and you got no fast way to travel in dungeons where you cant use your mounts. Again lots of walking. I don't know how it is for other chars but with the seraphim aoe seems to be lacking a bit, not that it matters since they die in quick succession. Game sometimes crashes even with the gold edition, not often though luckily in my case.Little bit about me, i love hack and slash games like diablo and grim dawn and stuff but really this sacred thing got me exited because of its fresh story line and graphics and new combat system with combos and stuff. I played the first part as well and loved it. So if you love this type of game then why not play it, altough i warn you might get bored before you get anywhere.			"

												The game could be nice if something would be don with its horrible map design and non-existent quest tracking. I'm 8 hours into the game, lvl 12 and I'm still running around level 2 wolfes, trying to find questpoints. Running 5 minutes in the direction of the minimap arrow points to only to run into an unclimable hill or river. OK. Backtrack, while fighting hordes of lvl3 bandits and lvl5 Kobolds (1 EXP for each). Mounts? Well, 8 hours in the game and they add maximum of 3% to my speed. Very frustrating experience of running around for hours without any target or feeling of progress. Probably will drop this one.Update:I'm 16 hours into the game. Managed to understand the quest tracking system. But the game is soooo repetitive and boring... Didn't try multiplayer, but single player is just not worth the amount of time it takes. I really wanted to like this title, but... No, thanks. Dropped.			"

												Great game, but has its flaws.ProsInteresting, exciting open world to explore, reminiscent of the Elder Scrolls games.A good sense of humor; the game doesn't take itself too seriously.Beautiful graphics and art. I especially love the menu background: it's unique and pleasingly-grotesque.Lovely ambience. The details are great, such as the musicians and conversations from people heard in towns.Plenty of side quests to do.A variety of different characters to choose from, with many different skills, weapons, and other loot.Decent controls.ConsThe camera can be bad and requires a lot of fiddling to get it to your individual taste (at least in my case).The font is absolutely awful. On large screens it can be nearly unreadable and tiny. It is difficult to change the font and there are no options provided to change the UI size. This makes the game way less enjoyable to play, when I have to squint to read just about anything!The game is confusing at first. Aspects of the game aren't really explained very well. I'm 6 hours in and I'm still not 100% sure what runes do!Customizaton of character appearance is a bit limited. All of the classes are locked at one gender, and some only offer one hair style.Again, I cannot stress enough how bad the font is. My eyes still ache from all that squinting...Overall, a pretty fun experience with a few annoyances. I would recommend picking this game up, especially when it's on sale.			"

												Pros...-Big world to roam around and explore-A lot of quests; main storyline and side quests to keep you busy-Armour and weapons have their own designs (RPG rules dictate more skin = more defense,)-Gorgeous graphics-Campy, self-aware humor in the form of intentionally bad writing, voice acting and dialogue-Always stuff to slay and make you feel tough like the big, bad, skimpy Seraphim you are-Class customization with special traits, perks and four skill/ability trees for each classNeutral?...-A lot of quests are just ""go here and kill X"" or ""go there and gather X"". It generally works but can get tedious having to fight your skimpy butt through half of the continent to loot a stone or something and then sprint your skimpy butt way all the way back for an often mediocre reward.-Character ""classes"" are gender locked. I didn't care about this, but I recall it being a common complaint from critics.-Too easy. Bosses basically have a lot of HP. Just slash away.Cons...-The camera is atrocious. Good lord.-The AI is abysmal. Escort missions suck; for example, I had to escort a villager to his sister. He would dart clear across the map, aggro a bunch of crap, runs in another direction, aggroing MORE stuff, by the time I finally FOUND him, he was dead and I failed the quest. Don't expect other escort missions to be better.-No Steam Cloud supportOverall, it's an enjoyable hack n' slash and worth picking up, but I would recommend doing so on a sale.			"

												Know before going into this game that it has an aboslutely horrible camera, and the adjustable view ranges from ""sort of top down but kind of hard to use and clunky"" to ""I'm trying to use a third person camera but I can't see more than a meter infront of my character"".Apparently you can modify it in the config in the root directory but it's not very well documented at all.The game was designed like this because the developers apparently didn't want to make a resource-intensive skybox and distant view? So you're stuck forever admiring the ground and struggling to guess what's infront of your character. (Have they ever heard of mapping techniques that let them get around that? There are plenty. :V)I guess there's a game? I couldn't tell. I stumbled around and managed to kill some random elves that attacked me for no reason, and then found one that mysteriously ignored the aggressive elves around it. I interacted with it and the elf gave me some quest about stopping nighttime turtle egg poachers? That sounds like a personal problem.			"

												Sorry for giving a bad review on this game. It has nice graphic, the world is huge... but it is also so boring to play... No clear main quest to follow... Plenty of side quests with moderate or low interest.... No clear tutorial, and I find the map terrible to get the right direction for quests... Interaction with other characters too limited or non-existing.... you just wander, and left or right click to kill ennemies.... after a while it becomes very dull....If you enjoyed Titan Quest, you will for sure enjoy this game which is very similar to TQ (+ open world). If you were bored playing TQ like me (after 8000 killed ennemies), don t bother here.			"

												A light hearted, humorous, clunky RPG which I like to call the Deadly Premonition among RPGs. Weird character design (for such a run-of-the-mill fantasy setting), laughable animation (just take a look at that intro!), wonky voice acting, rather convoluted character attributes system, and yet it all comes together with good-looking graphics, music (Blind Guardian, hells yes!), interesting usage of physx, a bit of self-conscious humor, and a huge open world to form a thoroughly enjoyable game. Also you may notice glimpses of the good old Sacred 1 here and there. I also recommend using the Community Patch 1.50 (latest version as of now), which makes the game more stable, adds some previously unavailable items and fixes a bunch of stuff. Also check out the community guides section if you wanna change the default font and such.			"

												Sure the developers tried to make the game look pretty, but the controls are lacking. They don't give you a tutorial or explain how things work well enough. Also, the map system is horrible and so is the camera view. Then there is the fact that you  could be running forward and take your finger off W and you'd still keep moving forward. Overall, there are a lot of things wrong with this game and it's a good thing I got this on the steam sale at a low price, otherwise I would be very upset.			"

												I remember buying the original version when it first came out.  I was looking for something new to play, and the logo really caught my eye.  Ultimately I decided to take a chance on it.  Long story short it became an instant favorite.  Everything I loved about dungeon crawlers, Sacred 2 had it.  Great loot, beautiful graphics, badass characters... and that theme song from Blind Guardian was awesome.  Sadly, the original PC I played it on broke, and for some reason I could never install it on any PC I've had since.  So you can imagine how sad I was when I saw they released the Ice and Blood expansion.  Once I saw there was a Sacred 2 Gold available I made a promise that I'd buy it once it went on sale.  Luckily I was able to catch this as the summer sale was ending.I've been having a blast reliving old times, and I'm looking forward to the 100s of hours I know I'll be pouring into this game.  If you're into Diablo type games then you'll like Sacred 2 Gold (breaks my heart to see what Deep Silver did with 3; that might have killed any hope of a proper Sacred follow up D:)			"

												Very simple: get  a 2-4 pack and rock it. You will never feel bad.From a long-lived S2 player, itwould be...My review is as simple as this:YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE. These few hours on steam can barely compensate for my thousands of hours iwth my frineds on darkmatters.org in this game, and all the buildcrafting (justt visit the site and enjoy) I did on this game. And all those builds I used. So awesome.Two years of trashing, togetherness, buildcrafting, sharing... All gone. Imagine a server where you log in and people ask: hi man, what do you need? And they shower you with tons of items before you even know what the game is all about. ANY MMO community LOSES to what S2 was like.People were giving stuff out for fun. THEY had a lot, an they were gaining a lot. Nobody whined. Everybody enojyed it, and laughed. Everyone shared, and had fun.Kick the game down to an XP windows mode and have fun. I sure hope some hamachi servers can do it for you If yes, you will still love the game.Period. And I still play it in Lan/MP. And it si still awesome.			"

												Well, i have played enough to produce a solid review of the game.  If you like diablo and the constant grind then you will like this game.  I hesitate to recommend it though because it is very buggy.  It started out buggy and so I installed the community patch and I am not sure that fixed it at all in any way.  It is still buggy.  It randomly stalls for no aparent reason at all.  With that said it is a good game.  There is tons of loot to get though the pool is rather small and you notice you pick up similar items constantly.  There are many quirks with the game.  It took me forever to get use to the questing system and the UI.The game is a click click click game. Tons of clicking and killing.  I'm playing on easy because on any other difficulty there are just too many mobs.  Right now I just run through them all. I'd hate to have more that I would have to run through.  Levelling is a chore. mobs barely give you exp.  If they are 5 lvls under you, you get 1xp and you need like 10k+ to level.  There are tons of levels.  at 52 hours play on one toon, I am at level 32.  There are, I've read 200+ lvls.  The quests are all the same.  Go here, click that, turn in. Travelling is a chore even with a mount.  So many obstacles that get in the way of movement. It doesn't help the camera is finiky.  With all the negatives I am enjoying the game...it might be the completionist in me that won't put it down until I beat it or until another better game can be found.			"

												I don't usually buy games, but this is one of the legendary games that I must have. It is the only game I know that have huge open world (which the v3 sadly will not) that doesn't need any loading. Yeah, you can roam freely without ever loading. Some fun weaponries can make you smile. Some quests hillarious and some make you want to switch side (resetting the hero) because of the moral.Beware, though, this game have glitches in here and there. But, I used to play this game just to roam and screwing up. At that time, I got those funny weapons. And if you listen, NPCs make funny sounds. :)			"

												Great loot based RPG with awesome spells and graphics. It is a little easy to master and become overpowered but still fun to play just to pass the time away. A pirk to the game if you care is the sexy models and armor sets. The dungeons and bosses are easy to do over and over simply by restarting the game and choose the open gameplay setting in multiplayer. COOP is fun too but I think LAN support is only available now not over the internet which is a shame. Playinga a friend or friends is very fun indeed. Overall the game is good. In my honest opinion even though it is older the first Sacred game without the expansion set, if you can get it, is way better and more difficult even though it is more of an old school click and go RPG. Both Sacred and Sacred 2 games are a thumbs up for me. The price itself makes them worth playing.I just read some reviews and the camera can be adjusted in the game settings. You have to adjust them so they are right for you and that may take several times until you finally realize what each slide bar does for the camera. Any game like this will be motion sickness. If this is a problem for you don't buy it but it is certainly tolerable for me. The graphics too may need adjusting several times. My recommendation is to never turn on the Physics option. That crashes the game and you really don't need it.Price still = worth a buy. Enjoy.			"

												Managed just 4 hours on this game before deleting it.  Camera is one of the worst I've had the misfortune of experiencing - keeps changing angle to put you or your enemy behind a wall; and the view range is limited to begin with.  AI and player pathing is suspect with you or mobs running into terrain features.I got it free, but I wouldn't even waste my cash or harddrive space on it.			"

												Game crashes at startup. Setting compatibility mode, run as admin, installing community patch... Nothing helped.Steam should no sell (and remove) non-functioning games. Or force the publishers to update their games. Buying older games is not safe, you might never know if they are working, or they will still crash after hours of fiddling and trying to make them run.If it is being actively sold, then it needs to work, and it needs to be patched.

												Liked: * My character was pretty* Good soundtrack and the voice acting was decent* Character building was promising, there were a lot of different ways to build a characterDisliked: * Camera mechanics are not ideal. The character often gets stuck under bridges or runs into walls if my camera isn't aligned just right* LAN multiplayer doesn't save quest progress for either party, despite both players starting new characters* Battle mechanics are sloppy. The character often doesn't even move when I click on an enemy for an attack and sometimes the character just moves in the opposite direction. Overall, I'm upset that I spent money on a game that won't save my progress in the only mode I'll play. This was bought so that I could play with friends, but it's not fun enough for me to disregard the issues I listed above.			"

												This game is just ok, i not hooked but it isn't too bad either.Camera is crappy, some animations look stiff and map markers can be confusing as hell.It feels limited as an open world game in a sense that you can't usually do what you do in an open world game (like jumping on a cliff, ledge just to make shortcuts) like in skyrim. (yeah the comparison is a bit far, however i compare every open world rpg game to skyrim)Yet if you view this game like a mmorpg with singleplayer it becomes reccomendable, as you can basically farm items, gold, buy things, sell things, questing. (basically like diablo) and combat can be funny when your character makes remarks on your enemies like ""only a mother can love a face like that"".my suggestion is grab this game on sale to have maximum fun and less wallet gouging!

												Absolutely one of the best Diablo clones in existence, I hesitate to even call it such as it outshines it's own inspiration in almost every way. First up, the open-world of Ancaria is massive. I have well over 100 hours combined into my favorite Seraphim and Dryad characters and have yet to open every spot on the map. Next, almost everything in the world is 3d modeled as opposed to 2d sprites as in a lot of others. The variety of character personalities/classes is quite interesting if they are flashy versions of most ARPG stereotypes. I do suggest the Seraphim as she becomes a magical/divine powerhouse rather quickly. Although I'm presently hoping Steam gives me a refund on this PC version (my laptop just doesn't wanna run it), I can't imagine the Xbox 360 version being any better than PC would. Even as well as the console controls were done, the interface screams M&K. Highly Recommended!			"

												Confusing, thickly dense, with no clear direction. The update to properly 3D didn't help the atmosphere. Sacred Gold is a much better iteration of this style of game, and has the benefit of running better as well.			"

												I would love to recommend this game, but since the devs don't have any support for newer platforms/system configs this game runs so poorly on my pc I can barely even use it. Essentially it has a frame rate of about 1-5 FPS. I have an i7 2.80Ghz  Processor, with 8GB of DDR3 ram, as well as an ASUS ATI Radeon R9 with 4GBs of dedicated GDDR5 VRam as well, so no issues with system specs, just an old game with no future support. I bought the game a year ago, barely played and then when I finally decided to play it I could not get it to work at all. Would like to though as I had this back on the 360 and it worked great and loved it. Shame the only support I found was a community patch that took about 3 hours to download over a very fast connection...and still did not fix my stuttering and fps issues. Good game, bad future support on hardware. Maybe it's a driver, but I recently even tried after another graphic update and still no good. I even asked for a refund and I was denied. So waste of money there. My recommendation...find this in the bargain bin at your local retailer for the 360 or the ps3, save your $15 bucks for something else.			"

												It bothers me not recommending this game. You can clearly see that the developers invested a huge amount of time and love to make this game.The world is huge, with no loading times except when entering specific dungeons. There are deserts, greenlands, mountains, swamps, jungles, pretty much a full global ecosystem. There are so many different kinds of creatures that I dare say this is the ARPG with the greatest foe variety ever made. Everything from huge, oldschool dragons to advanced robots imbued with magic will stand in your path. Talking about path, you can play either the good or evil campaing, with objectives, characters and locations varying for each one of the paths you choose. Every character class has its own huge set of habilities, starting place, mount and equipment type. There is enough customization to get you theorycrafting for quite a while when building your character. The story isn't the best around, but it gets you going. A sidequest chain in the first area of the game features the members of the band Blind Guardian, which will be a pleasant surprise if you dig the band. There's even a music video of the band playing to a bunch of monsters if you complete the chain quest, I should also add that one of the band's songs feature in the game's soundtrack.There was effort and love in this game's development, you can notice it. Everything is well though and has its own place in the world.Despite all this, there are also terrible mistakes. Getting the game to run for the first time will be a logistical nightmare. Depending on your rig, the game might run anything ranging from ""okay"" to ""unplayable"". It requires a lot more processing power than the graphics make you believe it will, using the Steam Overlay feature will be close to impossible and there will be crashes. Be prepared to redo parts of the game due to losing progress on crashes. No game should be released with these kinds of issues and I cannot recommend a game that comes out like this unless the rest of the game is flawlessly good, which Sacred 2 certainly isn't.I feel the need to say that, if you like ARPGs, you might still enjoy the game very much despite everything, as I did. Take a good look at some gameplay videos and try it out if you want, but be aware of what you'll be getting yourself into.Gameplay - 8/10Soundtrack - 9/10Graphics - 4/10Content - 9/10Challenge Level - 9/10Replayability - 7/10			"

												Sacred 2 Gold is a pretty generic hack'n'slash RPG in the vein of Diablo or Titan Quest, only with a more open-world approach. I have about 50 hours played (Steam didn't record some of my game time for some reason, probably related to one of the many, many crashes.)Pros:+ Lots of loot.+ Lots of ways to customize your character's build.+ Graphics can be pretty sometimes, considering the game's age.+ Some of the mounts are pretty cool looking.Cons:- Game crashes or freezes frequently because of terrible memory management code.- The main story is so forgettable and pointless that after 50 hours I couldn't even tell you what it was about.- The world could easily be called ""generic fantasy world"". There is nothing outstanding about it.- The voice acting and writing is among the worst in any game. Ever. Seriously.- The ""funny"" quests and dialogue are... not funny. The tone of the game is all over the place.- No respeccing. Want to try another build? Roll a new character.- The camera is abysmal, even when you disable the autofollow and control it yourself.- The world is far too big and often feels ""copied and pasted"". Not nearly enough true variety.- Fast travel options are weirdly placed, which means you end up running around the same areas a lot.- All quests are of the ""go here, kill these, bring these back"" type.- Almost no interactivity in the environment.- Music is short and repetitive. You'll hear the same music all the time.- Despite the plethora of skills and abilities, combat just isn't that fun.Total Dealbreakers:- The death penalty in this game is the resetting of a stat called ""Survival Bonus[www.sacredwiki.org]"" which takes hours and hours of combat to raise. If you die it goes back to zero and you have to build it up again from scratch. This stat is one of the most important stats in the game, and affects all your attributes. It's one of the most brutal death penalties in a game of this type that I've ever seen.Basically, this game could have been great, but the dev team made some really strange design decisions. Here's how I would have fixed it:+ Rewrite the main quest so it makes sense and they player feels included.+ Rewrite all dialogue. All of it.+ Reduce the world to about 50% of the size.+ Remove the most tedious sidequests (which is most of them, tbh)+ Add more enemy types and more interesting enemy behaviour.+ Allow respeccing through gold or a quest.+ Remove the voice acting entirely. Yes, it's that bad.+ Change the camera target and FoV. In fact, redo the entire visibility system.+ Allow the player to teleport to any resurrection station they have discovered, rather than just portals.+ Make survival bonus recoverable in a few hours, rather than days! +Place some stuff in dungeons other than monsters (secret passages, hidden buttons, etc.)+ Make Riding a ""special"" skill available to all builds, independent of other skills.+ Fix the damn crashing bugs!I uninstalled this game without finishing the main quest, because honestly I was simply bored and frustrated playing it. There are LOADS of far, far better hack'n'slash games out there. Play them instead.			"

												I'm sure somewhere in Sacred 2 is an interesting game. A *lot* of interesting game, by the looks of it. However, it's pretty dead-set on being as difficult to actually play with as possible. It doesn't know if it wants to control like a third-person action game or like a normal action RPG, so it decides to try both as poorly as possible. The camera, lost in the previous confusion, does it's own little thing, which usually results in getting you killed. There's a really odd feeling you get while playing Sacred 2 that comes from trying to wrestle with the controls and the camera at the same time. Is this what single mothers of twins feel like? The actual leveling up bit is different at best and utterly obtuse at worse. This is half the reason you play these games, so if you're willing to invest the dozens of hours required to actually see most of the game, I'm sure I'll make sense. Eventually.This is a nitpick, but my god, the character designs. Every female has to be sexy, and to Sacred, that means exposed panties. Not stylized, not suggested, just women literally running around in their underwear. It's like a 14 year old drew this and then a sweaty 29 year old with a neck beard animated it. What the heck.			"

												    While I loved and highly recommend the xbox 360 version of this game the PC port is awful.  Despite having many more buttons you cannot have as many skills programmed (even if you plug in a controller).  The graphics don't look as good, the controls are wonky somehow.  I can only explain by saying the characters don't always move where you tell them to.  The camera is terrible (which is really hard to do in a top down game).    Perhaps I'm just unfairly comparing the game to the console version, but that huge and enticing to explore world seemed like such a chore here.Pros:    Same in depth and complex leveling system.  (you have a great deal of control over how your character develops)    Same random loot drop love.    Graphics aren't terrible.    Excellent music.Cons:    Everything I said in the first part.    No interesting NPCs (except maybe the band Blind Guardians).    Huge map can be daunting.    Quests are everywhere obscuring the story (if there is one)There are things to enjoy here, but it's not enough.  Pick this up in the bargain bin for your old console and enjoy it there.  Don't waste your money on this port.			"

This game might be liked by someone else, I just didn't like it. If you like battling things a lot, you might like it. It will work on Windows 8.1 but you need to modify it first.

												I still haven't finished the game, but if you are looking for diablo like rpgs or arpgs, this is not the game for you, compare to the Dungeon Siege 2, Titan Quest, Torchlight, and many others, this game is boring.Pros:-Nice graphic-The RPG system is unique, including combat arts, skills and so on, never seen a similar system before.-The Map is really big, and complicate,Cons:-Boring enemies and especially Boss fight, totally boring.-The combat feels bad, and the combat arts(attack skills if you don't know what it means) are not so cool. I'm playing Seraphin, so I don't know how other characters feels.-Too many sub quests, and most of them are boring.-The control feels buggy, at least for pc, I think it might be better if you play the console version.If you are a RPG fans, want to experence a unique system, and want to explore a massive map, this is the game for you. But if you want to experience immersive combat, and care about the feeling when you cut the enemies, I don't recommand this game to you, go for the other games.			"

												There are some excellent elements in the action RPG Sacred 2, but they are overshadowed by several serious problems.  The character classes are interesting, the progression choices to customize your character's operation are superb, itemization is good, and the world is large.  As for the bad: it is extremely tedious to find and travel to quest objectives which is made worse by several related bugs.  It is difficult to select targets, even with a PC mouse.  The isometric view is more top-down than a looking-ahead view angle; this hampers navigation and prevents you from seeing and targeting enemies.  The game lacks a tutorial to introduce game elements, though I was able to eventually figure most things out through trial and error.  I spent about six hours with this game, but I'll be uninstalling and will not return.			"

												I tried to play this game, I really tried to enjoy it. The writing is utter garbage, with absolutely no immersion. Usually, arpgs rely on good loot systems and interesting combat mechanics to make up for it. This game has a horrible loot system and the combat is extremely boring. Especially in the endgame, its all about chance to hit and chance to be hit. If you get unlucky you can die instantly because your enemy landed 2 20% hits in a row. Conversely, you can stand there missing 10 hits in a row without being able to do anything about it, bosses are exceptionally bad offenders here. There are so many broken things with this game that not only do I not recommend it, but I think its absolutely trash. When there are arpgs like grim dawn and path of exile out there, just don't bother with this nonsense. I liked how it did mounts, and the first silver difficulty playthrough I did was ok, but after that I just can't be bothered to play it anymore. The sidequests feel extremely unrewarding for the most part and even though there are more than you'll probably ever do, it only makes the game worse not better. I wish the developers actually tried to make interesting content rather than just gobs of it, because as it is now I just don't care about the content I haven't explored.I'm going to uninstall this game for certain, and never come back to it. At least it did the job of filling in for poe before it came out, and it reminded me how terribly executed games can get. I'm not saying that there is nothing good in this game, but everything good is just completely overshadowed by its problems.			"

												I've never played Sacred or Sacred 2, but I've heard of the title - and it's always received good praise from websites, magazine, and players alike. With the game recently going on an 80% sale,  despite the game already being over six years old (as of this writing), it seemed worth taking a look. Sacred 3 is set to release August 2014, and I thought it was about time to see what the interest is.I enjoy playing ARPG games such as Torchlight, Diablo, Path of Exile, etc. Sacred & Sacred 2 is compared to Diablo and Diablo II due to its play style, and genre categorization. It's also known that Sacred 2 is pretty much referred to Sacred 1.5, without a large development jump from title to title.I'm sure this game was somewhat innovative and exciting to play in 2008, but sadly I feel that the game is better left to the ages in fond memory - especially for those that played & enjoyed it. The game feels like a bad console port to PC, and the controls / camera made the game feel disjointed. There was a lot of texture popping, and combat didn't feel very engaging in the early stages.The game also doesn't do a good job of being intuitive, and the game UI feels very foreign. Perhaps at one time there was a game manual included with this title, but the initial lack of a tutorial to explain combat - or UI functions was disappointing. Thankfully I've the aptitude to read, and learn quickly - but I can see the first-time player/new player being confused; Hopefully this sort of system doesn't make its way into Sacred 3.The bottom line is that new players (such as myself) should steer clear of this title, even at significant discount from Steam. Unless you're one of the other type waxing nostalgic for the title... Avoid this mediocre game. There are much better ARPG choices out there to choose from. Trust me.			"

												To me, the Sacred series has always appealed to a very particular kind of player.  Too much of this game feels like a constant string of fetch quests with boosts to stats and gear so incrimental that inventory and skill management begins to feel like a second job.  I feel that there is just most to this game that I am somehow missing, because enough people keeping buying into this series to justify Sacred 3 on top of 2.  So really, I can't rag on Sacred that much.  It's just one of those series that doesn't push my buttons.If you've played and loved the first Sacred, this will likely be right up your alley.  If you played and got bored on the first go around, you might just want to move onto the next title on your wishlist.			"

												The game is fun, and I will keep playing it, but I can't recommend a game that is THIS buggy after numerous patches and an expansion. Official support for this game shouldn't have ended when it did because it's an absolute mess. Frequent crashes, freezes, and my character getting stuck for no apparent reason ruin the gameplay experience. All in all it's a damn shame because when it works, Sacred 2 is pretty great.			"

												I want to say that I love this game. I loved playing Sacred 2 on my 360 or PS3 back in the day. If you can find it on whatever console you like I'd prefer you play it there and not from Steam. The game is so broken it took me an hour to get it to even open, then it would crash whenever I opened it, then it would open in the wrong resolution and crash when I tried changing it, then it just crashed randomly, the cursor would appear in the wrong spot, the game would freeze and the only way to close the game was to force restart my computer. When I finally did get the game to run for more than 5 minutes I had a hard time getting used to the god awful controls, which you can change, but my game would freeze and crash when I tried.The game is broken on steam, play it on console if you can find it.

While it has some interesting ideas, and isn't completely unplayable, you're better off with almost any other entry in this genre.  + Impressive pathing.  Click almost anywhere, and your character will find their way.  +- Free Camera+- Skill lines.  Interesting but limiting+- Old graphics with decent performance+- Move with WASD, but steers like a vehicle- Clunky controls and UI- Strange shared CD system- Convoluted skill upgrading system- In coop, only one player can hear quest dialogue- Coop doesn't save quest progress unless perfectly synced- Multiplayer is shutdown.

												I would have enjoyed this game except for two reasons- Poor Camera angles- Lack of tutorialDon't buy this unless you're really into the series. The game starts assuming that you already know the backstories and controls. It has a ""tutorial"" but it is very poorly designed, as you'll end up figuring by yourself most of the controls and abilities.If that is not a problem for you, then I assure you, the camera will be. It is FRUSTRATING. Every step you take the camera will move on its own, and you'll end up stopping to adjust the camera to your liking, only for it to move again, out of angle. You'll end up losing your way because of the constant shift of camera angles.I really, really wanted to like this game, specially since it has Blind Guardian in it, but I ended up disliking it. Again, don't buy it unless you're into the series and you know what's up. Otherwise, spend your money somewhere else, this is not the game for you.			"

The targetting system is awful, especially for melee skills, making you dance and jitter to reach an enemy The bosses and combat is really uninvolved, just toss your skills at enemies and sit in their face, tanking/ pretending to avoid the AoEs and projectiles while downing health potions non stop The skill system increases the cooldown of every skill with armor and levels, forcing you to spend more skill points to reduce back down the cooldowns The areas are gigantic but void of anything of interest The quests are mostly meaningless and unorganized back & forths that take too much time for no reason  I've had multiple quests glitches on me and refuse to be completed The game seems to allow and be okay with murder in any situation I've seen a random guard glitch out and punch a random citizen for no reason I got my mount stuck in so many areas The area transitions sometimes teleport you twice back to the same place The game crashes at random, happened 4 times in ~20 hours The multiplayer is dead and you're forced to use a fanmade, 3rd party program to play online.I gave up when the game froze for no reason and crashed, and made me walk for 15 minutes through a dragon's cavern.

												This game needs to come with a warning about its system requirements - those requirements mainly being a computer that was manufactured in the late 90's, and an OS that is no longer supported by its own publisher.Steam really needs to stop selling these out-of-date titles if they're not going to be properly fixed and/or labeled.  It's a broken game, being sold under false advertising.  No amount of workarounds will fix a memory leak and a 2GB RAM limit.  (Which in turn causes the game to crash like perfect clockwork.)August 2016 state of the game:  Still broken and largely unplayable, and still no warning on the store page.  Extremely long ""fixes"" have been suggested by the community (everything short of making a virgin sacrifice on the night of a lunar eclipse), but this only somewhat extends the amount of playtime before the memory crash.  It doesn't stop it from happening, and it still happens like clockwork.http://steamcommunity.com/app/225640/discussions/0/358415738215016656/Final word of warning:  People have a nasty habit of writing reviews for games for back when they actually worked somewhat well. ""Nostalgia goggles"" prevent folks from basing their review on a product's current state of play.  In short, a positive review would have been accurate back in the days of XP and Vista, because frankly, it really WAS a great game.  Today however, a positive review is simply wrong, because the game just plain doesn't work correctly.If you legitimately feel that the following headaches are worth all the trouble:1.  Editing entire paragraphs within .ini files, 2.  Modifying the game's file structure by manually unpacking and re-packing system files,3.  Downloading community patches from potentially dangerous sources,4.  Disabling graphical effects on your modern rig that would have otherwise made huge visual improvements (effects which had no problem and worked fine in the days of XP and Vista), and finally,5.  Saving every five minutes to prepare for a crash that happens every thirty minutes despite all those ""fixes"" mentioned in steps 1 through 4, then by all means, base your positive review on THAT.

												This game is weird.  What I mean by this is, its the first rpg game I ever bought that I immediately regret buying.  I been playing rpgs since the NES era and this is the first time I didn't understand what the I was doing.  Complication can sometime be alluring and satisfying, such as with EVE which I love playing, but in this situation, one word from my military days keep popping in my mind and that is KISS, which basically is a nice way of saying ""Keep it simple, Stupid!""  The biggest issue is leveling.  I have no idea where to put my character points, have zero understanding of the skill tree system, the tutorial is horrible and reading the manual hurts.  It feels like I'm reading Klingon.  With that said, it could be me.  Maybe it's the difference between liking vanilla ice cream over chocolate.  I say this because there is a part 3 out now, which usually means people like part 1 and 2.  Still I can't recommend this game to anyone.			"

												The only reason I'm not recomending it is becasue, in the US criminal law says Innocent until proven guilty, but for products its♥♥♥♥♥♥until it convinces me it's not. So yeah, it wont boot on windows 8, I just let it sit on the error message so I could say. I never wanted Windows 8, it was all anyone had to sell me when I needed to build a new computer, it was a matter of having just enough money and not a lot of time, sort of a now or never thing, so I had no other chioce, that said I've played a ton of other games on my PC and I'm super happy with it, maybe I'll have enough money to get a new OS somday and get to play this, until then I have no opinion on the game itself, but dont buy it if you plan on running it on Windows 8, because it wont.

												What it misses is the nuance, the charm and the challenge that marked both the original games and the best of the Diablo clones (such as Titan Quest). In short, Sacred 2 is a game that's easy to miss without really missing out. Basically a nice Action-RPG which is its own worst enemy with repetitive gameplay, complicated inventory and a dull story.			"

Shiny graphics, that requires way too strong a machine to produce way too 'meh' an experience.Sorry :/ I really wanted to be nice, but I was really disappointed			"

												Where do I start. I guess the very beginning, huh.The opening cinematic looked pretty alright, especially for a game from, what, 2005? Imagine Power Rangers but with scantily clad women and fireballs - only not that awesome. The narrator explained the story, but none of it was even interesting enough to remember past the end of the introduction.Moving on.So I made my character. I had the option between 5 scantily clad women, a man in a skirt, and a skeleton. The game began with my (I'm assuming) instructor telling me to defeat a fellow student in a duel. The camera zoomed out to allow me control and a full screen window came up to tell me I had some DLC too enjoy. Great! Too bad the game didn't pause though, because the other student was already throwing fireball after fireball at my face.I closed the dialog and attacked my opponent. (Evidently, left clicking your opponent makes you swing your weapon at them - and not accurately.) I defeated my fellow student and he fell to the ground. ""What are you doing?!"" exclaimed my instructor. ""You weren't supposed to kill him!""""Uh....""So I killed my instructor and walked through the starting area. The only NPCs I could find would only tell me to go away and leave them alone, so I walked out of the starting gate and was immediately murdered by the very first trash mob on the road.Aside from a horrible introduction, this game has the absolute worst camera that I've ever experienced in a game. You can move forward, backward, and look left and right. God help you if you look left or right, though, because your camera will do anything but cooperate.I counted no less than a dozen buttons on the UI, and precisely zero help screens. Hitting escape to go to the menu to figure out what the keybinds won't do much good either. Keys are listed as ""Weapon 1, ""Orb 1,"" ""Skill 1,"" etc. How delightfully nondescript.So far I've murdered 7 people and I've been ignored by 3 (perhaps the latter is explained by the former.) Maybe there is some sort of appeal to this game after I learn how to play it, but I would rather not put myself through the trouble.Save yourself some time and skip this one. Diablo and Torchlight are far better than this shoddy clone.			"

												So... I guess this is an improvement over Sacred? What I remember about Sacred (I got it when it was new) is that it seemed really cool, but my PC at the time couldn't handle it. By the time I had a PC that could, the current version of Windows refused to play nice with Sacred.When I finally got Sacred 2, I thought it would be great. It will be like Sacred, but now even Sacred 2 is a bit old, so my PC should be able to handle it no sweat. My PC blows the recommended hardware out of the water. Sacred 2 runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ I get jerky animations and what can only be described as GPU lag, but can't possibly be, since my graphics card is newer than this game.In addition, it was one of the early attempts at an isometric view with 3D graphics and a rotating camera. So the camera and map features are at the same time absolutely necessary and absolutely worthless.I can't give this game a worthwhile review because I'm playing it on hardware that's too powerful for it. That makes absolutely no sense to me, but there you have it.Bottom line: should you buy Sacred 2? Off-hand, I'd have to say no. If you have anything like a current PC, you won't enjoy it. If, on the other hand, your PC is more than five years old and still running Windows XP, I would recommend you try Sacred 2. If it's anything like Sacred, it'll be amazing.It really pains me to give this game a thumbs down, but I just have to. There's no excuse (in my mind) for this game having the kind of issues it has.

												Disclaimer: I am not big on this kind of game, but I went in with an open mindA hack and slash ARPG with no personality or identity of it's own. Battle music will cut in every time you're in combat, which amounts to engaging a single foe then hearing a choir as though an epic battle is about to start, then felling that single opponent almost instantly. Then the music abruptly goes away, only to restart from the beginning the next time a foe crosses your path. It's incredibly jarring and disharmonious.The avatar picture in the top left did not look like my character. The game deviates from well accepted standards of the genre, only to fail to explain them. The default controls are all over the place, for instance 'i' doesn't even open inventory. I accidentally skipped two cinematics, one by pressing volume up on my machine, and the other by attempting to shift-tab to the steam interface.Overall if you like this kind of game, there are other games that do it much better. If you don't like this style of game then this one is not going to change your mind. Perhaps it was good at the time, but if so it did not age well. "

 Disclaimer - I do not own Sacred 2, I have played the game via Steam family share and the hours recorded on Steam is not accurate either. Sacred 2 is an action role playing game part of the Sacred series. The PC version of the game was released in 2008. This was my first experience with the sacred series, having not played the original release either. I went into the game expecting it to be a little like Dungeon Keeper or Diablo. The gameplay is top-down style, clicking on the world where to move and the traditional left and right click attacks. This to me is one of the best control systems out there as it is easy to grasp and you are able to do everything you need to do with just your mouse.  Sadly a lot of Sacred's 2 important menus are not bound to keys so you have to click on your UI in order to bring them up, such as inventory etc.  I also did not like the fact there was hardly any tutorial to the game; you get told how to move and attack; that's it. Upon starting the game for the first time and creating your character, you are greeted with a humongous amount of information straight away. Although the game tries to explain what everything does, I found it a little overwhelming that I was being fed this amount of information on the first screen. The graphics are dated since this game came out in 2008, you can easily see polygons and sharp edges on everything in the world.  There is a small amount of voice acting in the game too which is done very well, would of made the experience even better if all NPCs had it though. I have been playing Sacred for about seven hours now; and I am barely even scratching the surface on the amount of content in this game. I am seeing sources online telling me there are about thirty four hours worth of content on offer here which is a huge amount. There are around 100 quests to complete in the main campaign as well as plenty of caves and dungeons to explore, there are said to be about 600 side quests out there too. I am having a number of technical issues in my playthrough so far. The main one is that my UI will randomly disappear at points, which is extremely difficult to work around as I am not able to see my health or use potions etc. The only way I found to fix this was for you to either die, or reload the game. Sadly this one becomes very annoying very fast. Secondly there is quite a few areas which cause lag spikes and stuttering. I should not be playing a game that is almost seven years old and experience stuttering at all. Do I recommend Sacred 2? Personally I think I may of been spoiled by recent RPG games. Back in the day I would bet my life on Sacred 2 being game of the year material; but compared to current and recent day RPG games, it just isn't the same. People who have played the game will probably disagree, but since I didn't grow up playing this game when I was younger I can only go off my first experience playing it.  So for me I won't recommend it since I am not having as much fun on this as I do other games. Old school gamers which love having tons of information to immerse and delve themselves into will love this game, it's just not for me. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up. You can also find more reviews over at http://www.completingthebackloggroup.com/ "

												Note: My Steam hours do not reflect the many hundreds of hours I played at home on my LAN with family and friends. I have the original disks still. Great game. Beautiful. Nice characters but gets easy if you use the exploits. My lips are sealed. Easy to play.Update: You know why I gave this a thumbs up? Because there is nothing about the game that is bad. It may not be that hardcore for some but there is nothing bad about it. It does rquire a good PC to play. I remember way back when playing with the graphics settings for each computer I had helped and disabling PhysX. And the game is much better playing with some friends coop. Boss runs anyone? ;-)For people who need +/- :Minuses: I really didn't have any because I don't care about story in these games. Bugs and glitches if any had no real effect to rate down. My game runs fine.Pluses: Large world to explore. Hidden places. Separate MP sections to go to. Good graphics for my PC. Sexy and cool characters. Lots of quests and repeatable in the MP map.Cool bosses. Coop mode is awesome.Update to my review since I saw only half the people were helped by my review. The game is easy to learn, has lots to do, many skills to tweek, and is a fun RPG for those who like RPGs. I am not sure what people want in life. There is a story if you read each quest but most people don't want to read I suppose. You can make it harder by just tweeking your character in such a way that you don't have all the best stuff nor all the best skills. But that wouldn't be fun would it? You can't have it both ways. Either you are a hero or you are not. Heroes in every other medium are over the top strong and have immense skill. I still say this is a good game OVERALL. That means across the board. The first Sacred without the expansion was harder but I doubt you will find a copy of the original game.Another thing: I have hundreds of hours in this game. I had this game on PC when it first came out and played it for many months. Steam hours are a re-buy.			"

												I bought this on the recent sale . I DO NOT RECOMMEND by this if you  dont  have  virtual machine runing old windows distribution .The game run only if you  set it up to be compatable with  windows vista , and then it frezzes and crashes  on a random  intervals sometimes loosing  last 10-15 min of  game play  regardeless if yu use the save game options ( the game seems to have automatic save after each quest completion , wich dosent affect the  roll back bug at all) .On the game play  side , its  start to drop and trow at you all kinds of stuff wich aint well explaind . Overall it seems fun ,but not well explaind . I personaly had fun   killing everyting as Elven ranger   with one hit , but after loosing  3 times   more than 10 min of game time  i just gave up and regret  buying the game . "

												<---- Sacred 2 Gold --- Got this in a humblebundle deal for $1. It's basically a Diablo clone. A bad one. My mage got 3 guys on him and died in about 3 seconds. Fun right? Lack of hotkeys sucks too. I used my big summon demon spell, it killed 2 guys for me, then turned around and killed me. Are you ♥♥♥♥ing KIDDING me with this game? I will be very happy if steam ever allows us to trade/sell our games because then I can get a couple of coins for garbage like this. If it was on sale for 1 cent I still wouldn't recommend it and if I could sell it in the market and only got five cents for it I would consider that fair.			"

												Sacred 2 Gold looks like an amazing game full of fun times for those that love adventure RPG's in the style of Baldur's Gate, but this is an atrocity of programming.  I can't even play the game more than 2 minutes without the screen freaking out and glitching back to the title and sometimes the main computer desktop (with the game still running).  This even happens when opening dropdown lists in the settings or adjusting sliders in the character creator.While I'm sure this game would be great fun if it worked, as it stands, I can't recommend this version of the game to anyone.  I've seen this played on an xbox360 at a friend's house and never noticed these kind of problems so go give that version a try if you want.  Just stay away from this broken mess and save yourself some money.			"

												It's much better use of both your time and money to track down a copy of Sacred 1. I had only heard bad things about this game and most of them are true.It's very boring with none of the charm the first game had. I would of loved a ""lazy"" reuse of the last game's engine sequel, atleast that would be better than this.Most of the quest are the same old ""go here, kill this"" quests and it controlls like it was programed for someone with 6 fingers on each hand. Switching abilities is a pain and is hard to do in combat.The characters are stereotypes of the ones in the first game, that were stereotypes to begin with, with a completly pointless customisation slider that just makes them all look the same. Not that it matters beacuse to be able to see more that 2m in any direction requires the screen to be fully zoomed out. The map looks like someone lent on the brightness way too much and forgot what ""open world"" means. Sacred ! was this world slowly falling in (and part of) hell, so very dark. Also it might look open but it's just a series of paths boxed in by invisible walls with little to nothing worth discovering in it. Basically it is ""Baby's first Vanilla Fantasy Land"", ""Tired of getting lost in a open 2d world?"" ""Try our quest trail and fast travel systems to totally remove all sense of exploration or acomplishment."" ""Plus we've made the whole map boring and lifeless so you can be prepaired to know what real life is like.""and so on.Compaired to the first game it's bad, as a game on it's own, it's worse. Spend the $20 on a better fantasy game, there's a ton of them out there for much less. I'm happy to of got this on sale, even then it was still a rip-off.			"

Waste of my time and money. Now feel disapointed, frustrated, and now all I want is a refund, yet cannot find the right support for that either. Thanks steam.

												After pouring more than 500 hours into this game, I think I can safely say that I can write a good review of this game. For those who enjoyed action rpgs such as diablo and torchlight, you probabaly will enjoy this game. Sacred 2 is an open world hack n slash rpg that is filled with massive amounts of content. I have to say the thing that keeps me playing this game is the leveling. Leveling up in this game is so much fun and super addicting. Gameplay is pretty solid, although it could be better in my opinion. Loot is definitely an aspect where Sacred 2 shines. The feeling of satisfaction you get after picking up PILES of loot from slain enemies is amazing. The character classes are all really fun, each have their own unique playstyle and all classes (excluding the seraphim and inquisitor) can choose between a shadow campaign or a light campaign.       Now I did mention this game is similar to diablo; however, if you are looking for the same level of challenge as diablo II, then this game does not have it. So for those who like a really high challenge, you might want to try a different game. This game is also known to have many glitches, which is why many others playing this game suggest the community patch. Personally I have not used the community patch and I have not ran into and game-breaking glitches.			"

												For all I can say this is the ultimate Version of Sacred 2. With most of the bugs purged and a large world to play it still has a lot to offer. Even or especially in the days of Diablo 3. Sacred 2 is for those who seek the need for freedom and openness. You will and should continue playing Sacred 2 since its successor isn't granting you a huge world to play and has merely become a free2play game that was turned into a fullprice title within the last second however is not losing the smell of its inferior heritage. Let Sacred 2 have its renessaince for good.			"

												The #1 Diablo clone in my opinion. But Sacred 2 is so much more than a Diablo knockoff. It has a HUGE persistent world. Walking a bee-line from main quest to main quest will let you see less than 10% of the game's content. The meat of the game is the ~500 or so side-quests this monster has. Ascaron really broke themselves making a deep, massive world full of stuff to do. It really feels like you're walking around in an MMORPG.Sadly they ruined it a bit with the level scaling system: monsters will always be your level or a little above, no matter where you go. I can only presume they did this because balancing such a huge world would be next to impossible. Despite this, Sacred 2 is still an AWESOME game. You feel epic and godly, just like you should, and there's always improvements to be made to your character.Multiplayer is STILL AROUND, even though Steam says it's not. The online servers are gone forever, but you can still play in LAN mode with Hamachi. So if you want to play with friends, you can with a little leg-work.The build system is very different from other Diablo clones. You spend less time focusing on your spells (which are called Combat Arts) and more time focusing on passive buffs that power specific components of your character (called Skills). You can cast any spell, but it's the skills that define what you're good at. There's thousands of combinations, and room for experimentation galore.Basically a number cruncher's dream and a great romp for people who just want to smash something's face-- maybe many somethings.

												December 25th, 2008; I receive a PS3 for christmas, but get no games for it so I'm stuck playing COD Classic after purchasing it from PSN, The next day I finally get to go to Best Buy and pick out my first game to test out what HD graphics can look like, and also see what the system can offer me. So obviously the cover catches my eye, as well as it being an open-world RPG. I was stoked at first glance, but obviously skeptical. I get home and pop Sacred 2 - Fallen Angel into the PS3. It loads up and I see the menu screen; it looks good so far but not TRULY impressed. Then the game starts... My jaw touched the floor after seeing the game, and stayed there after playing it for 5+ hours my first night. Don't let my play time on STEAM fool you, I have accumulated several hundred hours on this game and let me tell you, it is all around perfect with so much replayability its unbelieveable. The graphics are spot-on, the world is truly the biggest map I've ever played in for an RPG, and the music is immersive as well as diverse. Though, the ""catch-phrases"" or little dialouge bits each character has can get quite repetitive, yet does not take to much away from the game it self. But sadly Ascaron is out of business but it is still WAY better and 100% worth the $20 bucks on STEAM (heck, it was even $40 when it came out, so the game has always been worth the purchase). Honestly my personal favorite underrated RPG, and the music used is from Blind Guardian so how can you complain with that? 9.5/10 only beacuse the graphics are a bit dated and the catch-phrases can get old, overall still worth it, so stop reading and get exploring!

												Really fun game to play. It's a hack and slash RPG. It's a diablo clone where you run around doing quests, build up your character with different skills and find new items to improve your performance. For those who's played sacred 1 gold it's quite the same, but in my experience it's less bugs in this game. I've yet to ome over 1. However there is 1 big flaw that would be so easy to fix that they have not considered. If you have 100 small items in your inventory and want to stash them in your chest you actually have to move them with the mouse 1 by 1 into the stash. Normally you would at least have the option to hold down a button and click to get the items to the stash, like it is possible on sacred 1 gold and mostly all serious RPG's. However this is not possible here which is an amazingly annoying. If this ever had a beta and people did not report this, SHAME ON YOU! This should have been easliy fixed. You start suspecting that the developers haven't even played their own game. Anyways, if you can bother using several minutes on this then the rest of the game is definitely worth the time.			"

												Good and bad :The Good : easy (you'll never die), fun quests (you see their location on the maps), good loot (but no craft or recycling), relaxing game (no need to think), so yes it worth it  !!The Bad : the views will give you headeache, even after some change in Gameplay option (curves, etc) To resume, in open you will not see the foe you're firing to, if you have range weapons. In fact you know foes are around provided to the mini map.  In caves, more time than you'd like, the foe is not aimable cause of a wall or an ally. But as i said first, the game is so basical you will not die anyway  ;p			"

												For all I can say this is the ultimate Version of Sacred 2. With most of the bugs purged and a large world to play it still has a lot to offer. Even or especially in the days of Diablo 3. Sacred 2 is for those who seek the need for freedom and openness. You will and should continue playing Sacred 2 since its successor isn't granting you a huge world to play and has merely become a free2play game that was turned into a fullprice title within the last second however is not losing the smell of its inferior heritage. Let Sacred 2 have its renessaince for good.			"

												After pouring more than 500 hours into this game, I think I can safely say that I can write a good review of this game. For those who enjoyed action rpgs such as diablo and torchlight, you probabaly will enjoy this game. Sacred 2 is an open world hack n slash rpg that is filled with massive amounts of content. I have to say the thing that keeps me playing this game is the leveling. Leveling up in this game is so much fun and super addicting. Gameplay is pretty solid, although it could be better in my opinion. Loot is definitely an aspect where Sacred 2 shines. The feeling of satisfaction you get after picking up PILES of loot from slain enemies is amazing. The character classes are all really fun, each have their own unique playstyle and all classes (excluding the seraphim and inquisitor) can choose between a shadow campaign or a light campaign.       Now I did mention this game is similar to diablo; however, if you are looking for the same level of challenge as diablo II, then this game does not have it. So for those who like a really high challenge, you might want to try a different game. This game is also known to have many glitches, which is why many others playing this game suggest the community patch. Personally I have not used the community patch and I have not ran into and game-breaking glitches.			"

												Sacred 2!It's odd, its crazy, it's massive and despite the bugs and terrible voice acting, you need to play this ARPG.Seriously, It's awesome.   Open world, massive detailed landscapes that vary in terrain, and atmosphereI was walking through a forest, routed some Bandits, came across a cave, and found a dungeon entrance in a cracked part of wall, suddenly i'm fighing ghosts and minotaurs!   Plus, you can have a Mount in a Hack n Slash loot game?  And your horse can have combat skills and you can attack from horseback!   This game deserves to be played.  Ignore Sacred 3, as it's an abomination and 4000 steps in the wrong direction.   This game is amazing and even has an easter egg concert by the band that does the title song.   Always remember:""This land is Saaaaaaaaaacccredddd!!!!"" "

												Having played it long before it came on Steam, i can say that, technical issues aside, it's one of the best ARPGs i've ever played.Massive, detailed world with a huge amount of quests and a lot of humor. Character progression is extremely deep and customizable, much more than the average game in the genre.The camera can be a pain to get used to, but it can be tweaked through .ini settings if you find it too restrictive.

												This game is awesome as a RPG Open world Hack and slash with lots of things to do. The graphic are beautifull considering the age of the game... If you like torchlight 2, Diablo II  or skyrim, you might take a look at this one. A word of warning: choose your class wisely and level your charater regarding a preplan you made first. Leveling understanding had me confused quite a bit at the beginning and it leave me no choice but read some build and the meaning of all this buff and perk you can invest into. I strongly reccommend you do the same if you are new to the franchise as the game is not forgiving at all and messing a character is easy. That said I love every aspect of the game but the camera control and had to get use to it. The combat music was also annoying and horrible to my taste, once again I dig a bit on the net and found a way to turn it off. Now here is what is good with the game:- Open world - Huge map.- Lots of option (may be too much for certain player) to level and customize your character the way you want- Lots of side quest, some easy some not.- A good story line, if you read the book you found during exploration the world of sacred 2 start to make sense- Yes you can ride a horse- Combat mechanic is Diablo II style, even better.- Plenty monster to fight- Navigation in this game is a bliss with 3 different sorts of map and a compass... no GPS though (kidding).- Variety of weapon, armor, items and spells - The resurection system is fine tuned here... yes I died and died and died while experimenting tactics.- And much much more I missed... just 18Hrs in the game.Conclusion: If you like open world RPG with hack and slash element this game is made for you. If you are new to RPG this one might be a high learning curve with hiccup but it stills worth it. Did I mention the game is fun to play? Yes it is indeed. My rate: 8/10 (still hate the camera system, no exit so far in dungeon but the way in (I am picky here), the combat music is horrible..., Multiplayer server down -> they do not exist at all... but I like to play RPG alone anyway.)Thanks for reading.

												The online is technically shut down but there is an executable file you can download to play online with friends -- including myself -- and this game is really a hardcore RPG experience.If you like RPGs from a top down perspective where you only control one character like Torchlight, Diablo II, A Bard's Tale, or a medieval version of Fallout; then this is a great title to be had. It's even better with friends.A fun RPG experience with tons of quests, a large map with no hardly any load screens, lots of loot, and even the metal band Blind Guardian.+ Great graphics considering the scale of the world and amount of content+ Physics being ragdolls and debris to kick around, totally mindless, pointless fun, but I adore it all the same+ Kick-[butt] soundtrack feat. Blind Guardian as themselves, and for a side-quest no less.+ Enough classes to choose from that everyone is likely to find their class(es) of choice+ Hardcore RPG for hardcore role-players+ Challenging moments+ Tons of loot+ Doesn't take itself too seriously+ Carrier imp+ Soooooo many quests+ Tons of replayability+ Fun with friends+ Art style has a very Todd McFarlane feel to it+ Blends science fiction and medieval fantasy for an amazing world- Too much bloom, my eyes begin to hurt after a while- The voice acting- Casual role-players, or action seekers will quickly turned off by combat and massive amount of class customization- Character creation too limited (female characters can choose hairstyle from about 4 styles, and hair color from an RGB slider, all classes can choose skin color, except for Temple Guardian)- Servers were shut down long ago, LAN only (unless you run specific software)			"

												The Sacred series has a very solid following of diehard fans, and there are a number of very good reasons why it does.  Sacred 2 will bring you MANY, MANY hours of emotional roleplay gaming enjoyment, but also misery.  You'll be elated one minute, then depressed the next....to the point of irony.But why do I find the game so great and worth getting?I ended up with a LONG run-on sentence listing all the reasons (not that my writing skills are even good anyways), so here's a numbered list to make things a bit easier to read:1. It's got tons of loot (loot hoarder paradise);2. an immense open world to explore (too big to adequately cover with one playthrough);3. an overwhelming amount of quests (again, too much to cover in one playthrough);4. Each Class has the capability of being developed to be a solid character to carry you through multiple playthroughs at different difficulties (these are level dependant);5. The leveling and development choices are flexible enough to build that character the way you want to play;6. And finally....BLIND GUARDIAN!!!  A for real heavy metal band can be found in the game, but I don't want to spoil it for you too much.  (psst...come here...hush, hush ok?  There's a questline with an amazing ending.)<---No♥♥♥♥♥♥Sherlock!So hey, if point 6 about a 1980s Heavy Metal Band from Germany who's music rocks the hell out the game doesn't make this an instant sale....well man, I really don't know what will.The music (and yes! Heavy Metal is freakin music, don't you dare say otherwise! hehe) makes any fight an EPIC deathmatch (even against those dam rats.   And here's a tip about rats, no joke, you see one of those and the music goes metal on you, RUN! RUN TO THE HILLS!)And Yes, There were/are bugs in the game:I've played through some game breaking bugs when this game came out, to the point of wanting to rip my hair out and destroy my computer, and everything else in my reach!!  I'm just glad that MOST of them have been fixed, but I'd advise you to do like I do (as almost every other Sacred 2 player has learned).... SAVE....SAVE OFTEN!  It's a good practice to follow for any game anyways.The game tended to crash at almost identical intervals of time, forcing you to reload that last save.And then there was the corrupted characters, but I don't want to go there, it's just too painful to relive that.Getting and Buying the Sacred games:I've bought Sacred 2 when it first came out, then later I bought Sacred 2: Fallen Angel Collector's Edition, and now I bought Sacred 2: Gold to finally have the Ice & Blood expansion to play the Dragon Mage class.Finally, I'd like to point out something VERY important about the Sacred series as a whole.  The followers and diehards of the Sacred series (most of the players anyways) DO NOT consider Sacred 3 and Sacred: Citadels of really being Sacred games.   They are Sacred in name only, that's it, that's all.  You might disagree and debate it until you turn blue in the face, but that fact will still remain true to most  players who've played through the series since the start.So, DO get:+Sacred+Sacred Underworld Expansion=Sacred Gold (both combined)+Sacred 2: Fallen Angel+Sacred 2: Ice and Blood Expansion=Sacred 2 Gold (both combined)and visit   The Sacred Wiki [www.sacredwiki.org]  for all your needs including maps, walkthroughs, and access to the community patches.And DON'T get:-Sacred 3-Sacred CitadelsINSTEAD of those 2 which are a sacrilage to the Sacred series, support and wait for the real successor, called Unbended!  It's a game in development by the original developers of Sacred.http://www.unbended.zone/http://www.sacredwiki.org/index.php/Unbended:AetherraIn closing, dam this is WAY WAY too long, but I had lots to say about the game and the series.Just get the game, especially since it's on sale for like $5 right now during the Xmas sale.  You'll get your money's worth in just doing the tutorial portion believe me.			"

												December 25th, 2008; I receive a PS3 for christmas, but get no games for it so I'm stuck playing COD Classic after purchasing it from PSN, The next day I finally get to go to Best Buy and pick out my first game to test out what HD graphics can look like, and also see what the system can offer me. So obviously the cover catches my eye, as well as it being an open-world RPG. I was stoked at first glance, but obviously skeptical. I get home and pop Sacred 2 - Fallen Angel into the PS3. It loads up and I see the menu screen; it looks good so far but not TRULY impressed. Then the game starts... My jaw touched the floor after seeing the game, and stayed there after playing it for 5+ hours my first night. Don't let my play time on STEAM fool you, I have accumulated several hundred hours on this game and let me tell you, it is all around perfect with so much replayability its unbelieveable. The graphics are spot-on, the world is truly the biggest map I've ever played in for an RPG, and the music is immersive as well as diverse. Though, the ""catch-phrases"" or little dialouge bits each character has can get quite repetitive, yet does not take to much away from the game it self. But sadly Ascaron is out of business but it is still WAY better and 100% worth the $20 bucks on STEAM (heck, it was even $40 when it came out, so the game has always been worth the purchase). Honestly my personal favorite underrated RPG, and the music used is from Blind Guardian so how can you complain with that? 9.5/10 only beacuse the graphics are a bit dated and the catch-phrases can get old, overall still worth it, so stop reading and get exploring!

												Big fan of Sacred 1 series, Sacred 2 does things in a lsightly different way but does not disappoint!Usually it ends one way ""Just one more mob"" or ""Just one more level"".So if you're a fan of Sacred 1 and the likes of it I definitely reccomend you to check out Saced 2 as well!			"
