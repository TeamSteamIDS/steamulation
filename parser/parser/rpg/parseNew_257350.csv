												Baldur's Gate - A 16 year old game stands up to the test of time, and it's co-op!So during the steam summer sale, a friend of mine bought me Baldur's Gate 1(Enhanced Edition) so we could play together(the 4 pack was 20 bucks). 6 months later, we had never played together once so I finally decided that I wanted to play, so I played it solo.Now there's a few things you should know about Baldur's Gate. The game was originally released in 1998. I played it while I was in high school my senior year. It introduced a LOT of new people to Dungeons & Dragons. It's a 3rd person isometric RPG in which you control all members of your party. It's paused based(instead of turn based), which means that when combat starts, you pause, issue commands, unpause, wait for something to happen, pause again, issue commands, etc, etc. There are lots of games with that type of system now, but as far as I know, BG was the first.So the way you're -supposed- to play it solo is to create one character and go along recruiting AI NPCs to join your party of up to six. Well you can get around all that by playing in multiplayer mode by yourself. Multiplayer mode lets you create all six party members and tweak them to your desire. You can also export/import different characters at any time. You can easily get away with this from an RP(roleplaying) perspective by saving your game in an inn and swapping party members in and out saying ""Oh I met this guy at this inn"". So to start with, I created my own party of 3: Human Fighter(me), Paladin, and Cleric, then I pick up NPCs along the way. Not completely satisfied with the NPCs in game, I finished the game with 5/6 party members self generated, and only one in-game NPC(Yeslick the Dwarven Fighter/Cleric). If you enjoy character creation and tweaking things and micromanaging party members, gear, stats, and other RPG elements, this game is definately for you.Lets talk about the story. This is where the game really drew a lot of people in. For those of you that have already played, you know what I'm talking about. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone that may play the game in the future(even if it IS 16 years old), but it's a great, great story that lets you choose your own path. Of course my path is that of the good soldier fighting for... well... good. But if you enjoy the darker side of things, it's always allowed, which a lot of games give you trouble doing. You can lie, cheat, steal, and murder and still complete the game.Oftentimes now that I'm in my 3rd decade of life, I've gone back and tried to play games from my childhood that I remember really enjoying, and graphically none of them have stood up to the test of time(X-Com, Doom, etc). Since all of the assets in BG are more or less hand drawn and the enhanced edition lets you play at your native resolution, the game still looks pretty damn good, especially amidst the recent indy dev 8 bit gaming boom. So graphically, it passes the test. The environments are pretty freakin cool too. A whole lot of unique, hand drawn areas that I had forgotten about since I first played a long time ago that made me say ""huh, cool"" when I came across them recently.And now let's talk difficulty. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is this game hard. It's been so long since I've played a game that didn't just blatantly hold my hand and coddle me the whole way through I'd forgotten what it's like to play a game that punishes you. AD&D 2.0 core rules are a huge ♥♥♥♥♥ and completely unforgiving. There are 5 difficulty levels in the game:-Easy - Everything does half damage, all hit point gains per level are maximized, and characters can't permanently die.- Normal - Everything does 75% damage, all hit point gains per level are maximized, and characters can't permanently die.- Core Rules - Everything does 100% damage, hit point gains are randomized(so you can get as little as 1 hp/level on your badass front-line fighter that needs ~10 hp/level), and characters can permanently die.- Hard - Everything does 150% damage- Insane - Everything does 200% damage and you are a satan worshipping masochistI may have added that last little part on the insane bit.So being the badass gaming veteran I am, I of course choose Core Rules. I understand what THAC0 is, I know what the different classes are, I know how to D&D. I'm good.Or so I thought.I'm actually not as good as I had thought. I had to do a LOT of fights multiple times because Jesus Christ, this game can be hard. Mostly with the crowd control abilities the enemies get(note - If you fight against a group that has a mage, KEEP YOUR PARTY SPREAD OUT just like in ArmA). A lot of times I'd get hit with an AoE fear or confuse or stun, etc, etc, etc. It could be infuriating, but I kept re-loading and going at the fights in different manners from different angles, and analyzing my party and their abilities and switching things around until finally, at the end of the game, I had SOME sort of idea of what I was doing... I thought... until the final battle.Let's just say that the final battle in Baldur's Gate had me curled up in a fetal position in the corner of my room praying to Torm asking him what I had done so poorly to have been punished so badly.So somewhere between 20 and 50 attempts later, I managed to defeat the final boss and win the game. I even had to google strategies for the final boss. I actually felt a sense of accomplishment like I haven't felt in a game in a long, long time. The funny part is, 17 year old me beat the game in 1998 without the internet for guidance. I have NO CLUE how I managed that feat.So I immediately went to steam and bought Baldur's Gate 2 enhanced edition, even though it's not on sale, and started a new game. This time, however, I'm playing on normal mode. It seems to be a much better balance of playability vs difficulty. I've still lost some fights, but I've learned a whole damn lot and built my party around the strengths needed.I have a Cavalier paladin because he: 1. Can't be feared, charmed, mind controller, or poisoned; and 2. He can make the entire party immune to fear pretty much all the time. He's also a badass tank alongside my main character which is a frontline fully maximized fighter with sword and shield. I also have a pure Dwarven Cleric, Fighter/Thief, Fighter/Mage, and Dragon Disciple Sorcerer. I dual classed the Thief and Mage with Fighter bases so they could use longbows for good DPS instead of being relegated to a shortbow and a sling. The nice side to that is that they get fighter HP for their first 7 levels so they're pretty beefy on top of it all.I just pretend(roleplay) that my entire group is a squad of trained military soldiers that have been sent on a mission, so they almost all have that base fighter class from their military training.So I have 2 tanks(FIghter/Cavalier Paladin), a pure healing Cleric, and 3 pure DPS(Thief/Mage/Sorcerer). But don't be fooled, that fighter and paladin can put out some melee hurt too. The cleric is really the only non-dps class. Oh... Make sure you -always- have a thief in your party with the script that makes him passively detect traps. Trust me on this. You don't necessarily need a thief/rogue that can stealth, but you damn sure need one that can detect/disarm traps and pick locks.And on that note, there are pre-set scripts that you can use for each character. There are about 20 for all the different classes in the game to mess around with. I pretty much have my whole group on the standard ""I see an enemy and attack with my equipped weapon"", except for my rogue, who is set to always passively detect traps when not in combat, and my cleric who is set to dynamically run around and heal. I micromanage everything else(mage spells mostly).Read the rest of this review here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Jester814/discussions/0/648817377413793428/ "

												This is Baldur's Gate 2. You wouldn't need something else to say.But 2.0 update came out.It did bring some improvements with it. Some spells and abilities were tweaked, a new class was added, some bugs fixed. Changes were made into a save system - now there are 4 slots for quicksaves. Cloudsaves and achievements were enabled. Off-hand weapons became equippable with launchers and two-handers, preventing constant jumping into inventory.  Further zooming is enabled. That's a good thing.Some of the graphics was changed. Outlines were added for sprites, for instance. This gave the game a cartoonish look, turning them off replaced thick lines with thin ones thus retaining cartoon style.And now, for the complete disaster of this update - UI. I don't know who came up with the idea that switching a classic interface which proven itself over years and perfectly fit for PC with a mobile version's UI was a good call, but this person needs to think again.Let's go over the interface screens separately.Journal. Now it looks like a plane tablet with two sheets of paper attached. It takes left part of the screen when active. It now stores active and completed quests together. It also now needs each entry separately, which means that if quest has numerous stages you need to click them all to view the whole quest. And ""no objective"" text almost on each entry. Old one kept active and completed quests separately, opened the whole quest for player in one click, looked like an open book and took the whole screen, blocking the player from the current situation and allowing to concentrate on reading (you wouldn't go into journal without pausing anyway). And it's the good old journal we're used to. So old one for me.Map. Turning on the map screen gives me the impression of receiving data from spy satellite:) Map notes really get in the way and disabling them removes  map marks as well. And the control pad on the local map looks completely alien, too. Travelling on the world map now requires either double click or clicking on the destination and then ""travel"" button instead of the single click of old world map. Improvement of new world map? It now always shows you the time needed to get to destination.Old map had a button to switch marks on/off. Hovering the cursor over map mark displayed their description in the special window. This allowed the player to get the info needed and to not overload the screen with text. It is also more aesthetically pleasing. Plus, it's something we're used to.Inventory. The new inventory isn't really different from the old one. Improvement? It now shows how will character's AC, hp, Thac0 and damage will change if he/she equips item held with the mouse. Downgrade? Attacks per round value is removed from the ""damage"" box. Jumping between inventory and character sheet, yay!Character sheet.  Keeping  the info on separate screens is very inconvenient. Exp bars look out of place. I, for one, prefer to see the exact amount of exp my character has accumulated. Plus, a quick calculation never hurts. Aesthetically, it looks terrible. Seriously, old character sheet had everything you needed on ONE screen. If devs felt so strongly about changing something there they could just take the old sheet and make the info stored in the right side box, which was already broken into categories, foldable. This would allow the player to keep the necessary info on hand and hide the excess one.Mage book/priest scroll. This is an example of actual improvement. It keeps the old aesthetics. It definitely is more informative as it gives the description without needing to pop up description windows for each and every spell and having to close it after. Left page – list of spells, right page – descriptions. Well done. Downside is if you have a vast spel repetoir, you have to scroll. Devs need to organize the left page so it can accomodate more spells. One way would be leaving just spell icons placed as tile.Text bar is now manually expanded. A good decision. It now stores text without giant gaps as it did with dialogues. Definitely an improvement.Save/load screen. Should have kept “delete” button where it was - along with the “save/load” one. Now a player needs to click the save, then hover the cursor to the bottom of the screen and press “delete” instead of having it on hand. Plus, these save/load and delete buttons were made to be paired – one button had upper corners cut, the other bottom corners cut. A minor inconvenience and can be fixed by just making a “save” button symmetric. A bigger Inconvenience is that saves now change their order accordingly to date of change. That’s a bad thing if you have multiple walkthroughs simultaneously. But that’s not much of a problem, too.Health bars. Not really a necessary thing, but someone might find this useful. A good thing, that devs thought that not everyone might like it and included the option to remove it. New and new “old” hightlight circles. I didn’t like the new “new” highlight circles. The new “old” ones are much thinner like imported from some RTS game. I prefer the old thick ones. Still, for the option to keep the new “old” I’m grateful.That’s all the criticism I can come up with now.Overall, this new update brought some nice tweaks, but with the exclusion of text bar and spell books, the UI is butchered. And since this is a “video”game, the update ruins a large part of player’s experience. I understand that new players might like new UI. But, I’m a new player myself and I found the older UI both more aesthetically pleasing and functional (again, with the exception of spell books and text bar).What we have now is literally Android port’s of BG interface glued to PC version for some unfathomable reason. Bhaalspawn saga is considered classic for a reason and classic basically doesn’t need any changes. We’re now stuck with a heavy-metal version of Moonlight sonata.TL;DR Unless devs appease both parties by including an option of switching between old and new UI, I can’t recommend Steam version of this magnificent game. Hence, GoG.9.04.2016. Reverting to 1.3 actually started working. Took devs just 9 days to hand me back the product I payed for.			"

												It's Baldur's Gate II + Throne of Bhaal with some extra content.They took an awesome game, re-released it for modern systems and displays but didn't change anything about the gameplay. That's a very good Idea.Deep combat/character system (AD&D rules with a few tweaks), fantastic story, decent presentation, great and varied characters (it's Bioware, duh!), extremely well-executed open-world gameplay (after the first dungeon).Release-version somewhat buggy, crashes, quests getting stuck, saves MAY get corrupted if game crashes on save (not terrible if noticed immediately).You can get BG1+2+addons for less money than the BGII:EE, but that involves more trouble to get it running properly and is overall not just as well-rounded as the EEs.Bugs are being fixed one after another, eventually it'll be just fine.

												I bought the original back in 2000 in a box. Back when we were still buying game in box. It became my favorite game of all time and is still is. Devollopper dont make games like that anymore. It is based on the D&D 2nd edition set of rules. It have the most depth story, a lot of side quest and the main quest is one of the best written I ever saw. The interaction between your party members is even better than anything done recently like Dragon age or Mass EffectThe enhaced edition add some cool features to the UI to simplify thing and make it easier for gamer to enjoy it, without removing its hardcore gameplay or any game design. There is 4 new playable NPC with their quest line and they are really awesome. There is more dialogue line and quest and a whole new campaign called ""Black Pit 2"" along with the original expension ""Throne of Bhaal"". I cant recommend this enouph to any fan of cRPG. 100/100			"

												This has always been my favorite game of all time by a long, long shot. There's a Pacific Ocean of distance between this game and my №2. I've replayed this about 6 times already, doing every possible quest in each playthrough, and will be replaying it at least once every two years. No other RPG to this date created this level of interactivity, immersion and replayability. Worth about 10x Witchers, 5x Skyrims and 3x Mass Effects to me.			"

												I played this with my friend, we had been waiting for years upon years to play this game on multiplayer and were SO excited for the enhanced edition. Like for 10+ years we waited for this to happen, and it finally did.And oh boy, was I disappointed.All that time, he had said that he solod the entire game as a Paladin, cutting through everything, chopping it all to bits, but oddly he never took the conversation further when I started namedropping specific items and builds.I know why.I will tell you why.We have just escaped the mindflayer prisons and are finding a way out.Me- ""Wait, let me open the door and we will pull them here and trap them.""Him- *Charges in and gets killed in 3 hits by mindflayers*We are helping the rebellion of a sahuaguin prince who wants to overthrow a usurper to his throne and wander into a pit of zombies that poison us with every hit.Me- *Surrounded by monsters, low on health, poisoned, pauses the game to choreograph a battle plan*Him- ""Stop pausing the game, let me win!!!""Me- ""No, wait, I'm a druid, let me figure this out or I'm toast, I'll buff you with haste.""Him- ""WHY WON'T YOU LET ME WIN!!"" *Spams unpause so I think sod it, I die, he dies*Him- ""HAHAHAHAH""We find ourselves confronted with some kind of puzzle, 6 treasure chests lay in a circle around us and the floor is riddled with traps.Me- ""Ok, let me disarm all the traps.""Him- *Charges across the room, gets turned to stone* ""Reload.""Me- ""No it's okay, I'll stone to flesh you."" *Stone to flesh on him*Him- *Walks into exactly the same trap, turns to stone*Me- ""Why did you do that?"" *Rests, stone to flesh on him*Him- *Walks into the same trap again*Me- ""Stop doing that, are you dumb?"" *Rests, stone to flesh on him*Him- *Finally stops, lets me disarm all the traps on the floor*Him- *Walks around the room opening all of the chests one by one, eating acid arrows, magic missiles, and then finally a death spell*Him- ""Reload.""Me- ""No, I can revive you."" *Revives him* ""Just stand right there don't move."" *Disarms every single trap*Him- *Opens all the chests takes all the items equips the +4 spear on his other character*Me- ""That's an upgrade for me can I have it?""Him- ""BRB."" *for 45 minutes*We are in the sewers under the city and encounter a particularly nasty pack of bandits who killed us on two attempts to fight them head on.Me- ""Ok wait here, I will pull them to us one by one, they are tough man, the spellcasters cast stuns so we need to get them alone.""Him- ""Ok.""Me- *Moves toward them slowly to get aggro, notices he's running up behind me, pause it* ""Wait back there, please.""Him- *silence*Me- ""OK? Wait back there ok??""Him- *silence*Me- *unpauses it*Him- *Charges passed me and attacks them all, gets stunned, gets killed*We get ambushed in a lodge in the windspear hills, we are low level compared to this area and quest but we are powering through. He gets killed playing with a solo mindset and trying to take on a heavily armoured dwarf who is cleaving a third of his health with each hit and a couple of his lackeys. I manage to take on the wizard by myself and use up my last healing spell keeping myself alive, as I know my friend is dead and I've already wasted my other charges on him.Him- ""Why didn't you heal me? It's your job.""I rooted and managed to kill the lackeys using bear form and using my potions. With just me and the dwarf left, I notice that he really does hit mega hard and decided to run out of the house to try and lose aggro and catch a rest. He didn't stop following me, and 2 wild dogs came out of nowhere and attacked me too. In a moment of true tension I turn 180 and run straight passed the dwarf with dogs in tow. To my sheer amazement and relief, the dogs started attacking the dwarf and he stopped to fight them!! In the moments of freedom I got, I casted a root spell from out of view distance and then ran inside the house.I noticed I still had my daily heal spell up, so I used it on myself, getting me to about half health and I turned into a bear and waited. In comes the dwarf, mad as hell and covered in dog's blood. The next 10 seconds were a blur. He hits me, hard, I'm one hit from death. I hit him, he misses. I hit him again, he misses. I miss.... he misses, then I kill him with a final maul to the face. PHEW!!!!!Carrying all of his gear, I only have enough strength in bear form to carry it plus his corpse to the temple in the city to revive him. So I trundle across the land carrying him and all of his gear over my back, as a bear. By far the most epic and tense moments I've EVER HAD in any RPG, ever. Full stop.Him- ""If you didn't pause it so much I would have killed them. It's so annoying when you're pausing it all the time""Me- ""Did you see what happened? It was epic man.""Him- ""No I was chatting with my bro in his room.""The game is full on amazing, always has been, always will be. The new characters are a little annoying and I ended up turning the girl in the copper coronet to stone because she wouldn't shut up about going to the crypt to find the treasure, like literally she went on about it nonstop and her voice.... argh.... she makes a pretty statue.But just make sure you have a teammate who understands what this game is all about, understands tactics, is patient and has an IQ above 80.10/10			"

												Allright, at first I have to mention one thing: I am a big fan of BG 2 and it is still my most beloved RPG ever. The Enhanced Edition used to be pretty good: some good upgrades, better graphics, changes to make the gameplay more comfortable. It was ok and I liked it. I'd rate BG2: EE 9+/10 back then.However, everything good must come to the end in some point. For this game, the point was 2.0 update. I've run the game and I couldn't recognize it. What have you done to my favourite RPG, Beamdog?! What the heck is this abomination? Deafult spell autocast, tips popping up everywhere, highlighting the map so you know where you can go (WTF), health bars, completely demolished journal... What is this? Baldur's Gate 2: Version for people with Paramecium caudatum IQ? Are you f****n' kiddin' me?! You, Beamdog, have completely ripped of the good old spirit, the soul of this brilliant game. That's a thing I can never forgive you. Shame on you. Give my beloved BG back, you disgustig thieves.Until there's no possibility to go back to the previous version of the game, it isn't worth playing. Sorry. I think I better go to my shelf, take the old CD version of Baldur's Gate 2 and install it, so I can save at least few of my nerve cells.A little PS: of course some of those annoying things can be disabled in the options menu, yes. And yes, I know about that possibility. But still: you can't do it with the all bad things Beamdog has done to this game. Plus: it's just the fact itself that annoys me the most: why the hell spell autocast, autoattack, automatic trap finding etc. is set as DEAFULT? It's just like Beamdog saying: ""We think that most of the players are r-e-t-a-r-d-e-d by deafult, so we set all those options on in advance; they can of course disable them later, if they figure out that they aren't r-e-t-a-r-d-e-d at all."" Still, even if you make a massive disabling in the options, the game won't be that good as it was before 2.0 patch. Thank you. The end.			"

												I disliked BG1 yet I loved BG2.This is a BG2 EE review and while im sitting here writing it, i cant help but reference the start of an epic story which is BG1.There are many people who will write that BG , as a series, is complete story of your character as they follow the path from start, middle and end of their own destiny.I cannot argue with this valid point.Yet I found that BG1 was clearly made from a company (Pre- EA Bioware) that had grand ambition , scope and excellent writing but didnt know how to implement this all into a single game.What came from the end of BG1 was the experience , scope and confidence to make a vastly superior game in BG2.When starting a new character in BG2 , all the back story that exsisted in BG1 is told to you in the opening trailer of the game. Who you are and what you have done have been generalised in a way that starting off in BG2 verses playing the first title of the series doesnt leave you lost.Infact, anything you may have lost in terms of playing BG1 is redoubled in the amazing expansion called Throne of Bhaal, which takes the story of your past , present and potential future to levels that werent even touched on in the first title.This expansion is included in BG2 EE so if you choose to buy this remaster , you will miss very little in terms of story.If your old enough to remember Terminator and then watch Terminator 2 year later will understand this completely because they share a common trait.  The second incarnation is so vastly superior to the first that there is no need to experience/watch the first.Im not going to beat a dead horse on the actual review of BG2:EE.There are so many amazing reviews online that illustrate , far better than i could , all of the brillant traits that make this game one of the BEST RPG's of all time.What stands out for me is the writing and PACE of the game.Bioware crafted BG2 in a way , in the quest structure, that you never feel very far off the beaten path towards the end. All the side quests are meant to compliment the main story in some way or another.And the side quests are easily the BEST of any RPG ive ever played.That is not to undermind the main story at all, but only reiterate the strength of how impactful the side quests are.I mentioned the pace of the game and I wish there was a virtual table I could bang to get this point across.There are so many past and present RPG's I play where I get so wrapped up in the vast open nature of a game that the main quest or objective becomes a second priority.This isnt the case in BG2.BioWare cleverly crafted a way to keep the story in focus but give the player all the time they needed to explore and experiment. When you were ready, the story took main focus and ran forward at amazing speeds.By the end of BG2 you feel satisfied. It truely is a complete story.Yet if you feel is there more to the backstory that hasnt been complete, the expansion Throne of Bhaal answers them.This expansion was made before the invention of DLC. Its a TRUE expansion with 20-30+ hours of content and RICH , character driven story. It could possibly be the best expansion ive played in my life.It ends the story of a character you started from BG1 and ends it in excellent fashion.This review was writtten for a very esoteric perspective. Made for a RPG fan who doesnt mind the learning curve of a good game and appreicates a epic story.  If there are gamers out there of this nature who havent played this game, I hope this review helps.In the end, BG2 stand alone as one the best games ive ever played. It is a reminder that story, characters and solid gameplay trump impressive graphics and superfical gameplay.Im old enough to see the progression of gaming in a unique perspective.  I owned pong, i watched nintendo and sega battle out in console wars that lasted 3 generations of systems, the rise of the X-box and sony into the market and a game that was so massive that 12M people played it online at the same time. Yet through all of this , even more than once when ive been amazed at a technical breakthrough, its how games have impacted me intellectually and emotionally that have stuck with me through the years.This is one of those games.

												Thank gods I backed up my entire BG2 directory the last time I played.  I added a couple player-made mods that I didn't want to have to scour the net to find again the next time I wanted to play.I heard people screaming about Beam Dog molesting my 2nd favorite game of all time and against my better judgement, I gave Beamdog the benefit of the doubt.  I installed it cleanly from Steam and loaded it up, started creating a new character and felt like I'd just taken a sip of beer spiked with Rohypnol.  I continued though determined to see all the changes they've made.  ""Surely they can't have completely destroyed this masterpiece."" I foolishly told myself as I finished creating my character.""Oh god, those sprites look terrible"" These were my first words upon seeing the opening scene with Jon Irenicus. Every sprite now has gaudy thick black outlines, completely ruining the way the original developers seamlessly melded their spritework with the prerendered backdrop of the game world.  I hurredly retreated to the options menu to tweak everything as best I could back to the original.  The menus look so tiny now on my 23 inch monitor.  The UI overall doesn't scale well how it did before.The map is awful, the journal is awful, the character sheet is awful, the inventory is awful, the spellbook is awful.  Even the gods damned Save/Load screen is awful!  How could Beamdog mess up this badly?  It's like they purposely made everything worse, piece by piece. I can tell a lot of things they changed for ""streamlining"" but this is a classic crpg.  We know how to play D&D computer games, we learned how when the game first came out with no problem.  Why do you feel the need to dumb this down?I didn't continue playing this way.  How could I?  I'm not a fan of people staying in marriages where the husband continually beats and rapes his wife, and that is what Beamdog is doing to every fan of the Baldur's Gate series.  Something truly wicked is happening within this company.  I saw the signs when that accursed liberal politics expansion was released for Baldur's Gate I.  I opened up my archived BG2 install directory and copied the entire contents over this new patch, I've erased the abomination from my own PC, but I won't stop there.Beamdog, this is directly for you.  I am going on a full assault against you.  You are Jon Irenicus holding my sister prisoner and experimenting on her in disgusting and abhorrent manners.  I'm going to assemble a party and come after you. You will roll back these changes, you will publicly apologize for being child molestors of all Baldur's Gate fans.  And you will relinquish your rights of this game to a different group who will treat it and its fans with the respect it deserves.I never thought I would be posting a negative review of one of the greatest games of all time.  Look at what you've made me do.All you had to do was fix some bugs.  Instead you wanted war.  Well, now you've got it.			"

												Lots of people seem to be complaining about version 2.0 of the game, not realising that you can roll the game back to version 1.3 (i.e. the version with the bug fixes but without the bs) under beta programs within the steam client. You don't have to play version 2.0 if you don't want, and version 1.3 is the best version of the enhanced edition due to bug fixes.			"

												Fun, but bugged beyond all belief. The ""Enhanced"" version is actually WORSE than the original -- and that simply should not be! EG: 1) At least one of the ""rez"" spells DOESN'T -- it merely harms the caster and leaves the dead character dead. 2) The pathing of the characters, whether controlled by the player or the AI, is almost offensively nonsensical, resulting in members of the party wandering off in the OPPOSITE direction of where they are supposed to be heading or taking the most circuitous and perilous path to a space mere feet away. The AI will often halt a character mid-path and just leave them there, meaning you may find yourself missing a member of your party during an important battle. 3) The voices cut in and out, sometimes not even finishing sentences or words. 4) The ""triggered"" dialogue will sometimes skip ahead several steps, ruining some potential romances and preventing the player from making their own choices. 5) The AI-controlled party members will often disengage or cease attacking enemies, and casters will often stop casting spells or just freeze mid-spell. What is more, many characters will freeze in the middle of drinking a potion, meaning they receive no benefit from the potion but also cannot/will not fight back when attacked. 6) Many NPCs will simply stand in place, refusing to move, which can be game-breaking if they are blocking the only doorway or path to a game-crucial location. 7) Characters can have the wrong abilities for their class and/or race.It's so bad, it's virtually unplayable at points. Sometimes you have to start the entire game over again and hope that an issue won't occur again. I've literally seen people in the official forums advising new players to just uninstall this and get the original, older version because it (ironically) has LESS bugs than this new ""Enhanced"" edition. A tragic wasted opportunity to revive a classic rpg.			"

 Beamdog Review I never write negative reviews. I love supporting companies by providing positive feedback and encouraging people like Beamdog to remaster our favorite games. This review isn't about the game or any of the gameplay mechanics. Nooooo, this review is about something so much worse than I let on. I have played Baldur's Gate 2 since I was 8 years old and it has been so near and dear to me that I cannot begin to express how elated I was at owning the remastered version, which is practically the only readily available version left online. So this review isnt about the game, but about the company and their ""liberties"" they have taken on our beloved classic-- A classic game so timeless, it is frequently listed as one of the best games and RPGs of all time. What did Beamdog do that was so bad? Beamdog, I want to personally and come out and say for all fans of BG2  that bought your game.. Why? This game became less about remembering about the times we played it when we were kids or young adults, and more about putting Beamdog's dreaded arbitrary personal stamps all across BG2's UI. 1. Reconfiguring the spellbook (this just ripped my soul out of me)2. Entirely scrapping the character portrait screen and replacing it with  uncountable nuances that make it hard to even describe what was there before.3. Changing the map display4.Changing the inventory screen5.Changing weapon icons6. Simplifying item statistics7. Changing the journal8. God just too many to count... Baldur's Gate 2 is Grueling Making this game more accessible and user friendly isn't what fans of BG2 want. We want the challenge we remembered and the time consuming, rewarding experience of this perfectly crafted game. The game simply has little room for improvement on its original construction, besides some of its outdated graphics. We want all the quirks of the original game, and the massive game that Black Isle created, not Beamdog. These Details Might be Small But they matter more than one single change that was made for ""optimal"" organization or helpfulness. Baldur's Gate 2 isn't supposed to hold your hand and it shouldn't be changed like this. People that buy this game, including me, that are disappointed, will personally go out of their own way to make this barely recognizable classic fail and your company to lose the privledge of meddling with a piece of art so valuable, it proved to be too much for your company to responsibly manage with respect, and care to the creators, as well as the die hard fans. Art is often said to belong to the public once it is crafted, because it exists with flaws, and is in our memories. We connect with these pieces of work on a level that we can see in ourselves, and our past. Everyone that enjoyed this game when it was released played one of the greatest games of all time. Beamdog, do yourself a favor and fix this trash or let some other capable company fix what you have destroyed, because this isnt art anymore, its trash that I have to tolerate. Im a positive person and have always tried to be, but this is just awful.Whatever you do... DONT BUY THIS GAME			"

												With Fallout 2 and Planescape;Torment, Baldur's Gate II is one of the great gems of roleplaying, a timeless classic. Even after 14 years it is still a great game, atmosphere, depth, story wise, a masterpiece, a once in a lifetime game.The story is gripping and epic enough to keep one thinking about it long after finishing the game. There are countless quests and many different classes, epic battles and incredible humour (don't kill The Eye of the Beholder before you enter the under dark, makes for one of the funniest re-encounters in game in Throne of Baal), and last but not least gripping dialogues!For anyone who likes RPGs, well worth a visit!P.S.And the MUSIC! The Intro Music still gets me going after all these years! "

												This purchase was a disappointment. There are FAR too many bugs in this release, and in fact, the original release of Baldur's Gate II had far fewer bugs (BGII veteran here; I've been playing this game since 2001 and have never taken a year off). I was very pleased with all the enhancements which make this game look so much nicer on newer systems, but between the sheer number of bugs and the weak voice-acting of the new NPCs (Hexxat's voice was PITIFUL to the point where I couldn't keep her in my party) I just can't say this release is worth spending money on, period. Download the latest patch, get a widescreen mod and the Baldur's Gate II Fixpack from Giberlings 3 and just play the original release. Don't waste your time with this version.Update 01/01/17: I tried playing this again recently and was equally disappointed. There are still crippling bugs which make certain quests unfinishable, and the new journal and spellbook interfaces are a joke, as they make everything more difficult to read and modify. Even when the new content runs the way it's supposed to, it's awful. In particular, the cat quest for Barad Ding was an absolutely boring and insufferable fetch-quest and an insult to what made the original release of this game so great. ♥♥♥♥ you Beamdog, and way to tarnish an otherwise amazing game.

												Once this game was an unparalelled piece of art. It was probably the best game ever made. But then some idoits thought it was good idea to tamper with perfection. And now it isn't worth my spit. Now the game is sluggish and it's not like the graphics were improved. It's just sluggish...BUT WAIT! There's more. They also decided that it was a good idea to change the dialoge because it didn't fit their notions of pc. How did they miss the memo that this is a freaken RPG? The appeal of an RPG isn't in perfect cookie cutter charaters that always ""behave"" the way they should. That's boring and stupid. A good RPG has vibrant and dynamic characters that have flaws as well as strengths. I keep hoping that Beamdog will see the light and fix the crap they've done to this game... But I'm not feeling to hopeful. What's really shocking is that they think any fan of this game is likely to buy their sequel to Baldur's Gate II. I'm disinclined from ever buy anything from Beamdog after the mess they've made here. And from looking at message boards and the like I don't think I'm the only one.			"

												OMG - What have you done?  The original game is the definitive RPG.  Beamdog have just done what to it with the v2.0 ""update""? This is no update, v2.0 EE is to BG2 what the fourth Indiana Jones film was compared to its predecessors, the difference being Spielberg only crapped all over the new film whereas Beamdog have taken the game I was in the middle of playing and made the UI, in particular the character arbitration screens, almost unfathomable even to someone who is a veteran of D&D style RPG's.  I don't care that you've added the Google maps zoom level view - what use can that honestly provide anyway when you are limited by line of sight??This has to go down as as bad an ""update"" as Windows 8 was, unless there is a way to back out the v2.0 or Beamdog release a v2.1 which reverts certain ""updates"" or allows the users the choice of the ""updated"" or the better view I will no longer play EE, I will get out my old discs and play through them.In summary, I would no longer recommend BG2EE it's like some hideous modders w*nkfest, I would however highly recommend BG2 - it's a great game, an epic game, a game that has yet to be truly surpassed with a very effective UI already in situ - the only thing I'd really miss from BG2 EE is the looting bar. Way to go Beamdog, looks like you've also lost a future sale of Windspear too			"

												I randomly got this game on a sale, and tried to play it a couple times but couldn't get into it. The graphics were very basic, I didn't like the isometric view, and the gameplay seemed confusing and awkward. I just didn't get it.Then one time I was bored so I decided to try it one more time. For some reason, this time it just clicked and it all made sense... and I realized this is maybe the best game ever made. I couldn't stop playing it.. after I finished it I was searching for D&D lore and more games like this.I think the key realization is this: you aren't only ""playing"" what you see on the screen. When you play Skyrim or something like that, the immersion is based on looking all around at the sights of the world around you. In a game like Baldur's Gate, you have to think of the character models more like pieces on a tabletop. They are representing what's going on, but you have to engage your imagination as well.When you get that, the whole world with its characters and rich storyline and lore come alive and you realize this is like stepping into an amazing fantasy universe where you are totally free to explore and talk to all kinds of people and have adventures. It's an incredible experience and BG2 is the perfect place to start!			"

												I grew up with this game. It's one of my favorites of all time. The story is quite good, and there are so many different party/class configurations that will keep you coming back for more. There are a huge number of quests, a great deal of them with hours worth of content and multiple outcomes. Every class has their own unique quest chain, and there are numerous others for each side of the alignment spectrum. The game is hugely improved over Baldur's Gate 1, and there are even a few small improvements here over BG: EE.I like the additions that Beamdog made, but it's worth noting that this game is still very, very buggy - especially in online multiplayer. Unfortunately, it seems like they've created more problems than they've fixed. It can be tolerated or worked around, but people who have the original and are thinking of upgrading to this should perhaps weigh their options. If you're looking to play multiplayer, expect to see good old Biff the Understudy fairly often.My personal favorite additions are the hugely reduced load times, auto-loot, and the conveniently organized/bulleted journal. I haven't played around a lot with the new NPCs, but I like them a lot so far. Their romance options, however, seem incredibly superficial at present. There is now a same-sex option for both males and females respectively, so that's nice, though both of these NPCs are unfortunately evil.This version is compatible with a lot (although not all) of the countless mods created for this game over the last fifteen years, allowing you to configure your gameplay experience if the hundreds of hours of vanilla content aren't enough for you.I cannot recommend this game enough, and that extends also to the first game. They're just fantastic.			"

												Well, the game was already a masterpiece when it was out, only to be seconded by Planespace: Torment for some (not me). Therefore, the base quality is still there. The original game had beautiful 2d artwork used as locations and they held their eye candy to this day.What needed work was the paper dolls, spell effects, the UI, screen resolution (original one only supported 800 x 600 and 640 x 480) and one of the nightmares: 64 bit compatibility.The initial release had bugs but at the moment, this game is quite solid. The story itself is probably one of the best modules ever written for Forgotten Realms. The characters (original ones) are all quite fun in their way and the newly added ones somewhat blend in. Although, they are neither as interesting as the original cast (like Minsc, Edwin or Jensen) nor their voice acting matches the quality of the original NPCs. Still, they don't disturb you much.I have probably played and completed Baldur's Gate 1, Tales from the Sword Coast, Baldur's Gate 2 and Throne of Bhaal over 20 times, modding them to the bone. Nowadays, I am replaying the EE and I am quite happy that it helped me return to an already favorite, not causing issues with my high end rig. I am already halfway through the game, saving Imoen, and wife laughs at me whenever she sees me mimic the NPCs and their war cries.Now that Pillars of Eternity and Torment: Tides of Numenera are coming, it would be nice to re-visit this masterpiece.

												BEAMDOG, WHAT THE HECK!?For old players returning after a long absence, you will immediately recognize a massive change in the UI thanks to some alterations by the aforementioned company. Black borders around the menu screen regardless of resolution, the Barbarian is tossed into the Fighter sub-class category, the original new portraits are replaced with some new-new portraits, and a slew of bugs and incompatability problems that make the game bug out more than it ever has before.Some mage specialties are impossible to play as (such as Transmuter) because now you need to have a specialty school assigned for every rank during character creation. Except the problem is that not every school has a spell at every rank, which means character creation comes to a screeching halt when selecting your skills.Making any kind of spell caster is a pain too, because they decided to throw away the Pick For Me option and make it automatically pick for you; as if you're too stupid to make your own decisions. Which means you have to manually go back, unlearn all these spells and pick new ones every time. I love Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II and was perfectly happy with the original Enhanced Edition until they pulled this crap. This is exactly what happened with Starwars Galaxies. The owners had an awesome game, tried to make it into something entirely new, and ended up with a colossal screw up that lead to their game dieing out completely!BEAMDOG, you broke the golden rule of game design: YOU DON'T MESS WITH PERFECTION!

												Baldur's Gate II is, for me, the best RPG of all time.With an unbelievably rich story and exciting battles, as well as allowing you to enjoy simple things like doing more personal quests, grabbing a drink in a tavern, reading books or taking some time to laugh at a hamster's ""squeek"" (you will meet Boo!), Baldur's Gate II has a unique balance that makes you get lost in its world without getting tired of playing at all (one of the original loading screen tips said ""while your character doesn't need to eat, remember that you do"").You can actually FEEL empathy or antipathy for each one of the characters, their pasts and their personalities (this can even be one of the determining factors for who you're going to let into or to kick out of your party). Even common people may have interesting things to say, or just something to make you laugh. Quests may be only waiting for you to talk to someone in a corner.The locations, though particularly ""small"" by today's standards, are many, well designed and diverse, which gives a real sense of travelling and adventure. The game also features a nice day-night cycle, and not only the sceneries change, but some monsters, animals and NPCs may appear only at night or during the daytime, as well as some quests. Oh, and party members get sleepy, so be sure to find an inn or another safe place to spend the night sometimes!All these things, in conjunction with the game's substantial lore, help build up an incredibly immersive atmosphere. Have no doubt that a lot of characters and places will stay in your memory forever.On top of that, every corner of Baldur's Gate II has impeccable art (besides those awful character miniatures in your inventory xD), from the menus to the spell effects, as far as the Infinity Engine goes. In my opinion, to this day, the environments are very beautiful and pleasing (this statement MAY be nostalgia talking, but reviews are kind of personal, so... :P). Also, an extremely nice and beautiful feature is the fact that every item has its own hand drawn sketch scroll to go along with its written description.Dialogues go from the trivial ""g'day, sir!"" to the most philosophical questions about who you are in the story and what you'll do with your life and with the ones around you. The voice acting is impressive! Besides, you have the liberty to answer a ""good day"" with a sword in the throat, as well as a ""will you save his life?"" with a heroic action. The answer alternatives are really well thought and have true impact on the quests - it's not an illusional free choice, as we see in other RPGs. This allows you to fully and faithfully roleplay your character all the way, by the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition's rules.The freedom you possess to determine your party's reputation is absolutely amazing too. Your doings may have good or bad consequences not only to the story and to the world (for example, people in towns will react differently to your presence, depending on your reputation), but to the integrity of the party itself, as all members will have their own points of view about your actions (yes, you can end up losing party members because they don't agree with what you're doing or with the time you're taking to do something, or simply because they don't get along well with each other!).The combat system can be turn-based or real-time (the choice is yours), and the variety of possible actions you can take is almost infinite, from a myriad of spells (coming from your character, from scrolls or from magical items) to a brutal two-handed sword reckless approach - or maybe by sneaking through and simply avoiding the situation, who knows? This allows you to get into the same battle from many different ways and create your own unique strategies, which means that, even if someone can't handle a certain combat at a certain time in the game, another person (or even you, later on) could end up sorting it out, making the combat skill-rewarding, intelligent and exciting.You can follow the main storyline straight to the end or you can take your time to do side quests (lots of them). And, by the way, it's not uncommon to find yourself bumping into ultra powerful enemies when you're just not even a little bit prepared for the fight. You have to really work your way to strengthen your party before being ready for some of these quests. And the harder ones are trully rewarding. Well, the whole combat system is rewarding, as a matter of fact. So, if you face and kill a dragon, know that (besides feeling like a boss) the loot will be fantastic!The soundtrack will stay with you forever (nostalgia hits me every time I open the menu), and all tracks fit every scenario like a glove, finishing the immersion with a flourish. The orchestration is a work of art. Just listen to the first trailer's opening! That's Viconia's Romance Theme.If that isn't enough, well, rest assured no playthrough will be the same as the previous one! The replayability is infinite (specially with friends, if you have the chance!).Baldur's Gate II is a game you WILL WANT to dive into.I dare say I didn't play it. I lived it!NOTE: I really don't think the Enhanced Edition ruined the game at all, as stated in other reviews. I play Baldur's Gate II since 2000 and I can state that the content is all there, the game still feels the same all the way and the enhancements are really nice (if you don't like the visual ones, most of them are optional, so you don't have to get angry about changing the way the original game looked like). And I must say I didn't experience any bugs at all. My guess is that the impact of the Enhanced Edition's changes and tweaks is more personal than actually objective.			"

												I am posting this on both the review for this game, and the first in the series, Baldur's Gate: Enhanced edition.I absolutely LOVE this game, and everything about it, and the other game in the series. I loved the combat, the UI was tight, everything was well-polished when Beamdog re-released the game. I was actually in the middle of a run through the entire game on the hardest difficulty with only the main character...Before IT happened.The update to Siege of Dragonspear affected both games, and it's been nothing but negative for me so far. I can no longer access the Command Console (used for fixing the many glitches that can happen here and there), the UI is buggy and, when it does work, is clunky and, frankly, ugly as sin itself. My saves have all disappeared into the wind, and my character's data has become ridiculously bugged (Level 34 at the tail end of Throne of Bhaal suddenly turning into a level 17 with all of the items from her run through BG1 and 2? What?) and more. Before now, I would have recommended this series in a heartbeat. This game, nearly two decades ago, defined and revived a dying RPG era. But now? Now it's nearly impossible to play. And, unfortunately, it was the fault of the people who brought it back in the first place.--HOW BEAMDOG CAN FIX THIS---Implementation of the old character and save game formatting-Option to use the old UI-Option to turn the Console Command on and off IN GAME. The steps to do this in the first place were a nightmare in and of itself.--Things that COULD help--- Scale the difficulty levels back down a little. Insane difficulty jumped from enemies doing 50% more damage to 100%, and Legacy of Bhaal makes the game nearly unplayable.As it stands right now? DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. It pains me to say that (as you can no doubt see from my time in this game), but as it is right now, it's not worth any money.			"

												I can't decide if this game is my number 1 favorite game of all time, or just 2nd place. There are so many positive things to say almost no bad.If you like D&D and/or tactical RPG's, you'll love it. It's basically 2nd edition D&D placed into a video game. The quests are fun and interesting, the tactical combat is satisfying and engaging, and the characters feel real. The plot of the main storyline is very smooth, well-paced, and highly immersive. Not to mention really cool. I could go on all day about it, but you could easily read anything I would say on a review of the original game. Instead, I'm going to adress the differences between this Enhanced Edition and the original. 1. Praise to lord you can actually play the game again. The original had a nasty habit of not working with newer computers. You had to be a computer expert to get it to work, and even then it was unlikely. Until this came out, I feared I would never play it again.2. The graphics are highly improved. You can run it in double the resoloution of the original. No more blurry combat and squinting hard at the screen through a grainy and pixelated mess. 3. There is a lot new content for this game. There are 4 new party members, and each has their own quest associated with them. And that goes for both SoA and ToB, so that is 8 new missions and 4 new party members. 4. While still a little bit buggy, it's much less buggy than the original. And it's nothing you can't fix with the console commands.Some people don't think it's worth 25 dollars. I say thats a bargain. You get to play a game that hasn't been working for a decade and is also vastly improved, indulge your nostalgia, and play new content.			"

												The new update is an abomination.Shaman class is nothing of value, the new ui is awfully designed.No option to revert back to the old ui, either. Wheras the old ui had everything you needed at a glance, the new ui looks terribly cheap and out of place, and makes the game cumbersome to play,Everything is just sorta a hassle to get around now, taking more clicks than it should, bogging down the experience.  Important information that was previously available at a glance is now hidden behind several submenus. The new graphical style for the menus is ugly and out of place, not to mention the new sprites (at least those can be disabled, thankfully)The new map system and the character sheet are by far the worst offenders.Get the GoG version, dont bother with this version. I'd rather just do a bgtutu run with the classic games at this point. I bought EE specifically so I wouldnt have to deal with setting tutu up, but when I get surprise updates that basically ruin the playability of the game, I'm somewhat regretting that decision.Beamdog, give the option to roll back.

												So after 242hrs can I say it was worth it? HELL YES! the new Enhanced edition looks amazing and plays amazing. I didnt notice any real bugs besides Jaheiras Harper call spell not working properly but I managed to track down a fix online.Got to level 28 as a Mage running with Imoen, Jaheira, Keldorn, Minsc and Edwina *cough* Edwin I mean. I played a Lawful good character throughout the game but I was tempted on more than one occassion to switch to the dark side and I also romanced Jaheira even if she was a whiny bint! This time around it was only 242hrs and nothing like the amount of time I spent when i first bought the game all those years ago, though I managed to finish Throne of Bhaal properly and got the good ending :D10/10 Would Buy again without a second though!

												There are character classes you can't even create anymore since the 2.0 patch. I've brought this to the attention of Beamdog on their forums only to be completely ignored. The new interface is love it or hate it; most hate it, and you get no option to switch between them. Names and descriptions of items have been altered for seemingly no reason. Various game mechanics no longer work the way they did originally, now that they've been ""improved"". This company has shown through this, and other more explicit demonstrations, that it doesn't care what the consumer thinks or wants. It's all about the company's own interpretation of what Baldur's Gate should have been like, rather than what it was and what made it so great. Beamdog will never get another cent from me.			"

												The original BG1 and BG2 were two of the best RPGs of all time. Unfortunately this new developer has ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized the UI in an attempt to capitalize on the tablet gaming market. It would be ok if there were an option in the graphics settings to enable ""tablet mode"", but that wans't done. You do not have the option of accepting these new UI changes, it is a forced patch through steam. That is to say, I bought a certian product and later on I was forced by the developer to accept a different product in its place. There are some nice improvements to the mechanics, but the forced UI changes are simply unbearable.If you love the original look and feel of Baldurs Gate I would recommend you find a different version than Enhanced Edition 2.0			"

												TLDR Version - Newbies should buy, Veterans (and Newbies who have access to the originals), should probably avoid.After further tweaking (and finding out it is compatible with mods) I have come back to this game and its prequel, but I cannot change my vote to a recommendation: It's solid, but derivative. I am very, *very* glad for its existence, but I cannot recommend veterans to pick it up.Get both Baldur's Gates (the second is not as fun without an imported character, and the first is not as fun without the BG ""tutu"" mod) and mod them. While I love bioware, and *did* gladly pay again, unless you have *both* never played Baldur's Gate before *and* are skittish or unaware of the modding community, it's not worth your time.			"

												Ah.  Baldur's gate.   I cant even tell you how many times i've played this game through to the end.  The world is massive, the NPCs feel human,  the quests are exciting, and the combat system is deep and nuanced. And then there's the 'Enhanced Edition'.   It's difficult for me to recommend the enhancements 'overhaul games' added to baldur's gate simply because there aren't very many of them.  Almost all of the issues which existed in 2001 are present in the enhanced edition.   This includes (but is not limited to) : - Cheating the combat system by initiating dialogue with a neutral NPC and then attacking them while they are stuck in the 'i want to talk to you' animation.   - Casting a spell in an area covered by fog of war and having your spellcaster get stuck in an endless casting loop which never results in the spell actually being cast. - Pathfinding bugs- Awkward looting of certain objects which requires that your character be in a specific spot to interact with the object.I could go on.In Overhaul's defense, they did add a few new NPCs to the mix, all of whom seem interesting and useful in their own right.  But it feels like they did this to try and distract from the underlying issue -  which is that they are adding icing on top of an old, rotting, cake.  I love baldur's gate and i'm enjoying the enhanced edition, but Bioware / Black Isle deserve the credit for that,  not Overhaul.  Only get this if you are a rabid fan of anything Baldur's Gate (like me) and just want to have one last spin around Faerun.  Everyone else should probably just buy the original version from GOG.com.  You'll save money, and you're getting almost exactly the same experience.			"

												One of the best RPGs of all time, sadly broken with the new update. No longer looks like it shows you on the screenshots, which is false advertising and tons of bugs aswell. Oh yeah, also makes your characters INVULNERABLE on easy ""story mode"", whatever that is. Great update.EDIT: I decided that I love this game enough to give it the review it deserves, so here goes:This game is amazing, in terms of everything from combat to story to world building and music.There was a new update that kinda ruined the game, but there's a way to restore the old game if you go into properties > betas and select the 1.3 update. That makes the game what it used to be before the update: Good old Baldur's Gate, but with some updates like the multiplayer and resolution. (Works on both 1 and 2)This game shines in the story aspects. The combat can be a bit tedious at time but at the core it's very solid. The game is based on Dungeons and Dragons rules, I'm not sure which edition. The stories are an official part of the D&D universe so this game is D&D canon. The stories are excellently done and you never know what to expect next in this game. It can literally be anything, no matter how ridiculous, wild or just purely awesome. Some grand quests take you through epic dungeons, fighting monsters from old folk legends, other quests have you kill god-like creatures, while others just have you solve a town quarrel or the likes. There's a wide arrange of amazing writing and voice acting in this game, and the most amazing questlines I've ever played in a game. Even if the game might be a bit outdated, I think it's worth to play for this fact alone.			"

												I honestly think that there will never be a better game than Baldur's Gate II. I did play most of today rpgs, TES, Witcher, ME, Dragon Age, Divinity, etc. While I enjoyed much of some of them, in my opinion only Planescape and KOTOR are in BG2 level and that game industry is sadly gone.For those that are afraid this game is too difficult to understand or dated, forget about that. Everything that you need to know is there and this edition makes is even easier. I started playing this without knowing much english and no idea what D&D was, so you can do it too.*The story is personal, you don't have to save the world. *Dialogues are rich, not a ♥♥♥♥ing wheel with 3 choices that are actually the same. Still there is no extreme reading like in Planescape if that worries you. *You are going to love the characters to death. Forget about those lifeless, stoic, emo companions/protagonists that plague the latest RPGs. If you don't believe me google ""Minsc and Boo"" or ""Edwin"".*THE COMBAT: probably my favorite part. Is GRATIFYING. When you encounter a new enemy you will need a new strategy, change spells, if your plan works you feel the true meaning of achievement. The spell diversity is magnificent. I'm not talking about a stupid AOE that changes color and only does damage of different smell. These effects are truly different: from a magical eye that reveals an area to a timed bomb or a stop time spell. *The music: just listen to the main theme that's pure adventure in sound form. https://youtu.be/U88zyFLzIXQ?t=16*You never know what you are getting into. The world doesn't level with you. You pick a simple quest, next a dragon eats your party in 2 seconds because you are too spoiled by modern games and think that ""surely if they put the dragon here I can beat it"". True adventure. *There are no cons that I can think of. I have the glorious old CD version and I still feel bad that I bougth this at $5 while crap games cost $60.			"

												Before the recent updates Baldur's gate 2 enhanced edition was a near perfect and totally complete version of the old Baldur's gate 2 game. However, unfortunately the new updates have fundamentally changed the game including terrible new character A.I., oddly dull bright character sprites, altered timing in combat, altered ability rolls and combat rolls, etc...I am not one to normally say this, but if you can, download an older verion of the game for free from the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥or some other website because this current version is rather insulting in the fact that Beamdog did not allow the long time players a choice in this odd massacre of a classic game from years ago.However, if you do decide to pay for this, you can expierience the game how it has been played for the better part of the past 15 years by right clicking it in your steam inventory, going to properties, Betas, and then selecting the bgiiee 1.3 Beta. It is not really a Beta, but the cpmpletely finished game as it should be played.The current owners are terrible in digging their grimy little claws and uncreative influence into a perfectly good game. They are fine expanding upon it with the interqual and the planned prequel but the 2.0 and up updates are wrong and unreccomendable.			"

												Highly recommended.I don't need to tell the people who have ever played this game before what they already know, but now that I know I have one of the highest amount of hours on record I felt the need to explain a little about why this game is one of, if not the greatest sequels to an already great saga. Truly a specatcluar return to a lifechanging game, and by that I mean I probably spent twice the hours on this game the first time back in the early 2000's.  I've already played through twice as a good and evil character and I would recommend doing the same. I didn't change up my party selection much(usually dorn, jaheria, viconia, hexxat, and edwina..ahem..edwin) all leaders in their pre-ordained classes.  I also exported my char from the first game, to get a head start on levels and mage spell memorization.  The voice actor for the villain (Joneleth) is exceptional and makes for a harrowing macabre theme throughout.  The graphics and cinematics are the only drawbacks I can think of but thats not why you play a game like this.			"

												It's Baldurs Gate alright. If you're looking for a singleplayer experience on par with the original Baldurs Gate 2, then here it is. Additional characters are very interesting and fun to play with. A few bugs here and there, and some of them are quite bad and consistent, but overall I really enjoyed the singleplayer experience enough to play through the game 3 or 4 times.Multiplayer on the other hand is broken beyond belief. If you intend to play BG2 with friends, my advice is to buy the original from somewhere else, because the Enhanced Edition's multiplayer is just straight up nonsense. Can't even get out of the tutorial area without some encountering at least 4 or 5 major bugs, including quests just straight up not working, or scripted events not occuring.			"

												Baldur's Gate 2 is the follow-up of one of the best RPG experiences created to this day. Originally released in 2000, you should really play the first before considering getting the second as it DIRECTLY follows the storyline created in Baldur's Gate 1 and starts you at a much higher level. Therefor, if you haven't played it yet, head over to the Baldur's Gate 1: Enhanced Edition first and then come back and buy this game for it is fantastic. Both Enhanced Editions offer a much more convenient experience with some great solid new content. Baldur's Gate 2: Enhanced Edition offers four new companions, each with a great storyline and dialogue, new class and race combinations and  ""The Black Pits 2"" campaign (an arena-style combat campaign). They are both definitely worth getting as they are the definite modern way to experience these fantastic classic games that offer a tremendous amount of content, quests, great dialogue and a huge sense of freedom. Visually there have been few improvements, and a shocking lack of options is disturbing, but if you can set aside these problems and have the patience to learn these obviously outdated gameplay mechanics then both Baldur's Gate 1: Enhanced Edition and Baldur's Gate 2: Enhanced Edition are absolutely worth it.

												The Baldur's Gate series is without question the apex of Bioware development and a masterpiece CRPG. I'm not going to comment on whether or not the series is good or bad since it goes without saying that any rpg fan needs to at least give it a spin. What's important and what I struggled with since the enhanced editions launched was whether or not these new editions were worth it, or whether or not I should just dust off my CD copies from the days of yore. It's true that there isn't anything in the enhanced editions that can't already be done with mods. The last time I tried installing the CD versions and modding it all up was a tedious experience though. It's also true that the added content is forgettable; the Black Pits is something that I'll never touch and the new NPCs range from tolerable (Neera, for example) to poor (Hexxat, for example). But I couldn't care less about the above. For me it boiled down to two things: One, was this version easier to set up and two, was this version buggier than the originals. The enhanced editions are no doubt easier to jump into on a modern computer due to many of the enhancements mirroring typical mods that you'd want to install (porting BG1 to the ToB engine, for example). Many of the community's mods have been updated for the Enhanced editions as well, so you can still cry in a fetal position as Swords Coast Stratagems mages rip you to shreds if that's your thing. Now, bugginess is obviously dependent on many variables and I can only experience my own playthrough of the series, but apart from one crash to desktop in the opening dungeon of BG2 my playthrough from BG1 to ToB was smooth and clean. The official forums would make you think that the game is a bug ridden mess and it kept me away from purchasing for months, but I do not regret purchasing it in its current state. I won't be touching my CD copy of the series again.			"

												“If there was something for the original Baldur’s Gate that just doesn’t mesh for modern day gamers like the sexism, [we tried to address that],” said writer Amber Scott. “In the original there’s a lot of jokes at women’s expense. Or if not a lot, there’s a couple, like Safana was just a sex object in BG 1, and Jaheira was the nagging wife and that was played for comedy. We were able to say like, ‘No, that’s not really the kind of story we want to make.’ In Siege of Dragonspear, Safana gets her own little storyline, she got a way better personality upgrade. If people don’t like that, then too bad.” -Amber Scott Preparing for the future ruin of this great classic by the ""writers"" frothing at the mouth to make BG3			"

												The original version was decent for its day, though I was never a fan of the Forgotten Realms setting as its one of the most boring of the D&D campaign settings.However this enhanced version, especially with the 2.0 patch and everything I've seen about the expansion is downright awful. Their agenda is showing, and I cannot recommend anyone give Beamdog any money. I wish I could request a refund.			"

												-Captured by Mind Flayers-Find out What Happened to Montaron-Find Proof of Mae'Var's Treachery-Inside the Planar Sphere-Investigate and Destroy the Cult of the Eyeless-Investigate the Deaths in the Umar Hills-Rescue Gerran's Child from Firkraag-Rescue Raelis and Haer'Dalis from the Planar Prison-Seek Out and Investigate the Fallen Paladins-Solve the 'skinner' Murders in the Bridge DistrictThe above would be among the best RPG main questlines ever, but they aren't, they are SIDE quests! All for one game. One game that still stands in 2017 with a game world of unparalleled scope, atmosphere, and intrigue. Each of the above mentioned quests takes hours, but there's always more to do, even after you finish them. The massive scope of Baldur's Gate 2 is decorated with mostly text-based dialogue (though the main story line is almost fully, and fabulously, voice acted). Dialogue that represents the best writing the gaming industry has to offer. BioWare's storytelling in this game hasn't been matched for 17 years. 20 deep and intriguing, well developed characters make up the cast of NPCs you get to choose from to form your party of 6. Each of those party members will banter with eachother, and will question your decisions, and sometimes your decisions will lead to them leaving you, or even trying to kill you.There's plenty complex gameplay that overlays a massive adventure here. 7 races, dozens of classes, and hundreds of abilities and spells, are all yours to experiment with as you clash with hundreds of different kinds of enemies and monsters, who all possess abilities and spells of the same complexity. Decorated with visually stunning spell effects and suprisingly immersive sound effects, this game still boasts many of the most epic RPG fights in the history of videogames. There's always something new to learn about the combat, so this gameplay will never cease to engage and interest you.You'll find youself in a dungeon, trying to rescue a poor man's daughter from a dragon, but that dragon instantly butchers all of your tanky warriors as soon as you unpause. You'll find yourself in an ancient ruin with a demon that is immune to all forms of attack. The challenges are endless in this game, and they rival Dark Souls, but they are equally rewarding as well. When you finally figure out how to kill that Dragon, his loot will turn you into a demi-god, which is good, because you will have to fight a God in the next fight after that.The main quest features many more characters besides the 20 NPCs that you get to choose. A quest that will take you on unforgettable adventures, not only through the Forgotten Realms, but through human emotion. Torture, imprisonment, war, death, suffering, and betrayal are all features in this wonderfully dark and gripping tale. The mage Jon Irenicus, widely regarded as the best videogame villain of all time, tries to strip you of your powers, tortures you, and the questions he asks about your abominable and inhuman nature linger with you for the entire game, and often come up in nightmares. He takes your friends from you, and he steals your very soul, and leads you on a merry chase through Elven forests, Catacombs full of vampires, alternate planes of existence, cities below the Ocean, Islands ruled by barbaric Pirates, Elven cities, The Underdark, and even to the Deepest circle of Hell. 17 years later people are still playing this game, and the only ones who wouldn't tell you it's one of the best, if not THE best RPG of all time, are the ones who haven't played it. It's better late than never to change that. No RPG has a combination of such a massive game world full of atmospheric detail and intrigue, combined with flawless and gripping writing, and extremely engaging and rewarding gameplay. And along with everything else, This games soundtrack will stick with you for the rest of your life, along with many of the characters, and many of the events.11/10 ""The pinnacle of RPG greatness, by which all other titles of the genre are measured"" -GOG			"

 ""Take heart fellow adventurers, for you have curried the favor of Boo, the only miniature giant space hamster in the realm!” Baldur’s Gate 2 is a towering achievement in the history of role-playing games. Since 2000, when Black Isle Studios finally released this role-playing game (rpg) sequel of its signature series Baldur’s Gate, the fan community has significantly grown in numbers. This lavishly produced game quickly established itself as the most compelling, intelligent and exciting rpg available for PC. After Fallout, Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale it was the next milestone of unparalleled quality, its renown extending far beyond the boundaries of the genre. For instance, the people, who were not interested in the rpg genre at all, were drawn to it, and particularly praised the smart and sophisticated gameplay.The protagonist and companions have an incredible chemistry, and are surrounded by some of the most vivid and compelling fantasy creatures ever created. The storytelling is epic, and the memorable characters offer loads of witty and mature dialogues. Furthermore, the different classes, alignments and team combinations create an amazing replayability.In addition, the expansion – called Throne of Bhaal – offers up enough gameplay improvements, innovations, technical advances, and new content to justify itself as a worthy add-on to the main game. Amusing quotes:  “Edwin do this. Edwin do that. Someone get this jerk a banana!”  “I wanted infravision like the elves... But 'tis more than just taking their eyes.”  “Boo points, I punch. Is very simple relationship, but it is effective.”  Trivia: During the game's development, a quality assurance department was added to BioWare, and the game's publishers lent their assistance in testing. Because of its immense size with over 300 quests, Baldur's Gate 2 was considered a tester's nightmare.

												This is a review for a very specific catagory of people.I bought this game, along with the first, only so that I wouldn't have to go through the trouble of patching it whenever I reinstalled my existing, regular version. I generally play at least one infinity engine game a year and don't keep them on my hard drive inbetween.If this review was for the game itself it would be nothing but glowing praise. Baldur's gate 2 still somehow stands up to more modern releases when coupled with the widescreen mod, et al. As it stands, this enhanced edition changes some elements in a way that I, personally don't like.If you are a returning player, like me, and looking for convinience, I recommend a little research into the differences between this, and a modded original.

												Just to note, Baldur's Gate is my favorite video game. However, I can't recommend this ""enhanced"" edition.I spent quite some time debating whether or not to recommend this game. It boils down to this: The original content is great. Still is, still always will be. It's an epic adventure with great characters, good plot development and fantastic modified-2nd edition gameplay. The graphics show their age, of course, but there are still some great backdrops and whatnot. The dialogue in this game is probably the best of any game ever made -- epic when it needs to be, and hilarious otherwise.Why I don't recommend this game is the new content, which is poorly written and boring. The new characters are written by people who clearly don't comprehend the wit of the original game, but think they do. It's painful.Seriously, go find the original version on the internet somewhere for a much cheaper price, and enjoy. If you can't find it or just want a Steam version (which is what I did), then go for it! You will still have a great time with this version!			"

												Why did Beamdog force a new UI on players who were totally pleased with it as is?  I've been extremely pleased with all my EE purchases, but now I'm really concerned.   I was unable to even get through character creation.\ -The ui elements are WAY too small on my macbook pro retina screen.  In order to tweak base attributes, I had to really try clicking on the + - buttons. -I wanted to start a Fighter/Mage.  I found the spell selection went from a grid/icon view, to a list/icon view.  Before you were able to at one glance see all the spells you had selected and all the available spells.  Now, you can only see about 5 at a time.  You have to then scroll down to see the other options.  Not a good design decision, and I can't imagine this being better on a tablet either...I've clocked a LOT of time into this game, not even mentioning the legacy version.  I like to re-visit this game every-so-often as well.  Upon doing so last night I was horrified.After accidentally choosing the wrong spells I gave up in frustration.   Please fix this and give us back our classic UI!			"

												I love this game!  I have since it first came out and I bought its CD-ROM version! When it was released in Steam (Enhanced Edition) I also bought it and really enjoyed it! But as so many others here in the reviews, I can’t even bear to play it in its current form (update 2.0). They managed to ruin a perfect formula, with messed up journal, weird zoom in and out for the map, and complete overhaul of the beautiful previous UI and menu. The game has lost its charm! I really hope that the developers will give us the option of playing it in a mode that pays respect to the original that we love! Until then I cannot continue to recommend this once great game!			"

												Certainly the best turn based game I've ever played, and ranks as one of the best video games I've ever played alongside its predessor. Unlike the first game, this one moves much faster and right from the get go throws you into the action. As far as the story goes (which is the most important aspect of a game) this is unparalled in the fantasy genre. Controls are a bit tedious as is the movement algorithm for controlled characters, but nothing an hour in game wont get you adjusted to. Graphics are not this game's strong point, however they are good considering when the game was made, and do not in anyway impede the story or experience. 10/10 would play again.			"

												Undoubtly one of, if not the best RPG games of all time, it was a instant classic when it was released many years ago. It covers around 200hrs or so of playtime depending on what all you decide to do in it, with tremendous replay value in the form is multiple choice dialogue, character creation, party selection, and branching storylines.StorylineBeing of the strongest aspects of the game, it is rich in nature and varied to some degree depending on your choices in the game, which can have a real permanant impact on how it unfolds and certain events that can occur later. The main story covers about 50hrs or so of the game, so it is a small piece of the much larger game with dozens of sidequests and optional areas to explore.CharactersThere are about a dozen or so base characters in the game, each with their own unique look and personality. Everyone of them interact with other party members and some may even outright refuse to join you if they see a particular person already with you. Lots of instances in the game have reactive choices as well, meaning they will either comment on your actions or depending on how extreme may even outright leave you. Romances are possible in the game with three standard female options to choose from and one male.GameplayThe gameplay is largely based on the DnD 2nd edition ruleset, though you really don't need to be particular familiar with this in order to be able to play it. You are able to either create your own entire party from scratch, which can be a lengthy process if you aren't familiar with the game or choose from existing templates. Battles can be highly tactical in nature with many having numerous ways fo being handled depending on your composition, spells and gear. Some encounters will also be different depending on what level you get to them at, being far more difficult if you aren't properly prepared. SoundThe voice acting in the game is top notch and there are thousands of lines of dialogue to go through. Not all of it is fully voiced, but all of the important scenes in the game are. Music sets a good pace as well, with some of them being able to indicate a tell tale pace as to what type of encounter you are facing, with major ones playing certain tracks which you will come to know and associate.OverallIf you are any kind of a fan of RPG games, this is a must play. Deep character development, storyline, relantionship building, roleplaying elements and sheer replayability will have you spending many hours in this classic. And with the ability to download mods for it to add more quests, characters, romances, items and new areas; the possibilities are staggering.			"

NOTE: I’m posting this review on both Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition and Baldur’s Gate 2: Enhanced Edition pages, since my opinion is valid for both products, and they should be considered as one.What can one say in front of such magnificence? These two RPGs are simply the pillar of western production of this genre, and when the two are combined in a single game they definitively are among the top 10 of the must-play for every PC gamer out there, no matter the age.BG:EE and BG2:EE are simply THE definitive Dungeons & Dragons experience, including almost all the possible 2.5 Edition Core and several optional rulebooks of the Forgotten Realms setting and translating them into a marvellous duo of 3rd person games.Although both games are very old (they were developed and published between 1998 and 2001 by Bioware / Black Isle Studios), they have been “enhanced” and made available on modern systems (including Windows 7/8/10 PCs, OSx, Android and IOS) by the guys at Overhaul Games / Beamdog, who not only re-tooled the original Infinity Engine to make it run on modern platforms, but also added several other goodies that were not present in the original release, in addition to bug fixes and standard “curator” jobs.I could go on for pages and pages describing in detail the marvels of the Baldur’s Gate Series, but I’ll try to cut it short and stick to a much shorter format.PROs- Ever dreamed of taking your typical AD&D session with your friends out of the pen & paper setting to a PC screen? This game is for you!- Charismatic characters and companions: Minsc the Ranger (and Boo!), Jaheira, Viconia, Xzar, Sarevok… what else can I say?- Longevity: both games combined are well over 100 hours of gameplay- Replayability: seriously, there are hundreds of possible combinations of classes / races / kits / alignments / companions / choices to completely change your experience at every playthrough- Every action you make affects the game world, like it is expected from a proper Western RPG. Apart from some scripted events to progress with the main story, the rest is up to you- Multiplayer: join with 5 friends to create a fully custom party!- The (new) developers are supporting the game with patches and fixes, and they actually listen to the community- Compatible with most of the original BG / BG2 community mods- Runs on every system, even your mobile phone / tablet (NOTE: the Android / IOs versions are separate purchases). HW requirements are very lowCONs- After more than 16 years from my first BG playthrough I still cannot find a single flaw in any of these games. They are simply a masterpiece.In a nutshell, these games set THE standard all the following RPGs on the market were measured against, and none of them was able to surpass Baldur’s Gate until now.Buy them, play them, enjoy them. 12/10, would pickpocket Drizzt again			"

												If I had to rate the enhaced version of this game without ever playing the original I would easly give this a 5 out of 5. That being said though having played the original Baldur's Gate 2 and Throne of Bhaal many time over, I would give the enhanced version a 3 out of 5.I give the ""enhanced"" version a lower rating for a few facts;1. I have noticed far more bugs in the enhanced version of the game then I ever did in the origional, including broken spells. monster spawns, and quests.2. The price... need I say more $25 for an improved UI and multiplayer, 4 extra characters, a new expansion, and a host of new bugs, when you can get the original bioware clasic for $10 from other places.3. With the improved engine comes a lack of settings present in the original, one of the more important being the number of pathing nodes, the enhanced version seems to be set at the default 400,000 nodes with out any way of changing it, so prepair for plenty of ""You must gather your party before venturing forth""All in all I have still put in 20.5hrs in the last 2 weeks acording to steam and I plan on putting in many more just for the sake of finishing what I started, but I would definitely recommend waiting for it to go on sale before getting it unless you are a die hard fan like me and must have it right away.     -Every hamster has his day!

												Let me make one thing very clear: I LOVE THIS GAME, this is my favorite game of all time alongside Neverwinter Nights.The Story, The Music, The Gameplay, The Characters i love it all, i wanted to write a long and detalied review giving my honest thoughts about why i love this game so much.I would recommend the Enhanced Edition of both BG1 and BG2 instantly before the thing everyone else talks about happend:The 2.0 update.The new cartoonish sprites might look ugly but at least you can disable them.But then we have the UI... in the words of Dr.Steinmen from Bioshock: It is Ugly. Ugly! Ugly! UUGGLLLYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!This Ugly UI ruins the game for me, until this gets fixed im avoiding this game and i suggest everyone else does the same.			"

												A lot of us older gamers fall into the trap of comparing games today against games in our nostalgic memory. I can think of only a few games that were objectively as good if not better than today in terms of pure gameplay standards (we won't talk about game company practice comparisons).Baldur's Gate 2: ToB is one of those games I've the most fond memories of. I liked the idea of Dungeons & Dragons but I wasn't overly familiar with all of the internal concepts and I still enjoyed the hell out of it. And I strongly believe that you can too.I doubt this recommendation will sway anyone, if you haven't played Baldur's Gate 2 previously or already picked up the enhanced editions you aren't likely to based on my say so. However, I feel compelled to encourage you to play through it regardless of your D&D expertise.			"

												I remember playing this as an kid and loving it, however DO NOT buy this game now.What you're buying is now ""Baldur's Gate II: The SJW Hacked Together Edition 2.0"".I played around and so far it looks like it 90% of the update destroys the majority of game content while the 10% adds some nice new features to it. (Such as totally making the UI unusable, adding a horrible lazy multiplayer attempt, changing MAIN characters to fit their own political agenda with stupid quotes, and worst of all, FORCING you to use this version and bragging about how they don't care about what the ""biggoted"" minority playerbase wants)I'd recommend finding another source to get this game from besides Steam and avoid this horrible mess.Not mention the fact that the developers themselves (dee) has been mass forum banning from people that have called out their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ excuses and lazy job while forcing SJW garbage down peoples throats. Valve however has stepped in and has removed all of their privileges on the forum and has unbanned every user that was affected by the abusing developers trying to censor legitimate responses and threads.Edit; Oh boy, did some researching on what others have also called out and it turns out one of their developers(TrentOster) is beggeingfor users to give positive reviews and some popular members have said they've been offered gift copies of the game to hand out under the assumption that they'll leave positive reviews in return.

												This is still the greatest rpg I have ever played. I played this game when it first came out in its four disc glory and jumped on it when I saw it on sale. The story is compelling and engrossing and the sidequests are entertaining as well. The graphics hold up well and the style is still enjoyable to play through. The ""enhanced"" part is negligable, if you played an earlier version you are not missing much. This is a must play for any rpg fan.			"

												If you have not played this yet, chances are, you were too young or RPGs are not your cup of tea. It is a classic that gotten a touch-up by Beamdog and honestly deserve a chance if you like:1. Plenty of reading/lores (walls of text but definitely worthwhile reading).2. Decent characters to love/hate (*cough* *♥♥♥♥♥* *cough* *Jaheira* *cough*) that are weirdly more memorable than most other RPGs.3. Enemies that will rip your carefully planned formation/strategy/party into pieces just because they can (damn you Lich).4. Enjoyable fights (especially after you loaded the same save over and over till you won the fight).However do note that the touch-up do have its fair share of bugs (even though I successfully completed two separate runs through the game). It has been fixed (mostly) and you should not be facing any game-breaking in most circumstances. Overall, it is really cheap and definitely worth a try :)			"

Because my computer sucked. So I used to have to switch the cds. And there's one area in between cd 2 and cd 3 where you would switch. But at once point you could still go back to the cd 2 areas, so I would find myself constantly switching between cd 2 and 3. But I digress. I probably have like 500 hours on my cd version of this game. So like 600ish total hours on this game. I'm still finding new stuff.			"

												This is one of those classic RPGs that just don't get old. At least for me personally. I still rate this to be one of the best games ever so can't really write about it neutrally/objectively.Epic story, ageless visual style, brilliant voice acting and sounds overall, interesting tactical combat, solid controls though mayhaps a bit outdated for the modern gamer (very natural for me as I played this at an age when I didn't even speak English), challenging, the writing on the party members is just gold and the list goes on.Through the game it's great how you feel as the power of your party increases steadily and towards the end of the game you have seriously strong bunch of badasses wearing rare powerful gear, with stories of their own. And as you've finished the game you can't but help feel touched by what an awesome literally epic adventure of struggle and finding what and who you are and what is your destiny in the world you've traversed through.To keep it short I'm gonna stop rambling here. I'm suggesting this game to anyone whose loved the old CRPGs and pretty much to any fantasy RPG lover. I'm sure it's going to feel a bit old and rough to get into for some but if you put the time to play it in length, get into it, play through it, I'm sure it'll be an interesting and rewarding game experience for you.

												What can I say about Baldur's Gate 2? Well, lets start with the flaws. Whoever designed the romances had a thing for elves. That's it really. That's the only thing close to a flaw. It's an amazingly solid game filled with some fantastic characters and some genuinely imaginative quests that rewards careful planning and thinking things through, something modern games seem to have abandoned in favour of letting players just facetank everything. The challenges combined with the brilliant characters just make winning so much better, especially when that one fight you thought was impossible suddenly turns out to be easier than eating cake when you think to try one of the fun little counters to whatever was petrifying you/eating you/setting you on fire/Charming Minsc, setting him to BLEND and sending him back after you.Carrying a character through from a level one scrub in Baldur's Gate and into Baldurs Gate two then onto Throne of Bhaal is an amazing journey full of frustration, laughter, lots of swearing and ultimately watching your level 40 character effortlessly wipe out entire armies is something everyone should do at least once.Hamsters and rangers everywhere, rejoice!

												TL; DR: 'Learn hard to enjoy hard.'That about sums up my thoughts on BG series, unless one is an original D&D fan and knows most of the rules and spells already.BG isn't like the latest Blizzard games. It doesn't explain you much about anything, let alone a proper tutorial. There are dozens of status effects and you need to know how to counter them using the right spell which you might have or not if you didn't know about it. You have to pause a lot and make strategic moves, and I'm sure that this isn't rly familiar to younger generations unless they have been playing Dragon Age. This is definitely not easy to learn, thus you need to 'learn hard to enjoy hard.'You might not like the term though. Why bother learning how to play this game when there are hundreds of other games that are much more newbie-friendly? This probably is the reason why the review score goes down every big sale; people buy it, doesn't get it, quit and thumbs down.So back to the point. If you ask me why bother learning, this is my answer:  BG will let you conquer the game itself.In Diablo, you will kill enemies using different weapons, and skills. It's not a matter of strategy, but a combination.In BG, at first, you may step on traps. You may spend a long time to gear up different party members. You may be frustrated to control all characters at once. You may become paranoid at enemy mages, and be vulnerable against status effects.After some time, traps wouldn't bother you anymore, and you may like it as a source of exp. You will learn how to gear up your party members properly. You will be using pause at a right moment and command all your characters at once. You will learn how to interfere enemy mages, and remove status effects. After considerable amount of time, enemies will be stepping on your traps. You will minmax every characters in different save files and do funny things. You won't need to pause anymore. Enemies will be paranoid at your mage and status effects, while you will simply prevent bad status effects from your party.As time goes by, the things that you've hated for the most will start to work on your favor, and you will be able to try different strategies. This feeling of accomplishment and variety is probably why people still like and play BG.If you are ready for it, BG can be a historical masterpiece for you. If you are not, you might see it as an obsolete piece of drek. It's up to you, really. And as a fan of this game, I hope you give chance at it and stick with it a little more before you quit. You will see the turning point, as I did.			"

												Before you blaze past a negative review for what is my favorite RPG and game of all time let's take a look at why i do not reccomend buying this version of it.BioWare did a fantastic job, and they still do, at making top notch games that not only excell in every aspect of role playing, character customization, RPG systems, and general gameplay but they are known for having minimal bugs in their software. Beamdog in all their 'enhanced editions' has managed to introduce game breaking and software breaking bugs that can only be cured by running the Linux versions in a Linux steam. and even then this solution is not neccessarily an end all. if you're not old enough to still own your 4CD BGII: SoA and Disks for ToB then i reccomend getting it from GoG. Beamdog totally destroyed any semblance of quality in the BEST RPG series ever made.UPDATE:issue:1) if you have had a different experience that is great, that is, in fact, VERY GOOD. however is does not discount the numerous bugs and performance concerns you can find that match and exceed the ones i have seen in 30 seconds with google or bing or whatever search engine you prefer. so please do not post drivel about how ""my experience trumps your experience"". hardware and software are complicated and undoubtedly people will have conflicting experiences, KEEP IT TO YOUR SELF.2) Using a decent intel processor seems to remedy much of the issues in terms of performance. however the performance requirements of the game should allow for anything AMD FM1/Phenom II or even Core 2 but they do not and those systems will, in my experience completely fail at running the game when a lot is going on. this, in some cases prevents issues with the GPU however intel and NVidia GPUs still seem to have framerate issues when a lot of activity is present.final note: the issues with the HUD are almost always a CPU issue. also any card that is being controlled with a driver that uses an OpenGL version higher than stated in the GPU spec (note 500 series NVidia cards only technically go to 4.1 but modern 500 series driver uses 4.4)  will possibly have issues.tl;dr this game used to run well and it doesn't universally run well anymore, use the original on GoG or if you have the disks, the only reason to buy a beamdog update is for IceWind Dale because the old infinite engine ran on IPX for multiplayer which is no longer supported outside of WindowsXP and is only workable for local area networking.The March 31 update for this is UNSIGHTLY, UGLY, and ultimately destroys any semblance of authenticity to the aesthetics of the original and should not be bought. as of now i will be using the original from GoG or my CDs, THIS IS AN AFFRONT TO THE USERS AND SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												Baldur's Gate 2 EE is frequently (but not always) given the crown for best of the classic isometric Forgotten Realms RPGs, and that reputation is well deserved. With a dark and provacative main story arc, the ability to play as both good and evil with alignment-appropriate companions, side quests with enough content to rival main quests in other games, compelling companions with deep stories, and a RTwP (real time w/ pause) combat system that manages to make combat both chaotic and strategic - BG2EE should be a slam-dunk recommend. Unfortunately the game does have flaws, and I'll use this review to detail these weaknesses so that users on the fence can make an informed decision before buying.  BG2EE owes much of its incredible story to the environment in which its set. The Dungeons and Dragons universe is rich with both lore and mechanics. While the game unarguably benefits from the rich lore, the same cannot be said of the mechanics. The AD&D ruleset, cumbersome and obtuse even in its time during pen and paper play, is a harsh ruleset for a PC RPG. New players will need to spend a substantial amount of time learning about AC, THAC0, weapon proficiences, Ability Score modifiers, weapon enchantment levels, combat protection spells, spell protection spells, various dispels, and so much more. Diving into the game without a basic understanding of these rules will almost certainly lead to a 'gimped' charachter and near-guaranteed slaughter by certain encounters. The need for an intimate understanding of the rulesets is made worse by the choices the developers made in crafting companions. Your companions, while having emotionally compelling stories that draw you deeply into the game, will join your party with weapon profeciencies and leveling decisions that are questionable (at best). My recommendation on this is to download EEKeeper and use it to tweak your companions' weapon proficiencies. Problem solved, so long as you have the dicipline to not break the game by boosting instead of tweaking. You'll find another flaw with BG2EE when you examine how the story is balanced. Completionists (as I imagine most hardcore RPG players looking at this title are) will want to complete all available sidequests before advancing to the next main story chapter. In BG1EE, this worked fine. Every chapter unlocked additional sidequests in a relatively steady flow. Not so in BG2EE. You'll step out of the introductory dungeon with the vast majority of the game's sidequests front loaded. Literally dozens of hours of deep, rich content that will you keep you enthralled for days before you even touch the main quest.   Normally this wouldn't be an issue, and most would consider it a good thing, except the main story arc's hook is to remove from play one of your best (imo) companion choices. This made party selection more difficult than it needed to be, at least for me. To wrap this review up, which has now become my longest review to date, I'll say this: If you're willing to play the prequel and immerse yourself in the story and willing to take the time to learn the mechanics, plan out your party choices, and use EEKeeper to  tweak those companions - Baldur's Gate 2 EE will be guaranteed to be one of your most unforgetable gaming experiences. If not, you're still likely to have a great time, but the experience may be tainted by frustration and confusion.			"

												I've never played the original version of this game before, but I can definitely say this is one of the best Western RPGs ever crafted. The story picks up directly after Baldur's Gate 1, so I would say its definitely necessary to play that game before this one and for the fact that it gives a much better pacing in the actual gameplay because in BG1; You start off as a lowly level 1 and can slowly learn all the ins and outs of the DND 3.5 system and fight smaller challenges because in BG2, you start off at a much higher level with advanced skills and greater challenges to face and might possibly have some difficulty especially if you choose a hard area to go to first.This game is also one of the biggest games I've ever played and that's saying a lot because this wasn't 80+ hours of messing around...it was all me trying to just playthrough the game and doing most of the quests. Speaking of quests, after the initial dungeon, you are treated to an entire chapter where essentially you are free to explore and do as many interesting sidequests as you please and this will take you most of your time playing through the game, but doing a good amount of them is also the key to even be a high enough level to take on the main storyline, but the quests  are varied and interesting enough that you might not even want to touch the story for a long time (even as urgent as it is)All this and I've barely even mentioned that after you finish this extremely lengthy game that there is the expansion called Throne of Bhaal which adds another 15-20 hours of gameplay and picks up right where the story left off and it adds even more to such an amazing game.In Conclusion, I would recommend this game to any WRPG fan and even just fans of the genre in general. There might be a bit of a learning curve because of all the DND talk, but a few google searches or even just doing the in-game tutorials will help you understand things better, so no need to be overwhelmed.

												Baldur's Gate II:EE is the combined pack of Shadows of Amn+Throne of Bhaal which continue and conclude the story of Gorion's ward and their ascension into Godhood. BGII is arguably one of the best roleplaying games of all time with an incredibly deep, intricately woven and dark story that plays host to one of the best game villains and a plethora of tangential side missions, stories and npcs that make the world of Faerun come to life. Shadows of Amn's story begins shortly after the events of the original Baldur's Gate, the opening cinematic and cutscene opens with your character being the unwilling constituent in the antagonist's demented BDSM fantasies. Little is revealed initially other than his name, Irenicus and he has shown some interest in you, or more specifically your heritage. His experiments are quickly interrupted by a besieging rival guild and in the ensuing chaos you are able to escape and you begin your journey in pursuit of Irenicus and his ilk to seek out your revenge. Your adventure will see you travel the city of coin, Athkatla and the surrounding countryside of Amn as you pursue Irenicus down the Sword Coast. Throughout your travels you'll slowly learn the motivations and misdeeds that drive Irenicus and your interactions with him reveal the true nature of your lineage. Irenicus is a solid and well written antagonist although he isn't as insidious or devious as Sarevok.Defeating Irenicus will throw you into Throne of Bhaal which is the culmination of the Bhaalspawn saga which pits you against the other most powerful Bhaalspawn in a Highlander-esque showdown to become the reincarnation of Bhaal himself. 'There can be only one..'The gameplay is essentially unchanged from the first Baldur's Gate, at least at its core, it's still very tactical realtime combat with the ability to pause. Overall though the 'meta' is very different with [arcane] spellcasters being very strong in BGII due to the increased level cap and access to higher level spells and the abundance of powerful items, where as BGI was much easier as a warrior. Generally though the combat feels more enjoyable with a wider array of tools at your disposal and a greater array of vastly differing enemies to fight makes many battles feel varied and memorable. The further you push through the story of SoA and into ToB the more action oriented the game and combat will become as enemies get tougher and your character grows stronger. The increase in action will help accomodate for the weaker story in ToB. Overall though the combat is still very slow comparatively with any Arpg as it is designed to take some level of strategy and meticulous planning to succeed in BGII.Graphically the Baldur's Gate series is timelessly beautiful because of the development decision to use painted 2d backdrops. The spell effects still look amazing and vary greatly between spells. The character models on the otherhand have not aged well and look very bland, pixelated and blurry but is a minor grievance in the grand scheme of things.Having completed this game several times now, both playing with a full player created party, solo and then picking up npcs along the way the game offers a lot of replayability whether it be from the particular challenges and different strategies required of each class during fights with certain enemies and bosses or from the story arcs and commentary provided by the npcs you choose. This is a thinking man's game so if you're looking for a game with which to turn your brain off and have some mindless fun you may wish to reconsider. Those looking for a challenge and a riveting story this is the game for you. On a personal note, this is one of my favourite games of all time and I recommend it wholeheartedly, especially to those that enjoy a good rpg.			"

												I love deep, classic RPG's. It uses 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons rules which give this game good complexity. The writting is epic. The music full. The visuals and aesthetic are immersive and detailed. Its not hard to see why Bioware wanted to pull aspects from this game for the Dragon Age franchise.Bottom line, buy this game and buy it now.

												This a review on both BG/BG2 EE.Beamdog has proven to be nothing but money-milking company. Claiming to be the most hardcore BG fans blah blah they actually showed a complete lack of knowledge of the game concept. People modded this game for an eternity before them and did a MUCH greater job in actually enhancing original title. None of these improvements were implemented in EE-versions of both BG/BG2. Instead they introduced a horrible UI design (that applies mostly to BG1 but still - compare their UI to BG tutu, for instance), disgusting new art/cinematic/portraits made in a complete different style, that distracts and ruin the whole atmosphere. Tons of bugs and glitches were introduced with the initial releases only to trigger numerous patches, that... brought new bugs. And what are these bugs? Camera zoom level being reset after leaving/entering the zone, commands not being issued after the first click etc. We are ""enchancing"" a 98' game, remember? But that aside, what i really hoped for was the actual enhancing of battle system as there were tons of great mods like scs that screamed to be implemented in EE version along with the option to tweak the difficulty on the fly, w/o the need of 3rd party programs, different difficulty settings etc etc. Instead we got none of this. Ye, they left a modding option (right, you needed to ""mod the enhanced verion"" to actually play the game), only to release so called EE 2.0 later on that brought an end to 20 years of hard work of modding. 99% of mods are incompatible with it. Wohoo! And yes, they intoduced a new difficulty to compansate. Kappa. All it does is 10 times increased mobs hp-pools so your first fight (in tutorial) takes a year and half with 1032377 game loads. Keep up the good work, beamdog. True BG fans!			"

												This game used to be great. Then they ""updated"" it. The new graphics are hard on my computer, and it is so glitchy that it erased my saved game. Will not use again until it is updated to fix this.EDIT: Okay, so multiple updates later, and the game is starting (barely) to look like its old self again graphics-wise, but is still incredibly slow (to say nothing of the other changes the other reviewers are talking about - I'm a new player so I'll leave that alone). ... Beamdog, you started with a perfectly good game. How in the world did you mess this up this badly? And how did you manage to make an old game laggy? You guys literally could not have screwed this up worse.*Sigh* Well, it's like my old high school teacher use to say: ""Fix it till it's broke.""Second EDIT: As other reviewers pointed out, you can revert back to the 1.3 version before the horrible new graphics came out. I'll be playing that version, but I still cannot recommend buying this game if there are other alternative versions of this game out there.			"

												One of the best old-school RPG, back when Bioware were making games so good, they were ahead of their time. Along with Kotor 1&2, Baldur's Gate 1&2 were Masterpiece, gameplay (Strategy, turn-by-turn, fully customable AI behavior, driven story) and the stories/lores in every cornes of the game makes its so much enjoyable.  Sometimes I'm kinda against old games making a ""remastered"" (which 80% of those games are adding minor tweak that a simple mod/download+unzip/ was fixing the problem, which many are still broken and force people to modify their old fix/mod so it works with both version now.  (Aka, Myst,Riven,Baldursgate,Kotor,deusex,rollercoaster,systemshock,etc) But this game is so worth it that you will GLADLY spend that time fixing some of the issues (you might get lucky also!).I have 21 hours played and I still feel like I am early in the game and yet so much epic stuff happened and met so many people...

												BG2 is one of the best games of all time.BG 2 enhanced edition is positively the worst version of the game.I specifically only bought it to play multiplayer with a friend, because I assumed an enhanced edition surely would have the most polished multiplayer, right?Wrong.Riddled with bugs. You can't start a new multiplayer game without being forced to create a complete party (in a game known for having great NPC party members), constant crashes, random disconections, and strange lag whenever you pick up items without being the host. And many other minor problems.Although I have not gotten all the new npcs, I can tell that the ones I've gotten to (a thief and a wild mage) are terribly written, and have no respect for the setting of forgotten realms. The writers clearly either did not read into the setting, or just did not care. Not to mention that they clash horribly with the old party members, and barely interact with them. It seems silly that jaheira would comment on a drow joining the party but not a VAMPIRE of all things.tl/dr:Bugs+terrible graphics make this a bad version of the game, and the additional npcs are badly written. Do not buy.			"

												OK, so a little background. I've been playing this game for years and loved it. Unfortunatly I lost the disks during a recent move and was crushed to learn I could play my fav game. I've never really used steam and when I was surfing the store I saw this on sale for $10. Needless to say I was delighted to no end. I bought there and was surprised by all the added content to the original game. I have probably several hundred hours on the old version and this new Extended Edition has made some changes that I find interesting and helpful.BGEE has some small changes such as loot finder, improved combat rolls, character creation, inventory perks, ect. But the change that got my attention was the item stacking increase.I have played about every role there is to play in this game, but my most favorite is the ranger/Archer. The old problem was never having enough arrows. The old game had arrows in stacks of 40, now they stack to 80. Potions as well have increased up to 20, the old was 5. Small but very important changes like this make the game more enjoyable without having to fret over the constant nuscience of running out of supplies all the time.Also there is a inreased amount of data availible about Armor Class, Damage Throws, Thaco, ect. that wasn't in the original. You can now see how much damage your charcters can take and deal (and how fast) with relative ease. Another useful feature, is the fact you can now zoom in and out to adjust the point of veiw of the game. A wider range of resalutions give the most access to play on any screen (I'm playing on a laptop). The perk about the EE is that it plays seemlessly with any version of windows. I'm currebtly running on Windows 8 and works without a hitch thus far.If you've played this before and need more information on the changes made you visit the community page (also many tips on what class to start with and the changes made to the roles of each one). All in all a very good remastering of a classic and deffinatly recommend this game to new and old players alike.Happy Gaming :)			"

												One of my favorite games of all time, and it's held up marvelously even over a decade later. It has one of the greatest villains in gaming, a boatload of content (easily ~60 hours for a playthrough of the game and the expansion) ability to explore and do stuff at your own whim, lots of great characters, and tons of iconic forgotten realms locations. The enhanced edition is great, and adds new quests, areas, characters, an arena mode, and a sorely needed interface upgrade.			"

												Owners of the original may post comments like this is the same game repackaged and they already did all of this with free mods....... Well they would be correct mostly however there are a few notable improvements, mainly the new introduction of multiple new characters each with there own areas and quests thrown in which does provide quite a few extra hours of interesting places to explore. The other note I will make on people who owned the previous game is that not everyone is into messing around with mods and tweaking the game, what this does is pretty much give you all those tweaks in a nice easy to use bundle which suits me just fine. For those of you that have never played baldurs gate 2 or the first one I would suggest getting that one first and then playing through. The reason why is because this in my opinion is simply Bioware's story telling at it's absolute finest, you know the good stuff before EA came along and basically♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the companies games  like they did so many other's ""cough mass effect"". ""cough dragon age 2"". Not that i really had over tone problems with dragon age 2 it was just the fact that I had to upset my companions by turning down the OTT sexual harressment from my general party members if your into that it's cool not judging but anyway i digress. #Ultimately however I have written this review off the top of my head in about the last 2 minutes so it is most probably full of typo's and spelling errors feel free to correct me. Solid combat system Solid inventory systemSolid plot line Solid party characters that you can love I mean Minsc is da manSolid villans both first and second game. When you consider that they can create these characters without the CGI of newer games like mass effect or the voice over acting just done through partial voice acting and mostly text is a testament to how well written the dialogue in this game is. The more notable flaws I would say are in summationHas not really done much to improve on the original few extra chars and high res Certain classes do have limited abilities however this is probably because they stayed quite true to the D&D rule set 2nd edition could be third... unsure never played D&D off the computer. Certain classes defintely kick out way more power at certain levels to others this game can be power gamed. Few bugs in places but nothing major imo. Action pace can be slow for some but i liked this made me feel emersed in the game like i actually was going to a tavern and meeting characters and conversing instead of just fight fight fight....

												Baldurs Gate 2 on its own is probable one of the best games of its era. A really enjoyable game that has withstood the test of time. I would recommend anyone give it a shot because it really is one of the best. Seriously the gameplay is spectacular. Expect multiple 40+ hr playthroughs with a ton of replayability.This release by beamdog though is a joke. Game won't launch, more bugs than the original version, broken progression quests, incomplete garbage. It's like I am playing an alpha. Totally dissapointed at how this was released. The game is still one of the behemoths but the dev's of this release would make me stay away. Sorry guys.			"

												Pros:One of the best stories of any RPG ever made.There is almost 0 hand holding.New content is excellent. Hexxat is a really cool new character.The game is pretty difficult, but if you are willing to adapt and try new things you can win. I actually have died more in BG:2 in the first 3 chapters then I have in all of dark souls and demon souls combined. Tons of improvements over the old game. The red diamond for mass looting is amazing.Cons:Gameplay really didn't age well.Found a few minor bugs, nothing game breaking yet.The slower pace takes a bit to get used to. It is an punishing game if you rush.Overall the game holds up well and I recommend it if you like any of the other games that use the infinity engine.			"

												Quite simply the finest Dungeons and Dragons game ever made. David Warner (TRON, Star Trek TNG) is Jon Irenicus, an enigmatic and merciless mage who tortures you in captivity. You must escape, and unravel a scheme which involves the gods themselves. This is one of the most important North American RPGs released during the 96-02' golden age, and represents the pinnacle of the D&D rule system before it was ruined by Neverwinter Nights.This is the definitive edition of the game, and it is worth owning digitally for all time. New characters and content have been added, and you can import your character from Baldur's Gate I: Enhanced Edition. Your characters growth is intimidating--you can begin as a level 1 rookie, and by the conclusion of the final game, depending on your imported saved games, you and your party can end up as powerful as demigods.

												If you have never played the Baldurs Gate series, then purchase the classic edition and play that with some quality of life mods.  If you have, then keep playing the classic editions with those mods.  The added content from this Enhanced Edition ranges from pointless to mediocre, and the best part (the Black Pits II) is so utterly bug ridden that if you can get a character through a couple battles then consider yourself to have earned a steam achievement.  If you can get a single party properly imported from Baldurs Gate Enhanced Edition version of the Black Pits (this games Enhanced predcessor) then add another achievment to your wall of meaningless trophies.  Give yourself about 10 trophies if you can get through either games original campaign without an interesting, brand new to the EE bug that stops you in your tracks and forces at best a fall back to an older save (you are saving every 12 seconds yes?  that should be part of the Store page for these flawed and broken releases).What it boils down to is this:  this game is inferior in every way that its possible to be to the original or digital releases of the games, with some mods applied.  Graphically, stability wise, and content wise, this is a sad and pitiful insult to what might be the best RPG franchise in history.  Oh, and there are some changes to the original games cutscenes that, for some people, are heinous because they change the tone of certain areas.  I am not that bothered by it, you can always look at the original cutscenes on youtube, but its something that should be noted.  Its the bugginess and lack of anything meaningful added that gives these EE's a big fat NOPE.gif			"

It lives true to its name if you are a keen RPG fan (NOT to be confused as a hack n Slash RPG i.e. Diablo).Although this is a remake, the devs have breathed in new life into a almost perfect game of its time with updated compatiblity of higher-res, new quests, new characters and eliminated its inherent bugs.The graphics are dated, but still AMAZING for an aging game.I recommend this to all true RPG fans, as the replayablity is immense, the story 10/10, the depth of game play is deep and an all round winner, refreshed for the modern age.People say it is not worth the price, but I've bought all the iterations of this game and its expansions thorughout the years.

Decided to get it on steam so I would always have it handy as I kept misplacing it. All was well, just like the game I remembered and loved, THAT IS UNTIL!!!    Why did they have to update it, they have completely ruined it. I have uninstalled and reinstalled using original version, yet to see if this will make a difference but I can see I am not the only one who is displeased with new update so thought I would add my two pennies worth. You never know if enough people complain they may think twice before messing with a classic in the future!P.S Reinstalling using original version did work, obviously you cant join multiplayer unless you are all on the same version so there arn't many people on but interface is original and that is what really counts, right? Anyone wanting to play original just go to the game in your library, properties, then betas. Click on top version and install from there! Baldurs Gate the way it was meant to be seen!!			"

												The best RPG of all time along with Planescape: Torment. If you love DnD type RPGs this is a must have. I replayed this game countless times since it came out in 2000 and I'm not planning on stopping. It's a classic masterpiece - some modern games come close to matching the experience of BG2, but I always come back to it. For a new player, however, there is steep learning curve, but once learned you're immensly rewarded. BEAMDOG enchanded edition. They did a great job updating the visuals and fixed most of the bugs/crashes. However, content wise I think they did a poor job. I would rate 4/10 the actual 'enchanced' content part. Is the game still worth getting? YES, just I'd recommend skipping thenew 4 character story lines and staying away from them, I believe they dillute the quality of the original game.			"

												I love BG, BG2, NWN, and NWN2, which all can be bought on GOG. I got all the old DnD games off GOG for $20 during a sale. The Enhanced Edition doesn't really change much except add things that were added through mods, and add 4 new characters; Neera, Dorn, Rashaad, and Hexxat. Each character has a romance arc, a major quest in SoA, and a quest in ToB. So far I have mostly played with Neera (been bouncing back and forth between B♥♥♥♥nd BG2EE to pay mods that are not BG2EE ready), and the dialogue she has is hilarious. Also some areas have been slightly altered like the Order of the Radiant Heart. If you love B♥♥♥♥nd want to see what they changed, then I would say buy this game when its on sale. If you do not care about any of the new characters, then I would just go get it off GOG. Regardless I like BG2:EE for the most part. Also several of the NPC mods have been updated for BG2:EE. I have played BG/BGEE 5 times, and BG2/BG2EE at least 15 times, so if you play the game a lot the enhanced edition is worth the money.			"

Are you someone that enjoy roleplaying games? This is the game for you. If you can overlook the outdated graphics (which you SHOULD be able to do if you are a true roleplayer) then you'll absolutely, and positively love this title. And with the Enhanced Edition you get all the expansions aswell as new material. So put on your wizard hat or grab your dusty sword. It's oldschool adventuring time. Ps. This game is difficult.

Let's Get Straight In!I have played Baldur's Gate I & II since release way back on early 98 or something lol, i'm now 27 and still love this game with a passion and still develop for it, the graphics were unique but decent for their time and the mechanics were again unique and amazing, classic D&D style and i recommend this game to anyone who likes Medieval/Fantasy RP Games, Mobas, or general strategy games.The game offers micro-management on a fair scale with a.i. capabilities that come in handy considering how difficult the game can be.Now don't let the games graphics fool you, this game is fast paced when it comes to combat and you need to know what you're doing, this isn't your typical hack n slash or kick back cast and nuke, some enemies have immunities, some enemies have buffs or shields that could send your spells back at your party, they could be immune to the weapon they are using, 1 well-placed spell in this game can determine an entire battle remember that.The updates for the game have been amazing and beemdog are still hard at work although a shared files system would be nice, GameSpyArcade in it's days had just down, download and use the files of the host of the server, very cool feature i think BG is missing these days but still a great game, networking does need some improving still.The new chat system isn't all that, fairly small and if the group you are playing with is not very social it can be easy to lose track as it is hidden in the top right and to be honest i think having a chatbox above the console with no visible background or border would be much cleaner for the interface, or have it on the top of the window, just a suggestion.The new character borders are nice, at first i thought it looked a bit too toon but over time i've got used to it and its become a nice change.I think considering the patches that were released for ToB before EE to fix bugs that still exist in !EE! is madness, they were released with source codes so why were they not implemented in the EE release.(Thank you beamdog for fixing the cutscene crash/disconnect bug) that was driving the community of this game mad for so long.Finally i find considering the volume of modders for BG that use steam i think making BG EE workshop capable would be amazing for downloading/creating new content for the game, i know many people would appreciate this feature.Anyway, great game, great story, greatness, there is still no equal even in the MMO world, BG is still superior.

												This is a direct copy-paste of my review for Baldur's Gate - Enhanced Edition, as it pretty much covers everything I have to say about the sequel as well: Personal rating: 10/10Replayability: HighBudget: If you already own the original, buy on sale only. Lenght: ... It took me years to finally complete it. I'd wager an experienced player can get it done in a week or more. No less. Baldur's Gate is hands-down one of the best games I've ever played. While initially, porting D&D into a tactical real-time gameplay setting should set off some alarm-bells, this game is one of the most tactical games I've ever played, requiring precison, patience and understanding. It's also a roleplaying game that allows you to explore the, now venerable Forgotten Realms setting that I grew up with (Fantasy books ect.). It features a soundtrack and memorable characters that you will NEVER forget. You'll find yourself hearing things in real life, that almost makes you burst out a quote from this old gem, that no one will get. The biggest problem with Baldur's Gate, is that it's ancient by now... Which is where the enhanced edition comes in! Upgrading the game to HD and even upgrading the game engine and interface to the same standard as the sequel is exactly the kind of boost the game needed to become playable, even to people who didn't grow up with it. Enhanced edition also features some new content. While I appreciated this, I'll be honest and say that I didn't quite feel that this new content entirely fit with the mood of the original game. It was a bit too... Humorous and... Cute. I mean, considering the rather dark underlining theme of the game and the story, it just didn't feel quite right, but this is to be expected as the update was done by a third party. Baldur's Gate, to me, is the predecessor to all modern RPG's.			"

												Me and a few friends picked up this game on sale because we wanted to play through the game on co-op. It's a lot of fun, but borderline unplayable due to the constant glitches and how often the game crashed, especially during cutscenes. It's been about a year and a half, and so far none of the patches have fixed it. No amount of uninstalling or reinstalling has fixed it. The single player is still great, but if you pick this game up to play with friends, beware.			"

												Baldur's Gate 2 is one of the greatest games of all time, surpassing the original in many ways. It was Bioware's Magnum Opus, their ""Dark Side of the Moon"", if you will. The Enhanced Edition is the same game, but there are some improvements that I feel make it a better experience. The improvements in BG2:EE are actually more helpful in BG2:EE than they were in BG:EE. BG2 severely lacked Evil aligned party members, most notably a thief. This has been rectified in the Enhanced edition, and you can now play a fully Evil aligned party. Dorn, Neera, and Rasaad return from BG:EE, each with their own extensive questlines, as well as a new companion, Hexxat the neutral evil Thief. The companion questlines span the length of the game, with additional quests every few chapters, concluding in Throne of Bhaal. Of course, these companions are totally optional, but I do feel they are a very welcome improvement if you happen to play an Evil party. Of course, the other Enhanced edition improvements are also here, like the name, object, and contaniner highlighting when pressing tab, as well as the adjustable zoom. They are very helpful, and make the experience much more enjoyable for a modern audience. Another cool thing is that a few new items will be  imported into Irenicus's dungeon if you happened import from the original BG:EE. They are nothing special, and they are mostly just items that you would find semi-early in the game anyway, but it's a helpful addition. On the subject of bugs, this game is significantly better than it was on release, but I did notice a few bugs along the way. Granted they were bugs present in the original game, but they were there. They were easily rectified by use of the developer console, and were very rare throughout my 220 hour playthrough, but just be aware you may or may not have to deal with that. Over all, I think BG2:EE is a fantastic game, just like the original. If you love Baldur's gate 2 and are itching for another playthrough, it is definitely worth it. If you haven't played Baldur's Gate 2, it is even more worth it, as this is the definitive version of one of the finest games ever crafted. Even at full price, you will get your moneys worth, as this game is around 200+ hours long. If you are going to play BG2:EE I highly recommend you try out BG:EE first, as you will be more familiar with the new companions, as well as be able to import your character. Check out my highly rated review of that if you are on the fence. http://steamcommunity.com/id/infernal_machine/recommended/228280/ "

At times, it will even make you question the morality of turnip farming.Overall though, it is such an amazing RPG experience that the flaws will seem insignificant. I could ramble on about the battle mechanics or the learning curve, but those comments speak to people who've already played BG or BG2. The best advice I can give anyone considering buying this game is that it will eat your life, so beware.			"

												BG 2:EE is a pretty neat game with the mechanics from D&D's 3rd edition (I believe).   I've played it for about 6 hours or so and am still on chapter one, so it seems like there's a large storyline here.  It can be up to 6 player, though multiplayer is fairly unstable - it works maybe 80% of the time, and dc's and crashes are fairly common (one every 1-2 hours or so).  I just ended a two hour session when my client crashed and the two people I was playing with could never succesfully connect to the game (after at least 5 different attempts).			"

												As the sequel to BG1, BG2 picks up on new adventures with old and new characters alike. Quests will take you through the huge world of DnD as you uncover more of the story left off from BG1.My personal favorite feature is the ability to import a character from BG1 to use right from BG2. This is not required, but it adds more sentiment to your character in my opinion, as well as adds some flow to the game and story.The graphics and gameplay are roughly the same, but the gameplay is expanded on a bit more simply due to the fact that all characters are higher level and; therefore, have better rewards for completing tasks.BG2 is so well done that it feels like all of the Baldur's Gate games are one big adventure waiting to be played and finished in any way you choose. Would definitely recommend.			"

												In my own humble opinion Baldur's Gate II, with or without the expansion Throne of Bhaal, is the best video role-playing game ever made. It features an epic story, great music, memorable characters, a very long playing time and lots of important choices for the player to make.In short, I can recommend this game to everyone. However, first there is a small learning curve to master, because this game features an extensive ruleset from a real role-playing game (D&D) and powerful enemies.			"

You get 3 cookie cutter responses for most of the dialogue. The voice acting is terrible (Neera was voiced well though), the writing is weak and the whole thing feels incredibly out of place.Buy the game anyway. It's a legendary title that deserves many replays.			"

New players might not mind them, but older players, like me, will get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the ♥♥♥♥ off when they run up to you in the middle of town and force their quest and presence on you.It's also really jarring that the new companion's portraits are way better than the vanilla guys.

												One of the best RPGs I have had the privilege to play.Memorable music, rich dialogue, and complex relationships; Baldur's gate II: Enhanced Edition will leave you wanting more after each play session.I had played this game since the early 2000s, and if it's one thing I find incredibly fascinating; it's that every time I play the game, I discover many new things. There are (many) areas in this game, and many NPCs who react to you based on a wide array of variables. This is a game for those who crave a game that is not predictable.There are many classes to choose from, as well as sub-classes within the primary base classes. For example, you may choose to become a mage, but from there you may choose a specialist sub-class (E.G, Illusionists, Necromancers, and so on.)There are countless quests, and many of them are not even directly related to the overall storyline, but are a glimpse into the rich brand that is ""The Forgotten Realms.""I HIGHLY recommend this to any RPG enthusiasts out there, and I would also like to say that the graphics look wonderful in this edition. The text is very clear and HD-friendly. The 2D isometric graphics maintain their beauty and look very pleasing to the eye. For all of those people who choose to make the purchase - enjoy! "

If you're on a tight budget then just mod the original games, but pick this up if you can. The team of designers behind this had a lot of fixes to implement, and overall I'd say they did a great job. This version of BG2 feels nicely polished and is a good way to experience the old school greatness of its time on a modern computer system.

												I could easily write pages upon pages extolling the virtues of this game, but this is 2015 and we should be realistic, so I will simply and concisely explain why this is the greatest game of all time....but not the most fun.1.) The Writing - Quite simply, above and beyond anything you find in most modern games.  A compelling story (IF YOU LIKE HIGH FANTASY), memorable characters, beautiful set-pieces, and the best flavor text in any game...well, maybe ever.  If you love fantasy epics, this one is a classic!2.) The D&D - Let's face it: this is a Dungeons and Dragons game.  For people playing it for that reason, it delivers!  A perfectly (well...mostly) executed take on 2nd/3rd editions, with the best parts of both (THAC0 forever!) mixed together in a way that translates well.  To get the true D&D experience, show the dice rolls in terminal and and pause after every round.3.) The Graphic Design - Yes, by today's standards, this looks like an indy game.  But what a game!  Beautiful static backgrounds...I mean, hang them on your wall gorgeous.  Excellent effects that made the spells and effects really pop off the screen.  Detailed, well animated sprites that gave the characters a sense of life that other, similar games still struggle to achieve.  The monsters were so varied and detailed, it's a wonder the game didn't win more awards than it did.There are some downsides.  It's a big game, takes hundreds of hours to do everything.  The gameplay can be frustratingly hard for the uninitiated (PROTIP: drink all the potions!!!!), and the lack of quest markers and waypoints and glowing exclamation points means the casual gamer will be lost without a walk-through guide.But if you're like me - and if you are reading this, you probably are - and you want an old-school, authentic experience, BG2 is IT!  It's a masterpiece that I will continue to play into my waning years.  GOAT			"

												I lost myself in Faerûn... again.Okay, let me be honest. This classic is still one of the best RPGs out there and even though the Enhanced Edition doesn't do as much as BG 1: EE does, it's still adding widescreen to BG 2 - which is great.You still have this game with like the best RPG villian ever, a gameplay that makes you lose yourself in it and music to back it all up, the voiceovers are extremly well done and playing a whole party of heroes has never been so much fun. I may be overreacting but this game deserves it.90/10, would spend 500+ hours on this.			"

												Some bugs, if youve never played the original and dont know when a bug is in effect take a look at the communities updated active bug list before starting (im talking about you watchers keep map bug); there are sokme pretty easy work arounds/fixes using console. other than that, so far the additional charaacters dont seem to be as deep as the originals of the game. Would still highly recommmend. Great game,			"

												Well, what to say about this one? On many RPG-game community-sites, Baldur's Gate still ranks in Top 10 (just like the first part, Planescape: Torment and some other RPG games of Black Isles) although it is quite old and there is a reason for it.Baldur's Gate II is a party based isometric strategical aD&D RPG game with a deep storyline, moral choices, real interaction between your NSCs, lore to almost no end... Almost anything a real good RPG needs.ICompared to the first part of the series, there are some differences. The story is more linear. You have less open-world exploration but are driven either to your next main quest or to one of many subquests. This reduces the risk of newcomers getting lost in endless exploration without knowing what they have to do next, but I realy liked the true open-worldness of the first part, so this is a little downside in my opinion.Everything else is still the same old-school RPG-style like the first part. So it is realy some kind of must-have for hardcore RPG gamers. Oh, and you can import your character from the first part which is a big pro for this game. There are only very few series which allow really carrying over your char.This edition is shipped with the ""Throne of Bhaal""-AddOn which was not the best Add-On Black Isles ever made. The story and the enemys truely seem overloaded and a lot exxagerated most of the time and so are the items and the  ""epic"" skills your characters will achieve to beat the game (which is not very hard, even on increased difficulty levels). Buit still it concludes the ""Bhaalspawn""-storyline of the series.The Enhanced Edition comes with another campaign ""The Black Pits II"" continuing the arena-fighting campaign from the enhanced edition of the first part with even more arena fighting, but also with a deeper story and more tactical options and more roleplaying between the fights.It also has enhanced graphics compared to the original game and some new NSCs with their own subquests and interactions. Some of them you might know from the Enhanced Edition of the first part.The enhanced edition also has some new character classes, skills and spells, but those are only bonusses. If you already own the original game, have some great mods installed and don't like arena-fighting, this enhanced edition might not be worth buying, but for all the others it is clearly a recommendation.

												Can never rate BG2 bad. That being said there's important functionality missing in the game, most notably an interface to editing Baldur.ini. The default baldur.ini uses only 32000 path nodes, it was obvious to me in gameplay because some party members would take the longest path across a map. You can edit it by hand which does help.			"

												Amazing rpg that stands the test of time.well written story and well written NPCs(mostly) they you will love(mostly)Shadows of Amn story was my favorite.2nd ed D&D terminology may be a bit confusing to someone newer though.THAC0 (to hit armor class zero) - chance to hit with attacks basically, lower = better-Effects with ""+x to THAC0"" will actually lower this value, which is goodAC - Armor class - how well armored you are, lower = better-Effects with ""+x to Armor Class"" actually lower this value, which is good Saving Throws - die roll you would need to save against a specific effect. lower =  better-Effects with ""+x to saving throws"" actually lower this value, which is goodOnly piece of advice I'd give is this:Spellcasters will ruin your day with crowd control through confusion/fear/stun if you cant deal with them quickly.5th lvl Wizard spell ""Oracle"" = best way to dispel their invisibility.5th lvl Wizard spell ""Breach"" = best way to dispel their protection spells to kill them fast.and dont be afraid to use the quicksave feature. this game is very unforgiving in some ways, especially your first playthrough.

												So after ending first time BG 2 EE it's time to share with other's what I'm felling about it. I've spent about 500 h (at least) playing original BG Saga and BG 2 EE it is good old Baldur enchanced to today requirements (improved graphics and add use without problem of new windows systems). I would not tell anything about story to avoid spoilers and only admit that is one of best, if not best, in all games ever. Graphics is ok (only when zoom very close you can see pixels), music is perfect and game is hard (not like todays games which are just easy), there are many ways to resolve quests too. For me there are  only two disadvantage. They're only english version of game (original BG 2 have best polish version ever) and uncompability with most of mods. So I can refer with pure hart to buy this game but maybe it will good to wait when more mods would me converted to works with EE as they add much content to game (you can as well buy original game and install mods which enchanced graphics etc etc ).

												This is simply one of the greatest RPGs of all time. the characters are absolutely fantastic in every way, from comical to depressing. The storylines run the gauntlet from short and surprising to sweeping epics of betrayal. The world is so much deeper and richer than almost anything else that has been released since. You will find yourself sent on small errand quests that uncover plot twist after plot twist and now you're fighting a subterranean old god under the sewers. You will be infiltrating thieves guilds and trudging through the underdark. It is also one of the least linear gaming experiences you will ever have. At times you're only given long term goals like ""you need to pay X amount to gain the help of Y group, here you are in this city, go find a way to make tons of money""Yes, the rule set can be a little daunting in the beginning as it is based on old 2nd edition d&d, which is widely known to be highly unintuitive and even, at times, contradictory. Fortunately it really only takes a few minutes to learn the basics in the form of, lower armor class is harder to hit, higher saving throws helps you avoid things, do more damage to kill things faster. Honestly just give it a chance, explore a little bit and you're almost guaranteed to be hooked. "

												You will never find another rpg game like the Baldur's Gate Series. The amount of depth and story put into each character is beyond that of the ""Dragonborn"" from Skyrim, or the protagonist from Fable series or even those in the Dragon Age series. The perks of completing each quest are well worth it, anything from gaining better loot to sell, high end equipable items to owning keeps/strongholds. To those like me, who are fairly new to rpgs, I would highly recommend this game as I have enjoyed every minute of it. I have been getting my♥♥♥♥♥♥handed to me lately, and I applaud the fact you have more than enough allies to find and recruit to go with you into your party, so if I find a particular dungeon or whatever to be too challenging, I revert back and rethink my strategy.

												Baldur's Gate II, i remember how much time i played this game 6-7 years ago on my old PC, and with the Enhanced Edition, what can i say? It still holds up.Ths is probably one of the rare RPGs that can still, after all this time, evoke in me a sense of wonder and just makes me want to play it. Now, i won't review the game proper, but just the Enhanced Edition, the game is simply a masterpiece and i think at this point most of the CRPG players at least heard about it. Let's start with the first bônus. The game comes with the expansion, Throne of Bhaal, an amazing expansion that is the size of some games released today. Besides it, the entire system of Shadows of Amn is overhauled to ToB standards, and that is another good point for the Enhanced Edition. And, there's no ""mumb jumbo"" to make it work in nowadays systems, it's just install and play, simply as that, so, if you wanna enjoy this game without any problem with your OS or the hardware, this is the version to buy.About the enhancements in the game, there are the extra characters, everyone of them with content both for SoA and ToB, and...It's actually better content this time around, than the one presented in the original Enhanced Edition, so you're gonna have some fun. And better, they are romanceable, and that alone makes the replay value of the game to get even better. Of the new characters quests there is just one part that doesn't feel right depending on your protagonist...But the game is receiving feedback and it may get better.On sound an video there's not much to tell, it's the same game, but with some improvements in those areas, nothing major, so it feels like the old beast, and that is good, the BG II graphics were beatiful then and they hold up 'till now.Anyway, i recommend this game, even just for practical purposes, and is a damn fine RPG, one, if not the best.

												This is a good game because it has good and bad things but the good ones outweight the bad ones.So sayeth the wise Alaundo.Also, I think that wether you like this game or not is going to depend very very much on when you were born. This is a very personal tought but if you are from 1990 onwards its a bit unlikely you will like it or enjoy it as someone from the 70s or 80s for the simple reason that this was a game folks from the 80s grew up with while the 90s generation were still a bit too youngOn the other hand if you have a great dislike for what Bioware has turned into with the years, enjoy old rpg games in isometrical perspective or a have very specific taste towards classic games no matter of your age then yea, this is a purchase that will please the wise Alaundo.In fact if you are into this kind of games, save some cash and get Baldurs gate 1-2, Icewind Dale 1-2, and Planescape: Torment and maybe take a vacation month (barely enough time).

												I love Baldur's Gate II; I've been playing it for years, and I adore Infinity Engine games in general. However, I cannot give Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition an unconditional recommendation. For $25, this game comes with very little in the way of improvements or enhancements. I understand copyright issues have prevented Beamdog from making substantial changes to the game, so you'll find no HD graphics, no achievements, no major bugfixes, no sweeping changes to the game and little new content.What you do get is a faithful and functioning game with four well-designed new NPCs, a number of interesting new kits (Shadowdancer is especially powerful) and a robust multiplayer system. If this is enough for you, and you enjoy old-school 2nd Edition D&D games, I can recommend this game if it's ever on sale. Just don't expect an overhaul, improved graphics or anything similar.			"

												I've loved this game ever since it released back in my youngling days.That being said this is quite a bit different, everything is still there but Beamdog has tried a little to hard to streamline the game.  The point of the game is that it's challenging and all your characters requires attention at every turn.The new AI system they put on your characters is on by default which is just silly.  I have played so much so it wasn't a problem for me to turn it off but for people who don't understand how to get to the ""Scripts"" it's a problem and needs to be disabled by default.Definite amazing rendition of the original game, solid 8/10 where I give the original the full 10/10.

												I was told that the Enhanced Edition screwed over the original game, so I expected it to break immediately as I opened it.  I was glad to be disappointed.  Sure there were a few glitches and crashes, but the game worked fine otherwise.  The new graphics introduced in update 2.0 are God-awful, but most can be switched off in the graphics menu.  Most things look the same with the glaring exception of the new character menu, but that's still easy enough to navigate.  Admittedly, I never tried any of the new content, save the Black Pits (which was surprisingly good).  I just couldn't separate myself from my grand party of Keldorn, Aerie, Jaheira, Minsc and Imoen/Yoshimo long enough to try Neera or Rasaad or Hexxat or Dorn.  I don't really feel inclined to try them either, which I think is a flaw of the Enhanced Edition.  The achievements don't even give incentive to try the new characters, so I never worried about it aside from a brief stint with Hexxat.  She didn't seem very important or fun to me, so I dumped her for another after an hour or so of playtime.  Beamdog touted its new content as new and exciting, but it just wasn't important enough in the world for me to try.  I might do it one of these days. Or not.Oh, and this is a review for the Enhanced Edition changes only.  If you haven't played the original, 10/10 would recommend.			"

												If you even slightly liked the first one, or any aspect of it, this one is superior in every way. The party members all have deep and sincere developmental quest lines, the enemies are exciting and dangerous, the cities are thorougly packed with people and places to explore and interact with, and the dungeons are savage!

												This is not one of the most highly rated PC games of all time for no reason.  Whether or not you are a fan of D&D (I am) this is one of the most satisfyingly deep, both tactically and in terms of lore, RPGs I have ever had the pleasure of playing.  I bought this on release in 2000 and despite the obvious fact that the engine has aged, I genuinely think that this game has stood the test of time.  It will not disappoint you, whether you are returning for nostalgia puposes, keen to see how D&D has been implemented in a computer game, or a new player wondering what the hype was all about.  The memorable characters and villains (Minsc, Jon Irenicus anyone in the know!) will stay with you for many years.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I have (all 120 hours of it, this game is huge) and if you're new to CRPGS, I'm jealous, because you've got many new worlds to visit and colourful characters to meet and this one is rightly held up in high regard as one of the best!The 'Test of Time' Award Nominee 2016!

												D&D's Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced edition is, by far, the best and greatest installment of the D&D gaming merchandise to date.Hands down.I grew up with this game, and then I searched far and wide just to get a single disk copy. After aquiring it, it became the only game I played for around two years, and it became my gateway into the RPG section of gaming. This is, to me at least, the biggest name in adventure games, and if you've played any of the recent titles (I don't think I have to mention them) and have some small amount of patience for number reading, and storylines, then this game is perfect for you.I recommend this game to everyone.

												This is, by far, my favorite game ever crafted. The story, the characters, the artistic and colorful graphics, down to the ambience and music, are a treat to experience. I still have my boxed version from when I first bought the game. Since then, I have played it countless times, and bought it 3 more times, from Amazon, GoG and finally on here. The game is challenging, and forces you to use tactics, and take advantage of the skills the different party members have to offer. It also forces you to think, and choose dialogue wisely. If you enjoy RPG's in general, I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												I wish we had more games likes this one, these days.Really well-made characters, quests (and side-quets ! They are actually GOOD in this game) and the best RPG combat system ever created.The world itself is one of the best ever made. It's not like we are playing a game, It's like we are living in a world, with It's complex culture, geography, cities, organizations, monsters, Dungeons and Dragons!Too bad the AD&D rules are outdated. A remake with D&D 3.5 rules would make thiis game a world worth living in =)			"

												Just bought my second copy of BG:EE and BG:EE II on Steam, should have done it in the firsplace instead of buying them from Beamdog. Anyway, all I can say is that this game is amazing, and it weren't for being aged it would still compete with The Witcher 2 and Skyrim, the lore and vastness of the Forgotten Realms is larger than the Extended Universe in Star Wars. The games story follows a plot of an upcoming cataclysm as well as discovering your own heritage, through the gameplay you'll find loads of diversity to play the game your way. The dungeons are amazingly designed and NPCs have so much to say and loads of character, yes the majority of it may be text, but I certainly prefer it to Elder Scrolls NPCs that simply have a couple of dialogue options and the same voice actor as everyone else. If you're an RPG fan new or old, these two games are a must have.			"

												BG2 enhanced has some potentially game breaking bugs that can be annoying. Fortunately, they all have relatively easy work arounds  if you're willing to tinker with EE Keeper a little. That said, those bugs were fixed a long time ago by the community. If you buy through GOG, you can play BG-Tutu with the fixpack and associated content and not have to deal with it at all. The downside is you have to patch it all manually yourself, which can be a bit of a drag for some but should be perfectly doable for most. It is, however, nice to have Baldur's Gate on steam and working on a modern machine without any fuss. I expect this version will be patched and the bugs I mentioned will hopefully be fixed. It's Baldur's Gate on Steam, which is great. The Enhanced editions bring new content and characters which are themselves quite nice. All in all, I won't fail to recommend it. An all-time classic is an all-time classic.			"

												Enhanced version of a classic game. Yes, if you have your old game CDs or buy the updated GOG version you can MOD the heck out of this game.  But for people new to the game or who just want a well working version with a few enhancements this version is good to go, (with no extra DLs or patches required).  I am just getting used to the new NPCs and they seem like nice if not spectacular additions.  For me a fan who played several 100 hours of the original version, this is a great way to get back into the game without needing to master a puzzle of patches and Mods it takes to make the original playable beyond the vanilla version I have played many times already.  I reccomend the EE/Steam version for any BG-fan, Infinity game engine fan, DnD-fan, Party-based RPG-fan, or anyone who likes old school RPGs with all their quirks and complexities. Well worth the price, it's BG2 without hassles. - Nuff said for a 8.5 / 10.			"

												Bladur's Gate II is an old paused based RPG based on 2nd edition Dungeons and Dragons.  The game does very little handholding and very little explaining what the rules mean, which are two of the major complaints I've heard about this game.  I personally love the lack of hand holding, but.. to each their own.The game really and truly feels.. alive.  It does this by having interesting and enjoyable characters, locations, and quests.  Sometimes things don't make sense.  Sometimes people say a little something that helps you along, but that little something is not recorded anywhere.  Sometimes things happen for seemingly no reason.  The end result?  The game feels like it's real.  People have their own wishes and desires, and you need to balance each party members' goals with your own.  Combat is fun, and very challenging.  You can make a choice that impacts you in ways you won't even realize until you play through again, which is one of the more amazing things about this game.  Modern games give you 'choices', where you 'choose' good or bad.  Baldur's Gate II blurs the line.  There are multiple paths to nearly everything, and very few (if any) of them are marked as ""good"", or ""bad"".  Say the right thing or have the right person with you and you might avoid combat.  Do the wrong thing and you'll get attacked without ever realizing there was another possibility.			"

												I've probably bought this game five or six times since it came out back in 2000, including having bought this Enhanced Edition twice including once via Beamdog and more recently here on Steam. In total, I'm sure I've logged over a thousand hours over the years thanks in part to the modding communities and my fondness for the Dungeons and Dragons and the Forgotten Realms. There's a LOT of replayability in the game even without mods, however. And the characters from the base game are by far my most loved characters from any game series. Some of the writing in the new content added by the EE is rather questionable, but regardless I do love the new characters. I've been playing this game on and off for over half of my life, so without question this is my choice for test of time. I wish I could have also nominated it for villian in need of a hug, but test of time fits so much better.			"

I personally love the lack of hand holding, but.. to each their own.The game really and truly feels.. alive.  It does this by having interesting and enjoyable characters, locations, and quests.  Sometimes things don't make sense.  Sometimes people say a little something that helps you along, but that little something is not recorded anywhere.  Sometimes things happen for seemingly no reason.  The end result?  The game feels like it's real.  People have their own wishes and desires, and you need to balance each party members' goals with your own.  Combat is fun, and very challenging.  You can make a choice that impacts you in ways you won't even realize until you play through again, which is one of the more amazing things about this game.  Modern games give you 'choices', where you 'choose' good or bad.  Baldur's Gate II blurs the line.  There are multiple paths to nearly everything, and very few (if any) of them are marked as ""good"", or ""bad"".  Say the right thing or have the right person with you and you might avoid combat.  Do the wrong thing and you'll get attacked without ever realizing there was another possibility.			"

												Works great and is only a pre-packaged version of all the mods. I've bought this game probably three times in the past 15 years to accomodate new systems and formats.. It's that good. I also Have a high dpi screen and had a few problems with the screen scaling too large and only seeing a small portion of the screen rendering it unplayable. I followed the forums suggestion to right click on 'baldur.exe' and alter the compatibility mode to run on high DPI. It's now perfect.			"

												Every few years I come back to this game, whether it be the enhanced edition or the vanilla game itself, due to how amazing this game is in almost every way. The story and writing has yet to be matched by any other game I have come across and the gameplay itself requires strategic thinking that most other games have just used spam tactics to compensate for the lack of strategy. The artwork for all the maps are very hard to get tired of seeing, each having been meticulously made with great detail, the only downfall to the graphics in this game is the character models being somewhat repetative but considering this is an isometric game, you arent meant to look too closely at them anyway. The soundtrack is very memorable and I still catch myself  humming some of the tunes found throughout the game. I probably will keep coming back to BG2 for the rest of my life, not just because of nostalgia either. After all the years I have spent playing this game I am still yet to see every single bit of content that it has to offer and I think that really says more than any review I could possibly write up.

												My nomination for the 'Test of TIme' award as years later I find myself coming back to this beaut and still love the characters and the world you play in.Thanks to a little tweeking by the guys at beamdog, this game still holds up pretty well, dispite it's 2D world limitations. Where as games like skyrim imerse you with a 3D world you can explore. Here you are pulled in by not only the rich story telling centred on the main character, but the quests and dialog of your supporting party members. I remember the first time 2 party members started talking to each other, and I thought, 'hey, where's my bit?' but then realised that these characters had their own thought/agenders, that didn't make my character the centre of the universe.Game play is pretty solid with a respectable learning curve. New game modes allow you to change the difficulty to however easy or difficult you want. Magic can take some getting use to, so it's important to read what spells do and track combat text through the feedback window. However with the game being out so long you can find any number of useful guides online to help explain spells and debuffs etc.The soundtrack include one of my favorite games themes to date, which is good if like me you want to spend your first hour roling the perfect human paladin.Overall this game is perfect for anyone who wants to see where Bioware got their reputation from, long before they made 'Mass Effect' of 'Dragon Age'			"

												Kept putting off on reviewing this classic game (albeit enhanced). This is one of the very few games that I keep coming back to and play over many years. Must have started playing the original back in 2000 when it first released. I must have gotten three or four copies of this game over the years (until finally getting enhanced Steam version) since I kept losing cds (yes, I am that old). This is worthwhile game to nominate for ""Test of Time"" award. Also, this is best game in my opinion that has ever been created in terms of storyline, character developments and much more, which is my reason why I always return to this game. Hard to find a game like this nowadays. Now, back to my 100th (or whatever, I lost track) playthrough. ;)			"

The enhanced edition adds a little more to the original but is still quite the same game, I do hope they follow through with BG3 as they state on the website.			"

												What! #2 Holy Smokes! This game...Well if you enjoy a deeply rich story with voice acting and enjoyed the first one, buckle up. This game is by far the most enjoyable fantasy game I've ever played. Don't play it one easy or normal, crank it up! You'll realize that its not easy and takes some time learning the deeper mechanics within the game. First time playing? Make a fighter and cleave your way through the story. A game which has SEVERAL play thrus with different alignment types. Wana be good? Sure, Wana be Evil? Sure play as various classes with an uncanny story to make them. Sure the ""core"" story is the same but the way it goes down is hilariously different. This game not only captivated the fantasy players of its time, it revolutionized the fantasy gaming industry and with its frame work being 2nd Editing Dungeon and Dragons (best system currently) its holds a world of awesome. Black Isle crafted a masterpiece with this game and brought something to everyone in all aspects. If you're a true RPG and fantasy gamer you'll pick this up and enjoy a little retro throw back....then realize its better than most modern RPG's, Just listen to the sound environment for a game made in 00'.

The new characters, classes and UI/UX improvements have been fantastic. In addition, the Beamdog folks have even ensured the host of player-created content and mods more-or-less continue to work.

												The Shadows of Amn portion of this game is pretty good, giving you plenty of quests to pursue from inside the main city and the areas you subsequently travel to. I spent over 40 hours in this section (and there were plenty of quests I hadn't pursued) and party members got to around level 20. This feels like the sweet spot in D&D rules for character power; you've hit the peak of your thac0 and saving throws, have access to your highest level spells, and get your first  taste of the high level abilities at 3 million XP. The main villain in this part of the game is the best one in the entire series, with good voice acting to boot.In contrast, the final Throne of Bhaal portion is a very linear march through the final bosses, adding 15 hours of gameplay. At these few extra levels, your progression is mainly adding high level abilities and upgrading gear. Bosses get tougher since they start using HLA's on you, and casters are deadly if you don't keep pressure on them. The final fight has satisfying difficulty, but the story is far less engaging than Shadows of Amn.			"

												This is the best RPG of all time in my opinion. It has a fantastic rich story with great characters, strategic gameplay based on oldschool AD&D without the need to specifically understand AD&D rules to get into. This game can be played on easier difficulties if you just want to enjoy the story, or harder difficulties for a strategic challenge without becoming tedious as many RPG's tend to when played on harder difficulties.If you're not sure if you'd like this game or not, I'd recommend starting with the second game, as it's much more initially attention grabbing and introduces you to the more fun aspects of the gameplay while having a better story, and you won't miss out too much story wise since the two stories aren't directly connected. However I do recommend playing the first one at some point as it's still a fantastic game.For those old fans of BG:II, the Enhanced Edition is finally worth the pricetag, many of the glitches with the EE on release have been worked out and the online is functional again, with some new decent content that doesn't interfere with the base game.

												BG2EE is a fine re-release of one of the greatest games of all time. BG2 stands at the top of the ranking at the classic RPG site GameBanshee - and deservedly so. Beamdog's Enhanced Edition brings the game to modern HD displays, and Steam - so that you never have to look for your CDs again.There are many things that make BG2 great, and in their sum, they can be described as a spirit of complete and total confidence. It takes self-assurance to drop the player straight into the big hub of the game, bury him in quests, and let him figure things out. It takes conviction to fill a game to the brim with utterly broken enemies, spells, and abilities, and yet achieve a sort of a balance. It takes grand vision to hand-draw the phenomenal backgrounds of BG2, and compose a soundtrack fitting for a 3 hour epic Holywood production. It takes genius to emphasize the hero's companions to such an unprecedented degree.And the results are magnificent. In BG2, you can one-shot majestic dragons, and be one-shot by nasty mind-flayers. You can yield insanely broken weapons such as Crom Fayr, and still enjoy finding a decent offhand in the Underdark. You can build your entire strategy around brutal backstabs, or never hide in shadows the entire game. You can power-game and try to beat the game with a solo Paladin, or pick an off-kilter class such as the Bard Skald, accept the roll the game gives you, and dive into adventure with your trusty comrade Minsc. You can exploit every mechanic to become a true demigod, or play it hardcore and delete your character if he dies.And though the purely combat-oriented RPG in BG2 is good, it is the characters that really make the game (as is the case with other memorable titles such as Planescape Torment and Mass Effect 2). Video games seem to be a poor medium when it comes to conveying strong stories and plots; but they are perfect vehicles for character development. And fundamentally, as has been the canon in the West ever since the times of Plato and beyond, character development translates to a character's confrontation of his or her weaknesses, a journey through the darker corners of the soul, a quest for self-understanding.It is in this aspect of its monumental edifice that BG2 succeeds, while perhaps not totally, at least to such a degree as to leave a lasting impression. Who can forget the trials of dark Viconia, her anguish at facing the cruelty of her kin imprinted upon her own soul, her doubts, her fears, and her eventual ascent to tranquility? Who can forget Minsc who finds himself a new witch in the little waif Aerie? What of Anomen, who visibly grows from a boy to a man before the player's eyes, and with the player's help? Is it not fitting that Sarevok, now humbled and desperate, should ultimately join his brother? Who can forget the player's sibling, the fiery little tortured Imoen? And what of the protagonist's foes? The nasty little sister Bodhi, and the mighty - yet so tragic - Jon Irenicus? Surely the voicework on Irenicus is among the best ever done in a computer game.Finally, there is the protagonist himself - forced to face his fears, his demons, his destiny, and his nature. Will he choose to become a God and wreak havoc upon mortals and divines alike? Will he ascend his throne and try to change the essense of his heritage? Or will he willingly forsake immortality, and tread the roads of Faerun along with his trusty friends? It is up to you...And though one can distinctly see Bioware run out of steam by the time of Throne of Bhaal, the final episode of the saga still manages to include some of the finest fights of the entire series; and loot galore beyond imagination.Before concluding this review, let me say a few words about Beamdog's new content. I did Rasaad's missions, and though he had been a pathetic weakling for most of BG1EE and some of BG2EE, after about the midgame, Rasaad became a monster. Toward the end he was as powerful as my main (a Blade) and Minsc. His quests, unfortunately, were horribly broken and buggy throughout the entire saga. When the quests worked, they were great. But most of the time they did not work. The final fight in Rasaad's sequence, in particular, is heroically buggy, and took me an hour of replays to win - because I had to figure out how to activate the correct triggers in the right order.But, by and large, the new NPC's are solid, and fit the game reasonably well. They are nothing to shout about, but they work.BG1EE took me 30 hours for a fairly complete playthrough; and BG2EE another 60. If you have never played the game, you should. And if you have, like me, last played it maybe a decade ago - well, with this rerelase, maybe it's time you refreshed your memories. Good movies and good books never get old. And neither will BG2.11/10 - more than a great game - one of the classics.			"

												Before Dragon Age, before Neverwinter Nights, there was Baldur's Gate. This is one of my favorite games. Originally released in 1998. What I like most about the Enhanced Edition is that it doesn't crash. I simply could not get the original version to run properly on any post-Windows 2000 machine. Now, I can finally play it again!I made a Half Elf Cleric/Ranger. I named him McClerangicer! With my righteous, valiant party at my side, I have slain dragons, beholders, vampires, mind flayers, trolls, and other foul beasts. Over 30 hours in and still so much left to do. Irenicus must pay!

												If you were a fan of the original BG2, or BG:EE, I would recommend buying this game. While the interface hasn't changed much, the addition of a few new characters and storylines, as well as the ability to play this game on any modern PC, really makes it worth the value, IMO. Of course, this is my 3rd purchase of BG2, but being unable to play my old copies on my current setup made it worthwhile.			"

												RATING: 9/10Why can't you click the yes and no buttons when reviewing a game?  I wish I could on this one.  Here's your caveat emptor people:If you actually care about the new NPC's and Black Pit whatever they added in, OR if you have never played the original version, GET THIS GAME...... just maybe NOT THIS VERSION.  It is an amazing game, Baldur's gate series probably being the crown jewel of the D&D computer games.  However, with Beamdog, it is hit or miss whether the game will work with your computer specs at all.  Best to check with other people that have similar spec's or with beamdog before potentially losing 25$.  To prove my point, beamdog still hasn't even fixed the problems with Intel chipsets on the original BGEE, so I wasn't even able to play it at all until I got a new computer.  No refunds were given to all the people they f*cked in the♥♥♥♥♥♥on that one.Honestly, there are only two justifiable reasons for purchasing this one, over the more affordable Original: 1, in rolling the dice for your char. stats, it gives a total at the bottom... which if you're a serious OCD player, will save you countless mins/hrs of calculating your points to assure good stats (you can add up the right column of #'s, e.g. 1(5), of all the stats and want the total around 30.  Such takes a lot more time than just looking at one # and making sure you rolled a total of around 90).No. 2-the better screen resolution, and no3 you just want to increase the number of games on your steam list.Often, hardcore players will create their own party of 6  unique characters and not use any NPC's at all, so I wouldn't make a couple extra characters being added into the game the fulcrum of your choice on whether to buy or not.  The original game is good with any and all glitches it came with and you won't lose out on any experience by saving money.  The other new changes aren't so significant to weigh into the decision.  Gametstop has a bundle of six DnD games that often sells for around 9$ which contains the BG series.  For getting full-screen out of the tiny resolution options, just plug in a box monitor from your old PC into your laptop or whatever.Beamdog's work is just not that satisfying.  They released this game before the first travesty they put out was even fixed, and copped out of even fixing it.  Why isn't Bioware or someone useful updating these games?Judging the game itself, however; guarunteed to make its way to the top of any top10 RPGs list.			"

												This is an excellent game. Though there are some minor bugs, such as talking to certain NPC's at certain aspects which causes them to ignore forced dialog etc. But apart from that the game is outstanding! There are certain caveats though, as the second iteration of the Baldur's gate series, the level cap/minimum has increased substantially from the first game. The primary concern with this is, that you do not start at level 1, but with a premade character which you may fit to your own liking. Personally i find this game at its greatest and most nostalgic  when played with a prior created Bhaal spawn, which has been tailor made to your own liking. There is a great sentimental attachment in the characters you both play with, and associate with, as the dialog with this game is excellent as it can range from romantic interludes, to heated discussions on the most prudent means to eliminate the enemy. Apart from the seemingly hefty 25$ price tag, which certainly will leave the poorer of us at dismay, just wait till a discount/steam sale makes an appearance to sedate  your nostalgic or D&D cravings.

 10/10 The saga that keeps on giving. I gave BG:EE 10/10 and BGII:EE if anything exceeds that. The gameplay is more refined and driven, and the story as compelling as before. There are less explorable areas than before but each area does have a purpose. Again the hours required to ""complete"" the game are little short of a century, I stand at 87 hours for one playthrough. The game has improved choices and gameplay, as well as more player options and character customisation. Again the visuals show their age but that isn't why you play this game. It is particularly compelling to import a character from BG: EE and complete the game as  your  character. I would recomend this to fans of the original game and just fans of RPGs in general. NOTE:  The Throne of Bhaal expansion (included) I award  7/10  . Although fun it was rushed and unfinished off the back of a low budget. It provides a satisfying conclusion to the saga and some rivetting gameplay nonetheless but the storyline seems sloppy which is a real shame considering how compelling the other games are in this regard.

There is an abundance of characters with distinct personalities and motivations, and an excellent story. There are plenty of great side quests that will extend the experience, as well as helping out your party.

Also the simplification of multiplayer is a huge plus.			"

												A timeless classic that never ages. It makes modern RPGs look try-hard in comparison.Easy to learn yet deep and complex battle mechanics paired with in-depth character management make for a wonderful experience in the Forgotten Realms. Rich and detailed characters develop through the wonderfully crafted storyline that stands the test of time. It marries video games to D&D mechanics better than any game before and after it's release.Baldur's Gate (and the original) should be in every CRPG fans library.			"

												Picked this up during the Halloween sale for $5.  I have good memories of playing it 'back in the day' and figured it would be worth that much as I really enjoyed (for 140hrs+) the recently released Pillars of Eternity which shares the same isometric feel.  Unfortunately, encountering major bugs, like the Journal not working AT ALL, after a few hours of play, does not instill in me a great deal of confidence about bug-fixes and ongoing support.  I will give the game another 10 hours or so to see how it goes but not having the Journal for quest tracking and character story development is a pretty big strike against.  It is not wholly game-breaking to an established fan of the original, already prepared to experience old-time annoyances like inventory micro-management and dated/unfamiliar UI, but I'd be hesitant to recommend this 'enhanced edition' to a total newbie to the series in its present state.  Developer really should have set aside more resources for core testing instead of the well publicized activist 'updating' that had kept me from buying before the recent sale.  Not really enthused to see how that unfolds either, but heroes must persevere as they say...			"

Nope, didn't fix them, in fact, I'd probably say it's even worse than the original with show stopper bugs.

An old-style party-based RTS-configured RPG.Pros:Classic RPG with all the fun antics you rememberDecisions definitely matter to the point that you may get involved in a quest just by visiting an Inn.Combat System is the Best Your options and decisions in combat are no exception to the former.The Game seems to have been completely remastered from it's original form to fit the modern PC.All of your old classes/spells are there same as you remember plus a few new ones.Cons:Some of the items from the original game seem to be in different locations than the Enhanced Edition.Outside the new ""Addon"" Content there is really little difference in the ""Main"" storyline.With the enhanced edition there is no ""Off"" or ""Classic"" Switch for the game to restore to the original form.All in all i think the pros outweight the cons by a factor of atleast 10 possibly 20. Even though there is no ""Classic"" Button besides item locations changes seem limited to (minor) locations of loot and ""add-in"" content. If you liked it back then - you'll probably enjoy the enhanced edition, even thought it's much the same, nostaliga never gets old for AD&D.			"

												Take heed:I OWN the original game, the BG 1 EE and BG 2 EE the orignal ones, this is not them. This is yet another ""Enchanced Edition"" version, and they've ruined the game. Some additions that kill the game for me, the addition of HP bars over monsters is disgusting and it's not part of the original game. It ruins the feel of the game and makes it feel fake and less immsersive. The new character creation UI has been changed and the way you learn and memorize spells has changed, and it does not feel classic at all.AI including your own main character will attack on site, cast random spells etc, Something not intended by the orginal developers and was never in the EE edition I bought last year.This version is subpar. The ONLY reason and I mean only reason I am recommending this game is for the developers of the original game as I'm sure they get some royalties off these people.			"

												The vast amount of negative reviews are disheartening to say the least, I honestly don't think this game deserves it.There's been a lot of controversy about the UI and graphical changes in the 2.0 update that was released a few months before. Some of them are legitimate complaints and some boil down to ""They changed it, now it sucks"". The game is still perfectly enjoyable and storywise nothing has changed. (Aside from the new NPC's that were added when the Enhanced Edition was released, I'm talking specifically about 2.0!)If you are one of those that are wary of buying this because of these changes then you should know that it is still possible to play the original Enhanced Edition by subscribing to the ""1.3"" beta branch. What most people are failing to mention is that aside from these changes this is STILL one of the best CRPGs ever made. If you've never played a game in the Baldur's Gate series before you will not be disappointed by what this game has to offer.			"

												When I was 12 this game first came out. I loved D&D my mom got this for me for christmas. And I wasn't allowed to install things yet because my mom was cray. For a week I read the manual. A huge tome of information about every little detail. Stats, proficiences, races, classes. I soaked it all up. For a 12 year old this was advanced♥♥♥♥♥♥ since previously All i had played were, Warcraft 3, Age of Empires 1+2 and Streets of rage. So this was the dawning of a new era. mom installed the FOUR DISKS required to do it. 5 if you included ToB, 6 if you counted the special features disc. That's right mofos, extras. Like a whole shirt, a sick box. a free prima strategy guide. And a whole disc of art and story and music details. it was sweeeeeet. So i load that bad boy on my Windows 95 computer and get playing. i zip through the tutorial. on normal. But I get to the part where you had to identify the shield. And for some reason i could not figure it out. I was stuck on it for hours. Screaming and crying in frustration. that even with the wealth of knowledge about the game at my fingertips, I could not identify this damn shield. So I storm off and take a break. i come back to it and right click it. Then clicked identify. I felt so dumb. but. i finished that tutorial. Started a game as a fighter who went dual wield with Swords. Started the opening dungeon. Died to the first mephit room because I couldn't turn it of. Now at 26. i make a kensai mage and become a lightning tornado of chopping death and ambiguous morality. So i've come a long way.			"

												This game has spawned more Oisigs, Neeras, Edwins and Traveling Parties than I can count. Not even the smartest of minds can comprehend what kind of code must have been written to send High Watcher Oisig relentlessly at you, every time you enter a new screen. Maybe Minsc has written it. 10/10.On a more serious note, this game aged well. The combat surely is not up to todays standard and more than often I found myself letting the scripts do the work except for more challenging fights. The graphics are fine, the dialogue well written and mostly voiced.  The world is filled with life, characters and enemies. Countless loot is to be found, although there are certain weapons that can be found quite early which will be the strongest all throughout the game. For fans of RPGs, I would recommend this, but make sure to bring at least one friend with you and a lot of time.			"

												The greatest RPG of all time getting even better! I simply can't get enough of this drug of a game. And it's incredible how 15 years since I played it for the 1st time I find myself playing it and enjoying it just the same as I did in those days. This enhanced edition is truly beautiful and well polished, it runs like a dream, and everything is in place. The new companions are awesome, the refined gameplay works, and if you never played BG2 before then you should definitely grab this because otherwise you'll be missing out on a seriously epic RPG.Now lets also note a few things. This is a very old game that has been reworked in a minimal fashion to make it compatible with Steam. As of this current patch gen, the game features an improved interface, new difficulties added, and the correction of many bugs. This doesn't change the fact the game is old! If you are not into vintage games, this title may not be for you, as playing this game is like getting on a time machine back to the early 2000s, which was the golden era of RPGs. As you play the game you would find yourself dealing with infuriating things, like a totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI, or the awkward moving patterns of your characters. In fact, you'll scream in rage every time you find yourself being slaughtered because one of your companions failed to cast the spells he/she needed, or got stuck on a corner for no logical reason other than crappy AI. Assuming you can see passed its imperfections, you will find yourself in love with this vast, complex, rich, and unforgiving fantasy world, and the people you'll meet in it. What kind of RPGer are you? Role player or power gamer? Well, you'll be happy to discover the game puts both types of gameply on steroids, and gives you a unique experience with enormous amounts of re-playability .   Multiplayer was a big fail for me, but that's because I tried the Beamdog servers, so if you want to try the Multiplayer way, try the local IP type.			"

												Shadows of Amn is an absolute cult classic among RPGs, but despite its greatness one has to acknowledge its many flaws by the standards of today. For a strategy game, it is horribly unbalanced, as just the roll of one virtual dice (usually for one of the many overpowered magic spells/abilities) may completely eradicate your chances of winning a battle (because one or more of your party members die instantly), while on another attempt you might just get lucky and stomp every enemy in sight (because the spell is being resisted). In some situations, you simply have no chances of prevailing on your first attempt and you have to reload - knowing how to position your characters in advance, where not to go, or something like that. Inventory management is tedious (just so much stuff!), controlling your characters is prone to errors (casting spells is cancelled when the game is paused should you accidentally issue a move command, pathing errors), and some of the D&D rules employed in the game are just plain dumb.So why play Shadows of Amn?Because the game tells an amazing story, it has great characters and interesting locations, all of which alone warrant buying this gem from an age before fancy 3D graphics and well-thought out balancing. I have finished SoA at least 3 times in my life, and I’m quite confident I will do so a few times more before I die. And so should you. "

												You may have to delve into an ancient forgotten ruin to find another game just as good. Baldurs gate II: Enhanced Edition expands greatly on the first, not in just plot, but in characters, enemies, and terrain. The first was lacking many ""real"" dungeons, save for a few, but the second really goes out of its way to provide that ""dungeon"" environment, having been thrust into the fold of it from the start. The higher levels in the second allow for more deadly foes, having something like a lich in the first baldurs gate with the starter levels just wouldn't do it justice. No longer will you have to yawn at a pack of Gibberlings, for now, the true beasts of the night come out to stalk you...			"

												I, unfortunately, have a Mac.Because of this, I can't justify buying a nice PC to play great games on.But Boulders Gate 2 doesn't just run on this 4 year old Mac book pro, but it is one of the most amazing games I have ever played. I was stuck between this and Icewin Dale, but BG2EE takes the cake.Don't expect good graphics (thought their not bad) or amazing combat (though its strategic and quite challenging), but everything else you love about RPG's came from this game.Talos: Check.Customisation: Check.Voice acted NPC's: Check.Great Story: Check.Characters I genuinely like: Double check because of Boo.I can't wait until I have a weekend off just to sit and play this.

												Its just how I remember when BG was new to the world. I have allready played it to death, probably replayed it about 7 or 8 times now. If you have not played bg, can get over the outdated grapgics and like RPG's, then this game should not be passed on. They just dont make any games as well as the BG series. Not a single title in the past 5 years come even close. Just to give you an idea, the first dragon age was well done and was maybe half as good as BG, all it really had was better graphics. I doubt I will ever see another game of its kind again, the gaming industry has been in decline of quality and love from its creaters for many years.			"

												The greatest RPG of all time getting even better! I simply can't get enough of this drug of a game. And it's incredible how 15 years since I played it for the 1st time I find myself playing it and enjoying it just the same as I did in those days. This enhanced edition is truly beautiful and well polished, it runs like a dream, and everything is in place. The new companions are awesome, the refined gameplay works, and if you never played BG2 before then you should definitely grab this because otherwise you'll be missing out on a seriously epic RPG.Now lets also note a few things. This is a very old game that has been reworked in a minimal fashion to make it compatible with Steam. As of this current patch gen, the game features an improved interface, new difficulties added, and the correction of many bugs. This doesn't change the fact the game is old! If you are not into vintage games, this title may not be for you, as playing this game is like getting on a time machine back to the early 2000s, which was the golden era of RPGs. As you play the game you would find yourself dealing with infuriating things, like a totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI, or the awkward moving patterns of your characters. In fact, you'll scream in rage every time you find yourself being slaughtered because one of your companions failed to cast the spells he/she needed, or got stuck on a corner for no logical reason other than crappy AI. Assuming you can see passed its imperfections, you will find yourself in love with this vast, complex, rich, and unforgiving fantasy world, and the people you'll meet in it. What kind of RPGer are you? Role player or power gamer? Well, you'll be happy to discover the game puts both types of gameply on steroids, and gives you a unique experience with enormous amounts of re-playability .   Multiplayer was a big fail for me, but that's because I tried the Beamdog servers, so if you want to try the Multiplayer way, try the local IP type.			"

												When I was 12 this game first came out. I loved D&D my mom got this for me for christmas. And I wasn't allowed to install things yet because my mom was cray. For a week I read the manual. A huge tome of information about every little detail. Stats, proficiences, races, classes. I soaked it all up. For a 12 year old this was advanced♥♥♥♥♥♥ since previously All i had played were, Warcraft 3, Age of Empires 1+2 and Streets of rage. So this was the dawning of a new era. mom installed the FOUR DISKS required to do it. 5 if you included ToB, 6 if you counted the special features disc. That's right mofos, extras. Like a whole shirt, a sick box. a free prima strategy guide. And a whole disc of art and story and music details. it was sweeeeeet. So i load that bad boy on my Windows 95 computer and get playing. i zip through the tutorial. on normal. But I get to the part where you had to identify the shield. And for some reason i could not figure it out. I was stuck on it for hours. Screaming and crying in frustration. that even with the wealth of knowledge about the game at my fingertips, I could not identify this damn shield. So I storm off and take a break. i come back to it and right click it. Then clicked identify. I felt so dumb. but. i finished that tutorial. Started a game as a fighter who went dual wield with Swords. Started the opening dungeon. Died to the first mephit room because I couldn't turn it of. Now at 26. i make a kensai mage and become a lightning tornado of chopping death and ambiguous morality. So i've come a long way.			"

												So, have you ever played Dungeons and Dragons? If you have, BAM, that's this game (Advanced D&D, but same thing), if you haven't though, then you're in for a treat. So this is probably the BEST adventure game ever. This is the second game in a two off series. Created by a Triple Entente of awesome consisting of Wizards of the Coast, Black Isle Studios, and the illustious Bioware. This is a great standalone game, but some references to the first game are always in need of some background.The story begins right where the original game left off, after creating your character, you are thrust into the world of magic, adventure, dungeons, and amazing storytelling. Everything about this game is absolutely amazing, it is a great part of my childhood, and will more than be able to keep you and your friends happy in your own little fantasy world. You can go from fighting vampires in a graveyard, ogres in the countryside, defend against ancient evil spirits in dark ruins, fight off cults, answer genie riddles, and slay dragons.That being said, one of the only downfalls to this game is that it's worldbuilding ability is far from stellar, in fact, aside from the multiplayer story mode, this game has no real replay value, and the only redeeming feature is that it is an epic game that sprawls through every facet of the Dungeon and Dragons game. The game at points can be insanely hard if you aren't a specific class or have a specific party make up (oh, and have fun being evil, Bioware made this before learning the joy of selecting your own path to victory, so it'll be almost impossible to play as evil).All-In-All: This game is simply amazing, epic storytelling, beautiful visuals (even for their times), great character development, and absolutely awesome gameplay. A must play for fans of Dragon Age.			"

												Great game, my 247 hrs is about less than half of my time on the original.  The number of mods out there is amazing, anything from quest mods to npc mods. Character depth and interaction that you just can't get anymore on ""modern"" games. The EE is somewhat buggy, not buggy as hell as some of the other people are saying and yeah the game has been out since November 2013 and still no bug or addons like what was promised but still a great game. NOTE: a lot of mods for this game just don't work on the Enhanced Edition, I'd recommend the Original BG2 instead of this due to the lower number of available mods and literally no support from the devs.EDIT: I failed to mention, the added content exclusive to the EE isn't that great so you won't miss anything if you don't get it and just go for the Original.

I was unlucky as I hadn't realized this and was playing in one district quick saving multiple times.The only save left was the START of chapter 2 - what all my other saves had reset to for no apparent reason.

												An apparently leaked beta pre-release version of a CRPG classic redux. Has ten times as many spectacular bugs in it as the original 2000 release, no graphics and speed settings of the original and reduced pathfinding nodes. There's also new content including such gems as a Bag of Holding with a coffin stuck in it and a fetch quest about using limited consumables to catch 8 randomly wandering cats that have a 5% chance to escape your inventory once a minute.All in all an adequate experience for a nostalgic gamer who wants to meditate on a long prosperous journey big budget RPGs had from rng savegrind tactical strategies cluttered with walls of tedious graphomanic drama to putting a bucket on a vendor's head after spending a day in face generator.Also multiplayer.

												Quite simply the best game I have ever played in my 18+ years of playing video games. The world is so immersive, a seemingly endless stream of quests to complete, and so many classes that are all good that you want to play them all (except bard, screw bards). None of the classes are ragingly overpowered, even though mages can feel like it (specifically enemy mages) with time stops and imprisons galore, which just means that you have to be more strategic in spell placement as well as party composition.Otherwise, there are tons of characters within the game, both companions and NPCs, that are quite interesting, including the ghosts, djinn, statues, etc. that will give you fun riddles. Maybe it's just because the Forgotten Realms world had it's lore well established long before Baldur's Gate became a thing, but whatever it is, this world is unlike anything I have ever experienced before, with little to no hand holding, yet it doesn't feel unfair. There is a strategy to get through everything, you just have to figure it out for yourself.There are some bugs, but I found them mostly funny. High Watcher Oisig in the base game and a group of peasants in the expansion just kept randomly showing up in the most obscure places, and it was really funny to just see them pop up.Best moment definitely goes to the part in Throne of Bhaal where a group of dark elves are disguised as random animals. I just wanted to slaughter a moose and, lo and behold, it was actually a drow. Go figure.10/10 I'm glad I got to experience this for the first time through the Enhanced Edition on steam.			"

												One of the best RPGs and, I could even say, games ever. It's a must have for any lover of RPGs and a good game for any gamer in general. It may seem a little difficult at first but after you learn the basics you'll love this beauty as much as I do.I bought it on sale so I could relieve all the wonderful experiences I had when I played the original a few good years ago and it's just as good or even better. Definitly worth it.			"

												I checked this game out again after seeing all the recent negative reviews and I almost vomited when I got into the game. The spritework looks objectively awful now, and the interface is more unwieldy than ever and stands out next to the rest of the game's assets. It seems they're continually distancing the game from its original iteration with all these redundant updates, which is kinda counter-productive when you're making a re-release that's supposed to supercede the original.Maybe I'll appreciate these changes when my PC morphs into a phone, since that's the only place where these changes would make any amount of sense. But until then this is a straight up inferior version of the game. How hard would it be to add a ""Switch to original graphics"" option?			"

												It's well know that this is the best role playing game ever conceived so there's no real need for a review here regarding the vanilla version. It's been done. As far as the EE version, it had a rocky beginning, but now all the major bugs have been fixed and it's mostly a smooth game even over multiplayer. I played the entire saga with someone I've never met (Nitram) who lives across the globe. We had a lot of fun with few problems. What issues did appear were managable, so not too much time was spent troubleshooting. I imagine multiplayer is even more playable now since our playthrough was a couple years back.			"

												I want to like this game, but I simply get frustrated trying to play.  Its a tedius exercise in micromanagement, some of which could be emliminated without removing any of the tactical gameplay.  If you aren't constantly microing everything you die constantly, and usually upon reloading what killed you is easily overcome with metagame knowledge.  For some unknown reason they changed the auto casting of healing spells upon resting, adding another layer of useless micromanagement.  Spending tons of time clicking through spell menus and waiting for animations to finish to cast a dozen healing spells 1 by 1 isn't fun or adding to the gameplay, simply annoying.			"

												Den Klassiker schlechthin nochmal spielen. Ich hatte mich lange gewehrt dieses Rework zu spielen, aus Angst dass meine nostalgisch-erhöhte Erwartung enttäuscht werden würde. Nun nach einiger Spielzeit kann ich sagen, dass ich positiv vertraut überrascht wurde. Das Spiel fühlt sich immernoch so an wie früher, es gibt einige Quality-of-life-Änderungen (z.B. kann man der K.I. endlich ein Skript geben, ohne dass diese einem sofort den nächsten Kampf verliert).Die verbesserte Grafik ist sehr gut gelungen und fühlt sich nicht fehl am Platz an. Zusammengefasst: wer Baldur's Gate II mochte, wird vermutlich auch Baldur's Gate II Enhanced Edition mögen.			"

												Easily one of my favorite games. I played through it when it came out in 2000, and played through it again when the Enhanced Edition came out. It's full of stunning, memorable hand-drawn environments that stand up to this day. There is a massive amount of content -- one of those games that gets bigger and bigger just as you think you're coming to the end.What really makes it great, though, is the combat. This game is all about the combat. You will need to become intimately familiar with buffs, debuffs, alignments, weaknesses, and status effects and how to deal with those if you want to stand a chance in tougher battles. You will need to reload often. You will need to read the combat log to understand why you're dying. There are times you will lose your whole party over and over and finally discover you're better off using only a single character for that particular fight. It's insanely complex and tactical, and major battles are usually quite unique so it does not get repetitive at all.There's also a huge amount of work put into the story, dialogue, voice overs, character development -- all things that I don't care about too much but can't help appreciating. The plot is immersive and completely changes the pace at a few points, switching from  open-world to (somewhat) linear and then back to open world again.It's not a game to play casually. Without some dedication you will have a hard time getting into it, but once you break the ice it will suck you in.			"

												**** (of 5)A good role playing game with many characters and storylines. You are drawn into the stories and want to find out all about the many people you meet, especially your potential group members. Additionally the game is based on the dungeons&dragons rules, which give you quite a big freedom to steer your characters and their abilities. It's a bit tiresome that you can't save and sometimes it takes up too much time to find out, how to get any further.			"

												This game is still the best RPG I've played (not counting JRPGs). The characters are funny, smart and memorable. The story is intriguing and have just enough epic put in to it. There is tons of fun side quests. What they've done here is that they have you collecting money to advance. Sounds like a boring thing but to get the gold you need to find quests. This makes the gameplay and experience non-linear but keeps the story linear (linear stories are better). The game play is tactical and fun with lots of pause and unpause moments. Weapons are special here so you rarely change them. This makes your equipment mean more since they tell a story. I've got this from a dead witch… or whatever. Also, read the story on weapons with names. They are sometimes really cool.For the enhanced part. There is some improvement on character creation and they've included Throne of Bhaal. This is all good. They've also included 3 more characters. This would be good if they weren't so stereotypical, boring and bad.I could go on forever but will that not at all. If you want a epic story with enjoyable characters and tactical RPG gameplay than this is the top one. I don't know why you're still reading this. Buy it (on sale of course, also, for Linux).			"

												!!! NOTE TO BUYER: There are severe problems with Windows 7 !!!So, this is a game that uses mechanics from the earlier versions of the Dungeons&Dragons pen and paper RPG. It is out-dated gameplay-wise, but the story is well-crafted and the level of freedom is still far better than what many modern games allow.If you're considering buying this game to play with your friends - hold it, that's probably not a good idea. This game has been ported from the earlier version of the game, and present problems include:- Crashes when alt-tabbing- Crashes when progressing to the next chapter in multiplayer- GlitchesWhile the problems in multiplayer may seem minor, it is still frequent enough to make you no longer want to play after a few chapters.However, if you intend to buy this for the singleplayer content and don't mind the graphics, go ahead - it's a great buy.

												I'm very excited to be able to post this review, keep in mind this is not my full review! But I just can't contain myself. On to the review!!!!(1 hour in)So awesome, so far I've managed to roll an 88 stat with 18/56 for strength, my best roll thus far and saved it. I'm really aiming for a roll in the 90's with a str of 18/?? for my fighter/cleric. .......(3Hrs in)....so far I've almost cracked it, the gameplay is so nerve wracking!!! Interestingly I find that when I re-roll at higher speeds, I can't seem to keep up with the numbers on the screen, a few times there I'm sure I hit over 90 but then immediately re-roll!!! Keep missing that magic number, the heart races!!!!....(6 hours in)......Holy moly. So my strategy has shifted...and that's what this game is about, STRATEGY!!! If you planonbuyingthisgame...then be aware, do NOT stop on rolling a good stat number but then think it's not good enough and immediately begin the rolling roulette so quickley, you get complacent and click so fast, you miss good numbers that come up......(18/00 hours in...)....broke my mouse so had to leave the game running while I went to purchase another, didn't want to lose that 88 roll with 18/56 I had saved. Pretty sure I'm nearly half way through the game, stuck at the 18/22 boss, I've almost got it but I cant get the other roll over 90 now.....Best virtual dice rolling game ever, would roll a 72 again.

So if you are looking for great graphics thi sis not the game for you.But if you are looking for a great storyline and a lot of sidequest (I installed a bunch of mods, great stuff there too) this is one of the best RPG's ever.This version will bring you back to good old memories so I can recommend this game to all RPG fans!

No simple ""deal X dmg on y enemy"" system. Very diverse crowd control system, lots of ways to play this game. It uses the old dnd rules and they are much better for a computer game than the actual ones. Also charackter creation is less complicated.One of the first games where also multiclassing was possible. The atmosphere is still unmatched.			"

												When asked, I always say that Baldur's Gate II is my favourite ever game.  I've bought it more than once, but haven't played it in at least 10 years.  Graphically, it was never top of the line but coming back to it this is a strength because it doesn't feel like I'm playng something old.  The storylines are so memorable that I'm finding myself remember as I go - in fact, I recently completed ""de'arnise keep"" and found I could remember where the enemies were!  I'm really enjoying this trip down memory lane and looking forward to the new characters and stories added by Beamdog.I can't recommend this enough, Bioware at their best mixed with new elements for the experienced player.

												In a nutshell-  BGII is the perfection that Pillars of Eternity and the DragonAge series are trying to recapture.It's one of those rare games that has everything. -Beautiful hand-painted environments-Excellent writing, meaningful quests with multiple morally-ambiguous solutions. -Hectic real-time combat where the outcome depends on your strategy, not how powerful you are, without getting at all complicated. -Lots of drama, personal quests, character development, and romance between companions.  You know, like Dragonage.  Except, there are *over 20 companions*.  The game is everything you could want.			"

												!!! NOTE TO BUYER: There are severe problems with Windows 7 !!!So, this is a game that uses mechanics from the earlier versions of the Dungeons&Dragons pen and paper RPG. It is out-dated gameplay-wise, but the story is well-crafted and the level of freedom is still far better than what many modern games allow.If you're considering buying this game to play with your friends - hold it, that's probably not a good idea. This game has been ported from the earlier version of the game, and present problems include:- Crashes when alt-tabbing- Crashes when progressing to the next chapter in multiplayer- GlitchesWhile the problems in multiplayer may seem minor, it is still frequent enough to make you no longer want to play after a few chapters.However, if you intend to buy this for the singleplayer content and don't mind the graphics, go ahead - it's a great buy.

												Decent refactoring of a truly great game, but nothing spectacular that could not already be achieved by modding the vanilla game. I haven't tried multiplayer in EE yet, but from all accounts it appears to be a buggy mess.I am SO glad this game was not defiled by tacky Steam ""achievements"" popping up to ruin my immersion. I could give a  **** if that was the 1,000 orc I've slewn. Are gamers really that OCD today? Must we count every single mundane thing that happens? Achievements tend to become their own meta-game and affect story and immersion in negative ways, especially if you earn an ""achievement"" for doing mundane and ordinary actions that EVERY player does. ""Congratulations! You've opened your first door!"" *kill me now*However, if there must be an achievement, it should be for discovering the only giant miniature space hamster in the known universe.

												Once on the best RPG's of all time,Immersive sophisticated (bit dark) story, excellent character development, and fantastic questing. I'd recommend this, even to someone who does not normally like RPG's. If you are going to like RPG's at all, this might be the one. For people who do like RPGs, this is one of the best in the genre. You are less guided in this game in what you have to do next, after you beat the first dungeon you are in a wide world, where you can discover what quests you want to do, and you decide what you are capable of taking on.I played BG II before BG I, so you don't need to have played the first.you start as a lvl 7 character, not lvl 1, and you only create yourself, you pick which other 5 characters you want to accompany you.

												Fun game. Suffers from a couple old-school things that come with the freedom to kill anyone and anything. I killed a wizard in a sewer that made me instantly Kill-on-Sight to everyone factioned with the Old Wizards, preventing me from continuing my quest 25 hours into the game because I was supposed to go to this house and speak with a lady, but every time I went in there and triggered the quest event, the wizards I was supposed to save from the bad guys attacked ME along with the bad guys. Quit playing, what a drag.Otherwise, great game. Just woulda been nice to be able to have known that. But seeing as I killed that wizard probably 10 hours prior to that event, there was no chance I was going to revert that far back.9/10			"

												I say this game is not recommended, but you'll probably note the many hours I have in to it. Here's my explanation.The game is still a lot of fun. Quite challenging even on normal, and very brutal if you increase the difficulty. Mages can be gods on the battlefield, and not having a diverse party could quite simply ruin your life. However.....I do not recommend this game because at the end of the day it is exactly the same as it was when originally released so many years ago, the main difference is that there are a few extra characters/items and an additional quest here and there, but nothing truly ground shattering. As an owner of the original game, I could have simply loaded it on my PC and had nearly the same exact experience. Buying it on sale offers me a bit of satisfaction though, but still leaves a rather bad taste in my mouth. Overall, this kind of thing makes me realize that staying away from HD upgrades or anything of the sort is the best course of action. It really is nothing more than a money sink, and the only ones getting anything out of it are the people who profit from your purchase. If you have never played the game before, then give it a shot. But you could probably find an old copy of the original game and you'd pretty much never know the difference.			"

												I recommend this for multiplayer ONLY. The game in general is a buggy mess and the writing and conceptualization of the new content is poor, badly conceived and does not fit with the original game at all. Even for a multiplayer recommendation the connectivity itself is abysmal: get used to being unable to connect to games, getting kicked during cutscenes and so on and so forth.Everything it does is done as well or better by the original plus mods. (And I include Saerileth in that)However, the original is pretty much impossible to play on multiplayer.This is not worth the price for something which is essentially a multiplayer expansion for a retro game. If it was 10 or less yeah sure I'd recommend it but as of now it's just a disgusting cash-in on the part o0f the developers.			"

												Edit: DO NOT BUY!Beamdog has done what I could not have forseen, with their ridiculous Siege of Dragonspear expansion they have managed to turn the original Baldur's Gate Games into a blurry mess of Arcanum-style character sprites and failed UI-""upgrades"". You now have to scroll in your spellbooks, just so that the new kids don't actually have to learn the symbols (which is psychologically idiotic, cuz humans are good at symbolism), the edge of the map now hangs halfway into your screen killing immersion in the process, etc..This does not feel like Baldur's Gate anymore. I tried to play it. I tried to see the good in it, like the more organized journal, but it didn't come to me.Do not buy this anymore until they fix this. I'm going back to my Big World versions. Goodbye Neera.-------I will never understand the haters of this excellent remake. I also bought BG1+2 as original 6/4-CD versions when they came out. First in german, than a few years later as english DVDs, then at GoG again when they came on sale and I still bought the EE's of both games.And you know what? They've done everything right!1) The small tweaks go over extremly well, like 80 arrows per quiver slot.2) The engine works flawlessly and the little UI enhancements alone were worth the money to me.3) The new NPCs are mostly great. I especially adore Neera, who is so very different from the rest, maybe with the exception of Tiax. I also like Dorn, because both BGs generally lacked evil party NPCs that weren't overacting or plain insane.4) Both EE's are easy to mod. Most Gibberling's & Co mods work, but you need far less of them. The 12-hour-installation of the Big World Project was a pain in the rear, and it usually took me several tries.To sum it up, Beamdog delivered a pure Baldur's Gate experience with excellent new content in a very polished package.

												Baldurs Gate 2 single handedly ruined my grades through the majority of high school. One of the best games ever made and consistently makes it in my top 5 when people ask for my all time favourite games.The down side is the original game with mods is better than the enhanced edition. Do yourself a favour and go buy the originals on GOG and use the community mods to enhance it for the best experience.Edit: Version 2.0 has made the enhanced edition utterly horrible. It is almost unplayable.			"

												Firstly I'll say that I absolutely love Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, however I can't recommend the game in the Enhanced Edition format. The enhanced edition brings nothing new to the game that hasn't already been introduced in mods for the original. The updated graphics existed in the widescreen mod (albeit without the ability to zoom in to see an extremely blocky close up of characters). The new characters and quests are poorly written (dialogue choices are obvious and over the top - good, evil and sarcastic). Many of the quests seem to be attempts at comedy that both fall flat and break immersion in the game. This edition seems to have done very little to fix what bugs, exploits and even spelling errors existed in the original game, despite these problems being well known in the community and frequently already corrected in the various tweak packs. To make matters worse I've suffered several crash to desktops, which I've never experienced with the original game (I have the GOG version of the original installed on the same machine with mods).In my opinion the only two reasons to buy this version are for the (admittedly very fun!) Black Pits 2 or if you don't feel capable of modding the game yourself (perfectly understandable, but be reassured that the modding community is largely very helpful and supportive).			"

The UI is terrible, and the direction that the developers behind the Enhanced Editions is going is not good for this sort of series at all.There are still copies of the original game out there, with disks still available.

												Apesar de gostar mais da liberdade e mapas do primeiro Baldur's Gate, bem como da cidade-título, tenho que admitir que Athkatla é uma obra prima e tem personagens ainda mais desenvolvidos.E definitivamente Jon Irenicus é um vilão mais imoral e bem construído que Sarevok.Dito isso, o jogo manteve a fineza do primeiro, e deixa qualquer um minimamente interessado em D&D hookado na história e na multitude de quests.10/10. E eu estaria mentindo se contrariasse as milhares de horas que gastei (pré steam) explorando todos os cantos dos mapas.“Change is not always growth, but growth is often rooted in change.""“Those who rely on certainties are certain to be disappointed”  "

												I say this game is not recommended, but you'll probably note the many hours I have in to it. Here's my explanation.The game is still a lot of fun. Quite challenging even on normal, and very brutal if you increase the difficulty. Mages can be gods on the battlefield, and not having a diverse party could quite simply ruin your life. However.....I do not recommend this game because at the end of the day it is exactly the same as it was when originally released so many years ago, the main difference is that there are a few extra characters/items and an additional quest here and there, but nothing truly ground shattering. As an owner of the original game, I could have simply loaded it on my PC and had nearly the same exact experience. Buying it on sale offers me a bit of satisfaction though, but still leaves a rather bad taste in my mouth. Overall, this kind of thing makes me realize that staying away from HD upgrades or anything of the sort is the best course of action. It really is nothing more than a money sink, and the only ones getting anything out of it are the people who profit from your purchase. If you have never played the game before, then give it a shot. But you could probably find an old copy of the original game and you'd pretty much never know the difference.			"

												I recommend this for multiplayer ONLY. The game in general is a buggy mess and the writing and conceptualization of the new content is poor, badly conceived and does not fit with the original game at all. Even for a multiplayer recommendation the connectivity itself is abysmal: get used to being unable to connect to games, getting kicked during cutscenes and so on and so forth.Everything it does is done as well or better by the original plus mods. (And I include Saerileth in that)However, the original is pretty much impossible to play on multiplayer.This is not worth the price for something which is essentially a multiplayer expansion for a retro game. If it was 10 or less yeah sure I'd recommend it but as of now it's just a disgusting cash-in on the part o0f the developers.			"

												Edit: DO NOT BUY!Beamdog has done what I could not have forseen, with their ridiculous Siege of Dragonspear expansion they have managed to turn the original Baldur's Gate Games into a blurry mess of Arcanum-style character sprites and failed UI-""upgrades"". You now have to scroll in your spellbooks, just so that the new kids don't actually have to learn the symbols (which is psychologically idiotic, cuz humans are good at symbolism), the edge of the map now hangs halfway into your screen killing immersion in the process, etc..This does not feel like Baldur's Gate anymore. I tried to play it. I tried to see the good in it, like the more organized journal, but it didn't come to me.Do not buy this anymore until they fix this. I'm going back to my Big World versions. Goodbye Neera.-------I will never understand the haters of this excellent remake. I also bought BG1+2 as original 6/4-CD versions when they came out. First in german, than a few years later as english DVDs, then at GoG again when they came on sale and I still bought the EE's of both games.And you know what? They've done everything right!1) The small tweaks go over extremly well, like 80 arrows per quiver slot.2) The engine works flawlessly and the little UI enhancements alone were worth the money to me.3) The new NPCs are mostly great. I especially adore Neera, who is so very different from the rest, maybe with the exception of Tiax. I also like Dorn, because both BGs generally lacked evil party NPCs that weren't overacting or plain insane.4) Both EE's are easy to mod. Most Gibberling's & Co mods work, but you need far less of them. The 12-hour-installation of the Big World Project was a pain in the rear, and it usually took me several tries.To sum it up, Beamdog delivered a pure Baldur's Gate experience with excellent new content in a very polished package.

												Baldurs Gate 2 single handedly ruined my grades through the majority of high school. One of the best games ever made and consistently makes it in my top 5 when people ask for my all time favourite games.The down side is the original game with mods is better than the enhanced edition. Do yourself a favour and go buy the originals on GOG and use the community mods to enhance it for the best experience.Edit: Version 2.0 has made the enhanced edition utterly horrible. It is almost unplayable.			"

												Firstly I'll say that I absolutely love Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, however I can't recommend the game in the Enhanced Edition format. The enhanced edition brings nothing new to the game that hasn't already been introduced in mods for the original. The updated graphics existed in the widescreen mod (albeit without the ability to zoom in to see an extremely blocky close up of characters). The new characters and quests are poorly written (dialogue choices are obvious and over the top - good, evil and sarcastic). Many of the quests seem to be attempts at comedy that both fall flat and break immersion in the game. This edition seems to have done very little to fix what bugs, exploits and even spelling errors existed in the original game, despite these problems being well known in the community and frequently already corrected in the various tweak packs. To make matters worse I've suffered several crash to desktops, which I've never experienced with the original game (I have the GOG version of the original installed on the same machine with mods).In my opinion the only two reasons to buy this version are for the (admittedly very fun!) Black Pits 2 or if you don't feel capable of modding the game yourself (perfectly understandable, but be reassured that the modding community is largely very helpful and supportive).			"

												I played the original and Baldur's Gate 2 is potentially the greatest game of all time. However, do no go near this version of it. The UI is terrible, and the direction that the developers behind the Enhanced Editions is going is not good for this sort of series at all.There are still copies of the original game out there, with disks still available.

												You could argue the original game set the standard for CRPGs back when pen & paper was the norm and most RPGs were text, static image based or just looking like Lego on a screen. Then sequal came and did what the first did, but so much bigger and so much better, over 5 glorious CD's of awesomeness.The story continues where the first left off (mostly) and after a brief stint in jail, had you delving deeper into your heritage, catapulting your charater into the ""uncertain"" future with an epic climax to rival most games today. Then when you thought it all was over... the expansion came and just added more epic to a final conclusion.This Remastered edition leaves much of the original features with 2 new ""questlines"" to explore, all with some much needed engine and UI updates (with some not so much needed overly highlighted avatars) and well worth the cash to play the pretty vast original story game (if you want to do *everything*, expect a good few weeks of play). BUT if you do find a cheap 2nd hand copy of this game with it's expansion, or even the 4 disc of both 1 and 2 and thier expansions (which would probably play much better on the current crop of OS's), you'd be a fool to pass them up. In my not so unbiased opinion...			"

												I can understand taking a classic game and wanting to retouche it to make it more approachable to the dumbed-down new generation which only cares about graphics and misses out legendary content like the one in Baldur's Gate. What I cannot understand is two things:1. Why would you ask a full 20 euro for a game that you have filled with unfixed bugs (which are probably never going to be resolved anyway)? For 20 euros you should be fixing the bugs AND making me coffee for an entire year, you crooks!2. Who gave the right to a group of social justice warriors (which is codename for r e t a r d s) to change the actual content of a historic game with their political agenda??? This alone guarantees a downvote and is something I never even imagined when I gladly paid my hard-earned 20 euro to get an enhanced version of THE ACTUAL BALDUR'S GATE 2!After this, I paid ten bucks to order from Amazon the actual full Baldur's Gate collection (all games, all add-ons) and another ten for a similar Icewind Dale box, and have been a happier man ever since.

												 Baldur's Gate 2 is an old classic, updated with a fresh coat of paint, and some community mods incorporated as well, along with a bit of extra content. It's a lot longer than most modern RPG's, and offers a ludicrous amount of replayability for its price tag, however, it's still, at heart, a really old game that has not aged well in a lot of aspects, while other components are still stellar to this day.  Baldur's Gate is based off of the antiquated 2.0e D&D ruleset, offering counterintuitive game mechanics, poor balance, limited flexibility, and poor character creation, with minimalistic control over appearance, stats, and no 'feats' like exist in most D&D based games. Its gameplay itself is incredibly wonky and variable, classes like Fighter having at best, a single self-buff skill until epic levels, and otherwise entirely being left click and watch, while classes like Wizard have ridiculously high, and unforgiving skill ceilings. In terms of gameplay, character creation, class balance, and art design, I'd have to say that Baldur's Gate is far inferior to its spiritual successors such as Dragon Age, or Pillars of Eternity. It's aged poorly, and doesn't hold up well, even for its low price tag in these regards.  However, there's aspects in which, it still holds up, and I would recommend it. While casters, rather infuriatingly, have their spells interrupted when taking damage, resulting in a lot of unforgiving requirements for positioning, the Wizard, Sorcerer, and Cleric classes are ludicrously powerful in ways that a lot of RPG's usually tone down for balance reasons. In Baldur's Gate, a high level caster will play like a demi-god, summoning pit fiends, controlling minds, calling down angels, raining meteors from the heavens, killing with a single touch, create hordes of undead, extend phantasms of yourself capable of casting spells and fighting for you, etc. The level of power given to casters in this game is phenominal and satisfying when mastered, and a Cleric/Wizard multiclass has such a ludicrous amount and variety of potent spells that it'll take you longer to scroll through them all than it will to handle the encounter itself. But let's say casters aren't your thing, there's still a couple aspects in which Baldur's Gate 2 is worth a look. The first, is writing. There's a lot of it, and it's all stellar, and a lot of the time, easy to miss, as the vast majority of content in Baldur's Gate is optional sidequests, but regardless of how you slice it, Baldur's Gate offers a large amount of quality content, with interesting writing, characters, different tones, and those decision making mechanics that people love so much. The second, is the main reason that, years later, I still find myself coming back to Baldur's Gate 2, and that is the game's pacing. The common RPG notions of ""Oh, you're a normal person, then a thing happened, now there's a secret society, kill it, and save the entire planet"", two act arc, is really quite overdone and forced. A lot of RPG's will quickly rush to topics of killing gods, or saving the world, sprinting headlong into the notion of the highest degree of escalation at a breakneck speed.  Baldur's Gate 2 escalates to the same level, but it paces it out, and gives the player time to adapt to each new level of capability before moving onto the next. When you hit epic levels, be prepared to literally have to hold your own against entire armies. However, unlike a long RPG like say, Final Fantasy, do not expect to need to 'grind'. Doing quests is more than enough to fully cap out an entire adventuring party, with a fair amount of content left afterwards. I think the pacing of the game's content in terms of gameplay escalation of difficulty, and the pacing of the content in terms of plot development, is well balanced in a way that most games these days really miss out on.  As well, the game has built in multiplayer support, with Beamdog hosted servers, along with being able to run your own--usually for modded content--allowing you to bring along friends with split control over the party, which offers even more replayability to an already fairly lengthy game.  Ultimately, I recommend Baldur's Gate 2 for people with an interest in longer, well paced out, story driven RPG's with tactical, spellcaster focused combat, or a classical RPG that can be played with friends, and for people who don't mind poor character creation, archaic rulesets, and are willing to overlook the clunky combat.

Still one of the best RPGs out there and unlike some other of the older RPGs it is quite good to look at and the interface is not too clunky to use.  IMO the magic system is up there with the best, making the strategic element of spell choice and the tactical use of them in combat a challenging and greatly enjoyable aspect of the game.  My only gripe is with the in-city elements to the game which I think are a little weaker but otherwise excellent.9/10 - would have my mind flayed again.			"

												Before I bought the game I've done an extensive researh on game review sites / forums, have read the user comments and then bought the game myself.BG have been the most epic game of my childhood, and I was eager to play again when I've heard they have updated it after all those years. First and most important thing I can say; do not be fooled by all those negative user comments about how the game has been made easier and therefore ruined, by making things such as ""auto-trap detection"" and etc. If you want to play the game just as it was before when it was first released, those new additions CAN BE EASILY TURNED OFF, or some may be left on depending on your preference. Game is still as good as it was before, and after all the fixes, after buying/playing, I can say it is even better now. If you enjoy a RPG with an amazing detail and epic story waaay ahead of its time, which is still amazingly detailed and fun to play, do not think twice before buying this game. Do not expect graphical and animation-al (?) details, as this game is over 10 years old, but the depth of characters, stories, interactions... This game is better than any book I have read, any movie I have seen. If you spend alot of time, reading backstories, doing sidequests, exploring, I'm sure you will agree. 10+years old, still better than 99% of new RPGs.			"

												This is my 2nd attempt to try a true D&D game and while allot of people enjoy this sort of thing I do not.   When the grpahics are terrible and the game play is also bad its hard to enjoy something.   See the time I have on the game?  12 hours or so and I am still trying to get out of the starter dungeon.  Now I've played Divinity and Pillars of Eternity and enjoiyed them quite a bit.  This game is just terrible and if this is enhanced I get the shakes what the basic game is like.  One of the early party member is beyong annoying and the other is less than useless.  Casting any sort of AOE kills or roots your enitre party as well as the enemy.  The fact that I can camp any time I feel like it makes the mechanic of only being able to cast what is memorzied pretty uselss.   Now in most games if you mouse over a spell you will get a tool tip telling you what the spell is.  In this game you put the mouse over the icon and a few seconds later a scroll unrolls to tell you that this spell is ""fireball"" now if you right click it a window opens and you can see what it does.  Now carefully aim it so it lands 10 metyers BEHIND your targert or you will end up setting the enemy and your group on fire.  The druid in your part cvan cast a root spell which is a handy aoe but watch out where you cast that as it affects the entire area of the window you are in adn effectively roots everyone.   Blah  I couldn't recommend this to anyone!			"

												This is a joke, I've always owned the pre-steam era Baldur's Gate titles and played and finished them 100's of times - but this is RIFE with bugs and glitches. Whether it's NPCs doubling up and appearing in the strangest of places, e.g. some woman asking me to do a quest and appearing in Lavok's Sphere, a aprty member getting stuck under a table in the hall of the Black Pits 1, or being unable to go forward in the Astral Prison with Haerdalis and having to use cheats to get out.New charcaters are nice, classes and their quests too - but DAMN there are ALOT of bugs. If you have to buy it (like I did) get it when it reach $5 and less, Personally, I will not being buying the Dragonspear exapnsion when it comes out.			"

												This is a must own classic RPG with a grandiose story and engaging characters. A great combat and skill system based off of DnD rules. Plenty of tough choices to make, and the classes for your protaganist vary greatly for amazing replayability. My personal favorite game of all time. Here's the kicker though, you can easily find this game on other sites (ebay and Amazon for disc versions and other websites that will sell digital copies) that are cheaper, and that you can mod the hell out of. It comes down to whether or not you want convenience and a slightly higher pricetag with beamdog, or going through the process of finding a copy from a website you trust. However you choose to get this game, get it, because whether or not you buy it here or somewhere else, you should BUY THIS GAME. It's amazing.			"

It's just when I finally got to almost having an awesome brawl with vampires, I ran into a bug that prevented me from moving forward and now I haven't touched the game in months because some of us don't know how to mod the hell out of something or aren't very computer literate. I'm really disappointed. I was super excited to spend my day off kicking Bodhi's ayuss.			"

												I love Baldur's Gate. It is one of game sagas I played the most. The EE series have brought new elements. So, let's give one most positive and one most negative.EE gained a large visual advantage, by allowing big resolutions and zooming in and out beyod what I had in the original games. :O Although I already had my copies of the original games, I was happy to move my playing to the EE versions for this thing alone. ;)On the bad side, I find that characters introduced in EE and their story lines downgrade the general feel of the gameplay. :( Hence am happy to avoid them. :)			"

No more carrying 5 gem bags, just one or two now. The game has its ups and downs, some textures could be better but I overall have enjoyed this game very much, and hated it very much. The newer content is somewhat lacking, but still provides fun gameplay.			"

												Baldur's Gate II Enhanced Edition :Thanks to Beam Dog for upgrading the BG Forgotton Realms series so you can play it on any of the new  high end computers. With new characters as well as the old favorites and many new side quests. who would have thought the best series of RPG games could get better.If this isn't enough Beam Dog is almost finished with an expansion that takes place between BG 1 and BG II.If your an RPG lover then Baldur's Gate II EE is worth more than most all of the newer games that are comming out now.The only people that don't rate this game No 1 are too young to know that real game play is not just run-n-gun. You have use your brain and stratagy to play BG it's not all jump and shoot but Role Playing is an art for those of us that can still make change for a dollar without a calculator to give us the answer.Best of he Best 10 out of 10 with thimbs up all the way.Worth 3 times the cost easy.

What a way to start...I simply love the story, gameworld and lore of BG. The characters are interestingly written, and superbly voice acted even if unfortunately before era of fully voicing all dialogue. The combat is pausable tactical party based combat, and I've yet to tire of it.If you enjoy RPGs and can handle visually a bit older games (I still rate Infinity Engine fondly, perso), I can only recmmond this wholeheartedly!

												turn the framerate up to 40 or 45 to increase walking speed, google how to set up a char, AND PLAY!! The reason the first games that pulled many of us older  RPG fans from pnp to video games permanantly was final fantasy 2 and 3 was because of the story, party recruiting, and how each party member got legit, emotional back/side stories.  No video game RPG lived up to FF3 (or 6 if your young ) or chrono trigger for me until I played BG 2.  I never played BG1 back in the 90s because I was in college and didn't have my own PC.  By the time I got one in winter 2000, This was out.  Sadly enough despite how hooked i was, I was 21 and the lure of going out and socializing stopped me from ever beating this game.  I got to around chapter 4 and by the time I was ready to game again,  Morrowind was out so I never even bought TOB.   I put 20 something hours into this ee with a premade char just to reminisce.  Still fun!  No quest markers, but since the areas are limited in size and the cursor changes over clickable objects only a few times a screen, they are not needed.  Read the journal, go to the area, click stuff till you find.  we didn't have game wikis if we got stuck back then!  Shoot, I had dialup until 2002!  If you like apgs, crpgs, or played da-o and liked pause and play, try this!  Its like party based diablo with way less loot and way more story!!  I plan on playing thru bg 1, 2 and then tob all at once.  I have some time coming up now that I decided I will NOT be buying Elder Scrolls Online!  MMORPGS are designed to keep you subscribed, not to throw game content at you!  Time Sink with little reward!  I'd rather experience limited static content across multiple games then raid the same dungeons over and over with people I barely like!			"

												As it was on release. The Enhanced Edition is basically the same game, with some more.Baldurs gate is many things:           An obnoxious slice of gaming that highlights what gaming was, to how it is now.           A good look at how D&D and retrogressive consertativatism now travel hand in hand.           A great example of what happens with a cumbersome control system and excessive mechanical choice           How not to outlay game mechanics           Why Bioware is regarded as 'good'If you adore an abusive (rock paper sissors) combat system that requires excessive memory retention and gated combat. This is for you.As someone who has spent over 1k hours playing this game after the originals release. It is really difficult to play now due to the obtuse and ye old school difficulty curve. Eventhough I remember the entirety of the game.Now if you think you could put up with all of this, go for it.A definitative slice of gaming history.Recommended Yes!Do I actually like it now. NO.			"

												Baldur's Gate II, an awesome game.  I have the original disks still.  The only reason I bought it for steam is because the original won't work well with Win7 or Win8 because it was a game written for windows 98.  Sure I could get the old game to work but it would have a hell of a time connecting even via LAN for a game.  I waited for the enhanced version of BG2 to come out thinking that they would not only make it look nicer but fix the bugs and make it run perfect.  That's where I was wrong.  I now can play online.  But no matter who me or my friend play with the game crashes at sequence changes and map changes which ate up 50% of gaming time.  Ghost sessions stay on the server list for as long as 12 hours.  I'm hoping there is an active push to keep fixing this game because if there isn't I wouldn't really suggest getting the game unless you really loved it in single player mode.			"

												Baldur's Gate series brought the computer fantasy RPG genre back to life after the golden era of C64 and Amiga games. The second part of the series was in many ways the paramount game that every other computer RPG was compared to and rare were the ones that managed to nail it as well as this. It is epic, massive, interesting, it has well written NPC characters, romance options and battles. It manages to find good balance between story and battles. Time has taken it's toll on the mechanics a bit, but not too much. It is still very enjoyable game to play although a bit clunky at times. In my opinion the battle mechanics and stats are more enjoyable than in the modern Pillars of Eternity for example, which felt a bit too ""fuzzy"" for me. Here +1 is +1, period :)But in my books, the very best computer RPG of all times is still the masterpiece Planescape: Torment. BG2 is close second.			"

												This is an epic glitchfest, you can't even play multiplayer because of all the crashing and glitches. Just go buy the original because this thing doesn't even run at all, honestly the devs should be ashamed of themselves for even trying to sell this pile of garbage, all they did succesfully here was wreck a great game. The number of glitches I've encountered are just completely out of hand. Druid spells locking up and becoming unusuable after wildshape, summons not unsummoning when you rest, the genie from the first dungeon summoning in duplicates of himself at random times and places even in later chapters, non-host characters becoming a hosts char after dreams, crashing on the map. It's just bad, don't subject yourself to the this pile of crap.			"

												This game was and is one of the most important games of my life, partially because of the age I bumped into it but mostly from its strong writing and amazing storytelling. I try to push this game on friends like Mormons push Mormonism. It is the best game ever made. I don't know how many hours steam says I have on this because I bought it again through steam recently, but I've played at least 200 hours. The character development is the best. The only thing to compare to it was the recent-ish title Undertale. The game changed my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ life. Jaheira is a hottie and according to the books you're supposed to bone her. It's canon. Now buy this game and decide whether to stand by and let them lynch a dark elf or step in and kill some peasants in the name of chaotic good.tl;dr: Gateway drug for D&D, ultimate storytelling game, good for fans of modern-day Bethesda games			"

												Is nostalgia really enough to justify buying a game?The realistic answer is probably, ""No."" You're better off watching a ""Let's Play"" on YouTube. The story is still good, but the mechanics and the bugs just drag the game down.Like any D&D scenario, without a well balanced team, the game will make you mad. Keyboards will be thrown. Forums posts will be typed in all caps. I found myself dying withing the first few seconds of a fight just because I wasn't immune to the spells that were being cast. There's no respec'ing; what's done is done, and there's no going back.For what it's worth though, most of the bugs from the original game were fixed. However, a bunch of new bugs were introduced with the addition of the new content.Play it if you must, but if you're not into playing games for the nostalgia factor, stay clear.			"

												it's a wonderful game with an interesting story that will take weeks of regular play to complete. the spell lists are huge and varied, many unique magical items, some procured through quests (those are usually the best ones, but not always). if you don't mind the dated graphics and, in places, lack of voice acting -- plus if you like to read, there is a lot to read -- very immersive; highly recommended. a classic rpg. and mucho replayability with a diverse array of main character classes and personalized stronghold quests. from a dungeon to a major city, to pocket planes, to more dungeons and wilderness settings, the underdark, an underwater city, dragons' lairs, liches' crypts, a tree-top city, a sanitarium, to a layer of Hell itself -- this game has got it all!

												A classis isometric cRPG. My favourite one at that. Involving plot (at least on SoA part), good and memorable characters, good interractions with the world and characters, a great ammount of spells and items to play with. Also, very great replay value.Enhanced Edition adds some nice content (and more than in BG1:EE). This is especially  visible in ToB part of the game, when plot becomes very linear, so new quests, items and interractions are very welcome. I must say however, that writing style in new content is different from original and it is visible.From technical things, the game crashed on me few times and there are some small bugs and inconsistences in abillities description and how they work. Generally, I always had good time with BG2, and I think I still will.  Recommended for cRPG fans.			"

												Baldur's Gate was one of my favorite childhood games. In between I and II, I played Divinity: Original Sin. I'm now struggling to enjoy Baldur's Gate II.As far as role-playing games go, it delivers quite a bit of story content and can't be criticized on that front. It's a messy game, though--graphics, menus, icons, etc. Which is a damn shame because it's wreaking havoc on both the immersion and the gameplay for me. I'm not terribly sympathetic, as there are no limitations behind this.I'm likely to keep playing (for now) because it's a blast to the past. If you want a game like Baldur's Gate and don't have any nostalgic reasons for playing, though, just buy Original Sin.			"

												Soooooooo I have not played my favorite game of all time in  a while. Tonight I thought it could be fun to mess around with it and saw alot of negative reviews for the new patch. They have made some changes, some of them are good. I went a specialist mage (something I don't usually do) and thought the changes there were good, bonuses for casting spells from your school and so forth. I thought that was pretty cool.However when your chooosing things what is up with the red bar.... the original interface was very good why change it? And then in game there is this black outline around the characters now....uuuuh wth?I still recommend the game becausse well its baldurs gate but they need to not change what is already good. A few tweaks (such as they aforementioned adding a bonus for casting a spell from your chosing school) makes sense. It adds to the game.Changing the interface whn your choosing you character does not add to the game it makes you stare at a annpying red bar. Putting a black line around the characters in game does not add to the game. It makes it difficult to keep playing.Get it? Got it? CHANGE IT PLEASE.			"

												Put simply, this is by far the best western RPG I have ever playedBaldur's Gate 2 is the sequel to, surprisingly enough, Baldur's Gate. This game fixes many of the problems the first suffered from, eliminating those obnoxious huge wilderness areas that had to be explored completely if you wanted any sidequests at all. Some companions from 1 also return in 2, those being Minsc, Jaheria, Imoen, Viconia, and Edwin. The early game of 1 was fairly tedious, not only because of your weapons breaking if you so much as looked at them funny, but because of the incredibly painful low-level D&D combat that only gives mages 2 spells and takes 2 minutes to kill a rat. The combat is difficult in this game, but very fleshed out and you have an incredible number of options when it comes to gear and how you build your party. The central city of Athkatla is absolutely huge, being the best ""central city"" I have seen in a game so far. Exciting things happen in each and every area of Athkatla, giving you so many objective you may feel overloaded with quests. Baldur's Gate 2 has many mechanics that were great but never seemed to stick to RPG's that followed it. When a characters joins your party because they want help, if they do not get it fast enough, they will leave. Characters have many interactions between each other in this game, and many of them are unique and only happen once, unlike Baldur's Gate 1 where each companion had 1 interaction line and said constantly. Perhaps the most important part of the game is the quests. Baldur's Gate 2 collectively has the best sidequests I have seen in a game. Each one feels meaningful and significant, no mindless fetching. None of the quests drag either, each being finishable in about 1-2 hours, which means you can start a playing session, feel you've accomplished something every time, and go do something else after you've stopped. The quests are not hard to find, with the people who wish to give you work basically forcing themselves down your throat everywhere you walk, which means that a pleasant stroll through the city will likely result in you having a few new jobs each time and sometimes even an entire new companion.The story is good, it is unique and compelling, if not terrifically written. This game recaps the events of Baldur's Gate 1 terrifically, with out saying ""This is what happened in Baldur's Gate"" it seamlessly explains the backstory throughout the course of the game, and you feel as if you were just learning about it naturally. Perhaps the only thing this game did wrong was introduce romances to the RPG world, which resulted in Bioware taking a turn down the path of questionable dating sims with mediocre gameplay that people praise as original.Basically, this game is great, get it			"

But this Enhanced Edition knocked it out of the park. Not only were a number of bugs and minor glitches fixed, many of the fights have become more challenging than they were originally. Some encounters also seem to have different options available. The new NPCs are not only interesting but have good story lines to support their inclusion. In my humble opinion, any fan of the Balder's Gate games will enjoy the Enhanced Edition.			"

It unfortunately contains many (annoying) oversights, such as when you go from the world map to the area map, it zooms out again from the regular overview as if you just clicked on the area map from the regular overview.Picking items up also retains their respective position to your mouse cursor, but afterward your mouse cursor is leading for when you want to deposit them: very annoying!Also several new bugs entered the game, including gamebreaking ones preventing you from playing certain classes etc.Overall, however, if they do not wait too long to fix their newly implemented issues, I think the update improved the game.

												The original Baldur's Gate II is one of my favourite games of all time. A huge world with plenty of engaging characters, tough challenges, great dialogue, and tonnes of replayability. It's a game I've played once or twice a year since I first bought it ten years ago. This Enhanced Edition is a mostly improved version of that game, so of course I recommend it to anyone looking for a great game. The game has been improved graphically, multiplayer has been modernized, and extra content has been added. The additional content mostly matches the feel of the original Baldur's Gate, and anything that you don't like is easily ignored.  Generally speaking, bugs have been fixed, though there are still some minor ones present. Bugs are going to be present in any version of Baldur's Gate due to all of the complexity and variables. Fortunately, Beamdog is still releasing patches to fix what they can. Most of the mods for Baldur's Gate have been updated to work with the Enhanced Edition as well, so there's very little reason to play the original over the Enhanced Editions.Basically, get this game. And Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, obviously, because why would you want to start with 2?			"

												I'm surprised at the amount of bugsDon't misunderstand me, I am not shouting in anger when I say that. But I find the number of bugs I have come across in this game to be glaring. Five times, NPC's haven't shown up, or are in dialogue loops that require me to google fixes, and then I have to use the CLUA console to fix it.To say I am also disapointed at this would be an understatement. I don't imagine I'll bother playing through the EE versions again after this runthrough. And I have gone through these series multiple times.I guess I should have expected it. After all I bought BG:EE on the day it came out, hoping to play multiplayer and found that it was a borderline travesty. As in, something that had been working for thirteen(?) years was now broken. I guess I should have known that Overhaul Games isn't quite ready for something this big.Some bugs I've run into(no where near all):Dorn constantly repeating himself when I go to do his first quest(Endless speaking)The spirit at the cabin not showing up after doing the first quest in the ranger strongholdThe mother not spawning in trademeet for the second tanner/skinner questIn the planar prison, Renias(sp) and half the troop not spawning so I couldn't even teleport outAfter leaving the Underdark, anytime I open Viconia's inventory, the game crashes to desktopHexxat's quest bugged out and refused to take me back from one of her Tomb Excursions. Nothing would happen, everything just sat thereThe new NPC's are well written and fit seamlessly... when they work right.Bottomline, breaking a game that previously didn't have breaks in it, is a serious issue. And unless you know how to work the CLUA console, are willing to reload from saves MANY hours old and replay areas you already did, I can NOT recommend this in it's current state.I've finished this series multiple times, and if this is your first time, do yourself a favor, go to GOG.com and pick up the whole Baldur's Gate series for less money, less issues and NO DRM.

												The granddaddy of the Classic RPG genre, and an inspiration to all other future RPGS. A culmulative masterpiece of story, adventre, action, strategy, tactics, romance, immersion, and high fantasy excellence. If you are a fan of any RPG game i strongly urge you to give this game a go! For the price you pay, the level of detail and love that has gone into creating Baldur's Gate 2 is unreal. You will be easily immersed for hundreds of hours! The enhanced eddition allows this game to be born again into the modern era of gaming, adding a much needed facelift to the graphics engine, improved multiplayer support, streamlined statistics, and some nice quality of life changes to help newcomers get over the hurdles of the 2nd edition AD&D ruleset which can be overwhelming at first. Not to mention the additions of new playable classes, new NPC compainions, whole new areas to explore, and added voice dialogues.			"

												I don't know what happened to this game. I played it when it first came out and didn't have any complaints. I was getting bored with skyrim and decided to try it again and it is really messed up. Now when I go to pirate isle and go through spellhold, and get the horn for SAEMON and go to meet him on the dock, he isn't there. This messes up the rest of the game. If you can't go with Saemon to the Saugin, you miss out on the silver sword,the wave blade, the cloak of reflection, and the cloak of protection +2. It's a mess. If tou are thinking of buying this, don't waste your money and if they handle the new espansion pack as badly, I don't think I'll waste my time with it either.			"

												Baldur's Gate 2 received a good update compared to the original game. It's not such a big update compared to a modded version of the game, but that's the point, it stays true to the original and only improves on where the game lost strength in time. There is new content, there is interface scaling, there is native widescreen support and there is support (the game receives updates).Although I have not experimented heavily with mods I think this version (the enhanced edition) is better than what you get if you mod the classic game. Cloud saves are also a big advantage. The game runs fine, the zoom function is good, the new rendering abilities of the engine are nice (compared to the old version) and loadings are instantaneous (if you played the original you remember the long lasting circular loading screen, it's completely gone).I don't know why this game received so much hate, the original Baldur's Gate 2 is the best western RPG ever made, and this update makes it a viable choice in 2016, especially if you never played it before. The learning curve is steep and you'd have to either read the manual, or watch tutorials on youtube, but once you do that, the gameplay is as good as any game today.			"

												Played this game since the first release way back in the day.The characters are remarkable and numerous, each with a side quest, and the dialog is very well written. At times you will get random party banter, and some of these are hilarious. Certain quests have unique responses, that allow you to be a righeous hero, or a snarky a-hole. There is no set party, and you can recruit any characters you desire to aid you in your quest. Be warned that there is a reputation system and evil characters won't tolerate you being a goody two-shoes, and good characters won't stand by while you punch babies.The pathing is still bad, as well as the combat A.I., and if your casters are set to auto-attack they will sometimes interrupt their own spells. The A.I. can be turned on and off with simply pressing the 'A' key, though.This game does require some strategy for higher level fights, and you can't just wade in with your two-hander and expect results, unless that result is a dead party member. The learning curve isn't too sharp, with the starting dungeon teaching you the basics of the game.There is no real linear path to follow, and many side quests and areas to explore. You can blitz through the main  quest line, or do side areas to gear up and explore the area of Baldur's Gate.			"

												Despite going through some growing pains, the new version is overwhelmingly an improvement over the original. The visual changes that people are complaining about are all completely optional, so fans can pick and choose them as they want, which is nice.The interface isn't quite there yet, but the original was beyond awkward and clunky - there are better ways to display all of that second edition info! It's obvious that people hold classics from the past close to their heart but clunky UI design just doesn't hold up today, and it's possible to do better. People don't like change, and it's ridiculous to hold up the old design as something of a good implementation.The actual core game is obviously still super amazing.			"

												Speeking as someone who has put over 100 hours into this game, playing both before and after the recent patch, I can say that I don't get the hate for the patched version. People complain about the UI, but the old was clunky and hard to navigate as well, and you had to constantly go to the journal and then back to the map, journal to map, journal to map, while now, while you need to scroll a lot, at least you can control yor party while knowing what the @@@k you're doing. And the graphics update is completely optional, you can change them in settings, for example. All the haters just want to dump on something and this is a target because of a recent OPTIONAL expansion, which shoehorned in SJW crap. So the changes in patch 2.00 don't impact the game in a negative way in my personal opnion.			"

												What i see here is Complete BS, all this tryhard fans whinning about UI Changes and that they hold your hand , WELL NO♥♥♥♥♥♥ you see day by day how stupid and ignorant ppl are EVEN NOW (ALL THE TRYHARD FANS).OFC they change the UI and stuff so more ppl (not rly intelligent ones) buy it and recommend it to their friends (that most likely arent much more intelligent aswell)  Because not every human being is on  the same intellectual level and thus the Ui changes so the player had a hand to garb on.AND SRSLY?? i dont see any Gameplay changes so far , and the Map zoom out is for me a cool adition and makes the game more fitting and attractive for younger generations that are looking more on graphic then on gameplay (like buying a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and just stare at her)THis game is still as beatiful as it is and i still love the living ♥♥♥♥ out of this game.And just because Beamdog Trys to get more attention on their game for the profit , WELL WHY ELSE WOULD THEY BUY A OLD GAME????I see alot of ppl who say they do not respect what Bladurs Gate is and the Devs. of it.Aha and why??? because they made some changes on the ui and stuff so ppl dont play 1 hour and throw it away?The game is still hard , the story is the same and the Atmosphere might kinda Changed , but hey guys, pssssh, go under settings , and then nder beta options , and then u find the EARLIER PATCHES!And tbh i can take no one of this diehard fans srsly.Hell im one of the new Generation , maybe not that new cuz i remember my Nitendo64 as my first console , but STILL pretty young. and for my persepctive this game is a rare gem of the Past , buried out , and polished so the new world that missed the game can yet again see its glory. its one of the best games i have ever played even if its old , its all so well thought.ANd i played this game before Beamdog got it (thanks to my uncle) and thats why im sure of , that there no gameplay changes (maybe i was to young at that point and time to fully understand the mechanics an such) besides the UIBUT QUESS WHAT , I DONT WANT TO STAND STILL AND SWING MY CURSOUR AROUND EVERY ROOM FOR 2 MINUTES JUST SO IM SURE OFF I OPEND EVERY CHEST AND DIDNT MISS ANY.this♥♥♥♥♥♥pissed me off when i played the original and im glad they changed it.And at all thats my opinion about the reviews and the game itself , wrriten in bad engrisch (hue) and Awfull to non exsistent grammar.

												The continuation of the series of the Baldurs' Gate franchise. In my opinion this ""second part"" of the game loses its way a little, the world gets bigger, the storyline gets a little wonky and the plot becomes a LOT more linear - especially with the Throne of Bhaal part. The Enhanced Edition is a gigantic improvement over the original with a lot of new features, characters, and plotlines. It's fun and a great ending to the Baldurs Gate series, which is considered by many to be ""THE"" definitive computer isometric RPG. 8/10 - recommended, bonus points for nostalgia of the original , which came out in 2001.

												Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition is a visually rather simplistic, relatively old RPG. Now why should it be critically acclaimed as one of the best RPGs of all time, and already is?--It gives flexibility. You don't have to grind the main plot right away, there are sidequests, especially in SoA.--Character development. During my run, I felt a strong connection to all the characters, especially your romance options.--New characters. They may not exactly fit (per se) in the plot development, they add a bit of a flare to the story.--Amazing music. Yeah, this isn't a ""Great Soundtrack"" game. I know. However, the soundtracks to this game is SO DARN AMAZING! My favorite music (personally) is the music that comes up when you fight Irenicus.In conclusion, Baldur's Gate II is an amazing game, filling the requirements of what all RPGs should and goes beyond.

This game has alot of depth chances are you will restart the game more then once to make a character you like, the weapons are limited (in the sense that proficency dictates what weapon which character can use) so a bit of planning is required as to what you want to use and which characters can use what. It is easily one of the funniest games i've played legit hit 60 hours in like 5 days and normaly im a pretty casual gamer this game has me hooked can't believe it was made in the 2000s one of the most legit rpgs defs worth $20, easily 100+ hours of good gameplay, if things get difficult feel free to whip out a guide as what to do next sometimes you'll realise there is some awesome gear your missing out on that you could easily get to make a op char :) heaps of fun 9.5/10			"

												The game is one of the originals, at its best. One of the Godfathers of RPGs. It is not a game you can just jump right in and play. It may seem too much for newcomers, but if you stick with it, you will be rewarded with one of the best games ever created (gameplay & storyline).I've ignored all of the new comments about a new UI. The changes are so minimal it is petty to even complain. Some good changes, some bad.			"

												When I played this game as a kid, I was awful at it. I learned how to cheat, but even that could hardly cover just how little I understood how the game functions. I'm in college now, and I still think about those first times I played Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn. Instead of focusing on the story, which I liked, or the awesome stuff I would find, or cheat for, I thought I should focus on what made me play the game again and again:Minsc.My introduction to Minsc was in Irenicus' dungeon. As we explored said dungeon, I enjoyed his quirky, funny style of thought and speech. Throughout the game, I grew to love his style. I absolutely enjoyed having him in my party, because he was quite a character. I reached the end of Shadows of Amn, eventually. Since Throne of Baal was not even a thing at that point, I started a new game. This time, I wanted to play as  an evil character. My intention was to horde and dish out vengence on whoever I jolly well pleased to. What I failed to realize at the start was that that would involve losing Minsc.Instead of getting to listen to his hilarious speaches about goodness, buttkicking, and hamsters, I was instead subjected to stern, angry lectures about my actions. Eventually, Minsc left my party. I found others who could fill the role of meat shield, but no one could fill the role of ""Minsc."" No one had the same level of energy and enthusiasm for ANYTHING. A couple of the evil choices I would have to make as an evil character  also rubbed me wrong. Remember, I was a child at the time. So I abandoned that character.I played as a good character mostly so I could keep Minsc. Having been the subject of his scorn, I started to seek his praise. I played as different classes again and again, and I continued to zealously court Minsc's favor. Looking back, I can see how much of an impact Minsc had on my development, and how I treat morality in video games. At some point, I internalized a number of Minsc's battlecries and sayings, and started playing as the good guy no matter the game. I played as the good guy because in the back of my mind was ""this will allow me to keep Minsc.""I've since developed other reasons for nearly always doing good, but Minsc is still there, somewhere, in the back of my mind. The sting of his disapproval, and the happiness at seeing this strong character devote himself to goodness and justice. Did I idolize that about him? Absolutely. Do I still recall him fondly? Fondly enough to by a digital copy of the game so I can be with my idol and mentor again.Baldur's Gate 2 didn't have much of an impact on me as an impressionable child. Minsc did.Game contains Minsc. (11/10)			"

												This game is in mine opinion the best RPG game ever made even in compare to to day RPG games. The question is, if the enhanced edition is worth a buy. I think it is eve if you already got BG 2. New companions are worse than old, but they got a lot of new quests and the number of little things upgraded is just great.			"

												Despite working with great material, Beamdog manages to fall miles away from the mark of producing a stellar remake of Baldur's Gate 2. The sheer amount of gamebreaking bugs alongside with the low quality of 'additional new content' just don't make it worthwhile to buy this game. Instead of watching this performance by Beamdog the Understudy, it's just as well to buy the original on Steam or GOG and giving that a go- you'll spare yourself from a lot of grief, exceptionally bad voice acting and a myriad of bugs to choke an Otyugh.

												Too old to be considered anything positive....might have been good for its time but it is FAR past that point. For the  little time I put into this game, there was not much to cling onto right away.  Very clunky feeling as well as extremly slow paced with very boring fighting tactics and a combat system that is way out of date. Aside from that, the game crashed 5-7 times during the 1.5 hr of play-time my friends and I had, therefore, its not good for multiplayer.  I would suggest Pillars of Eternity due to it being more of an updated game in a similar genre even though it is only a single player game.			"

												Highy recommended. Beamdog didn't change a whole lot in their re-release other than graphic upgrades and new NPC's, but what they did change actually improved the game quite a bit. A lot of the tweak packs of the last decade have been incorporated, with ui improvements that are upgrades that don't over-simplify a game that really shines due to it's complexity.If you have never played BG before, this is the ultimate in PC western fantasy based RPGS. An incredible game and a stunning example of what the genre used to be before modern gaming turned the genre into a series of ""chase after the quest marker"" and ridiculously simple talent trees. Make a mage or sorcerer or recruit some for your team and have a blast.			"

												This is merely here to try and get some attention, a proper review will be in it's place eventually.Update 2.0 seems to have ruined some stuff, many bugs and unhappy customers.There is the option to opt back down to version 1.3. and play the game before the update.Though, while not an issue for Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, BGII:EE seems to be having issueseven with 1.3. Unable to start a new game, instant crash.Do hold off on purchasing until they address these issues. I have confidence that they'll fix it up, though I suspecta bit more heartache along the way.Aside from that though, the game is totally ♥♥♥♥ing baller and awesome.			"

I know my hours don't reflect it on this account ... but I really enjoy all the enhancements. :) The team has done a great job at cleaning up bugs, enchaning the UI and the new graphics for the characters are fluid enough. Definitely give this game a shot, the game does have some minor changes to the story but nothing that will ruin or detract from the original. If you really are concerned with the new additions, head on over to GOG to get the original. All in all, a really fun game regardless of which version you choose.			"

												Nostalgia made me return to The Forgotten Realms, and I am glad I did.I am going to review in 2 parts, firstly up until the v2 update and then a small part dealing with that update.Firstly the pre v2 Enhanced Edition was all that I remembered and more from completing the original game several times when it was first released. The new graphics etc refreshing the original really well. If you haven't played the originals, this (and BG 1 EE) is the place to start, if you did and just want to revisit without having to add several mods to make the originals playable again I would recommend to buy these Enhanced Editions. You can generally pick them up in sales for between £4 and £6 making them not too expensive either.The story is, as it always was very strong, but most of all it is the companions who travel with you who steal the show. Get the right combination of characters who bounce off/argue with each other adds a real depth only really found in Dragon Age, and maybe Mass Effect. "

												bg 2 was my first rpg back in 2006, so i know about this game LIKE A LOT and i couldn't miss enhanced edition.well, for me bg ee 2 has some flaws (mostly because it's new weird tab-oriented engine had some conflicts with my old laptop) but in general i actually liked it.all new characters are nice and mostly usefull. finally we have a true thief, not dual class, not multiclass, not protagonist and not betrayer. neera and dorn are pretty cool too. rasaad... well, having a monk in your party is sort of a challenge! :Dand all the new characters have long and interesting personal quests, so that is great addition to the well-known plot. the second part is so much better than bg ee 1 (especially bg ee 1's russian version, that one was a NIGHTMARE FULL OF CRASHES, LACK OF LOCALISATION AND HATRED). so if you doubt about trying that game — don't be. ( if you are from russia maybe you should hurry up while russian localisation didn't came and destroyed everything). oh and another important moment for russians: YOU CAN HAVE A BEAR IN YOUR PARTY IN THIS GAME.and if you're lucky and have less old pc than mine you probably will enjoy the game without any lags at all! or not.

												Rating: 9/10IF YOU BUY THIS GAME DO NOT KEEP YOSHIMO(it's a spoiler if I tell you why). Yes, he's a really awesome pure thief. Still not worth it.Overall: I really like this game. I have fond memories watching Baldur's Gate II over my dad's shoulder. So, there is some nostalgia involved for me. In short, I'm biased. Baldur's Gate II is tied to the original(as in you can import your character), which I recommend over-and-above the sequel. BGII is an old-style D&D videogame. Reading is required, and pausing the game to issue commands is a core part of combat, especially if you are fielding spellcasters of some sort. I have started the game multiple times, and recommend looking at all the classes' abilities before you exit character creation. You do have to save a lot in this game. The auto-save system isn't that good.Plot: Fairly decent. The political intruigue of Baldur's Gate I was more enganging to me. In this game you chase an egocentric, manipulative, creepy, evil wizard who made your life miserable and abused your sister to hell.Bugs: At worst, a quest may not trigger properly, and you have to load to five minutes ago. This game runs fairly smoothly, bug-wise.Difficulty: It's unforgiving at times, and you may have to load again and again or save constantly fighting a monster with an immunity to all but one of your party members' spells or a particularly difficult enemy group. The difficulty is adjustible from 'being handed to you' to 'the game mercilesslessly laughs as you are slaugthered by a +1 skeleton'(or something to that effect). I play on the 'core rules' setting, which is, more or less, 'veteran', but easier than 'hard' or 'legacy of bhaal'(insane).Graphics: The graphics are horrible. Don't buy this game if you need amazing visuals. The scenery, however, is rather pretty, especially outdoor forests and water. This is not a graphicially demanding game. You will not lag on this game unless you magic missile from every party member who you built as a mage/sorceror. There may be slight 'lag' when fighting one of the dragons. They are seperate fights, and are at the end of dungeons. I haven't had the game crash, ever.UI: It's a mini-menu popup system there are numerous menus, from 'map' to 'journal' to 'inventory'. There are others. The UI was redesigned. Fans of the old system(which I agree looked better) did not like that. I like the clean, new interface. If you want the classic interface, sorry, it was scrapped. If you don't care, then this is a non-issue.Party System: If you are playing normally and not 'hosting' an 'online' game and playing with a party you build yourself(which you can do, that's completely vaild, the interjections by BioWare NPCs serves to freshen the otherwise semi-stale dialogue), there is a single ""Playerchar"", and five extra NPCs. Banter and other random quest interjections makes the game a lot better. While it is realalistic, I don't like it that party members, even if you support them, will leave if your party reputation goes to the extremes. 1 and 0 are super-evil, 19 and 20 are super-good. Evil characters leave if you go above 18. Good characters leave if you go below 2. Neutral characters don't leave. The most interesting characters are good or evil, in my opinion. Also, certain party members, if left together for long enough, will try to kill each-other. The game does not have a modular system like mass effect, it's more of a 'team selection' mechanic. If you want to change your party, you have to re-find the character in question. Also, since this is a D&D game, levelling is important and shapes your character. Characters outside your party auto-level. The auto-levelling system in the game is insane, and makes stupid choices. It's best to find your five, and stick with them. I would recommend looking online at the party members and making it a priority to run around the world and find them as soon as possible.Note on 'romance' system. Thre three original 'romance' options for a male character will get into verbal cat-fights over him. If this annoys you, you either have to deal with it, or only have one of them in the party at a time. Also, these three are the best NPC healers in the game. If you want multiple healers, and play as a dude, do it yourself, or put up with the snit-fest. Female player characters do not have this issue. However, they're stuck with a traumatized gooody-two-shoes fighter-cleric(likable if you can get past the arrogance).Summary of my experience: (below)I created a Paladin a game ago.He's amassed 20,000 coins to bribe the theives' guild four timesHe has freed Imoen three timesHe has cleared the underdark three timesHe's failed Viconia's romance onceHe still hasn't finished the game.

												If you have the feeling that Dungeons and Dragons is to Tolkien fantasy what He-Man is to Star Wars, you can buy this game to find out that yes, the reasons you never tried D&D are all valid. It's a bit like playing Dragon Age: Origins without the feeling that there will be a rewarding RPG experience after these tedious battles. And with far uglier battles. And plastic toys instead of characters. There seem to be strong empiric evidence that many hours of exposure to this game risk making you both addicted and severly delusional about it's content. I stopped playing after an hour to avoid these symptoms.			"

												Beamdog have done a phenomenal job with their enhanced version of this beloved classic.  It's all the original BG2 goodness, with some great quality of life improvements and new content added in.  I was a little worried about the new content (new characters + quests) not fitting in to the original game, but Beamdog did a great job both with the voice acting and production quality, so it fits pretty seamlessly into the overall package.I like how this bundles both Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal together in a digital package, so no more annoying disc swapping like from the old school days.  Baldur's Gate 2 is my absolute favorite game of all time and even after 15 years it still holds up (not the graphics, but definitely the story, gameplay, and characters).  Even now, I still get the urge to play this game every few years and it's always a total blast and shot of nostalgia (in fact, I just finished my latest playthrough yesterday, and am about to start a second today!)11/10 would completely recommend, both Bioware's original game and Beamdog's enhanced version.  Baldur's Gate 2 is the pinnacle of RPGs and you can't call yourself an RPGer without experiencing this classic.			"

												TL;DR: This is the definitive RPG, and my most favorite game. Ever. Buy it now. Story: 5/5 You are the mortal progeny of Bhaal, the deceased god of Murder. I think you can assume awesomeness will follow.Characters: 5/5Memorable characters abound here. From Minsc (and Boo) the loveable fool of a Ranger desperate to do good in the world, to Viconia the damaged Drow desperately trying to survive in the overworld. CHARACTERS CAN DIE PERMANANTLY. SAVE OFTEN.Romance: 4/5If you're a playing a female, there's not much variety. That being said, male characters can romance Viconia, Jaheira, and Aerie (and.....Neera). All of the Romances have depth and feel meaningful. It isn't give a gift, get laid, romance over.Combat: 5/5Strategic use of spells, abilities, and careful planning will be your only saving grace. This is a difficult game. I suppose it's a mix of real time strategy and action rpgs. REMEMBER, THIS GAME IS F**KING HARD. DON'T B**CH ABOUT IT ON THE FORUMS!!!Gameplay: 5/5Absolutely solid. No nonsense. The EE ironed out any bugs (so far as I've encountered) with dialogue. You should'nt encounter any bugs or glitches, definatly not any game-breaking ones. Music: 5/5Perfect in every way. Works for every situation, nothing feels out of place or silly. And that opening is just sweet! BUHBUH BUNBUN BAHBAHMy most favorite game ever, now updated, and with better multiplayer. F**k yeah I bought this. "

												I really don't care what people say about this game, it's one of the best things I've ever played. The vanilla game itself is fantastic, as is all the new content they've added in (Dorn bby), and aside from said content, nothing has changed about this game, despite how many people are acting like it did.Seems like all anyone has to complain about is the fact that the UI changed, which is such a nitpicky argument. I personally like the graphical changes that were made to the game, but if you don't, you can disable these features. Furthermore, none of this makes the game unplayable. It's the same freaking amazing game.TL;DR Screw the haters, grab this title.			"

												Got off a friend's recommendation but NPCs are obnoxious and perfect archetypes for their race/class and AI sucks♥♥♥♥♥(they won't even auto-attack properly and stack behind each other instead of going around).It will probably be better once I start playing with another human but controlling 4+ characters is both aggravating and impossible.

												I can't recommend this game except to the hardcore D&D fans who are familiar with all spells, etc.   The problem with games like this that start at higher levels is the overwhelming number of options you have.   A high degree of micromanagement is required.   I've read that the story is meant to be great but that must come later in the game because I am yet to see anything that special unlike Pillars of Eternity which grabs you from the beginning.I've tried to pick it up a couple of times but find it a bit of a chore and am just not compelled to keep playing.

												Don't be deceived by ""enhanced edition"".  This is a great game in a pathetic release.You should just give me the budget for the game next time and I'll get some modders together and do a better job, and ive never even made a videogame.What I would have done:-improve the interface, its old and confusing, make it easier to navigate and understand-fix the inventory filling up with garbage too easily, and inventory management which just slows down the fun-graphics options:  resolution, various filters like anti-aliasing, 2xsai, sharpening, bloom, hdr, etc..-i would have diverted all resources away from producing new content and devoted it to improving the original release-found the original graphics assets and convert them to higher quality versions-touch up the original graphics assets to improve their quality, at minimum improve all character sprites			"

												It's still good. Minsc is still Minsc and that's what really matters....The new look smooths the edges of the old timey pixilation, and it runs pretty much the same.They added a few classes (which are in no way new to the game or genre) & new dual combos etc., the quest journal is clunkier but you'll get the hang of it.Oh, easy got very easy- try a harder setting like core rules to begin with, especially if you're running with a party.I played these games when they came out (tabletop too) and the update is fine, good even. People like to flip out about stuff but no need to worry. Its just as old, slow and methodical as ever which is the part of the mellow, soothing, sentimental experience of playing elderly games. Someone likely has a heart attack everytime they see new Risk pieces too but you don't need to join them if you don't wanna. You can play a game and have fun with it - I believe in you!			"

												I found this an extremely hard game to get into. There is no tutorial and it took me hours to figure out, not how to play it, but what the whole point of it was exactly. I stuck with it and eventually I saw what all the hoopla was about. If you like turn-based role-play adventure, this game is king. But you have to adjust a setting or two to make it truly turn-based in the first place! And of course, you have to discover that on your own. Among other things...			"

												This game was frustrating beyond belief! I bought this game to play it with some friends online, but on every cutscene the game crashed and we spent more time trying to figure out how to make the multiplayer option stable than actually playing the game. My friends are higly skilled in making bugg-ridden games work in multiplayer mode, but even they had to surrender in the face of this buginfested piece of dragondroppings, i hope that someday a true updated version of this classic game is released. The fact that a game with such a dysfunctional multiplayermode is even released, is nothing short of scandalous. Stay far away from this one.			"

												""Personally, I have been playing Baldur's Gate II in its original format for years but could not afford to purchase the 'Throne of Bhaal' expansion set to keep the game going. When the enhanced edition came out on Steam, my excitement for the revamped version has been at an all-time high. However, I began to notice differences in the game.""When I used to have my iPad Mini 2 and using my tablet to purchase BG 1 and 2, I have been disappointed to notice that I needed to spend my real-life money to purchase the newly-added characters and additional character portraits. After selling the tablet to my Dad who in turn gave it to his grandson, I wasted a good amount of my money on the purchases.""This year, when I purchased my MacBook Pro, I noticed the enhanced editions of BG 1 and 2 can be purchased and downloaded from off the App Store. After giving those games a second chance, I thought I needed to buy all the new characters and added character portraits just like last time. While going through my newly added games, I have been amazed to see EVERYTHING new about the enhanced editions have been covered.""Looking back, I regret wasting my time on BG 1 and 2 before getting my newest laptop. Bottom line, be careful what you are purchasing.""			"

												Notice how every review is either old fans that love it, or old fans that think the updates ruined it?If you have never played any Baldur's Gate game before, do not bother buying Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition.  It's not about the story, it's about learning curve.  There is no tutorial or instructions, and this game really needs one.  Apparently the original games did have tutorials, not the case with BG2:EE.  Perhaps if you're well versed in AD&D it will be a bit more forgiving.Also the combat system is really wonky and not very enjoyable.  It's real-time, but with the expectation that you continously pause it to issue commands to your party (there are auto-pause features).			"

												NO! NO! NO! NO! DO NOT BUY! Ok now that I have calmed down, let me explain. I recieved this game as a gift and thought I might as well play it. I had a multiplayer session with other people. We spent about 10 minutes in the character generation screen creating our characters before the session timed out. That was the best part of the game. We tried multiple times, but it kept timing out or dropping people from the session or even needing a computer restart. When we finally got a game started after spending over an hour in the game without even playing it, we found very low quality graphics (don't worry we weren't expecting good graphics in the first place, just thought I'd metion it) and a very confusing inventory and combat system. We spent another 30 mintues mucking around with the very first battle. After finally getting through it and figuring out the inventory system, we lost a player due to his inability to move his character and decided to end the confusing game. Overall, the game's character generation is the best part, and even that is only ok.			"

												I know there's a lot of manchildren whining about how the new UI ruined Baldur's Gate.While the UI update was definitely jarring to me and I haven't played as much Baldur's Gate as I used to (usually because the in-game music always sucked imo and I liked replacing it with TSFH, but it crashes the game every time it's minimized now), the fact there's a difficulty for babies like me that suck at games of this nature is certainly welcoming. It's still Baldur's Gate, with the story I fell in love with a long time ago. I can work around the interface and learn it again. The contrast between the original story and the Beamdog additions is pretty obvious, but not on the same level as Metroid Prime or any of Hideo Kojima's writings. The fact that such a brilliant game is surrounded by such entitled little sh*ts who need everything to remain the same makes me sad to my core, honestly. While you might be better off getting the original version and modding it if you can find it, if you're new to the franchise and/or can't find it in a regular store, this probably won't be hard to get the hang of. As I said earlier, I am a baby, and I managed to relearn the interface pretty damn fast. If you like RPGs, there's still enough of the old Baldur's Gate to recommend this, at least at the moment while it's on special. I would not recommend buying it at full price, being a 20 year old PC RPG being sold at $20.			"

												So First off,  Yes Baldurs gate / Planescape Torment are tied for first place among my all time fav Games,  And im old enough to have played AD&D when it was just AD&D and what knock though just barley as i started playing before i even went to school due to illness.  The Fact is I Love the game still to this dateSO Why the Thumbs Down? a Few ReasonsThe Main Reason However?Baldurs Gate (The original) which can be bought on Gog.com is ... Better for the most part for many reasons I'll list a few quickie reasons1) After 3+ Hours or even before that this game get Buggie Like ... Realy Buggie2) Heck GoG.Com Version MP works better then this games MP3) This game is EZ Mode yeah the hardest differcultys Make this game hard To a point but I can play gog.com play on norm differculty still have problems Legit Challange Differculty4) Lore/Gameplay itself Immersion seems to be NOT as strong in this vs the BG origional I remeber and still run across better fights / NPCS and other things that where More immersive in the game,  Example Assassins trying to kill you / Murderers / Thugs trying to steal things like that.Considering you can get the Origional on Gog.com cheap and its not nearly as buggie and what knock? I rather get that then this .... Provided i could go back in time.			"

												This game is anything but ENHANCED. Wow, it completely SUCKS on a 1080p monitor. Maybe my graphics are messed up, but it looks horrible and I'm kicking myself for wasting money on it.On my 24"" screen it looks absolutely nothing like the misleading video shown in the Steam preview. The graphics absolutely suck and Steam should be ashamed that they are misleading customers like this.I agree that 10 years ago the game was nice, but that was on a 15"" monitor. They didn't enhance it at all for the modern displays, all they did was allow it to fit on a wide screen.			"

												I just wanna see you be brave!5/10 I heard so many great things about this game and watched videos on it and everything, but it was not what i was expecting at all. If you havent played the orginal BG2 (like me) then i strongly recommend you read up about the game and watch videos before hand. I would have been happier if i waited for a sale, It was $28 with tax, that's too much for me. So I'm not saying this is a bad game I'm just saying I didn't have a very good expeirence with it. Pick it up on sale if you can wait.			"

												I never played this game before I purchased it. I had been wanting a good RPG, and I read about how great this series is. So, at 10 bucks, I figured why not give it a try. But, as with Skyrim, Divinity: Original Sin, and others, BG2's interface and mechanics completely turn me off. I don't know what I expected, but I certainly did not expect everything to be so clunky, clicky, and counter-intuitive. I played the first ten minutes and I was completely turned off by the tedious mechanics and by not knowing what is going on (and not being satisfied by the tutorial's explanation of how to do things). I am concluding that I really am a console gamer at heart, and that games like Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy are what I really should be playing instead of these PC RPGs. Sorry, this is just too much dull work. It's too much like non-video game D&Ding, except a lot less fun and a lot more frustrating.			"

If I sound illiterate in this area it is because I am, I see no reason why if I pay for something it should not  just simply work, period.  I just got to the second lvl in ARN 3 characters can lvl up but there are just no points to give them, Identify is memorized but still  cant identify anything.

												If you intend to buy this game keep in mind it is setup like the original Baldurs Gate. I personally preferred the Dark Alliance version and this game is nothing like that. For a Rpg/Strategy game the game holds true but I personally don't recommend it especially if you are not into strategy type Rpgs. Best to not waste your money and keep moving on.			"

												Still the best D&D game. While I personally prefer 3rd edition ruleset for actual gameplay, as a whole BG2 beats all newer D&D games. It's what D&D at it's core should be: party based adventure with a story and just the right amount of certain death for those who are unprepared, too curious or just not paying attention.			"

												By far the best RPG ever. Period.Now that the opening pledge of perpetual love has been declared, we can get down to the gritty of the review. The Baldurs gate series is no longer groundbreaking. Not in graphics, not in sheer scope of content - even though its storyline still is very strong compared to other RPGs out there. It's a solid game, even today some 13 or 16 years after its initial release. The series starts in candlekeep and the protagonist finds himself (or herself) very soon as a haunted individual, then the story pretty much goes from there. The plot, the twists and the mechanics of the game functions very well and even if the graphics are rough they still work. In short its great entertainment for a very reasonable price, keep in mind tho that beamdog hasn't really added much to the series so if you own the original series don't buy unless you're like me - a lover, a fighter - keeping the magic alive at all cost.

												The existence of these Enhanced Editions for classic DND-based rpgs has rekindled an appreciation for what game developers had offered us before the rise of the ""modern"" roleplaying game formulae.  Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn was, for its time, the hands down king of this genre, and it's fantastic to see that it is still getting the attention that it deserves.If you're a younger gamer who didn't have the opportunity to experience BGII in its prime, you may find the style of play a bit stunted, the pause feature and tactical camera a big adjustment to overcome when you consider that modern rpgs have deviated over time from this path.  Once you adjust to the controls, and realize the depth of customization and party compositions that this game offers, as well as its wealth of dungeon crawls and its formidable story, you won't be disappointed with the meager cost of this classic game revamp.  Support this project!  Check out the other EE's too!			"

												This is the best game I have ever played, both original and enhanced edition.  I recommend anyone who truly enjoys crpgs of this quality (few though they are of this generation of gaming) and I recommend this game also, for newbie rpg gamers.  This, and indeed, baldur's gate original game, AND, enhanced edition as well.			"

												Baldur's Gate II rates as my favorite game of all time, which might make this review a little tough to swallow so I'll try to be as unbiased as possible when I say this: This is absolutely a great game...it's just not for everyone. What made the original a classic: the characters, story and dialogue are all here and as good as they ever were, but a clumsy interface and non-obvious mechanics bog down the actual gameplay to a crawl (the manual the original game came with is 263 pages long). If you've never played a CRPG from the 'good old days' you might find BGII incredibly tough to comprehend and a slog to play, but put some effort into trying and you'll be rewarded with a sprawling adventure with space hamsters, rotten nobles and insane sorcerers. The enhanced edition comes with the expansion which ties the whole story up, adds some new party members and new content to play through, which makes this the version to get. Looking for an RPG to sink some time into, then you might want to check Baldurs Gate II out, just know what you're getting into.			"

This feature alone makes the Enhanced Edition the definitive edition.Otherwise, aside from some forgettable extra content, the game is untouched. Graphics are muddy but acceptable. Inventory management a little tedious. Writing and combat top-notch. Basically, Baldur's Gate II remains one of the best RPGs ever.Buy the game during a sale. $25 is absolute, total lunacy.			"

												I finally beat BG 1 EE so I was able to import my toon and test drive this puppy.  The bigger screen is definitely nice, but I do see what some of the other reviewers mean about bugs.  Companion walking AI is even worse than the original.  At times it's like herding freaked out cats.  I have issues where my characters will try to walk right up to an opponent before casting a spell.  NOT fun with something like Fireball.  I felt like I had better control of my party in the original edition.  Having all the extras thrown in is nice though.  I do have to agree with the previous reviewer who said Hexxat's voice acting was flat.  Granted until you complete that first mission for her, she's supposed to be in a trance (close as I want to get to a spoiler), but that could have been sold (acted) better.  After that point her voice acting is a bit better, but I was still bored enough with the character that she got the boot.I'd say the main reason to go with this version vs the old is convenience.  No fussing with mods, etc...  DL and it's done.  If you're good enough at installing mods manually though, you'd be just as happy with the gog version or your old CDs (still have mmine, lol).			"

BG1 and 2 were games I basically stumbled upon as a teenager and played off and on until the Advanced Editions hit stores recently. Exact same game as before, slightly updated, new questlines.. how can you go wrong? Oh right.. Steam and Beamdog multi-player isn't compatible. Be sure to converse with friends before trying to embark on a multi-playthrough or you'll be heartbroken. As I was.			"

												Baldur's Gate II is one of my favorite RPG's of all time, and actually one of my favorites games of all time. I sadly don't see all that many major changes from the Enhanced Edition, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. There was no need to change anything. I'm just thankful for easy compatibilty on modern systems... with the exception of certain glaring bugs, like multiplayer sessions not being able to view cutscenes without someone crashing, particularly chapter transitions.If you like top down, 3rd person tactical combat with an immense number of options and alternatives, this is the game for you. The game can be quite difficult at times, and this only serves to add to the sense of accomplishment after particularly tough battles.Just play it. This is classic RPG gameplay and storytelling at its finest.			"

												It's Baldur's Gate except you get to start with a good level and mages get some cool magics earlyer. Also the enhanced version has a couple new characters, classes and some fixes to the old game mechanics. Looks ok if you don't mind pausing every few seconds to micro manage 6 people and their summons, but there's also a multiplayer. Get a friend or two, make some characters, divide up a few NPC controls and go on an AD&D adventure to stop an evil wizard from stealing your life.			"

												Much like the first game, BG2 is a legendary RPG that continues and resolves the story of the Bhaalspawn saga with the Throne of Bhaal expansion. It offers a potential of hundreds of hours of D&D gameplay and is an incredible game to play if you want to get sucked into a great story. The enhanced edition offers the entire experience in one easy to play package that doesn't require modifying files just to get it to run. If you've never played any of the Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale games before, pick these up. They're must-buy games in my opinion.			"

												Baldur's Gate II was one of the best games of all time. That is considered to be a fact. This Enhanced Edition merely modernizes it, allowing it to work with current operating systems and widescreen resolutions. They did add some minor things to the game, such as a couple of new companions, which I felt were unneeded and superfluous, but they don't detract anything from the game. If you enjoy great stories, D&D, RPGs, or magic then try this game. Even if you don't enjoy any of those things, try this game.			"

												Baldur's Gate 2 is one of the all-time classics, super long and super deep, lots of tactics, lots of plot, often very funny and as dark as you want it. I've come back to it for years and have only just started to wear it out. Personally, I think it's so much better than BG1 that I would recommend new players just skip directly to BG2 (and only complete ToB if they loved the preceding).But being able to play it natively on Linux? Not having to mess with stupid mods for 12 hours just to get widescreen and stop fiddling with CD checks? That's AMAZING. Even for a game I've almost played out over like 20 years, it's well worth it. Anytime somebody brings CRPG content to Linux at a price which isn't totally insane, I want to support that and I'm going to buy it.Yes, the new content is pretty lame. It's not like the original content. But it's something to play, and it doesn't ruin the game. I just ignore it now.			"

												My #1 favorite RPG of all time. Baldur's Gate 2 is a CRPG from 2000-2001, which uses the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition (2.5E really since they introduce kits & high level ""feats"") ruleset, with a real-time twist. The game plays in real-time but can be paused at any point to assign orders, cast spells, or use items, which execute upon unpausing and complete during a combat round.Huge amount of character customization, over 200+ spells, high levels of character advancement, and a ton of items, all with interesting background and stories behind them to really appease the min-maxing crowd.The biggest selling points however, are the characters and storyline. You'll find some of the most unique, interesting, and downright fun NPCs in any game ever. The storyline, which may seem cliched now, makes the struggle with your divinity, much more real, when your divine essence is taken from you by force. Quests are far from straight-forward, with many of them introducing some interesting moral dilemmas. Not to mention the replayability introduced as your party members will chime in with their own thoughts, inter-party banter, and even party member conflicts which will require multiple playthroughs to experience.Finally, there's a modding community working hard to adapt many of the old mods for the new enhanced edition. Thankfully, most of the hardcode in the EE version is the same, and most mods should work fine. Mods can add another 50-100+ hours to this already content-packed game.I can't recommend this game enough. To players who haven't played CRPGs from the 80s-90s, be warned that there is a steep learning curve. But once you overcome it, you'll have one of the most defining experiences in gaming ever.			"

												I used to play this game when it first came out and I loved it so much! I was very excited when I saw I could buy and play it again! So many memories came back to me as I played my way though all the awesome quests, content, and epic battles. Now remember this is an older game so the graphics may not be what they are today so some may find that a negative. One thing I would like to  mention is that if you play the game then want to re play it and import your character it makes the game more difficult. I expected it to be a bit more challenging but not much since the rest of the party wouldn't be as high. My character is a half elven, chaotic good, conjurer mage at level 16 and the rest of the group (Misc, Valgayr (sp?), Jaheira, Nalia, and Viconia) all range between 10-13. I made it to Umar Hills and the shadow dungeon where I found multiple liches waiting. They were quite challenging since the rest weren't that high and my high level is a squishy clothie. Then doing ""Cult of the Eyeless"" quest line I found 3 beholders and 3 gauths in a location that typically had 1 beholder and 1 gauth. So  becareful when importing characters as it may make the game much more difficult then expected. Also when importing characters they don't come with their gear. All my girl had was her high level spells which was handy but the lack of good high level gear made the above fights that much more challenging. All in all I would give it 10/10.			"

It's almost flawless as I ran in a bug right at the end of ToB expansion just before the final battle where there was no option to travel to it from the pocket plane.

Sadly if you've already played the game before, which you likely have if you bought this remastered edition, then you probably remember most if not all of what made it cool. Like, you know, the plot. And the characters, and the plot twists, and everything else.Yeah they added a few new characters and a new place or two, and changed some of the dialogue around, but really in the end it's basically the exact same as it was when it was first released many many years ago. That isn't nessesarily a bad thing because the game is still great, but it really doesn't have a lot going for it to snare in people that were fans of the original.TLDR- If you've never played the Baldurs Gate series before, then you should buy this and play it because it has a deep storyline, compelling characters, and it's fun. If however, like me, you are a returning fan hoping for a more polished product that has had some stuff changed around to make it interesting and 'new' again .. well .. it is a more polished product I'll give it that but the changes to the game are so minimal that you could literally go through the entire thing and never hit *any* of the changed stuff unless you deliberately went out of your way to do so.

												I always end up thinking that I am doing something wrong in these type of games,not leveling correctly,not using my inventory to my advantage and so on,but I always somehow manage to get by.Micro-managing isn't one of my strong points,which is a bit awkward as I am a big fan of RPG's,but that's me all over.Baldur's Gate is just as enjoyable as ever,and I am determined to finish the game,hopefully sometime before I draw my pension.£5 or thereabout's for this game in the sale is a complete steal,it's wonderful,even if you pay full price it is worth every penny for the fun that you have.No real problems with this version although the odd member of my party wanders off on occasions,which can be a bit annoying when you are in the thick of it.Do not listen to the complainers who rated this version down,it's well worth it.

												This game is totally worth playing. It's a game I have played over and over again for few times. Everytime I find in it something new. Take your time and enjoy it... Diffrent companions, diffrent ways to fight, a lot of spells & abilities and items which helps you to gain advantage in fighting.A lot of quests, very interesting storyline. Quite big world to discover, very detailed universum, a lot of books which explain the history, even the artifacts got their own. Beatiful graphics, dialogues between characters, romances, your own castle or mage hideout, a lot of things to do. Beatiful soundtrack and cut-scenes.Only flaws are problems with multiplayer and saving game.You won't get bored!My rate: 9/10Graphics: 9/10Sound: 10/10Storyline: 10/10 "

												Ok, let me preface by saying Neverwinter Nights, the entire series (but NOT the mmo) are my favorite games of all time. I had never played this but I can see where ALOT of the content was rehashed for NWN. The combat does seem dated and a bit clunky, but the game is awsome so far. I am really enjoying this game, and maybe I should have played it long ago, I appreciate NWN much more because of this game. I am in Act II, but I play offline alot so I guess it doesn't update my play time.If your a fan of RPG games, you will not be dissapointed if you enjoy this for what it is, a dated masterpiece. This is a must buy for any RPG fan.			"

												Why is everyone so in love with this game?Because this game isn't actually a game. Its a book. Not just any book, but one of the most well written books of all time. How did they combine a book into a game? They let the gamer choose how the protaganist looks, acts, fights, loves. So in reality they didn't just write one great book, but like 15 of them. and depending on what chocies you make will determine which book you will read.And this game is truely the best book i've ever read. People ask me how can i play this old game the graphics blah blah. I respond to them, i just wanted to reread one of my favorite books ya fool.			"

												Excellent remake of a classic that reinvigorates an appreciation for old-school D&D-based RPGs.  Captivating, original story and characters despite the dated (though appealing in their own way) appearance and mechanics.  Highly recommended for hardcore RPG fans if you can appreciate - or endure - the difficulty and micromanagement.			"

												As a kid the original Baldur's Gate was one of my favorites even though I never had the patience to read through my journal to actually figure out where I was supposed to go. I wasn't able to beat the game until I was in my early teens and that was from spamming spawn monster wands with all of my party members then sat back and watched as Sarevok was mauled by various monsters. It took about 2 minutes for about 50 monsters or so, quite an impressive amount of patience for me. Now that I have a job I can buy my own games and stumbled onto BG2EE after forgetting that I still had the sequel to play. I have over 150 hours invested and I can say without a doubt that my patience hasn't gotten any better.10/10 "

												I liked the first part of this Series... And I like! the second - THIS - paart of the Series. Old, but cool. You play a group Avangers, looking for Treasures, perhaps a romance, and revenge on a sorcerer. Your way leads you through Faerûn. Mainpart is the city of Athkatla in Amn.There, you find old friends, like Imoen, Viconia and Minsc (from BG 1 ) but also new friends like Nalia, Mazzy and Keldorn. And many more. The task is clear: Kill the Wizard, in the dungeon you woke up! After all, it was nice not there ... find him and kicks him in the♥♥♥♥♥ And on your way get cool weapons, exp, and all what you can get...this game is 13 years old, but I still like it. Now with new Charakters. Cool. First, I had the normal BG 2-Game. Than, I get the Dungeons & Dragons - Anthology (Baldur's Gate) version from Amazon (Juni 2013... ) for 25 € and the Dungeons & Dragons - Anthology (Neverwinter Nights) for 25 €. Now I have the BG2 EE... 3rd time, I'm buying BG2. Buy it! this Game is Cool! Come, and become a God !			"

												No words in any language on Earth can adequately describe the greatness that is the Baldur's Gate series. This game is a shining example of what a roleplaying game truly is. A lot of it comes from the fact It is based on 2nd Edition Dungeons & Dragons, and while that edition is particularly confusing to learn, it comes to you pretty fast. Most of the learning curve comes from spells and their interactions, and some unintuitive things like ""lower is better"" for Armor Class, THAC0, and attack speed.The story is one of the best ever written for an RPG, and it is beautifully voiced to boot! The artwork and graphics, while technically dated, hold up incredibly well in this day and age. They give the game a fantastic sense of character that immerses you into the world with ease. Characters in the game are very fleshed out and are full of dialogue that makes the game world feel like a living, breathing place. This is one of the few RPG's where you can actually roleplay. (GASP! , SHOCK!) In fact, the game is practically designed around you roleplaying your character the way that YOU want. For example, it doesn't punish you for playing one alignment or the other, nor does it accomodate playing one alignment over the other. Characters simply react to you appropriately to your alignment vs, their own.To anyone who has played the game before the EE came out, the game is now better than ever.Some very good improvements I've noticed:- Updated UI, much more functional and friendly- Graphics as a whole feel more polished- Revamped spell effects look AWESOME!!- New recruitable party NPC's fit into the world seamlessly, and have very fun side-quests to boot- Brand new areas to explore with fun rewards for doing so(These are only some of the many improvements to the game, there are too many good ones to list here.)This game is an absolute masterpiece. Anyone who enjoys RPG's will fall in love with this game and its previous game (Baldur's Gate) instantly. It is worth every fraction of a cent and more. Ultimately this game deserves your time and you should buy it immediately ;)			"

												It's a great game, works very well on my computer after I had to fix some things behind the scenes... the one thing that truly disappoints me, however, is the fact that there are still some bugs in it. The most obvious and annoying one is the fact that the voices are rarely heard. They won't play at all, and I'm talking about the default pre-set voices that come with the game, not any custom made voices.I sincerely hope this bug can be fixed in a later date with an update, because hearing your characters talk is just part of the game! And it takes away a lot of fun if you don't hear the voice at all, or just random snippets from the sentences they say.			"

												i enthusiastically recommend both this game, as well as the enhanced edition of baldur's gate.  my understanding is that both products were unacceptably buggy upon release, but the current versions (july 2014) seem quite stable.  i haven't had any problems with either product, save one:  the throne of bhaal expansion keeps eating my shield of balduran!  i haven't reported it yet as beholders don't play a significant role in ToB.  *shrug*if you are expecting a major graphics overhaul, you will be disappointed.  most of the original art assets are gone (gee whiz, bioware!), so a simple HD remaster is out of the question.  you will get some new NPC's, which i personally enjoyed quite a bit.  as this is a matter of taste, your mileage may very.  for me, it was a chance to play with a party i would never have chosen for myself:  monks & wild mages?  ew.  but it's been great, and for those that are patient enough to stick with rasaad, you will find that he is insanely powerful by the time the ToB expansion begins.the interface, while seeming the same, strikes one as less clunky.  several small conveniences quickly seem impossible to live without.  & the load times.  oh. my. gawd.  honestly, if you plan to spend much time with the BG saga, you will be amazed at how quickly saves and areas load, in contrast to the original offerings.  this is something no mod can change in the original game (at least not that i've seen), and the idiot-proof install & play package will have tremendous appeal for those who lack either capability, inclination, or time to mess with modding the now-antiquated technology of the original release.having played the original vanilla releases for bg1, bg2, & ToB in the past year, i can honestly say that i'm hooked on the stability and convenience of enhanced edition.  the added characters have quests that add new areas (at a better resolution IIRC) to spice things up for veterans.  i'm not looking back.recommended for veterans & newbies alike.  100 hours (minimum) of enjoyment at $0.25 per hour?  yeah, i want to go to there.

												BG2 is still one of the best RPGs, I have ever enjoyed playing.  The plot is mature and contains many different kinds of elements. Between romance, rescuing civilizations, personal revenge, reconquering castles or the many social as well as physical dangers adventuring brings with it, all of them are handled very well.The AD&D rules are a bit dated and players unfamiliar with them will probably need the help of a guide, as some things other than the gameplay itself are quite hard to grasp. For example the damage reduction on certain constructs or demi liches, which make these (near) impossible to kill if the group isn't correctly outfitted. Also the fact that negative numbers are usually better is rather counterintuitive for younger players. There are also some smaller usability hardships during character creation and leveling (saving before leveling is recommended as the leveling screen can't be left to make comparisions between characters). Keeping an eye on your spells is also very important in this game as there a few spells without which the game becomes extremely hard to play. Without chaotic commands and negative energy protection the game becomes virtually impossible, so read all of the spells descriptions. Also managing arcane spellbooks is more important than it looks at the begining.Other than this, the game is pretty much perfect: Engaging, lots of fun, nice puzzles, great epic fights, loot, loot and more loot, 100h per playthrough of the main game with dozens of classes and even more party member options.So let google help you build a character. Save before leveling, so you know where to put your perks and which weapons you own. Read all the spells. ALL OF THEM. If you can't deal damage to sth., change the weapon type or try stronger magical weapons. And erase arcane spells, if you can't learn an important one or raise your int temporarily.If you do that, you will have a lot of fun with this gem of a rpg.			"

												Great game! Thank you for brining back this classic. I really missed the classical D&D style, dark and grim, and with a rich story and gameplay that makes you feel like living in a book. I hope they make an enhanced edition for Icewind Dale II as well.			"

												I finally beat BG 1 EE so I was able to import my toon and test drive this puppy.  The bigger screen is definitely nice, but I do see what some of the other reviewers mean about bugs.  Companion walking AI is even worse than the original.  At times it's like herding freaked out cats.  I have issues where my characters will try to walk right up to an opponent before casting a spell.  NOT fun with something like Fireball.  I felt like I had better control of my party in the original edition.  Having all the extras thrown in is nice though.  I do have to agree with the previous reviewer who said Hexxat's voice acting was flat.  Granted until you complete that first mission for her, she's supposed to be in a trance (close as I want to get to a spoiler), but that could have been sold (acted) better.  After that point her voice acting is a bit better, but I was still bored enough with the character that she got the boot.I'd say the main reason to go with this version vs the old is convenience.  No fussing with mods, etc...  DL and it's done.  If you're good enough at installing mods manually though, you'd be just as happy with the gog version or your old CDs (still have mmine, lol).			"

												This game is Perfect for those who Love D&D, love Rough-ish Older styled games or just love role play Strategy games in General. This game is almost Completely interactive as you can steal from others, talk to literally EVERY NPC in the game, and is completely addicting. This game however is no where near Perfect, but it's imperfections make it amazing. The game is highly Difficult however and sometimes you may need to spend hours alone on Small easy quests to Level up you Party Members. (not my style however) xD And it doesn't help that I LOVE CHallenges. Although I went and screwed around and nearly ♥♥♥♥ed up two Campaigns and had to start over. So if you buy this game. (which I HIGHLY recommend) Play Semi-Cautiously. Lol. Over All, I Give This Game An 8/10			"

												Seen alot of reviews that said the 2nd  re-done Bg2 was bugged to hell. So far on Chapter 4 andd not 1 bug to been seen. actually, i saw way more apparent bugs in the re-done bg 1, such as blank journals..which made it impossible to quest sometimes, map flying sideways constantly, making it hard as hell to locate stuff on the maps, other than that, both great ply throughs if you remember playing these games as a kid. Suprised theres even 1 bug in any of these games, i mean, they are re-done versions, common. Anyways, so far Bg 1 is way more buggy than Bg2, still love it.			"

												I played this game when it first came out. It still stands the test of time and, IMO, it is the greatest RGP of all time. The story is extremly intricate and has meaningful depth. The controls themselves are not entriely too difficult to understand, while you can be in control of all party members at once. The pause feature is one of the greatest parts of the game giving you the ability to command your party members to their full power. It does take a little getting used to and it is a difficult game so be prepared to save/reload hundreds of times. Save often, rest often, and GO FOR THE EYES.10/10			"

												I used to play this game when it first came out and I loved it so much! I was very excited when I saw I could buy and play it again! So many memories came back to me as I played my way though all the awesome quests, content, and epic battles. Now remember this is an older game so the graphics may not be what they are today so some may find that a negative. One thing I would like to  mention is that if you play the game then want to re play it and import your character it makes the game more difficult. I expected it to be a bit more challenging but not much since the rest of the party wouldn't be as high. My character is a half elven, chaotic good, conjurer mage at level 16 and the rest of the group (Misc, Valgayr (sp?), Jaheira, Nalia, and Viconia) all range between 10-13. I made it to Umar Hills and the shadow dungeon where I found multiple liches waiting. They were quite challenging since the rest weren't that high and my high level is a squishy clothie. Then doing ""Cult of the Eyeless"" quest line I found 3 beholders and 3 gauths in a location that typically had 1 beholder and 1 gauth. So  becareful when importing characters as it may make the game much more difficult then expected. Also when importing characters they don't come with their gear. All my girl had was her high level spells which was handy but the lack of good high level gear made the above fights that much more challenging. All in all I would give it 10/10.			"

												i enthusiastically recommend both this game, as well as the enhanced edition of baldur's gate.  my understanding is that both products were unacceptably buggy upon release, but the current versions (july 2014) seem quite stable.  i haven't had any problems with either product, save one:  the throne of bhaal expansion keeps eating my shield of balduran!  i haven't reported it yet as beholders don't play a significant role in ToB.  *shrug*if you are expecting a major graphics overhaul, you will be disappointed.  most of the original art assets are gone (gee whiz, bioware!), so a simple HD remaster is out of the question.  you will get some new NPC's, which i personally enjoyed quite a bit.  as this is a matter of taste, your mileage may very.  for me, it was a chance to play with a party i would never have chosen for myself:  monks & wild mages?  ew.  but it's been great, and for those that are patient enough to stick with rasaad, you will find that he is insanely powerful by the time the ToB expansion begins.the interface, while seeming the same, strikes one as less clunky.  several small conveniences quickly seem impossible to live without.  & the load times.  oh. my. gawd.  honestly, if you plan to spend much time with the BG saga, you will be amazed at how quickly saves and areas load, in contrast to the original offerings.  this is something no mod can change in the original game (at least not that i've seen), and the idiot-proof install & play package will have tremendous appeal for those who lack either capability, inclination, or time to mess with modding the now-antiquated technology of the original release.having played the original vanilla releases for bg1, bg2, & ToB in the past year, i can honestly say that i'm hooked on the stability and convenience of enhanced edition.  the added characters have quests that add new areas (at a better resolution IIRC) to spice things up for veterans.  i'm not looking back.recommended for veterans & newbies alike.  100 hours (minimum) of enjoyment at $0.25 per hour?  yeah, i want to go to there.

This feature alone makes the Enhanced Edition the definitive edition.Otherwise, aside from some forgettable extra content, the game is untouched. Graphics are muddy but acceptable. Inventory management a little tedious. Writing and combat top-notch. Basically, Baldur's Gate II remains one of the best RPGs ever.Buy the game during a sale. $25 is absolute, total lunacy.			"

												By far the best RPG ever. Period.Now that the opening pledge of perpetual love has been declared, we can get down to the gritty of the review. The Baldurs gate series is no longer groundbreaking. Not in graphics, not in sheer scope of content - even though its storyline still is very strong compared to other RPGs out there. It's a solid game, even today some 13 or 16 years after its initial release. The series starts in candlekeep and the protagonist finds himself (or herself) very soon as a haunted individual, then the story pretty much goes from there. The plot, the twists and the mechanics of the game functions very well and even if the graphics are rough they still work. In short its great entertainment for a very reasonable price, keep in mind tho that beamdog hasn't really added much to the series so if you own the original series don't buy unless you're like me - a lover, a fighter - keeping the magic alive at all cost.

												The existence of these Enhanced Editions for classic DND-based rpgs has rekindled an appreciation for what game developers had offered us before the rise of the ""modern"" roleplaying game formulae.  Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn was, for its time, the hands down king of this genre, and it's fantastic to see that it is still getting the attention that it deserves.If you're a younger gamer who didn't have the opportunity to experience BGII in its prime, you may find the style of play a bit stunted, the pause feature and tactical camera a big adjustment to overcome when you consider that modern rpgs have deviated over time from this path.  Once you adjust to the controls, and realize the depth of customization and party compositions that this game offers, as well as its wealth of dungeon crawls and its formidable story, you won't be disappointed with the meager cost of this classic game revamp.  Support this project!  Check out the other EE's too!			"

												I already own this game in its original CD-format, and I still bought it through Steam. It's story- and lorewise one of the richest games ever published, so if hours of uncovering plot detail is your thing, this is the ticket in isometric action rpg - format. One should strongly consider playing the first Baldur's Gate before this, as you get a lot more fun out of this game if you know and understand the story connections.			"

They did a great job of reviving the game, but their NPCs are mediocre at best, unfortunately.If you've never touched the series: the graphics are old-school but charming, the story is intensely personal instead of a standard save-the-world fantasy trope, the voice-acting is phenomenal, and the original writing is either really good or so hammy it's hard to dislike it regardless of its quality. The gameplay isn't to everyone's taste; it's pretty slow-paced and combat can become tedious. It's my favourite game in the whole world!!!!!			"

												Probably one of the most best RPG's made for its time, although the story at times isn't as good as the first BG its still very good, the patches added to the game make some of the ANNOYING glitches (cough harpers song spell cough) are mostly fixed and a walkthrough is needed at times (mainly for spells and what enemies you will need to cast to hurt them), and the last boss in throne of bhaal is the worst one (but it is a last boss afterall so... its meant to be challenging) as you WILL need to be very prepared to the point of having plans (e.g. WISH with high WIS necessity) but it is well worth a try after BG1.

But the biggest problem I'm having is simply dealing with how dated the gameplay mechanics are.Having to explicitly save constantly...  Navigating cumbersome character and inventory screens...  Clunky combat mechanics...  Just the basic UI is so outdated that it makes playing the game less enjoyable.			"

												Much like the first game, BG2 is a legendary RPG that continues and resolves the story of the Bhaalspawn saga with the Throne of Bhaal expansion. It offers a potential of hundreds of hours of D&D gameplay and is an incredible game to play if you want to get sucked into a great story. The enhanced edition offers the entire experience in one easy to play package that doesn't require modifying files just to get it to run. If you've never played any of the Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale games before, pick these up. They're must-buy games in my opinion.			"

												This game is a work of art. The NPC's have a load of fun interactions with one another and most fit little niches for party customisation and story progression. The wealth of magical items, equipment, weapons etc. available for you to hunt down and loot is fantastic. The main USP of this title compared to the likes of PoE is the uniqueness of special equipment that you can find and its interplay with encounters throughout the game. You don't just craft a 'normal/fine/rare/epic' weapon or armor piece, you find them on the corpse of a difficult foe at the end of a dungeon and your use of that item echoes your achievement without being overpowered.Some of the swords/flails/what have you have names and one of them even talks to you. For the most part, your path through the game is quite non-linear to the extent that you can journey about and make yourself as overpowered as you like before embarking on the main story, provided you're comfortable putting the work in.The combat has a wealth of strategic potential. You'll be saving and re-loading many times to approach encounters with different strategies, and it's not going to feel tedious. The lore is interesting from what I've payed attention to, but I'm not exactly a lore guy.Some seriously memorable people, places, and fights are packed into this title. It doesn't have an ""overwhelmingly positive"" response on steam at the time of writing, but I think that's a function of older players picking up the enhanced edition and not being totally happy with the quality of the added NPC's and their stories, which I agree with personally. Look up the reviews for the original release and see the overwhelming positivity for yourself. This game is a rare accomplishment on a significance and qualitative par with the likes of final fantasy 7 and I think you owe it to yourself to play through it.It says I've only 28 hours on record but I played this game to death back in the day			"

All in all the game runs smoother than the original did and that's what matters, it is fully moddable aswell just like the original so we are able to add custom portraits, voice sets, scripts, and the console is still accessible.This game stands the test of time!

												I have played and completed this game more or less once a year since I was ten. Playing this with my dad is one of my fondest childhood memories. This game also fed my need to be a completionist - I used to think that there was a single quest I hadn't completed. Of course, in later years I found out about the pantaloons enigma so there went that theory.Replaying with this edition (with achievements hallelujah) I discovered that there was still more the game had to offer. I don't mean the extended quests, what I mean is the quest available after casting a particular spell before having done particular standard quests and that's all I'll say about that. This game is my game. It is absolutely my nominee for the Test of Time Steam Award. Play it. Love it. Play it again.			"

												The Baldur's Gate series was what began my lifelong love of RPGs and the Enhanced Edition faithfully recreates the original game that fostered so many fond memories, while also adding a solid quantity of new and generally fairly good content.Excellent music, a memorable story, compelling villains and the quality of NPC companion writing that classic Bioware was so well known for- the companions added in the EE generally being on par with the standard and certainly not detracting from the overall experience.Even if you played excessive quantities of the original games- as I did- this is well worth a revisit, if only to be able to play through such an experience again in multiplayer with friends.The whole series comes strongly recommended, though I feel Baldur's Gate 2 and Throne of Bhaal were the true masterpieces.

												Baldurs gate is one of my all time favorite games. i played all of the games in the series multiple times. i have alwaays been in love with this game. i enjoy the new content added too the game if i want the original i still can play it elsewhere. disk or from another website. I truly enjoy the new content it adds spice to the game. there are a few things about the game i wish had been changed more areas added to Baldurs gate 2 enhanced edition like they added too baldurs gate 1. A few more added items too add some new spice. there is also a few issues in play. glitches in stuff. nothing major or anything that ruined the game for me. The added Characters add some really good variety to the game that always layed heavy on a good character play through. If i where you I would give this game a chance.			"

												As a kid the original Baldur's Gate was one of my favorites even though I never had the patience to read through my journal to actually figure out where I was supposed to go. I wasn't able to beat the game until I was in my early teens and that was from spamming spawn monster wands with all of my party members then sat back and watched as Sarevok was mauled by various monsters. It took about 2 minutes for about 50 monsters or so, quite an impressive amount of patience for me. Now that I have a job I can buy my own games and stumbled onto BG2EE after forgetting that I still had the sequel to play. I have over 150 hours invested and I can say without a doubt that my patience hasn't gotten any better.10/10 "

												Excellent remake of a classic that reinvigorates an appreciation for old-school D&D-based RPGs.

Highly recommended for hardcore RPG fans if you can appreciate - or endure - the difficulty and micromanagement.			"

												This, with it's addon ""Throne of Bhaal"" is it. THE BEST CRpg I have ever played and probably will ever play in my entire life. Long before my steam-days I have played every race, gender, class, alignment and difficulty possible (including David Gaider's ""harder Bhaalspawn"") with every possible companion. I've poured so many hours of my life into this very game, I nearly can't comprehend, and for that matter, I have infected relatives with this game (well, at least the interest to play it) aswell. Now I can replay it with new partymembers (by the time of this review - done).This is a highly subjective recommendation, but I have to say this: I will always, always love this game.As of Nov. 2016 - this still stands. No PoE, no Tyranny no IWD, no Skyrim or Fallout (F2 comes CLOSE) can reach this one.			"

Jon Irenicus is, to this day, my favorite villain in any game I've played and David Warner's voice performance as Irenicus is unforgettable.  Set in the Forgotten Realms setting, this game is the pinnacle of AD&D gaming and set the bar for all hardcore cRPGs that came after.  There's nothing quite like the magic of the Baldur's Gate series, and this came is the very best it has to offer.			"

												I liked the first part of this Series... And I like! the second - THIS - paart of the Series. Old, but cool. You play a group Avangers, looking for Treasures, perhaps a romance, and revenge on a sorcerer. Your way leads you through Faerûn. Mainpart is the city of Athkatla in Amn.There, you find old friends, like Imoen, Viconia and Minsc (from BG 1 ) but also new friends like Nalia, Mazzy and Keldorn. And many more. The task is clear: Kill the Wizard, in the dungeon you woke up! After all, it was nice not there ... find him and kicks him in the♥♥♥♥♥ And on your way get cool weapons, exp, and all what you can get...this game is 13 years old, but I still like it. Now with new Charakters. Cool. First, I had the normal BG 2-Game. Than, I get the Dungeons & Dragons - Anthology (Baldur's Gate) version from Amazon (Juni 2013... ) for 25 € and the Dungeons & Dragons - Anthology (Neverwinter Nights) for 25 €. Now I have the BG2 EE... 3rd time, I'm buying BG2. Buy it! this Game is Cool! Come, and become a God !			"

												One of the best RPGs ever made. The options available for how you build your character, and how many different companions you can travel with are insane. Be a fighter and smash things,Or a wizard and use a ridiculous number of spells,Or a rogue and stab them in the back and steal their things,Or a cleric and be able to smash things and use divine spells,Or a ranger and use either dual weapons or bows,Or a large number of sub-class specialties to further refine your abilites,Companions seemingly everywhere, many with side-quests and interparty banter (made better with tasteful mods)Or, attempt everything solo (it is possible).There is a reason the Baldur's Gate games have been heavily modded for all the years since they first came out. Speaking of which, If you get into modding the games can be so much better, but you need to be careful about which mods you use as always.Note: most of my time in Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 is in either the 4 disc version, or GoG version, and using mods.

												Baldur's Gate II was one of the best games of all time. That is considered to be a fact. This Enhanced Edition merely modernizes it, allowing it to work with current operating systems and widescreen resolutions. They did add some minor things to the game, such as a couple of new companions, which I felt were unneeded and superfluous, but they don't detract anything from the game.

												One of the great classics of RPG Gaming, and indeed gaming more broadly, Baldur's Gate is a masterpiece which shines anew in this Enhanced Edition.  While there's a great deal of back and forth online over whether EE or self patched/modded versions are better, the EE is a great, one click way to get started.Truely one of the greatest RPG's of all time, this (and the original) are must plays.  I recommend starting in BG1 - the plot there is much simpler and more grounded in the mundane, but it has some strong emotional beats and sets much of the emotional content of BG2. "

												It's a fun game and a good nostalgia trip. Sadly if you've already played the game before, which you likely have if you bought this remastered edition, then you probably remember most if not all of what made it cool. Like, you know, the plot. And the characters, and the plot twists, and everything else.Yeah they added a few new characters and a new place or two, and changed some of the dialogue around, but really in the end it's basically the exact same as it was when it was first released many many years ago. That isn't nessesarily a bad thing because the game is still great, but it really doesn't have a lot going for it to snare in people that were fans of the original.TLDR- If you've never played the Baldurs Gate series before, then you should buy this and play it because it has a deep storyline, compelling characters, and it's fun. If however, like me, you are a returning fan hoping for a more polished product that has had some stuff changed around to make it interesting and 'new' again .. well .. it is a more polished product I'll give it that but the changes to the game are so minimal that you could literally go through the entire thing and never hit *any* of the changed stuff unless you deliberately went out of your way to do so.

How did they combine a book into a game? They let the gamer choose how the protaganist looks, acts, fights, loves. So in reality they didn't just write one great book, but like 15 of them. and depending on what chocies you make will determine which book you will read.And this game is truely the best book i've ever read.

												Baldur's Gate will always hold a special place in my heart. It has well withstood the test of time, and the Enhanced Edition only refined the original. Never have I played or encountered a game exactly like this one.Wellcrafted characters and interesting plot line.I cannot recommend this game to RPG fans enough, if you enjoyed the first game you will most definitely enjoy this one.

												The greatest game ever made. I was going to preface the review with the greatest WCRPG ever made, or perhaps the greatest RPG ever made but neither of those really describe the scope of this game's promise.  Sure, you'll probably end up having more hours in other games.  If you play a multiplayer game and you're playing for the people, you aren't really going to credit the game for those relationships but as I stare at my original BG II: SoA case sitting on my shelf, I'm supremely happy that I bought the Steam Enhanced Edition.  BG II quite simply has everything you can want out of a video game.Unlike so many RPGs, BG II has the perfect balance of linear story, and branching exploration.  In fact, it's one of the few RPGs I've ever played that has successfully achieved that goal.  In BG II, you pursue a tense and captivating story, but the game allows you to explore Amn and the surrounding countryside at your leisure.  The result is an experience that doesn't feel like a plot train, nor like a meandering sandbox devoid of purpose.  Every main quest and its satellite components fit neatly in the plot mythos, creating a truly organic and wonderful experience.Thematically, the location of Faerun is as rich and varied as high traditional high fantasy can be, rivaling even that of Tolkien's creations.  The game features a large, exotic sister city to Baldur's Gate (Amn), rife with political intrigue and a myriad of hidden secrets.  Walk past a bar a dozen times, and yet on the thirteenth a new adventure allows you to find an underground cellar with new, untold dangers.  The cavernous Underdark, hidden druidic groves, pirate ships, desolate islands, dark forests, castles of every imagination, ruins and even planar travel await you in this game.The variety is staggering but theme alone doesn't propel this game's story.  A plot full of surprises, twists, moments of worry, panic and dread make this game something that you experience, not play.  The game organically develops, unfurling the finale like petals in a flower, instead of so many other, formulaic RPG plots.  Perhaps the characterization however, is the game's strongest storytelling element.  A diverse array of characters exist, both comically memorable and fearsomely grim and they not only interact with the protagonist but also with each other, with staggering consequences.  After playing through BG II and its expansion ToB, and logging over 150 hours with the original release, I am now happy to introduce other gamers to this forgotten classic.  With rich and deep tacitcal gameplay, endless customizeability and properly functioning multiplayer, everyone can now enjoy this gem of a game.  And because the game has such low system requirements, no one is left out.I played this game 15 years ago, as an adult but even as a grownup, I was still transformed by the depth and breadth of this amazing gaming experience.  Fifteen years later, middle aged as I am, I still appreciate what a special title this really is.  From art design, to music, to gameplay this title will give you exactly what you put in.Buy it, sit down, steep yourself in the lore.  Go slow and luxuriate in the rich tale that will unfold.  As a gamer, I can think of no better gift to my peers than to recommend this game.Must buy. 10/10.			"

												A more accurate title would be Baldur's Gate: Special Edition.The gem that is Baldur's Gate is still here but all attempts to polish it feel ... out of place.  - The new writing does not fit well with the rest of the story/tone. (Serriously who thought adding ""Cool babe now make me a sandwich"" as a dialouge option was a good idea?) + The ""Black Pits"" and ""Gladiators of Thay"" make for, quick, pleasent multiplayer sessions.  - The old mods wont work. + Several bug have been removed.  - Several bugs have been added.At the end of the day, the greatness that is Baldur's Gate is still an amazing experience and the new content is completly optional.Highly recommended.

												this version of the game has a bad reputation for bad dialogue and unlikable new characters. i honestly don't see it. yes the writing feels different than the original. but, is it bad? i don't think so. it's done in a dragon age 2 sort of way. you have the straight forward nice answer. the sarcastic♥♥♥♥♥answer and the answer that normally ends with you killing people. some of the dialogue i find funny. i like how the new characters have three way dialogue with the older party members. now the issue i do have with the game is to make party banter appear (it almost NEVER appears sadly, except your love interest or potential love interests. those activate correctly still) you have to hit CTRL+I and keep hitting it until banter starts. it sucks but at least you have the option of going through all of it whenever you want. just fyi, i don't know if this happens in shadows of amn, but in throne of bhaal your love interests party banter will repeat when hitting ctrl +I. it's annoying but i wanted to finish the banter of my other characters before finishing the game.gameplay wise this is fun once you understand how the stats work and that crowd control and summons trump dps mages. that and haste is everything. makes the game run at a tolerable speed. your normal walk is just slow. I also love how each member of the party acts differently with eachother. like some characters will try and kill eachother. it's a aspect of a game i've never seen before besides the BG series. i think it's a shame other games don't do this. it leads to more playthroughs. i've done a full good playthrough and am playing a evil playthrough with 2 of the new characters and i enjoy it still with over 150 hours of playtime.now a huge con of this game is that there are bugs. like i mentioned earlier there is banter bugs but there are some quests that litterally don't finish sometimes. like for example during edwins quest this guy shows up and tries to fix edwin. he does and then it's suppose to start a fight (edwin is a jerk but really fun party member honestly) the fight didn't activate tell i reloaded it three times. the biggest con of the game would have to be that it crashes constantly. now to be fair i looked it up on the internet and i think i found the solution (I haven't crashed in about 10 hours of play) it had me make the save folders in my documents not read only. remove the checked box on it. this probably wont work for everyone though. also i turned on admin for the EXE file and switched it to compatible with xp service pack 3. I do not know if this had any effect but it seems to help it. will see later on i guess. TL:DR great game with bugs but the game loads in so quick that when it crashes it's not a big deal. if this was pillars of eternity i'd have broken my monitor... that game takes forever to load... characters in this game are amazing and i do like dorn and hexxat of the new characters. i have not touch the other 2 (3 if you count the dark elf from 1. dunno why he isn't in 2) gameplay is fun but i think crowd control was overdone in D&D it lasts... way to long. other than that i highly recommend this game to anyone that loves isometric strategy games. hell, if you like a great story (even with todays cinematic stories this one beats almost all of them with how much detail they go into party member relationships.) they have a story mode button to basically make your party members immortal. they'll go to 1 hp and not die. if your unsure buy the game on discount. also i don't like BG1 much. the story was very bland compared to 2. they are night and day for me.

												Mostly the same as the BG1 review.Fewer bugs than the original, I can't recall anything specific. Overall happy on the improvements made to the games performance and stability.Multiplayer is improved and easier than ever. Makes it worth the purchase alone vs the original if you plan to play with friends.The new content that has been added in isn't really worth touching and in my opinion is cringeworthy at times, but I can appreciate the attempt. Still, nothing beats the original cast and the new characters feel out of place in their writing.Good product overall.			"
