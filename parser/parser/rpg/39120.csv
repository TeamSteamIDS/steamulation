												What have I done with my life?Once upon a time, Rift was a wonderful game, a great 'classic' MMO that had meaningful content, good raids and dungeons and was really worth investing the time into. Then Trion Worlds started bleeding money on failed project after failed project and Rifts Dev team got axed down hard. To try and compensate things went F2P and things were fine at first. Hey we get nifty new costumes and I don't need to pay a sub fee anymore (I still did, even if the original patron perks were pretty bad by recent standards.) The shift was subtle at first, gear became purchasable, either directly or in directly through lotto style loot crates that you can buy for special mounts and get decent gear on the side (A great deal till you realize the currency you get for the mounts is character bound, and the gear you get from the chest is based on your characters class. Meaning that before you'll ever have the currency saved to get that special super shiney mount, you'll have wasted more cash then you will want to think about on what is basically worthless chests and gears as opening them on a different character who could use the gear, means your currency is split. Well played Trion.) Tangent aside. What this gear purchasing did was create a stigma in the ""PuG"" raiding community, as you had to have the achievements to even be able to join the raids, and if you didn't have a guild that did them? You were SoL.Things like that continued to spiral out of control, when you realized how long it would take to grind out the dungeon and raid tokens to get gear, but feel free to buy Patron status and token boosters to cut down on that time by several hundred percent. Turning what used to be a fairly smooth and natural gear progression into something akin to an Asian MMO's level of grinding. Oh and because of course it is, the pvp is entirely based around who out gears who.Throw in the usual batch of awful awful people that come with the F2P crowd, and it's hard to even argue if just playing it for the social aspect is worth it. From an Role Play standpoint it does a few things right and many things wrong. The lore is built out of wet tissue paper, and few people even follow that, open world role play is almost impossible to find and when you do? You're going to wish you hadn't. One of the good and bad things it has, are Dimensions, or just player housing. Easily costumizable zones and area's you can do a great deal of things with. Probably the most positive thing about this game these days, minus the obvious cash shop tie in's to building materials. Of course, player housing is always a double edged sword for role play as it becomes cliquish and impossible for new people to really get involved.In the end the final nail in the coffin that made me write this review, was when they released the new single zone, not an expansion pack, not a new continent. But one area. They wanted to charge one hundred dollars, for the new class that came with it, as well as some relatively worthless in game items. This harkens back to the Ember isle map they added years ago, it was free, it was an amazing area and I still consider it their best zone. And while you can still reach this new zone for free, and the new class can be picked up for the low low cost of about 30 bucks (Without the cyber swag). I can only stop to realize, Rift really isn't the same. And it's just not worth the time anymore.Oh and there's easily another 1-2k hours missing from that playtime. So there goes that entire year of my life! Shoulda put that time into something I could have gone professional instead. Like Solitaire.			"

												RIFT is the perfect World of Warcraft clone. It has everything WoW has:Same interface, mechanics, professions, auction house, instances, raids, BGs, item naming, controls, addons on Curse, talents, etc,It also has the additions that WoW has always needed:- Random Zone Events (constant, running all the time)- Rifts (which appear randomly and massively accros the map)- 1 and 2 players dungeons (Chronicles)- Built-in mechanics that in WoW you need addons (sell grey items, quest guides, etc)- Instant Adventures, which randomly matches you with a bunch of players and then you keep doing infinitely chosen grinding quests in a zone, giving massive EXP and rewards (the best way to level).But mostly important it has AN AWESOME CHARACTER CLASS AND ROLE CUSTOMIZATION. It's something like ""make your own class and roles"":- Caster DPS-Tank-Healer- Pure caster DPS- Caster and Melee DPS- Caster with Pet DPS and Healer (or just DPS)- Melee Tank with Healing habilitiesAnd a LOT MOOOOOOORE.Regarding the Free to Play aspect of it: you can completely play the game without ever spending a penny, but a few restrictions:- You can't sell on the Auction House- Limited bags (very annoying)- You will have to grind a lot in order to buy mountsBut I was so hooked the first day that I bought the Classic Collector's Pack, unlocking a lot of extras, plus giving 1 month of Patron, which means 40% additional exp = faster leveling. Also, I WANTED to pay, because I was willing to help Trion. This game DESERVES money. It's polished, addicting and well crafted.If you want to play WoW but aren't willing for a comeback, RIFT is your game!			"

RIFT: F2P?RIFT is a great game. As of writing this review I have logged almost 4000 hours. Mhmm. Almost four thousand. One hundred and sixty-six days. It's a safe assumption that I'm a veteran player that has been enjoying this game almost since release!After hearing about it, I was worried about Trions Free To Play buisness model. I am happy to report (contrary to other opinions) that there is NOTHING out of reach in game to non patrons (subscribers) or those that don't want to spend hard earned cash for pixels and code, The F2P system in RIFT is created as such to allow people to purchase Credits using in-game currency. It might take a damn sight longer, but you could get everything, including sub time, just by something as simple as selling artifact collections.Combat is pretty fun, and the souls/roles (Calling/Class) system is one of the best i have ever experienced in an MMO. Mage tank? Sure! Cleric bard? Done! A Warrior healer? Go for it! Each class is updated by the devs fairly regularly, so all of them are fairly balanced, there are a few exceptions (looking at you Physician...).The world is huge, and gets bigger with each expansion. It still looks pretty good despite it's three year long run and is still one of my favourite MMOs ever.TL;DR  Great game with a ton of content, entirely free to play, if you don't enjoy it I'll personally refund your free for free.10/04/17 Edit - Don't bother with this game unless you love spending real money to be able to do anything in the late game. I would certainly still recommend this game to anyone and everyone, just as long as they are not going to want to seriously do the most content and expansion packs, and I am very disappointed with the recent paywall mountian climbing challenge that RIFT has become.

												As I have played this game for 2,700 hours I thought I might as well leave my opinion on it. I'll keep it short and simple.Pros ☺+ One of the best PvE experiences I've ever had in any game. The world and the raids are extremely dynamic with       fun and well-designed boss encounters.+ Great community.+ There's always something to do.+ A neat wardrobe system allowing you to change the looks of your gear if you're not satisfied with how it looks or the pieces don't match. Purely cosmetic feature. This has been taken even further after Nightmare Tide, as you can now directly ""transmog"" any gearpiece including weapons directly from your wardrobe tab.+ Many different options when creating your spec due to the soul tree feature.+ Seasonal events in which you unlock items such as mounts, clothing/gear, companions and more.+ F2P. You CAN buy gear with Gems which cost real money, but in order to do so, you must spend a helluva lot of money. It doesn't really have a negative effect on the game. If you're overall bad at the game/your role, gear won't help you. Guilds don't accept people without experience. The game is just as playable F2P as if you paid for stuff.+ Free server transfer every 7 days.Cons ☹- Horrible PvP. It's quite unbalanced and gets repetitive pretty fast.- Bad customer support. Can barely assist you due to all their policies.- Spending a lot of time on farming items such as gear pieces and planar essences is necessary in order to succesfully raid. I do however believe this applies to most MMOs.- Too few gear models. Often you'll see the same model used for several different gear pieces with other stats. Just letting you know if you're into cosmetics and looking cool.- The amount of players seems to be decreasing.So why quit a game you've spent almost 3,000 hours in?It's difficult to give just one reason or explanation. Basically, the fact I had played it for that long might've burnt me out. Other than that, my guild in which we had an awesome community disbanded, and the friends I used to play RIFT with had switched over to other games. Furthermore, I suppose I also just wanted to play other games. I have plenty on Steam and I'm not the type of guy who sticks with just one game forever. I like variation.			"

												Used to be my absolute baby of the MMO world long before it came to Steam, to the point of where I was one of the subscribers who willingly continued to pay a monthly subscription for over two years. I only quit constant play because of real life ♥♥♥♥ and becoming a parent. Their ORIGINAL model, when going from subs to free, was a legitimate pay2be lazy/have pretty stuff, plus DLC/extra roles. Now?Now it's nothing but pay2win trash that has broken my heart.Even after you drop over 200$ on DLC content/""essentials"" (without it now, you are so hindered, it's not even funny), you will have to pay over 100$ MORE just to fully unlock the game. This is not even touching the pay2win part! Investing your money is a waste of time, unless you want to pay out the nose to the tune of over 600$ (and this is lowballing) just to be competetive and capable of raiding.Goodbye, RIFT. I shall never redownload you again.			"

												Everything that made World of Warcraft great (minus the world itself), Telara is pretty big on its own. Had some great time tinkering builds in the game, dungeons are pretty challenging when you get into them at first. Progression feels very smooth and any time you spend into the game is rewarding.Polished and neat MMO, very recommended			"

												Pros- Great looking game compared to other MMOs.- Mechanics are solid, though it is action bar/button mashing, which may turn off more action oriented players.- LOTS of content. Zone events, world events, dungeons, chronicles, raids, PvP (if you like that), instant adventures, etc etc.- One of the better housing systems- Really good F2P model, with pretty much all content being free aside from things like bag space, some of the souls etc.- Can be a really casual or hard core game. It's pretty flexible in that regard.- Soul system is one of the better ""talent"" systems in MMOs.Cons- The lore could use some work. It's got the GW2 problem in that the lore is there, just horribly horribly presented, which is sad because it has some pretty cool ideas and concepts.- The shop is sometimes overpriced, and they do sell gear in the shop (albiet incredibly overpriced) which may turn off some people. Also they introduce new ""lockboxes"" all the time which I personally consider a lame version of gambling.- The reputation system is horrible. Almost as bad as WoWs.- The daily system the reputations are tied to get boring VERY fast, however if you want the best enchants for some slots, you need to do it.- If you're a lore junkie, a lot of the world is unfinished. Stories and zones. You'll get disappointed staring at grey blobs on the map that sound cool, but just don't exist, or finishing a story quest chain with far more questions than answers.It makes the world feel unfinished.- The subscription fee is no where near woth paying for. You get some boosters and a weekly gift, along with a discount. It's pretty worthless. If you want to support the game just spend $5 to $15 a month on credits and get something worthwhile.- Because tanking in this game is so unappealing like so many other MMOs, the old problem of tank shortages comes up a lot. It may be a turn off to some people who like to do dungeons.In the end I would recommend the game. I consider it one of the best MMOs out right now. Definitely one of the best F2P ones.			"

												I've been shaking off the urge to write a review for the F2P MMORPG, Rift, for about a week now, purely because I wanted to write one that did it justice. I'm a little under 200 hours into this game at the time of this review, but despite that, I've barely scatched the surface. I'll start negative. Rift isn't original, I mean sure, the Rift aspect is, but other than that it's pretty much filled with the same content you'd expect from an MMO. Quests that are uncreative, grinding to level and lots of walking, for the most part. So at this point you might be asking yourself why would you play Rift?Well, in short, Rift does what other MMOs do, but better. The only exception to this, in my view is the spell effects in game are lacking, they feel a little washed out, but everything else, from killing monsters to presentation is absolutely crisp, responsive and highly polished. The scenery is gorgeous, you'll often find yourself stopping to take screenshots and admire the landscape, and even the monsters. Every area has a totally unique atmosphere and feel to it, each crawling with unique monsters waiting to rip your face off. This brings me to difficulty. Rift isn't easy, at least not compared to other MMOs. The monsters and combat are a lot less forgiving, death comes with a penalty and continous deaths with permantly penalize your stats until you visit a healer. This is a good point though, it makes the grinding aspect of the game more enjoyable, because your attention is focused solely on the game in nail biting moments. Look away for even a few seconds and you could come back to find your body laying on the floor surrounded by dragons. Rift features a huge amount of content. The map is huge, there are several islands to travel, hundreds and hundreds of quests and a huge range of monsters to be killed by. Raids, Chronicles, Rifts, Hunt Rifts, Bounty Hunting, Warfronts, Instant Adventures, Dungeons and so on. To give a perspect on the amount of content, I list eight game types, in just one, for example Dungeons, there is about 40 dungeons in Rift ranging across across levels from 1 - 60. Once you hit 60, it isn't over. You can prestiege and the game introduces a second XP bar for planer attunement, which unlocks new abilities and skills. I was lucky enough to be invited to a guild on my first day of playing Rift, and I've stuck with it ever since. Joining a guild, working together to do guild quests and form raids/events is where I have the best fun, as I think a lot of people do also. You're able to completely customize your guild to represent and battle others, all the while earning points that contribute to the leveling tree in the guild. This too unlocks perks such as bonus xp, better loot drops, faster health regeneration, teleporting to guild members and so on. For those of you who may be collectors, don't worry, Rift has a HUGE amount of collectibles in-game, named ""artifacts"". Artifacts are found around the map, either by exploring or by looting monsters and/or chests. Rift encourages exploration, if you can see it, chances are you can go there. You'll be searching for these hidden artifacts for hours and hours, and when you finally do get the complete set for a particular catagory, you get rewards. Rift always rewards you for your work, and it rewards well. Professions in Rift are quite in-depth, there's enough to keep you digging away for hours, looking for the materials and crafting the items you need to level. The leveling doesn't take too long, there is 375 levels per skill, currently I've managed to achieve this in Fishing, which took about 30 hours or so, just to give a perspective. There is two types of professions; gathering and crafting, both of which tie into one another. You'll be given useful hints and tips as you progress, suggesting which receipes do craft and for what reasons. There is currently about ten professions, give or take, which include: Minning, Butchering, Fishing, Survival, Outfitting, Foraging, Armoursmithing, Weaponsmiths and so on. All the reciepes and materials you craft can either be used, traded or sold either to NPCs are stores or on the player economy driven Auction House.This game is ENTIRELY free to play, from level 1 to collecting every item, every piece of armour and maxing every skill. There is no restrictions and no cut out content. There is a store, you're able to purchase some items through real money. This is more of a boost, the items can be obtained in-game and no real world purchases are neccesary or required in any way. Spending credits earns loyalty points, which the more you spend, the more you earn. These unlocks are only available via the loyalty system, but can still be obtained absolutely free. There is an in-game item called ""Rex"", which you can purchase with game currency, then exchange it for both credits to spend in the store, as well as loyalty points to earn items. This means you can obtain everything in Rift, absolutely free. As far as MMOs go, this one is one of the best. It's free, it's filled with content and it's crisp in every aspect. I highly recommend you give this a go, it's a little slow to start off, but you'll find yourself hooked and playing daily, enjoying every second of it. 9.5/10 - A fantastic MMO that achieves everything it sets out to do in a high quality fashion.           -0.5 for the lacking spell visuals, it's minor, but noticable.

												Ever wondered how other free-to-play projects on Steam got Overwhelmingly Positive or Very Positive reviews, Trion? I can give you a few examples. There's a certain free-to-play MMO game here on Steam where you can get almost *anything* in the game by trading the in-game items with other players for premium currency. Little by little you will accumulate enough premium currency to buy almost *anything*, except for a few cosmetics which are availible only for real currency and for a limited time. Cosmetics, Trion. Not top-tier PvP/PvE equipment, not character classes, unattainable by other means. Cosmetics.That being said, almost every item in that game can be bought and/or crafted using the in-game resources. Is it grindy? Yes. It will take you a while to get somewhere and get the needed resources. The things is, however, you don't need to spend a penny on it to get a viable character, both in PvP and PvE. All you need is time and the will to play and have fun with other people.Now, let's talk about Rift. Not only is it grindy — god-awful grindy, not only do you need the resources/hundred kinds of different currencies, you also need the crafting skill/reputation required to get the things you need — the *only* way for you to get the premium currency without paying real money, is to buy REX, which gives you a portion of premium credits and costs unreasonable amounts of in-game currency. Apparently, god forbid you from making the premium currency and the advantages it gives you — numerous advantages — more accessible to your general public.I suppose you forgot the meaning of the word ""accessible"" at this point.I'm using my friend's account to post this because you banned me without any further notice from the community hub for calling you out on your fraudulent schemes; funny thing, it was me who invited this friend of mine to play Rift in the first place. Needless to say, we both are sceptical about touching Rift ever again considering your business practices and paywall policies.Also, nice moves, Trion, acting like a little kid who sticks his fingers in his ears and starts yelling because he doesn't like what he's hearing. Next you'll start removing negative reviews like some megalomaniac indie developer who can't take criticism. Sure this will make your game better and shift the Recent Review ratings to Overwhelmingly Positive, eventually! Nah, it won't. Just kidding. Watch your player base dwindle as you invent new ways of leeching money out of people. Either that, or show some respect to your player base. Take a look at your forums, reddit, steam hub, you'll find more specific suggestions on how to improve your game from your very players; more than you would like. Make the game more accessible in general, and people will come to support you. Earn their trust and loyalty, and their money, not by building paywalls, but by making the game more accessible.PS: This is a copy of the thread I made on the Community Hub, in case of the thread getting overrun by trolls or deleted for no good reason. This negative review is here to stay, unless Trion does something about their pay-to-win policies.			"

												UPDATED!!!Tried the game myself and I have to say that it is quite addicting or addictive. It has it's ups and downs but course I will say what are cons and pros for this game for YOU to decide if you want to play it or not.Pros : + Very huge open world to explore+ Nature environment is so beautiful and it feels so alive+ Tons of rewardable quests to make you very busy if you're bored+ Detailed tutorials+ Editable and customazible soul tree to make your character explore and test lots of abilities+ Build a house with friends or global players (WoW hasn't done that yet)+ Minnion quests fits nicely + Great mounts and pets (course premium means real cash)+ Rifts to close all over the world with great rewards+ Kill a monster in new area you get automatic quest (it gets confusing if you're overloaded with 5 or more quests)+ Swimming is great with limited breath bar to make underwater quests challenging+ Mentoring your character is great and useful if your friends are lower level + Self buffs that lasts for an hour or more and you can re-buff at any time you like+ Some story quests have a great voice acting and it's worth it to listen if you understand the story+ If I would choose between WoW and/or RIFT, I would pick up RIFT+ Tons of achievements in game (but I prefer STEAM achievement) + Free To Play+ Large player base+ Extensive class customization (some classes and creations are limited see cons below)+ Rifts create dynamic gameplay+ I recommend it for people who don't have annoying wife's ;) + Addicting from every corner or look of the game no matter where you are+ Fishing is so much fun :) + Crafting & Minning is also in the game but I haven't got the chance to try it+ Rewardable events+ Friendly player base (well if you are nice and polite)+ Auto adventure is great (if you're level 10 you can do level 20+ or higher quests with others that level)+ Bonus rifts are unlimited with great rewards if you can beat shown minutes or seconds with tons of players+ Great sound and music+ Server time is confusing to me and/or others so it's good that you click on that clock to keep an eye on your RL clock.+ Weekly updates (thursdays)I didn't forget about the cons as well and these I HOPE will be gone away in the future (with big hopes)cons : - Some class balance issues- Limited races for character creation (you need DLC to unlock limited races for character creation and other premium things)- RIFT: Ultimate Nightmare Edition costs 2 much (139,99€) unless you live a very rich life then go ahead and buy it- Leveling from level 10 or 15 to 65+ gets quite hard as EXP rating slows down unless you want to do repeatable quests and events- Annoying guild requests- There is no actual story because you have quests are all around the huge map - Aggressive mobs are annoying even if you try to avoid them- No falling damage- Too many aggresive mobs makes it harder to focus on your quests (specialy if there is a whole pack when you're on a quest grind)- No autowalk (although map does show where you need to go) P.S. i don't look for key bidnings i take  my time explore yellow area untill i find it- Some players are stealing kills - No steam achievements (game has it's own but tons of it)- 4 downloadable contents costs way to much (324,96€). Why would I or someone else pay that much if I or somebody else can get all that for 139.99€. And even that costs way to much. RIFT DLC editions costs too much specialy if you're planning to spend over 325€. Spend 68€ for Guild Wars 2 Digital Deluxe Edtion with game guide on how to level up ANY of race class + you get great useful premium items.I do recommend this game but be warned that play for free has it's limited restrictions unless you want to buy NIGHTMARE EDITION. I am happy enough that is play for free but at least they could do is lower the prices for nightmare edition if it's worthy of getting it. Some of you may think that some the cons are funny and/or stupid. But that's how I see it.Everyone has it's own taste but I love the game myself so I try and ignore the cons and maybe 1 day i'll buy nightmare edition. I recommend it but many of you won't like it. If you don't, well there's always uninstall button.			"

												RIFT - a great option for MMO players. Great graphics, beautiful and detailed landscapes. You can customize your character the way you want to by using different souls available within your selected class. For example, take a bit of Pyromancer for offense, a lot of Elementalist for some serious pet capability, and some Chloromancer to heal the party. Rift also has several pre-built options for those who like to get in and play quickly. Beyond all of the systems in the game, the standard things about the game are also very well done. The audio is phenomenal, and the controls are pretty intuitive. Glitches are very infrequent, and minor anyway. Besides, the game is still fairly new so such things are to be expected. Leveling up in this game is not grindy at all. The game frequently keeps you on quests (storyline and otherwise) which level you up as you play the game, rarely (if ever) forcing you to pull off to the side for some time to just level up. The solo-play material is well-handled, as is the group-play material. Gameplay is mostly solid, and the freedom to progress however you wish is definitely a bonus. The quests could benefit from more variety – something Trion should keep in mind for future content updates – and the overarching story is easily lost beneath the endless strings of ‘Collect this!’ and ‘Kill those!’ If you go in expecting total originality, immediate disappointment is sure to follow, but spend some time with the game, and you’ll be impressed with what Trion has to offer.  Rift breathes new life into the genre, restoring otherwise tired old concepts and proves success isn’t always built on originality.			"

												Disclamer: even though it says i spent 331 hours on the game, most of my game time was spent outside of Steam. My real game time spans over thousands of hours.I have been playing Rift on and off since the headstart of the original game in 2011. Back then it was my #2 most favorite game (only beaten by WoW because i was addicted to that game) and even though it no longer holds that place, i still really enjoy what the game brings to the table. It is one of the only MMOs still around that allows the player to build their own playstyle by combining skills and talents into a unique class. It's something i always admired about Rift.Unfortunately, it has fallen from its pedestal years ago and Trion hasn't done anything noteworthy to try and put it back in its place. The trouble started when they released their second expansion, Nightmare Tide. It changed a lot of things for the worst. The story was very dull, crafting became incredibly expensive, there was barely any questing content and expert dungeons were so easy that you could complete them without knowing the tactics. However, the thing that probably impacted the game most was the pure focus on Instant Adventures. They were changed in such a way that they gave a lot more experience and currency than normal questing, which lead to a lot of people leveling up doing nothing but these adventures. This didn't just cause players to get bored very quickly (since they never actually bothered to play the real game) but the new players were dropped off as max level without having any knowledge about their class.All of these reasons and more caused the big majority of the playerbase, including all of the raiding guilds, to leave the game in search for greener pastures.Nowadays the game is pretty much deserted. There are no official numbers, but other players are reporting in a playerbase between 6000 to 8000 players. The game automatically merges the players of different servers together in certain areas and made the chat channels cross server, which makes the game look more busy than it really is. It is very easy to play an entire afternoon and only find one other player of your home server walking around. Capital cities are completely empty outside of the seasonal events. The low level pvp queue died long ago. The dungeon queue is dead. The auction house is barely used anymore. There are barely any good guild around anymore. And the list goes on and on.The new expansion didn't do much to try and make the game better. The crafting is cheaper now, but in its stead there is the questing problem. There aren't enough quests to go around to reach max level unless you use exp boosts (which need to be bought with real money) or become a subscriber (subs gain a passive 40% exp boost from all sources). Another problem is the endgame. Right now there are only 2 dungeons (there is a third one, but it can't be classified as a dungeon) and a raid is to be released Soon™, but it has been lowkey confirmed to be a really casual 10 man raid because there will also be a Looking For Raid tool. The reason behind this is probably the lack of dedicated raiders and the very small playerbase still playing.My conclusion? If i am honest, i would love nothing more than to see more people play this game. I really like this game despite its many flaws and i secretly hope that the game will make a comeback one day. However, if i put my bias for the game aside, i'd have to say that it isn't worth playing if you are a new player. The game's golden age has passed ages ago and currently the game is nothing more than a dying horse that is kept on life support. It also doesn't help a lot that there probably won't be a big influx of players any time soon, since the forums are one big wall of negativity and most of the players in the global chats are nothing but doomsayers who like to whine about the flaws of the game. And that's why i can't recommend this game to newer players, as much as it may hurt my soul to do so.			"

												A dying game...I've been gaming for years. I've spent thousands of hours on more MMOs than I'd care to count.In all that time, I've learned to recognize various signs a game on it's last leg has.One of them is the increase of micro-transactions. Rift has recently taken various steps such as removing rested exp for free players, limiting dungeon charge accumulation for free players, etc to make their patron packs seem more attractive. This isn't an added benefit for payers, though; it's taking away what was for months (over a year, if memory serves) given to all just to attempt to extort players.Another is the ramping up of grind. If you aren't planing on paying, then you're missing out on huge increases to your currency gain. One of the most important things for upgrading gear at the time of writing is Abyssal Accelerators, which are bought with Abyssal Crusader Marks. Patrons get an increase of 40% to their marks gain by default, with additional increases being available from ""loyalty"" (AKA pay more than a threshold to gain this buff) as well as consumables, going for more than a 200% increase.A third sign is an increase in premium events. As said before, this is simply an attempt to extort money out of it's remaining playerbase; an event shows up with a mount, pet or other vanity item and demands money out of it's players for it. Usually, it includes a lockbox or some other RNG mechanic to obfuscate just how much money the item actually requires on average.Next, the addition of previously non-existant ""Login each day to win prizes!"" mobile-style coercion systems. They provide no true benefit to the player other than forcing him to loyally login each and every day for the possibility that he will buy something, and only give the smallest benefits in return.The last sign I want to talk about is the increase in NPCs to hide the fact the game world is empty. The carnival of the ascended is runing at the time of runing and I have seen a grand total of three other players taking part in the activities, at prime time.On the other hand, I saw several dozen ""reveler"" NPCs; they have nothing to say, don't serve any purpose, and in a healthy game wouldn't exist.In a healthy MMO, there would be plenty of players to render on screen instead and those NPCs would be considered a waste of valuable resources. Rift, however, is not healthy.So, all in all, while I very much like the game I cannot recommend it due to it's current business practices, the population of the servers, current progression system, monetization model etc.In it's golden days, this was a great MMO. I might even go so far as to say that until recently it was very decent and a reasonable choice for players looking for a fun free experience. But those days are clearly over and as it stands, this is just the desicated remains of what was once a good game.If you choose to disregard this warning, I hope you have either plenty of money or plenty of time, ideally both; because without either, you won't get far.-Sleepy			"

												Edit: My views haven't changed, but I've rewritten the second half to give some clarity to some common complaints I've heard about this review.How about some balance?Well, this isn't the easiest review to write. Rather than a ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"", this is sort of ""thumbs horizontal"" I guess? There are very strong positive aspects to this game and very negative ones as well.Typically, anything that markets itself as ""discount [game]"", is pretty much going to be ""horrible [game]"". So, Titan Quest is discount Diablo II, Demigod is discount Dota, etc. In this case, Rift is not so much ""discount WoW"", but ""alternative WoW"". Now, I've played WoW for a very extensive amount of time from the vanilla to Cataclysm, so I'm pretty familiar with both by now. From what I've seen, there aren't actually any ""downgrades"".  What WoW players complained about lacking for a very long time were pretty much stocked to begin with, if not pillars of the game itself. These included:Regional events that keep areas changing and make it more interesting to live in, which includes their gimmick, rifts (portals from another realm that launch invasions on nearby towns). 1-2 player dungeons and easier match-making for full five player dungeons. In fact, because of how build classification works (tank, DPS, heals, support), you are assured that every party will be pretty balanced for what you encounter, since every party must have a tank, a healer, a support, and two DPS.Guild quests and better guild management.Mentor level - You can scale your power down to a lower level if, for example, you have a friend join the game and don't want to be grossly overpowered when you play with them.Sidekick (which I don't agree with) - If you are the lowest level in your guild (which is the only explanation I can imagine) and everyone but you is doing some dungeon, you can temporarily raise your level to the party's rather than being left out of the event.Instant Adventure - particularly useful if you are just going to be on for ten minutes and don't want to get into the game too deep.Better UI elements like selling grey items and auction house price trends.Change classification on the fly - Basically, the skill points that you first chose that got you to whatever level you are can be changed, easily. There's a huge amount of flexibility when it comes to how you play your character. A rogue can be played how you expect it to, relying on range or pets, or it can be turned into an assassin, it can be made into a make-shift tank, or it can be a healer.  Even when it comes to a make, which is typically a glass cannon, there's flexibility about whether you want a nuker-pyro or an AoE damage like stormcaller or AoE heal like chloromancer, you can even have a melee mage. The way you play your character has huge amounts of flexibility with both how you play and how you look, I may never see another game with this range of possibilities. Even though this strategy really only works once you've reached level 60 and unlocked all of your skill points, this is where Rift draws a lot of its strength and it's an awesome dynamic.Warfronts (medium scale PvP) used to be broken and not match players up very well based on class and gear, but now they seem to be doing better, a few more tweaks with healing and I think I won't have anything to make note of there. The games are pretty good.Conquest (large scale PvP) is a cluster. And honestly, I don't think a lot people enjoy it because you kinda have to play with your leader holding a gun to your head saying ""move when I say move, ♥♥♥♥♥"". Well, no one enjoys that, but most people do it because the rewards are high enough to justify it. It's more about leader strategy and numbers than anything you do, personally.The theming for the original game is great. It definitely loses it and goes off in strange directions when you get into the first and second expansion pack, and that's mildly disappointing, but hey, don't let it get to you. As has been described elsewhere, the only thing you cannot do without spending money is using the auction house and all of your potential bag slots - and as little as five dollars unlocks those. This is ridiculously cheaper than the $15/mo WoW charges for the privilege of the same service. That said, the devs still need to pay rent, so a real money store is available in-game. 90% of the items are cosmetic; the other 10% are basically broken into two categories: Spend a small amount of money to get a slight boost to gold, exp rates, etc. Spend an exorbitant amount of money to get significant boosts or an item outright. In, literally, all cases, you may not purchase any item in the store that you cannot get some other way in the game. Sounds great, but how can you vote down something you've played for over 400 hours for free? I donno, how can you work at a job for ten years, say you like the work but simultaneously hate working there?The players suck. No really, they honestly do. I would take Dota people over these guys in a heartbeat. I have never in my life seen such a hostile group of folks in a game. It's kinda hard to get immersed in the environment and experience that I just described when there are fifty people at any given time complaining about how much they dislike the latest patch changes or the expansion systems or how their support ticket wasn't answered in the same day they submitted it...every single thing that the devs do is just a life-threatening crisis. Over a period of time, this really starts to affect your mood. But it's an MMO, a platform that is supposed to be around social constructs, communication, and collaboration. It's possible to turn off the chat and play completely alone, but dear god why should I have to do that?On the free hours I'm so ungreatful for: Like I said, I support some sort of substitute for a subscription requirement in order to bring new players in and pay the dev to continuously add new content, since they continuously need food. I've supported substantively in that regard to the tune of about $60, which I find to be reasonably fair for the time I've gotten out of it. To say that I'm shooting down this game without chipping anything in is factually false and irritating to hear.Ultimately? You should NEVER log in out of a sense of duty or sunk-time fallacy. There's a difference between ""logging into relax and have a good time"" to ""logging into a stressful environment of conflict because of your virtual obligations"". It seems like the hostile environment originated by the development team allowing themselves to be treated as punching bags, but changing their mind and punching back. Hard. So, the forums are dev/gamer flame wars, and the in-game world is nothing but passive aggressive condescending tones and internet-♥♥♥ kickings to the minority of people who agree with the devs.I think where I differ from most people (unpopularly) is that I'm willing to say that the developers are equally as bad as the consumer.Running a game you've created for a hundreds of thousands of people is challenging and every machine and gaming instance will be different. People will find bugs and as a dev, there's no hintbook or place you can just google that says how to fix it. Problems take time and experimentation and there's no promise of success. However, allowing a hostile and combative atmosphere serves no one and just lets people feed off of each other's hate. But adopting the same combative attitude as a dev? Is simply abhorrent.As a player who has no stake in the matter: I got my 400 hours, the devs got their money, and now it is time for us to part ways. If I had known what I do now, I would not have enjoyed it nearly as much originally, which is why I can't enjoy it now. Those two sentences may be the most reasonable justification for a review decision you're going to find.			"

												So I tried getting back into this a while ago but nothing worked to peak my interest. -The pay money to get random crap from chests is still there with the dull looking stuff available for people that just play to earn.-From my experience before FTP and now you now have to be a patron to get the same amount of EXP you once were getting just by playing the game so there is no outstanding benifit, you just pay to get what you once had in the first place.-All of the new hero content with the super powered classes are now pay to own.-It is impossible to get a guild together or find randoms to do any of the new raids. So if you want to raid you have to join one of the huge guilds and hope to get on the D, E, F, or G team and pray that they are able to do more than pick their nose and stand in the red.-The conflict between factions is a crock now, BUT you still get attacked by the other faction's guards when not on a pvp server.-The chats are spammed by rude children tearing out every last ball hair they have managed to grow in a flame war because who knows.-People will kick you out of a random dungeon if you don't know it, so don't expect to pick the game up and play without having at least 4 friends to probe anything new.-No one. And I mean no one. Is around doing the seasonal stuff. Which is mostly recycled.-All except the largest or latest towns are deserted, most likely due to the lack of players advancing through the game.-The game is suffering from copy/paste creatures that might have a different tint and a new name::Please note this is based on personal experience and my views only reflect my feelings and what I had witnessed the last time I logged on, if the game has improved please let me know in the comments so I can take another look at the game, Thanks!::			"

												Man, memories were had with this once-fantastic game.Years ago, I ran a guild on Laethy's, the Oceanic server, I met lots of friends, some even lifelong, enjoyed countless dungeons and raids, beautiful cosmetics and skins, great classes, fun and definitive PVP, AMAZING dungeons and party system, beautiful home worlds for clans, and I even loved the grind of doing all the quests and how beautiful each area looked. It was honestly one of the best MMO's that rivaled even Gw2 and WOW at its prime.However, that was years ago, and the game has been squandered since, turning into a typical pay2win grindfest, in which the community has dwindled and the game isnt enjoyable, Im sad that Trion killed such a fantastic game (I think it was because of Archeage, which flopped anyway).RIP RIFT, you were my first and only MMO i really ever enjoyed, thanks for all the memories.

												Best MMO out there. ..and I've played a lot of them. Always come back to Rift.It has everything that made old WoW fun plus way better graphics. On max settings this game is insanely beautiful. You have the standard 5 man dungeons and group raids but then you also 1 and 2 person chronicles as well. Add to that random Rift raids that appear anywhere in the world that anyone in the area can join as well. Then you have random area events that occur that anyone in the area can help achieve and defeat. Random world boss encounters. Artifact hunting which offer achievements, pets and lore as rewards among other things. Smooth easy to use crafting system. Huge customizable skill tree and class system with mindboggling amount of ways to setup and use your classes and skills. Fully customizable dimensions(personal houising) with hundreds of items you can find, buy or even make for your dimensions. Which people can even visit and rate your creativity. Guild dimensions as well. I could go on and on. Just level past the starter area tutorial and come join us in this awesome game.			"

												Free to Play: No Trials. No Tricks. No Traps. That sentence is a complete lie nowadays, playing as f2p became basically a trial, once you get to level cap, surprise, you need to buy Earring Slots and Planewalker to be strong enough for raids. Want to PVP instead? Prepare to get one-shot by wallet warriors with BIS gear that you can't even damage below 10%. If you want to be competitive in either PVP or PVE you simply wont be even close without paying, I bought the planewalker cheapest (20$) package just so I can raid and pvp on “even” ground (earrings and gear which makes huge diffrence, earrings by itself is like 10-15%% of your stats), but even with that purchase it’s impossible to keep up with the people buying monthly sub, as they earn more currency, have higher caps etc. You might think it’s not really pay2win since you can get same stuff for free with time, well technically yes, BUT it takes so long by the time lets say you get tier one set for your class, the game is already in t3, once you are halfway in t2 gear its already t4 out, etc etc. Basically paying players have huge advantage all the time, both pve/pvp they will simply have more stats than someone playing for free. I used to recommend this game as best f2p mmo out, but since last expansion it went completely pay2win, buying rex isnt really viable anymore to keep up, due to rex prices inflating so much it’s close to impossible to farm plat for it to sustain montly sub like that (price tripled on EU during few months i was playing, I assume now it’s way more especially latest move by trion, making earring and planewarlker cash only)Tl;dr Newest Endgame Raids are not possible without spending money, being competitive in pvp either. As f2p you will only be able to do older content tier’s (most likely 2 tier’s behind the current newest), and pvp is not even worth trying without mid-end gear. F2p is only viable if you play super casually, since its basically trial, but then you might as well go play GW2 which does it better for casual play, or Blade and Soul for pvp, Tera etc.			"

												I don't understand Trion...This game was, IS, a very good game. It has tons of content, lots of class build variety, an INCREDIBLE (and I mean near perfect) cosmetic system, great zone/monster/equipment design... It has a lot going for it. Yet, its publisher seems to get a kick out of making it a tedious grind fest. A chore. The classic ""You can buy this item for 100k of this currency (and you only get maybe 50 of said currency from a dungeon) OR you could just buy it for $15 bucks and skip the weeks of grind"". They are CONSTANTLY removing or gimping free content and hiding it behind their patron subscription system (or purchasing of credits).  Of course a company has to make money. That's what all companies are about. But do it by releasing expansions that aren't complete broken garbage for months after release, or by adding more flashy cosmetic content. More races. More classes (that aren't trashy push one button to win classes). Do it by adding QUALITY stuff, not by taking away already free content and hiding it behind paywalls. It's such a complete damn shame to have to downvote this game. It really is great at its core. But it just isn't fun for new/f2p players. Honestly I don't feel it's fun for veterans anymore either. Not when there are other great MMOs out there that don't take every opportunity to screw over their playerbase. On a side note. I can't stand making ranty, negative reviews. This game doesn't deserve it, but Trion absolutely does.			"

												The ""Very Positive"" rating is basically a monument of how great this game once was, sadly most people don't adjust their reviews as the game changes so this cemetery applicant has been able to keep it's good score.The devs slowly turned RIFT into a p2w and when the game died because of it they decided that the best way to save it is by ♥♥♥♥ing everyone who hasn't bought patron status yet. It would have been better to just make it p2p, because if you don't cough dough you're basically playing a demo. The only thing i wished for when i blew out the candles on my birthday cake last year was for this game to be shut down so that it would die gracefully, but obviously this hasn't happened so here i am, writing a negative review for the best game i ever played, because i get sad every time i see RIFT mentioned somewhere and i just want it to be put out of it's misery.

												RIFT COSTS MORE AND DELIVERS LESS THAN EVER BEFOREI loved Rift dearly for many years, but the publisher has killed it.  It was a wonderful game, and still is, but I can't recommend it.  Spending money on RIFT now is a bad investment.  Even if 4.1 hits the mark it is already too late and has been for some time.  From heavy-handed community management to stealthy and steady removal of content and features, to say nothing of the pitifully non-functional state of the expansion content, this game is circling the drain and everyone knows it.  I still log in a LOT, mostly out of habit, but I don't recommend this game for a new player as it simply has no future and at this point I don't think that can be changed.The old content of the original game is still worth playing if you love varied zones, crafting, collecting pets and costumes, and adventuring solo - you can still do all of it for free.  The player housing feature, called Dimensions, is actually the only part of the current game that is both functional and satisfying.  But if you are looking for challenging group content from a trustworthy publisher with a long and healthy future ahead of it, look elsewhere.			"

												""Patron Rewards Get Even Better""      So yes,that sentence basically summarizes it all. If this is Trion's way of saying , ""Non-patrons experience with playing Rift gets even worse"",  you could not have done a better job. A better job alienating new potential players that is,along with causing people that supported your game to quit. Your....new choices (for the lack of a more polite and diplomatic term) that you  implemented on the latest patch , have already been commented extensively on the forums and ingame,so I 'm not gonna state something that's not already being stated.      What I am going to say is this : If you expect people to financially support an MMO that advertises itself as free to play,while  all it does is sneak more and more subscriber privileges under the radar, forcing more and more restrictions to free players one ""choice"" at a time,you will be in for a big surprise. Why? The answer is simple.      Because people already have a subscription based MMO out there that they can play and get value for money,and won't waste their time and hard earned cash  on an unoptimised product that uses an archaic graphics engine and won't run properly unless you have a 2 thousand euros worth of gaming rig. People want to make the most of the time they invest on anything ,and the most of the money they spend,and that applies to video games entertainment too.And with the ""choices"" you keep making, Trion,your game will seize to entertain anyone very very soon.       So long story short,game is ""free-to-sample"",or at least that's what it has become.I have no hours played on steam cause I only use the glyph client.Thus,I can state ,fully confidently,that you should stay away from it,at least til Trion make amends for the increasing amount of cash-grabbing changes that they keep implementing into this game. Don't waste your money on it,don't play it.  Edited on the 20th of February , 2016 http://forums.riftgame.com/general-discussions/general-discussion/suggestions/478215-give-us-your-bag-ideas.html       So,there you go ladies and gentlemen,another idea Trion's Rift team will want to charge you money for. And the funniest thing is they present it in a way they think is subtle. In a time where games like Black Desert are about to be released,Trion's Rift development team have the balls to post ""tell us what's the next thing you wanna be charged for"" polls in their forums. Well done gentlemen,well done!			"

												First I'll say that rift is a great game, however it has one small flaw which decided whether or not I would recommend this game to others.The game itself is as good I would say as any subscribtion f2p MMORPG out there, better then some actually because the game is actively worked on by devs and lots of bug fixes, I almost never have had a game crash or see visual bugs. The game is clearly a polished and honed mmorpg and is pretty good at its current state effective of 6/13/2014. However, the small flaw, which actually is a huge deal for me personally, made me decide to not recommend and quit the game entirely.This game is free to play in name only, You are not required to, but pretty much have to if you are going to play anywhere past level 50, meaning endgame. And what would be the point of investing time and energy into a game where you hit a pay wall. the pay wall in rift is its loyalty points issue. basically, in rift, you cannot auction. at all. not one item. unless you have spent 10 dollars. and their is a in game currency coin cap. 2500 platinum which is an extremely small amount when people are running around with tens of thousands of platinum.All in all this game is good and i would say probably would suit casual players, but even then the no auction and coin cap rule is foolish IMO on the part of rifts dev team. The rift community is quite tiny and probably not growing due to this one small/large issue depending on how you look at it. But this is the games pay to play wall. Beware.			"

												The best MMO I've played. Really.Only thing I can compare it to is WoW. But there the world is pretty static (or at least was, since I've only played it till WotLK and got bored, so no idea how the things look after the Cataclysm). Here you can get a rift open right above your head if you are (un)lucky enough. There's hardly a way to have nothing to do in this game, since the world changes every minute, bringing forth new challenges.Of things that I like (concerning gameplay):- tons of quests, including daily crafting ones (helps improving crafting skills a lot)- public group option: now you don't have to put the group up yourself, invite each player separately etc; just one click and you're in with all the group bonuses- invasions!!! Those really bring players together (since it takes quite a lot of running around to fend off all the atacking mobs, seal rifts and defend ward stones in different points of the map at the same time)- fishing (holy cow, I love fishing in this game!)- tons of things-to-do-except-for-standard-MMO-stuff: artifacts hunting, minions quests etc.- it's free; like really - everything u can get with real money, you can get with the in-game currency, it just takes time to gather some coin, but it's doableOnly-one-thing-I-don't-like:- Auction House is not available untill you get Loyalty points - and you can get them only by paying real money or buying one terribly expensive stuff in game (called Rift EXchange); but well, I guess that can be forgiven - that's the only inconvenience I met and it's not really a problem - if the AH was available, REX would be even more expensive since the in-game currency would be easier to get or, in worse case, they would make something else not available to provoke ppl to pay; and one can live without AH, especially if u get into some guild where u can trade with your guildmates (or more like ppl just leave stuff they don't need in guild vault and you just come and get what you need, leaving your thing for others).Of non-gameplay matters:- graphic is really great (see screenshots); remember it's an MMO (so u tend to have XX players and mobs on the screen running around, casting spells etc.), and it all runs smoothly even though you can find worse models/animations in single-player games; guys who did the optimization for this game did their job really well- also graphics stuff - landscapes are beautiful and vast; sure the map is divided into zones, but it's done neatly and not hurting ones eyes (like suddenly coming out of dense forest into almost-desert plains)- I like how female models are done; I'm always irritaded when I see the ""very-fantasy"" heroines on high heels, with almost no armor and their boobs bigger than their heads; here the female heroes have quite realistic bodies (like one guy said ""hey, I noticed my XXX doesn't wear a bra!"") and if they're supposed to be warriors, they wear a full plate (even my rogue wears a full leather)So if you like MMOs, this one is definitely worth a shot. It has everything a ""standard"" one should have + some things from itself - and everything done really well.			"

Product received for free
												If you are new I wouldn't play this game. There are way to many microtransactions. If you are worried about the grind, don't worry. The game literally doesn't start until you are lvl 65. Everything before that is pretty much a tutorial.Is the game Pay2Win? Yes.2 Earring slots have to be paid for with real life money to be unlocked. It used to cost voidstone (One of the myriad of in game currencies) they took that away so they could take cash from their dwindling player base.Other features. They sell tier 2 gear on the market. People argue that this isn't p2w since T3 has to be earned. The time it takes to earn T2 is a tedious task. As I mentioned there are numerous currencies and notoriety you have to earn with also a bunch of different factions to even buy or use items. The grind for that is tedious, time consuming. Now that isn't bad, grinding and earning gear. That's what mmo's are about right? Except you spend weeks grinding out currencies because there are caps to upgrade ONE piece of gear. Here is a feel for how many pieces of gear that you can all separately upgrade. Helmet, cape, shoulder, chest, glove, legs, boots, 2 earrings, Neck, Trinket, 2 rings, Synergy Crystal, Seal, Planar Focus and 6 planar essences, two one handed/1 two handed and 1 offhand weapon. All of these require multiple upgrades, cost a VAST amount of in game currencies that is almost impossible to earn unless you have a credit card readily available.And the ongoing insult if cannot perform is “You’re a casual”. Which in itself is dumb. I understand mmo’s require time to get ahead. Yet in this game playing 20 hours a week isn’t enough. You will be left behind in the dust. 40 hours, you better be grinding the whole time. But I suppose non-casuals have played since launch, have been around long enough they already have all the p2w features that Trion has now implemented in their need for greed. So they don’t get the short hand of the stick.PVP… that sums it up honestly. Skill? Non-existent. The maps are neat, the queue times are fast and the idea sounds awesome. Pre-65 pvp doesn’t happen unless you like waiting around for hours for one to pop. The game is heavily, and I mean heavily gear dependent. Forget going into pvp thinking you have a chance. You will just be called a casual because you didn’t swipe your credit card before entering. Since pvp gear caps at about T2 you can buy T2 gear meaning you are good to go for pvp. A fully geared player vs some fresh 65’s could 1 v 5 and not drop below 90% That players skill could be average while the other 5 could be the best players on rift but now are in noob gear. Gear literally makes or breaks everything.Conquest. Don’t bother max gear people just get in premades and walk all over pugs who attempt it. Open world pvp turns into a one sided match. Credit card vs non-credit card. Other factors are people who spent a lot of money on game get awesome boosts like fast mount time, faster mount speed through patron which plays into pvp when someone can cc you and run away and you will never catch up to them. (Very annoying and boring when you actually are winning a fight against team credit card). So if I had to list pro’s and cons.Pros: -	Pve is fun, boss fights are fun.-	Wardrobe is really sweet. All armor collected becomes unlocked as skins for free.-	Traveling around isn’t very expensive using the teleporters.-	Teaming as you level up isn’t bad. Can queue instant adventures, dungeons, and just join adventures who make their party public to share quest mobs.Cons:-	Pay2Win: Buying Earrings.-	Gear grind defines your skill. -	Pvp is not fun unless you have gear. Give a toddler a remote detonator for a 50 megaton nuke, and an Adult who is in the Navy Seals a hammer and a one mile gap between that toddler. That defines pvp. The most skilled can get stomped on by those with better gear. Hammer vs Nuke. Who wins? *sigh*-	Hard to earn currencies, high currency requirements for upgrades, and weekly caps keep you from doing upgrades for weeks on end for one of your 25-26 pieces of gear. -	Cash Grabs, Cash shops. Taking away from players each update to create a paywall that forces you to buy patron. -	Getting a piece of gear and realizing you need Planewalker: Water. Apparently this zone was free which you can go there for free but you can’t even equip half the gear. It also drops in pvp and in dungeons and usually has nice stats for fresh 65’s. -	Game gets buggy, really laggy as well. I had some weird glyphdebugger come up that forced me to reinstall. I have had a few other friends and family also run into this where they couldn’t even play the game for the entire day. Sucks when you actually pay for patron and can’t even use it. Miss out on daily log in rewards and minion quests that you are trying to collect.Indifferent:-	I don’t mind that there is a cash shop. Selling new souls. (Another powerset tree for your class) That’s fine. They worked hard to create that, it’s an addition to the classes and as long as they aren’t some god mode autowin tree I am fine with it. Charging for some school girl outfit, or a katana is also fine. That is cosmetic. A mount, who cares? Other various features like that, that do not make one stronger or better is fine with me.In the end.I don’t mind a company trying to make money. That’s what businesses are designed to do, if it works, sell it. Yet a business is also supposed to try to support its customers, and Trion doesn’t do that. They seem to want to walk all over their player base and then milk them for more money while making them grind for months on end for gear. So if you want to quit your job, stop going to school, leave your kids at the orphanage and become a recluse then this game is for you. Or you can use your credit card daily if you don’t have the time. Either way it’s a cash sink or a time grab. Game is fun, but with all of this…it isn’t. "

												I haven't played rift in quite a while, but it went F2P quite a long time ago and last time I played it, Rift seemed very P2W.The game itself is pretty good. It's basically like WoW but with old style talent trees, more world content and way better mounts. The pve content is pretty good, but the pvp is horribly imbalanced and the character animations are very stiff. It's not a bad game, but it's years old by now and Trion is just trying to milk the playerbase for all they're worth at this point so I'd stay away personally.			"

												Rift was once a great game, back in Storm Legion the f2p model was perfect. It was a bit grindy but you could get anything from the store within a reasonable amount of time. Nightmare Tide lauches and kills all the fun Storm Legion had such as open world pvp and pvp rifts, conquest, pvp stats and gear, and even the raids suffered. Then Starfall Prophecy was announced and people hung on to those small thin threads of hope to see a better game. Starfall Prophecy lauches and just makes things worse. Their planar fragment system is nothing more than platinum sink, our ways of making plat through old content farming was removed, beta testers had quit long before so now we live test for the devs, there is absolutely no balance in pvp, pvp and pve builds are basically 1 button specs now, Some of their paid souls are garbage and the list goes on and on. Here is a video of the best guild and best beta testers RIFT has ever had who were finally fed up with the devs (not game) and decided to leave. I really suggest you watch this video if you are considering whether or not to play this game. EDIT: Guilds like Apotheosys, Coriolis, Critical Hit, Crayons and many hardcore guilds have quit because of the decisions at Try-no (Trion). Therefore, the testing community diminished and the result is a poorly made game.

												4.2k hours in ... I think I'm informed enough about the game to make a reasonable review.Don't play this ♥♥♥♥.-Extremely buggy, no fixes or they take forever to patch-Playerbase is non-existent (especially on EU servers)-With the new expasion game is becoming B2P + microtransaction + optional subscription + who knows what new way they introduce in the expasion to milk their customers-If you want to get started, be prepared to spend some serious cash on the game. We talking 100s of dollas, just to get the expasion pack + unlock gear slots + souls-incompetent support (I mean it, they really cant do anything at all to help you with your issues whatever they may be)-heavy censorship and banning-raids are fun (some of them at least) but you will never be able to find enough people to raid with (there's literally 1 or 2 guilds on EU left raiding in 20men raids)-the new expasion is gonna have only 2 dungeons + 1* 10men raid (but that wont even be on release but couple weeks after)-extremely grindy and repetitive-pvp is unbalanced and generally completely brokenIf you are thinking about giving this game a try, don't. Save yourself the time and just trust me on that, the game is dead and you won't be able to get into any end-game content unless you pay some serious cash. I wonder if they'll change the tag of the game from f2p to b2p once the expansion is released. It would be like saying that WoW is free to play because you can get few levels in the starting zone without paying sub ... but I'm pretty sure they won't.			"

												I'm sad.When I started playing this AWSOME game, it stole my heart.The leveling was fun, the community was friendly and the levelcap ( now 65) was easy to reach but hard to do (<- this is a sentence).I got bored when I kept getting some issues with the logging-in. I needed support. The help never arrived.After some time, which was about half a year, i came back. Reinstalled RIFT. Now I know I made a mistake.When i logged in, (the issue disappared) my charcters, all of then gone. Never paid mutch, but i did.Started again, and saw, the community died in the paywalls of the Dev team. They left their community with a game, about microtransactions. The updates come with the word ""Bugfixes"". I did found all of the old bugs, none of them fixed.This AWsome game.....gone AWful. I hate come back and see the recent reviews, went ""Very Positive"" to ""Mixed"".I can't recommend this game. I'm sad about it. But I can't.Nice try Devs. But your luck has ended. The people started to realize what you are doing to this game.			"

												10/10 - The Poor Man’s World Of Warcraft! FREE and Still Good in 2016!This is one of those reviews that you just can't win. Too many have played; too many have developed concrete opinions. This is just my personal take on the game and how it ranks in the genre as of 2016.The graphics and production values are pretty amazing! If you have played WOW this is certainly one of the closest clones. It's not a copy though; this game definitely has its own identity! There are massive worlds, PVP, bosses and absolutely everything you would want in an MMORPG. The member base on games like this is always in flux; currently there is an average of 650 players playing at any one time. Not a ton; but still more than at times in the past! If you look at the graphs from the last 5 years you can really see the trends and the conclusion... This game is far from dead.  A single DLC or major update can bring any game back to life!This is my favorite game in the mmorpg genre; granted my computer isn't amazing so I can't effectively play some of the newest games, but this one still has it going on in 2016! I just got off playing WOW for nostalgia’s sake and honestly I prefer this game much more so. Rift is completely free to play; being a premium member definitely has some serious bonuses like all MMORPGS. The biggest thing patrons receive is more xp, cash and access to the marketplace. The marketplace was a major factor for me in the past; but due to the current member slump it can be difficult to sell on a saturated market anyway. So FREE is still great.So, if you want to play something extremely enjoyable and very similar to WOW without the subscription... I'll see you in Rift! I've played this game on and off over the years and every time I come back I appreciate this game more and more. Please be aware that the member base is smaller than some games, and you will have to work a little harder as a free member. I've never spent a dime on this game and it's given me so much content and hours of enjoyment.Worth $20; my favorite mmorpg by far! It's really free. Fewer players, but still amazing!

												The ultimate pay to win game of all pay to win games. You can buy EVERYTHING for real money. Buying it for anything else takes a long ♥♥♥ time. You can buy boosts for everything: experience, money, currency collecting, artifact collecting, crafting experience, mounting speed, mount summoning speed... Getting from 1-60 takes about a few weeks, and getting from 60-65 takes just as long (if not longer).  Unless you buy and use those experience boosts (max time of 2 hrs).Once you finally hit level 65, you find there's NOTHING you can do. You can't do raids, cuz you don't have enough gear. You can't do expert dungeons, cuz you don't have enough gear. The only things you can do are nightmare rifts and events, which net you a certain type of currency.CurrenciesCurrency in this game is a way of saying ""♥♥♥♥ YOU, give us money"" by the designers. Basically, you get so god damned little currency from anything and gear costs so god damned much currency, it takes *literally* 3+ weeks to get a single peice of gear. I know what you're thinking: ""Oh, he's just exaggerating when he says 3+ weeks. I can grind that out in a week."" No. I mean literally 3 weeks. Take for example the chest peice for a cleric at level 65. It costs 21500 of a currency. When you're in the shop page looking at the chest peice, it displays how much of that currency you have in the bottom left of the window. When you mouse over that little currency, it says ""You can gain x of y maximum this week."" That y is 7000 for the chest peice currency. 21500 / 7000 = 3 with a remainder of 500. That's where I get 3+ weeks from. And trust me, it'll take you the ENTIRE damn week of grinding the same thing over and over again to gather the 7000 of that currency because you get so little from anything (~100 at a time). This is without mentioning that there's 40+ different currencies in this game, each currency gets you something different, from vanity items to gear to mounts to minions and so on.However, you can always buy this stuff for real money. That little button to buy things with real money is always directly to the right of the button to buy it for in-game currency. For the level 65 gear, it's ~30-40 dollars PER peice of gear.Yes, MMO's are all about the grind. I don't mind grinding, as long as it's well balanced and takes a reasonable amount of time. For this game, it takes much longer than what I'd call reasonable.Inventory and ProfessionsInventory size becomes a problem within 10 minutes of playing the game. There are about a dozen different crafting ingredients per teir of each crafting profession. You start off with 4 bag slots, but you can buy up to, I think, 9 bag slots (for real money, of course). So, your inventory fills to the brim with just crafting ingredients almost instantly. If you ever plan on doing any profession, as you're leveling up, you want to keep those ingredients, but you don't know which ones to keep for which professions, so you end up keeping them all, and trust me, you'll need them. Unless you want to over-pay for them on the auction house later, or end up having to grind lower level mobs and areas for those ingredients.So, all-in-all, if you plan on doing much without extreme annoyance, you'll end up spending $10+ for extra bag slots. For the bags themselves, you can craft most of them, buy them on the Auction House for an inordinate amount of money, or, of course, buy them for real money in the shop.The bank has the exact same problem as the player's inventory, small amount of bag slots but you can buy more for real money.SkillsSkills in this game are actually a positive. I like them. They're a litte bit complicated and are pretty unique for each class and each soul. Different combos are required to max dps, tanking capability, and healing capacity.The basic rules are: use cheap skills and small cooldowns to power up your more expensive and powerful skills.Each class has a set of different souls. Each soul has a different role: tanking, damaging, healing, or supporting. After buying all the ""soul packs"" for the game, you can perform every role on every class. This is pretty awesome for me, because I like to pour all my time and effort into one character and eff the alts. I also like the freedom to choose any of the roles on my one class. This form of purchasing, I don't have a real problem with (as long as it's a reasonable price). You're buying base game functionality that they worked long and hard on, and it's permenantly unlocked for your account forever, not some peice of gear for 20 bucks that you'll have to replace in a week or a bag slot for a character to hold more useless junk.The prices for the soul packs are reasonable, $20. However, in the most recent update, Into the Wilds, they added a whole new class, the Primalist. To buy JUST the primalist and his six souls, you'll have to shell out ~$45. And they've promised more souls for that class in the future, which I'm sure they'll market for another $20. It never ends with these people.It was this last update that finally pushed me over the edge. Previously, I was defending this game to my friends, but now, I just can't. It's too much. Just damn ridiculous.DungeonsDungeons in this game are pretty fun. They require some know-how and can be pretty challenging. The bosses don't just lie down and die, giving you free loot. Sometimes you have to CC the add, or silience the add, or kite the main boss. It requires actual strategy, not just tank 'n spank.RatingThe only real con I can find with this game is the micro-transactions. However, they mess up EVERYTHING. Like every ""Free to Play"" game ever, they scew the balancing to favor those throwing money at it. The developers make it extremely tedious to do anything without spending real money so that it's more tempting to pay for it. I'd rather buy the game for $60, $40 for each expansion, and pay a $15 monthly for it and have it take a REASONABLE amount of time to gather resources, currencies, and gear with everything unlocked for me (bag slots, classes, souls, areas, etc).Playing this game, you'll end up spending far more money than buying the game out-right with a $15 monthly OR you'll spend 4x as much time doing anything.Overall, I give this game a D-. It *can* be fun, but it just costs either too much money OR too much time to do anything. Neither of which I have in ample amounts. If you're either a teenager without a job giving you plenty of free time, or you're willing to throw hundreds of dollars away, then you'll enjoy this game. Otherwise, stay away from it, it's not worth your time and money.P.S.I did play WoW from the tail end of vanilla all the way to Cataclysm. If you want a comparison from WoW to Rift, this game is most like the Burning Crusade expansion of WoW (the best expansion in my opinion). Skills are semi-complicated, talent points give bonuses to skills, and dungeons require strategy. I could rant on for hours how Blizz ruined WoW, but I won't do that here.I will say, if Rift ever goes from free-to-play to buy the game, removing all micro-transactions and rebalancing currencies, I'd come back to this game in a heart-beat. However, I *seriously* doubt they will. So as it stands, I do not recommend this game.			"

												Had the potential to be the best MMO ever made, vanilla was incredible, then 2.0 expansion Grind Legion came out, then f2p and 3.0 NT brought infinitely more grind. Classes are amazing, as is the raiding but at this point it's not really worth playing anymore. Top tier raiding will require either a lot of money, or a ridiculous amount of time grinding (see Hikos' post on forums about the ridiculous expenses of end game). I quit after clearing T2 NT while being full BiS. T3 is a broken raid and they are now dragging out a fourth tier to put off making an expansion because the game will probably not last much longer. Good job Trion nazi's on killing the only good game you ever made :) RIP APOTHEOSYS			"

												so, rift. my very first MMO. when i started playing i fell in love with it. was such a good game, all the specs and classes were completely somewhat balanced, pvp was fun-ish(not a pvp fan honestly) and pve was the best thing i've ever found. i played a rogue and ended up becoming a world first member of the fires of heaven. sadly the game has declined and declined and declined. plane touch wilds was an ""ok"" ""expansion"" if you were to call it that. and primalist is dumb. 1 button top dps is very very ""pay to win"" as people would say. and then the nerf to mind of madness came. nothing was challenging. nothing was fun. and now there is a expansion that MUST be bought in order to play. rift is officially dead.uninstalled.

												Was a good game when it was pay to play.  I had played this extensively before the game went free to play.  Took a break for a while as they made the free to play transition, when I came back, all of my characters were gone.So I submitted a ticket to support to get my characters restored (You know, the ones I had spent 100+ hours on), and support refused to do anything for me.  Nor did they offer any form of compensation.They basically gave me, someone that had faith in the game, had paid full price as well as a 6 month subscription, the middle finger.  Immediately turned around my view of the game and the developers behind it.Fun game if you can avoid ever having to deal with support.  But I will not recommend it simply because of the attitude of the support team.  100+ hours put into my main character, and they delete it upon the free to play transition and refuse to compensate me in any way for it... Treating a paying player in such a manner is completely unacceptable.			"

												So where to start ? I spent way more hours then those 800 hours that steam recorded since i have been playing directly through glyph now when i started this game i simply couldnt wait to get max level and to see what the game has to offer in terms of raiding / end game content , i must say i was really satisfied and the game had a lot to offer it was pretty polished except for the fact that the performance was chaotic now lets say they ''improved'' that. Anyways i remember you could buy Earring slots / Water plane equipment thingy with void stones and that was a great way for new people that didnt wanna invest real money get into raiding and other activities cause yes no one would take you without earrings unless they were a elite guild/group.Before there was no way you could buy any raid piece with credits , soon you will need credits to even click the '' Play '' button and ofcourse you can buy any Raid Tier gear piece that you are missing to get sooner into raids. You could also freely que for any dungeon/ warfront specificly now that is just a patron thing in other words a pay to grind a dying game thing. There is so much more i could write in this review but i believe this is enough to say DONT WASTE TIME AND MONEY on a dying game where the developers are just trying to squeeze out money !!!When started playing Rift : 8/10At the time of review : 2/10 ( Dont feed them any further they just get greedier )			"

												Best F2P MMORPG I have played so far. Its a fun game with alots of content to explorer in a massive open world with lots of events all day long.The DLC's are very over priced and not really woth the money.The in-game store allows you to buy any gear. If you want the best gear you could raid and get it your self, or just use your parents credit card. Gear is expensive so wouldn't recommand buying it with irl money. And whats the point of playing if you pay to unlock everything?Leveling is alot of fun since you can do alot of content befor max level. You're not stuck with questing untill you reach max level. However, leveling isnt going very fast, ofcourse not, its F2P. They want you to buy experiance potions.This MMO is a great example of what an MMO is all about, teamplay. There are lots of open world events, rifts, dungeons, raids and adventures that requires a group in order to complete.Pros:+F2P+You can scale your level to play with lower level friends. Just adjust your own level and you can play with then without having to create a new character. (Exp will scale to)+Good Graphics+You can have your own house/landscape+Great teamplay/group content (and public groups you can instandly join, no need to create your own)+Big open world with fun events 24/7+Not stuck with questing while leveling up+Tons of events with great rewards+Gear looks awesome+Possible to change appearance+Lots of in-game settings that would normaly requires addons+Addon support+Auto quest system (Kill a mob for the first time gains a quest)+Fun dungeons with bosses that actually require tactics+Your talents can make you either ranged, melee, DPS or healer with different ways. (Example: Cleric has: AoE ranged, single target ranged, AoE melee, single target melee, AoE healing, and so on...)+Some classes/rolls are really hard to play wich adds an extra challange if you find the game to easy.+Auto scale dungeons/adventures. If the dungeon is to high or low level for you, your gear and xp will scale so its woth the run anyway. The drops are still useless though.+Tanking mages+Tanking rogues+Healing rogues+Healing warriors... Sounds all very weird if you played World of Warcraft. ""Ye, I'm a lvl 65 healing warrior"".Cons:-Poor spell effects, I dont really feel powerful as a level up-No story (Well, there is one, but its not really worth it)-Fairly slow leveling-No falling damage. Steel bones?-You can buy the best gear with irl money, if you are willing to pay for it.-Over priced DLC's that you dont need anyway-Some classes/rolls are much more powerfull then others-Not many classes to choose from-Bank got full very fast because of the minion quest system that gives me infinite dimension items for my landscape-Some rare mobs cannot be killed solo because they are to overpowered and require a small group. C'mon, we have world bosses for this.-Support class, of which i dont see the point. You could better have an Extra DPS that focuses on AoE damage then extra heals or buffs/debuffs..-To unlock some class/rolls/race, you need to pay irl money, but then again, its F2P and they need to make money some how.-Tanking mages requires irl money payment-Healing rogues requires irl money payment-Healing warriors requires irl money paymentScore: 8/10It's worth a tryEDIT:This review contains alot of grammar nazi food. I'm not even going to correct them.			"

												It has everything, mounts, a huge open world map, a lot of classes, excellent crafiting system, a lot of subclasses. As a MMORPG it is a deep and imersive history, unfortunatelly the game has turn into a pay to win a year ago or so, the community is dead, and it is impossible to have a decient experience on this game without spending money on it.

												RIFT is a complete and full-featured MMO experience. It gots high-quality graphics and high playerbase with an acceptable file size, which is approximately 19GB.Pros :+Extensive class customization.+Rifts create dynamic gameplay.+Life skills system.+Large playerbase.+High quality graphics.+Detailed mounts.Cons :-Some access locked only to buy-to-play players.-Hard to play for newbies, complex gameplay.-Seems like a World of W**craft copy.

												Used to play it before it was even on steam, got 3000 hours in it but I would not recommend it to anyone in its present state. I used to absolutely love this game, introduced it to many of my friends and we had alot of fun. But recently since a couple of expansions  it has gone to complete ♥♥♥♥, ballant Pay to Win, dead cities and no real sense of community. Instead of spending 100$ on ""totally optional"" expansion packs, I suggest you look at some other better mmo's out there.			"

												After 1k+ hours of playing this game and what I've experienced nowadays as an endgame semi-hardcore player. I can no longer recommend it as the game starts to become downhill and the P2W aspects are rising up lately where it becomes unfair and unbalanced the progression paces with the F2P players simply because most of the powerful gears or BiS can be simply obtained through buying of ""Gambling Lockboxes"" or paying vast amounts of real money for their ""Bundles"". Although it's still possible to get them through working for currencies in order to buy them or raiding should you pursue PVE gearing or PVPing for vice versa. But it takes ages in order for you to get its desired full sets in order to advance on the next tier progressions. In conclusion, F2P's luck will matter more along the way to win their rolls on the dropped gear by the boss when raiding or in PUG PVPing is how competent your team is as long there isn't much bads it'll be better.One absurd thing that I've noticed is that there will be a potion implemented to boost your character's level instantly into 60th, what a smart move Trion has done to let these payers SKIP MAJORITY of the contents of their game and just advance forward to the expansion...Also, one critical aspect comes with ""Expansion"" souls (AKA Subclasses) which requires to be paid tends to be the most useful and becomes a requisition in certain purposes later should you do raiding or PVPing. Which will certainly influence a couple of F2P players to pay these in order to expand their performances of competence in more different ways (Expanding different builds).PVPing is broken at the moment  because each soul isn't completely balanced in its proper scalings. A Mage Pyromancer has the strongest ST DPS than the other callings' similar type of souls, a Rogue's Physician whom is an ST healer tends to be unkillable and can easily save its other teammate no matter how strong their opponent's DPS is. And most of the players doing PVP tend to be casual and cares only to finish their dailies with no intention of taking things seriously granted.The customer service tends to be unsupportive as it takes a very long time depending on how well they'll care answering the players' concerns (Varying from a week to a couple of months), which will also end up having a generic response similar to what we'll hear from other companies. Therefore, you'll most likely find the answers for your concerns through the old threads on the forum.With the new 3.0 expansion. It's even much worse than before. The new currencies have a capacity limit rather than its previous expansion where the currencies have unlimited capacity, and there is no way to remove the cap of new currencies. Also, their new ""Earring"" slots are locked and is beyond paywall which requires the F2Ps to farm tremendous amounts of currencies which takes around one whole month to farm that non-stop without resorting to the usage of boosts or patrons. This kind of business model they're doing is ramping up to tremendously waste your time to achieve this, and I'd say it's not worth it. Let alone paying them up which I think is around $20-25 is better despite you can earn that amount in less than a month.Same goes from the other things they have introduced. Such as the Planewalker: Water is the same way of unlocking the Earring slots. There are several amounts of new gears in the game that requires you to have this attunement, or you cannot equip them. Then the new factions which are extremely tough to level their notoriety when you're unbuffed, it's also the same as leveling up your character in that region. There is a couple of players who have completed everything in the three new zones (Main/Side Quests and Carnage), and they still ended up around the 63 or 64th level which is ridiculous.I'm very disappointed for what they have done in this game. Everything was just fine during Storm Legion. Until they made it much worse to change their business model to cater more in P2Ws than F2Ps. Their motto ""No trials, no tricks, no traps"" is becoming a lie except that the game is still free to play without trial periods.			"

												I downloaded rift recently, while itching to play an mmo where I could sling spells from a distance and had some nice bredth of classes.Playing as a 'Reaper,' on the both fronts I was not disappointed. Although the information on Rift's website is rather vague and the wiki isn't much better, there's a satisfying depth to each 'calling.' Callings are your basic fantasy classes of Mage, Rogue, Warrior and Cleric. Within these 'callings' there are a variety of skill trees, of which the player may choose three, although there are in-game guides to help the player with recommended combinations which synergise well. You may also change which three 'soul trees' you're using and redistribute points, when not in combat.After your beginning instance, you're let out into the world to do you generic WoW-esque questing. Some small villages centre on teaching you about skills like fishing and survival or crafting professions. One introduces you to 'dimensions,' which are basically small home instances for you to decorate, although figuring out how to get there requires fumbling through various interfaces. W/r dimensions, the ability to rotate and adjust objects on xyz axes is nice and it's pretty smooth too.The negative aspects are however, quite significant. The questing system, graphical style and f2p model feel very reminiscent of various Asian f2p mmorpgs, which are lagging behind in the genre somewhat. In this regard, the game feels very same-y, there's not much I can get from it that I couldn't get from ArchAge or Jade Dynasty, the prior of which has cool things like boats, trans-continental trade and pvp against pirates at sea, to make it stand out some more.Like a f2p Asian mmo, Rift also suffers from the over-zealous use of premium currencies, boosts and other micro-transactions that we're all familiar with by now. As other reviews have pointed out, throwing money at the game gives you the ability to bypass a lot of the levelling(which makes up a lot of the content) and removes a lot of the grind. Not to mention that small cosmetic changes, like changing hair or character's gender costs thousands in this currency. Saving up for your first mount is instead chump change, if you choose to buy premium currency, something which I feel cheapens many aspects of the game. Rift is not shy about advertising patronship to the player either, including a button which is visible on-screen at all times, unless the player deliberately changes the ui layout to conceal it.The dimension home-instances seem like another way to squeeze money out of the player, by encouraging them to purchase furniture using premium currency, as much of the items above-beginner level became substantially more expensive.Lastly, although there's a sustantial effort made to explain how the 'soul tree' skill tree system works, there are other areas of the game which require more explanation. A number of quests required that I craft say a fishing lure, but gave no explanation as to how to do that. Instead, I had to read through the dialogue to find instructions clearly added in after much player confusion and frustration. Granted, I would have seen this had I read the dialogue the first time, but so much of the questing was so very boring and outdated that I had little motivation to really care about why I was collecting 10 Mutated Meat or killing 8 undead. Again, there's little information on either the website or the wiki, regarding this.I don't have anything against the game, nigh pay-to-win features aside, but it's just not very good. If it wasn't f2p I wouldn't have played it at all and I have a hard time believing people once willingly paid a continual subscription to experience Rift. The good features of the game are unfortunately drowned out by the more generic or out-dated aspects and what enjoyment I did get out of it, quickly drew to a close.			"

												It's a lot like WoW before Kung Fu Panda and Pokemon took a steaming ♥♥♥♥ on it. The visuals are great, supersampling for the higher end computers. Interesting dungeons, with tons of things to distract you from the monotony of questing. Good crafting. Decent community, though every Shard has it's trolls. It just wouldn't be an MMO without them.Only real complaint about the game is slightly sluggish combat. The developers went for style before fluidity, but with any luck that will be improved with the next expansion.Best of all, completely free to play and yes there are features that are held back from you as a free player (eg. limited bag slots, character slots), but that doesn't really harm the experience and the game is completely playable, and enjoyable in it's entirety without spending a penny.

												Back when this game had a subscription fee and decent raiding, it was actually quite a great game.In fact, it was so great, that I played this over World of Warcraft.However since it became free to play, it also became pay to win.The game is now an extremely slow grind, the content updates are mediocre and feel unfinished.I reinstall the game every now and then because I forgot why I stopped playing it.. Only to quickly find out why I uninstalled it. Sad.They should have stuck with the subscription model, it worked out much better.Interesting to see that the game is actually worse when it comes to optimisation than it was at launch though.It's clear where they're putting all their effort.

												So i baught this game long ago before the game was free to play, then came free to play and the game was good. Left the game and only returned recently. Started a new char as i couldnt remember anything about the game and all went fine, in fact i liked the game a lot! Gameplay is solid, questing is good and is a nice alternative if you dont do pay to play. At around lvl20 i thought well i need better gear so let me queue for a dungeon. Hours in the line and no group found... that kinda broke the game for me, a newbe who wants to  see all that there is to see couldnt even do some dungeons. Basically if you are new to the game and you dont have a max lvl char and what to experience the complete game then dont do it. After playing some rift i thought ill give Guild Wars 2 a go again and after 5 mins in GW2 my time spent in rift felt like a complete waste. If you are looking for a good mmorpg my  suggestions will be to leave rift and get either GW2 or WoW. Rift has great potential but at the end of the day there are better games out there. Great potential but i think the free to play move was something that hurt them.			"

												Please note the hours I have put into this game. I've been playing for 3 years now, and I am very particular about MMOs. I also don't like to spend money without justification. The only money I spend in RIFT on a regular basis is when I feel like I want to buy a new mount or some kind of consumable. You don't have to pay anything to enjoy this game or have access to the content.I have played most of the content solo, but it is much faster and more fun if you have friends to play with you. One of the new features Trion has implemented is sorting new players into starter guilds (defiants or guardians) on each server (shard). This helps new players find other players, so don't stress about being lost.There are many people in the game, despite other statements in the reviews. Many of the older, larger guilds have died out, but there are lots of smaller, newer ones that are active and growing. Find them and you'll find the happy, thriving player base that makes the game enjoyable.You don't have to buy the Soul packs to play effective character builds. You don't have to be a patron to get things accomplished -- it just expedites some tasks and adds conveniences. You don't have to have full raid gear. Trion has simplified many facets of the game in the time I have played it, mostly for the betterment and greater enjoyment of the game. If you feel like you DO need to buy the soul packs and expansion goodies, wait until there's a sale. You can get everything you want for a fraction of the price if you don't suffer from instant gratification issues.Immerse yourself in the story-rich world of Telara. Explore everywhere. Talk to NPCs. Delve into the Achievements to find fun rewards for doing things that aren't in your quest log. I hope to see you in the game!			"

												if you like pvp don't touch this game!1)there is no pvp untill max level do to low population and removal of incentives for f2p'ers2)max level has a huge gear gap so when you 1st start you will lose 90% of your pvp matches do to no fault of yours or your teams since matchmaking will tend to stack the better geared players on 1 team. (lack of players is also at fult here)3)do to to pvp matches consisting of steamrolling your opponent or getting steamrolled, pvp is unfun. there are very few matches this will not happen in. 4)rift has about 10 souls for each of the 5 callings that you can mix and match BUT 1/4th are useless for dungeons/raids and 2/3rd are useless in pvp. a note: the 5th calling is a pay one with about 7 souls, the 7th you need to buy in a soul pack and since it didnt sell well they have not fixed the weapon procs or the resistance bugs it has. 5)you can p2w to top gear and avoid this. (this is good or bad depending how you look at it) end game gear is only $400 if you want to be ""competitive""6)the rift engine is still unstable even with the new fix and you sometimes get dc'ed normally when your winning a pvp match.so what about end game raiding?well do to rushed content most end game raids are bugged for month upon release and sometimes forever after(there are still bad bugs in content made when rift first came out). they are also removing hardcore raids but not to make rift mainstream (like wow did) but do to rushed content people can not beat the bugged content without making it easier also if your a streamer and stream raid content you run the risk of a guild wide ban if you do something the devs don't like or if you have an ""agitator"" in your group. for normal dungeons again do to low population and a change to the que system no ones does these untill end game and at end game people just want a fast run.you can do open world pve untill 60 with little to no issues but at 65 the paywall will smack you in the face. open world pvp is dead and the one pvp server is barren.the game used to be so good with a great f2p model but 6 months back they changed to an aggressive cash shop model and now rush all content before proper testing can be done that will normally crash the server like last week when it was down for 2 day because they didn't test the holiday updates or just leave some things outright broken for months untill they get around to patching it. some holiday events even have the same bug pop up every year that never gets fixed like a Halloween quest that doesn't give defiants the reward. sadly this game was a hallmark for a good f2p model but has now gone the way of the other rippoff f2p games.p.s. there is a item in game that lets you buy credits with in game gold but the amount you need to get is very hard to amass since alot of end game things give little to no cash (about 30% only give 1 silver and thats the lowest amount possible)			"

												1243 hours of Rift, Thats how long I've lost of the time in my life while grinding raids, and pvp. During pay to play the game was at its absolute peak with players on at all times of day raiding, doing dungeons, with the content for the water plane, the game has changed horribly, gone are the holiday events were you could earn things in game now its pay for achievements. Even with the ability to buy prior raids gear when new content drops I felt as though the game has lost its charm and quit playing. I have not played the recent content but I hear its more of the same but I felt it changed and regained some of its charm of its past. I would recommend this game if you are looking for an MMO to play free, but I beg of you not to pay any money for raid gear simply because it defeats the entire purpose of the game and becomes stagnant very fast otherwise.

Rift used to be my fav before and Ive spent a lot of money on it (im obsessed with character customization)..but by time, the in-game currency is not enough for you to enjoy the game, which you HAVE TO pay a bit using real money to keep yourself 'comfortable' along your journey.. so that you wont be the weakest person in that game especially if you are in the PVP zone, and someone who is ""richer"" than you can kill you easily using their more ""expensive"" weapons and stuffhowever i really love this game back on those ol'days.. the gameplay, the way you customize your character, the mounts, the dungeons, good fps and graphic even on my lowest spec pc, the parade (on certain events only)...oh yeah you have to pay a bit to get a good mounts so you can move a bit faster.. the expensive mounts, the faster you can move..TBH, Rift SHOULD NOT be free-to-play game at first place. They should sell the game like ESO or GW2 and we pay to play the game. So that these terrible things can be avoided.p/s: rn im spending my money on TESO (on character of course) :D "

												I bought this game, many moons ago when it released. My girlfriend, and a mutual friend of ours decided to play this while we waited for the next wow expansion. Initially, it was quite entertaining. we ran around as the Defiant, murdering the ever living crap out of everything, a warrior, a cleric and a mage, we were quite the happy triplet, killing our way to the ripe old level of 29. (Mind you, this took weeks. Granted, probably because we couldn't play all that much, but it took for ♥♥♥♥ing ever.) Eventually, our little group fell apart, me and my now ex parted ways, and our friend rushed to the level cap and got bored quite soon after. So, fast forward to when this game comes out on steam, and I try to reclaim my old account, thinking I'll give it another go for old times sake, because why not, right? Anywho, long and exceptionally boring story aside, Trion refused to give me back my old account, because I didn't have the CD code, or remember my old as hell password. Despite the fact that I had the name of the account, the credit card, and a bunch of other nonsense. So I tried making a new account, played it, got bored, stopped. And finally, and the last time I'll ever turn on this abortion of a once decent game, I bought the nightmare tide bundle, got the level fifty, and then realized the entire ♥♥♥♥ing expansion was a zone from Cataclysm. Never again rift, Never a♥♥♥♥ingain.			"

												Its p2win.  Sure, you can technically get the gear for ""free,"" but its ""grind tokens for a month for one piece of gear"" levels of grind.  There are also rare-ish drops in the over-tuned flashpoints that are equivalent to the token purchases.  What this does is encouraging p2win on the left and an obscenely toxic community on the right.  I tried to get back into rift recently, and I had to quit the 5th time I got ♥♥♥♥ed over by a pug for loot.  I'm not so sure how prevalent this was across servers, but the pay-wall and cross-server PUGS (extra-layer of anonymity) encourages it greatly. I'm not just talking about ""but the tank took my dps gear/he already got a piece!"" whining (although that was horrendously common).   My ""favorite"" was when a particularly nice weaopn drops, and the entire group rolls against me for it with the intention of preventing me from winning and having a GM transfer it to their friend, the other rogue.  ♥♥♥♥ me for successfully healing a tough HM dungeon, right? They even told me to stfu because he naturally won the roll (and for the record, he already got loot too). This also ignores the people that demand you be overgeared to do any content, or try to get carried and wipe the group while not even wearing the starter crafting gear for HM's with some reputation items.  No enchants, no enhancements, no effort.  So success rate in even getting the pre-raid gear to drop was low enough.  Then you had to pray your group doesn't stab you in the back for it when it does.So never play it without friends and/or immediately leave a group if you see ~3-4 people from the same guild in there with you.  THey will close ranks and ♥♥♥♥ you over due to the cut-throat P2W formula the game has set up.  Its at least a 50/50, but my experience was a lot worse.That and its basically all just reskinned content.  Oh look, more of the same! just over and over.			"

												If you are a fan of Wow you will most likely like this game too.Much like World of Warcraft you take quests from quest givers and it is a MMO game. You can design your character and how it looks. Very good graphics and controls for movement. You can team with others to finish quests. Very enjoyable game.			"

												This game has become a major cash hog with pay2use classes and p2w cashshop. During it's former subscribe to play glory, the game wa great.. made a few max level characters and enjoyed every aspect of the game such as the mix and match classes that give you a unique playstyle. I loved this game before, 650 hours will agree, plus the 200 or so hours not logged from using off-steam launcher. But.. now with you having to buy new classes, and being able to buy gear off the cashshop.. this game has gone down the drain with it's free-to-play model and 'loyalty' seem which grants users benefits for spending tons of money on them. I tried playing again, and no.. I just can't. I enjoyed seeing the new stuff, but the Rift I played before is dead and gone. I miss planning raiding, doing end-game high tier dungeons, trying to be the first to finish them! RIP old Rift.			"

												Bought this game initially when it was pay to play and thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was, recently returned to discover that the new model for the game is utterly disgusting. 100% pay to win. It isn't just convenience items or cosmetics which have made their way to the store, but even gear. Unless you enjoy regular ganking in PvP or you are happy to shell out a considerable amount of money then I wouldn't touch this with a barge pole.100 euros gets you 24,050 credits, which may sound like a lot until you look at the price of items, horrific!Such a shame the premise was great. Trion you should be ashamed. Would have been a 7.5/10 for me but the scalping store 3/10 and that's a damn sight more generous than Trion is. AVOIDAddendum if you want to buy tier 2 armour and  weapons it would cost in excess of 100,000 credits, there has got to be a sanity check somewhere ......			"

												This game is dieing because of the devs, they are killing the game by bring out unfinished updates and being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to the community. There is a lack of players due to this now, when I started playing rift 2 years ago there was 3 times as many players that I would come accross on my adventure but now there aren't too many. This leads to a not very fun experiance and long dungeon ques if you aren't 50+ for SLE que and 65 for normals. I would not recomend spending your time in this game if you have a 9 to 5 job as there are many more games which you will find more fun.			"

												4.5/5 RIFT is a free to play MMO with a familiar (Warcraft) feel to it, that does enough to distinguish itself from all the other f2p MMOs out there.Pros:- The class system has been designed with flexibility in mind. Every class has the ability to switch roles, so you could be tanking in a dungeon one minute and doing solo quests as a DPS the next. MMO newbies can play with preset skill-trees to avoid being overwhelmed, whilst MMO veterans can tinker away with custom builds to their heart's content.- Dynamic zone events. You can be quietly questing in a zone, when suddenly, rifts open up spawning mobs and eventually, the event boss.  This encourages everyone in a zone to band together to close rifts and take down the boss, which is great fun.- How you choose to level up is really flexible. Do quests, instant adventures (kill/fetch quests with other players), zone events or dungeons.- RIFT is still actively being developed. Version 3.0 is due soon (end of Otober 2014)- Once you hit lvl 50, a new skill tree system (planar attunement) opens up, offering more customisation. A special set of dungeons (Chronicles) designed for 1-2 playes also becomes accessible from lvl 50+.- If want to try dungeons (designed for 5 players) but haven't got guild friends to join with, you can join a dungeon queue that will automatically match 5 random players together. (Note: the wait time depends on your role, it seems that tanks are in short supply, followed by healers)Cons: - Quests can get a bit grindy sometimes; many are of the ""collect 20 of ..""  or ""kill 12 of ..."" variety. However, occasionally you do come across more fun/unusual/interesting/innovative quests, lifting the game above your standard MMO.- Some zones are not well optimized and FPS will suddenly drop from a smooth 60fps down to 20fps. - Free players can buy stuff from the auction house but can't sell (although there is a trade chat channel available). It is possible however to use in-game currency (plat) to buy something called REX that another player has paid for using real cash. The REX can be used to unlock the ability to sell in the auction house.Recommendation: If you want to experience the fun and familiarity of an MMO like Warcraft, but don't want to pay a monthly subscription, then RIFT will provide exactly what you are looking for. It is a well-designed, flexible game ... and did I mention it was free?			"

												10/10Playstyle is a bit similiar to WOW, and other mmos, but the more you play the more you will see where it differs. Very good, very good mix of things to do; dimensions (player/guild housing), PVP, IA's (questing in groups, no boring solo grind-- unless you like solo... I sometimes do :D), dungeons, story sagas, and more. Try it out, it's free after all. You do NOT have to pay a dime, they have REX, which is bought on the Auction House for platinum. So, there is a way to get credits with in game currency. Ignore those who cry about how this game sucks you dry, they know NOT what they speak, not understanding business within the game industry and/or want everything and anything for absolutely FREEEE. Of course they have to try and make some RL money off of some players to keep the game afloat, but it doesn't mean it has to be you giving them money (leave that to people like me, who would rather spend money on this game, than a movie.) That being said, yes, yes you can buy gear and awesome things with real money (by spending credits--also available in the very active auction house in the forms of REX)Community is very good, has very minimal trolling. (tip: set your settings to not read low level chat, it's where the few, but funny trolls with god complexes lurk...) XDBuy the wings and dye them pink, dance for money, and watch them sing. They will point fingers at you, but you don't care. They are peasants with dull, dull hair. This is your time to shine.Give it a shot.<3			"

												I'm sitting, currently, at about +1000 hours, with four max level characters, so I feel that I have a sound understanding of the game. I am also a former WoW, GW2, PW, and other MMOs player. That being said lets dive into it. 6.9/10Pros:Leveling to max level is easy.Crafting is really easy to understand.Souls are different and easy to swap between.Your bags are almost never full (unless you have a hording problem)PvP can be enjoyable.Pugs are rather realible.The community is mostly friendly.You don't really need a guild until max level.Everyone can be everything.Cons:Some aspects of the game take a long time and a lot of focus to get. EX: you need 4kish Void Stones to buy an upgrade component to upgrade your gear. It takes a while to get the Void Stones and it becomes rather grindy.It's overall rather grindy. Grind raids, grind pvp, grind dungeons.. That's all max level is..Getting multiple characters geared takes a long time so your better off just having one main and not really playing the other classes.You NEED to raid to get gear at high levels.. You need raid gear to tank the dungeon to get the raid gear.The PvP maps get really stale after the hundreth time you've seen them and the dev's don't really seem to care.There are only two conquest maps, and I really only see one anymore.The dungeons are also very repeative and the low level dungeons become quickly tiresome.They've tried to make instant adventures better but they still make you want to peel your skin off after an hour or two.Also they aren't adding more free hairstyles. :(It's a pretty ok game, just try to ignore how some of the races look when they run with weapons or swing their weapons. I noticed it and now I can't stop watching the way my warrior swings her sword..			"

												Huge F2P MMORPG, if you like an expensive world and lots of choices like different classes that can have multiple specs at the same time, switching on the fly from a tank to a DPS to a support. Huge dynamic open world battles that affect the hole zone and are lots of fun. If you like hundreds of quest and interesting story and dialog this will suit you. You can use addons to tweak the game to your liking even further. Definitely worth a look as its now F2P and not Pay to Win.			"

												This game is basically World of Warcraft with debatably cooler graphics and some tricks (like world events) layered on top.  And no panda bears that I've seen yet. I'm very impressed that it's free to play.  I've only played ~6 hours, but for the first 20 levels (at least) there is plenty for a solo player to do.If you like that style of third person, triggered-action style controls, there is no reason NOT to play Rift.As a criticism, the UI isn't especially intuitive, and it takes a bit of work to figure out how to do things like craft or gather resources, or why things are happening.  The lore doesn't seem particularly polished.Still, I'm having fun running around with a buddy, doing fetch quests, and gearing up.  Give it a shot!  Nothing to lose but time.			"

												If you enjoy non-twitch MMORPGs then this is *THE* MMO for you. It gathers together the best ideas and mechanics from the past decade of the genre, added a unique mechinc with Rifts and the result is a very fun to play MMO packed with so much content that you always have something to do.The F2P system is probably the best you'll find in this genre. It is definitly *NOT* P2W and with being able to buy REX for in game platinum, you can purchase anything in the shop. Even a subscription can be purchased with nothing but in-game currency exchanged for REX other players sell.If you were ever a fan of games like EQ, DAoC, AC, WoW, WAR and the like, you'll love this game. It is the pinnicle of what we all came to know as an MMORPG. Rift doesn't really break new ground. It's not a terribly innovative game.  BUT, what it does do, it does very well. It has scratched my gameplay itch in every possible area for that familiar MMORPG feel I've come to love.			"

												Starfall Prophecy is a a repeat of lots of whats already on the maps in Rift.  Many of the images and scenes look the same.  The game has been up and running for five years now and could've dedicated money to adding more design and much better lore along with more activites.  As it stand right now they are using some of the same mechanics for their lore.  this time they actually have narration going on by what sounds like semi-professional speakers.  Also the playerbase has decreased drastically now.  Before the game was largely composed of its starter palyers.  Seems many of them have left, as the devs have had to start putting all of the populations on acombined shard at log in.  The experience is simply not worth my $40, along with a $15 monthly patron and pay for any additonal souls that just happen to come out.   So I've already uninstalled the game.			"

I feel like when this game launched, it was super fun when it had a huge community, but now that it's died down, it's just not the same. They've tried adding newfeatures and things, but it's just too little too late.

												This review is current as of 12/5/16.Where do I start? I've had loads of fun playing RIFT (about 5k hours, just over half through Steam) and do not regret a single moment. I started playing during Beta 1 (though I had proximity to the game's development prior), and from the Eye of Regulos to Ashenfell, it's been a wild ride. The rifts are what make the game world different from other MMOs. They're dynamic events that can appear throughout a zone in a number of locations - in 6 different types as well as variations of the rifts within those types. I still have yet to finish all of the planar achievements, and it's been almost 6 years.Then there's the soul system. While some souls are paid for (3 per class/calling), the combinations you can make with them are only limited by your imagination. There is an argument to be made that the cookie-cutter specs you can find on the official forums are currently better, and that does detract from the original ""any spec, any time"" aspect of the game. Some specs are simply not viable in endgame content, like Druid was for clerics for a long time.The community appears at first to be a mixed bag, but the chat is filled with a vocal minority of trolls. Ignore them and carry on, and you'll find that there are plenty of nice and welcoming players in the game. I'd suggest turning off the CrossEvents channel if you don't care for what political rant there is that week.PvE content? There's no shortage of that - between questing, rifts, planar invasions, dungeons, and raids (past, current, or upcoming), I doubt you'd find a way to finish all of it amazingly fast. Even with store experience boosts.PvP - it's always been a bit lacking, but it really took a hard hit after Nightmare Tide (Patch 3.0), when PvP-specific gear was removed. Low-level warfronts (Rift's battleground system) take upwards of an hour or two to get a queue to pop, and Conquest has been dead for a while (until it gets updated with current rewards). However, max-level warfronts are still alive and kicking and have a different meta to them than PvE content as far as specs go.And the big question - is Rift P2W? Nope. Rift, if I had to sum it up, is ""pay-to-progress-faster"", but nothing will ever give you a solid gameplay advantage long-term in Rift other than the loyalty system (extra mount speed is nothing to sniff at). Most of what is in the store is either fluff or used to get alts to max level (currently 70) faster. With Starfall Prophecy, all content after level 65 is locked unless you buy the expansion pack, but a trial to 65 out of 70 levels with nothing to lose on the way is amazing, compared to other MMOs that limit you to level 20.There is, however, a significant time investment required - in the form of reputation grinds (I use the term loosely), gearing up through the various tiers (which reset every expansion pack), and money in general (Planar Fragments in Starfall Prophecy being a particularly hard platinum sink). Don't let that deter you from the game - after all, none of these time-investment-specific requirements apply to the level 1-65 content, which is entirely free with no timegating!If you have more questions about the game, you can find me on the North America region servers: Maladii@Faeblight.

												I used to play this game through the Glyph app instead of through steam, I spent everyday just playing this, I loved it, there was so much meaning and a great story behind everything you did, but unfortunately Trion has done something terrible to Rift after they released 3.0 which completely messed it up and made so much seem so pointless. Everything below level 63 is meaningless unless you farming achievements. You can't queue for specific dungeons and warfronts anymore unless you're a patron. *sigh* , it just seems like it's become a pay to win type of game so yeah...

												I really wanted to like this game, the gameplay is extremely fun and the world is amazing to explore. However, the more I played the game the more I realized how much of the game you miss out on unless you use the point shop. There are two gear slots that are locked, as in you cannot equip that type of gear, unless you unlock them by spending atleast $20 in the point shop. Also, there is a ""loyalty"" system, which adds a currency limit and prevents you from listing items on the auction house unless you reach a certain loyalty level, and the only way to get loyalty is, you guessed it, spend money in the point shop.   I've never seen so much desperation from a company before. I would not reccomend this game unless you're willing to spend some money to get the full experience.			"

												This game... I adored RIFT. It was the first MMO I really sank my teeth into. I have at least as many non-Steam hours in RIFT from the independent launcher if not more, but my god. They went from ""Free to play with little restrictions here and there,""  to ""OPEN YOUR WALLET AND DUMP IT ON MY TABLE WHILE I ♥♥♥♥ YOUR ♥♥♥,"" in a matter of months.Every single thing I loved about this game has been killed off or stuffed behind some type of paywall or another. Do yourself a favor and don't bother installing. Because in a year or two, you'll look back, miss what the game was, and then realize you need to spend a ton of money for some trash souls and a portrait frame after you've already sunk a few hundred, (if not more,) dollars into it.

												Pros:-It's free. You can't go wrong with free games. Get bored? Leave for as long as you want and come back whenever you want. You don't have to worry about paying for a month or so of game time when you only want to play for a day.-Thanks to Rift Exchanges, which people sell for in game money, you can buy everything including expansions without paying a single penny.-You can transfer characters between shards (servers) for free, but there is a limit to how many you can do in a week.-You can temporarily move the character you're playing to another shard without limit, though you will return once you log out of that character.-If you have no friends who play this that you can quest with, you can just join ""instant adventures"" which will automatically join you to a raid group. You will even be brought up or down to the level of the group's quests temporarily.-If you want to go back and do a certain dungeon but you're too high of a level to normally be in a group, the game will automatically bring you down to the level of that group.-This game is in no way pay to win. Everything you can buy you can earn the equivalent of. No one class is really better than another. Also like I said above, you can buy absolutely everything with in game money.Cons:-Not a lot of people are low level so you might have a hard time finding a group in your level range, and it is very hard to find a group to do dungeons with.-That's about it.

												Rift.New to the game?Want to play a toon that can tank at the forefront and lead your team/raid through dungeon after dungeon defeating hordes of mobs and spectacular bosses? Then go to Youtube and immerse yourself in every video ever posted on the topic of tanking, memorize every dungeon, every mob, boss and tactic before you ever roll your toon or you will be on everyone's ignore list who figures out that you're in a dungeon for the first time as a tank. There is no room for learning anything if it involves being in a team. It's pretty much the same for every class.There is ZERO tolerance for being new to anything in this game. The player community is completely toxic . . . in a nice way.Other than that? The game is terrific.			"

												Y'know, maybe if this game actually LET ME PLAY, I would like it. Ive heard from friends that I was hoping to play with, that this game is pretty good for a F2P MMO. So after about an hour of fidgeting with the account creator, I got in. But alas, right after the character creation and before I could even play the game, I was banned. For what you ask? I dunno, cus they didnt tell me! After emailing them they responded with""Due to heavier traffic than usual, we are to busy to respond. We thank you for your patience.""...Not only did they ban me for NO reason, they also havent responded to my email. Until I get my account re-instated, I am quite upset with this game, and the developers.			"

												Although many MMO's have come out after the rise of WoW and it's slow descent, this one stands out of the crowd.I have tried MANY other MMO's, but not live up to this one in comparison. Although Rift is F2P, do  not be mistaken. It is not pay to win. IS a large game, so I cannot cover it all, but I will cover a good portion. Pros: Introduces rifts, something unique to this MMO.has a very special talent/skill tree system that varies greatly and can be used many different ways and still be effective.Cons:Races aren't extremely different=Poor Machinima abilities.Being inside cities on anything but low or minimum graphics will kill your average computer.Don't get me wrong, I love Rift but it isn't my favorite all time MMO, my favorite is what WoW used to be but Rift is the best MMO around currently.

												Game was great about 3 or so years ago...once it got released onto steam, it slowly started changing scope.  The playerbase is dwindling.  The game suffers the same fate as many MMOs...you release new content and then realize that once you do that, there is zero reason for the playerbase to visit the ""old game areas"" that were fun and populated unless they are grinding a new character.  Worst part about the game is the releasing of new sub-classes or ""souls"" that you need to buy and are often times overpowered.  LIke has been mentioned as well, the game is laggy even with the smaller playerbase and just doesn't feel like the old game at all.  Can't recommend it anymore.			"

												This game once had potential. As many other reviews have pointed out, It has become pay2win trash and you're heavily crippled if you aren't giving Trion a hefty sum of cash. Please do not reward their predatorial business model.			"

												This may have been one of the better MMO's out there.  They took what was good about WOW, and in some cases improved upon it.  Crafting/combat and professions are decent.  The lore and background writing are very good.  Questing isn't too much of a grind.  Graphics are quite good also. The problem?  You can play for free, but it's tough.  Extra bank slots, etc. cost money.  You have to have credits/REX to purchase these things and boy do they make sure that EVERYTHING can be upgraded for a price.  You can buy REX with ingame money, but it takes a lot of platinum and that takes a lot of time to earn.  Now I got the monthly subscription for $15 a month.  Turns out it just gives you some perks that really aren't that helpful.   It does not increase your bank vault, etc.  You STILL have to buy credits to do that.  So the subscription is not really worth it.  Now I could live with the cash shop mentality and just spend the $15 on credits rather than the subscription.  That would be the better choice in my opinion.  You're still getting a high quality game for your money.  The DLC's are another story though.  Drastically overpriced.  $150 for the Ultimate Nightmare edition?  I played a character up to level 35 and was enjoying it, but the fact that nonPVP is not an option turns me off.  Getting constantly griefed by a 60+ over and over is not fun.  Especially since the server was touted as PVE/RP.   Apparently that makes no difference and every server is set up the same, no matter what it says.  I would happily pay for the game if I had the option to actually have a co-op role playing type experience, but sadly that's not available here.  Conclusion.   If you're looking for a mature, role-playing game to enjoy and not be all about who's the biggest imaginary badass, then this is not the game for you. P.S. The coarse and racist language on the chat is pretty bad.  Doesn't seem to be moderated at all.			"

												6/10I started playing RIFT before it was even full release. (Like many I used the executable/patcher to launch outside of steam even after release. Until I had to reinstall when SL patching messed up, so... that piddly 1k is time after SL only.)RIFT 'was' an awesome game with good support and a REALLY awesome community. The game had alot of elements, which were in it, were going to be in it, some of which no other MMO's had at the time. In my eyes it was akin to an attempt at the 'Next Generation' of MMO.The game evolved and grew over the first 2 years, it had it's share of bugs and problems, but they worked hard and got things sorted out quickly and fairly.The problems started, when Trion or the development group decided to do an 'expansion', one huge bundle of content to put them far ahead and allow them to evolving the game without having to struggle so much to keep up (Atleast I thought that's why they did it...).Following this decision there was a major slowing of evolution/updates/content. It was expected, and yet it had bad results.During the 'Lull' in content, alot of players fell away and some guilds either merged or died out.When the 'Storm Legion' expansion finally came out, it did help revitalize the community 'somewhat', but with the 'X was the first to' seekers and the massive hunger resultant from the break in content, alot of new content got chewed through by some in a matter of days.After the initial burst of players, the population went back to, or maybe even more low than before, with even more guilds merging or dissolving.Trion decided then to re-vitalize the player base by going Free-to-play. (*Demise music plays)About 3 days after the game went FTP the general chat went from asking for an extra for a raid or new players asking for help to something akin to trolls vs gold spammers. Sure there was idle chat and such before, but nowhere near the same magnitude....Going into a random when guildies are offline, meant having an overgeared party that doesn't know/use mechanics and ignores when told, won't use interrupts or help skills out of fear of DPS loss or who knows what and then rages at the healer when they die from their stupidity despite being over geared. Sure you get good parties too, but it went from more like 4/5 with 1 of the 4 being a 'learning' party, to 2/3 with 1 undergear, 1 overgear and 1 drop/lame, to like 1/6 with 1 being OP and playing right and 5/6 still being OP, but being macro only players who only do DPS and can't move or insist on having 1 only macro with built in 'dispel magic' type abilities and still stand still, both of which have primary skill called 'rage healer or tank and DC'. Well, PUGS always had atleast a small gamble element, and there were still plenty of 'good community'. A mature player might have to scroll through 50 lines of text to find a question and 'whisper' a new player to help, but the help was still there.I stayed for a while and played in some of the decent guilds, but even some of those had troubles from bad players joining and having to be kicked or just getting freebies then leaving. I know of many large kind/good/fun guilds that ended up moving to Badlands, Star Wars MMO's and who knows what else. (I think one even went back to WOW...)FTP has not wrecked the game. All the higher tier items and things are not buyable, and there is still some good guilds with nice/mature people in them around, so that raiding can still be fun. Sadly, although the FTP element has been implemented reasonably, I can ohonestly say the move has certainty affected the type of in-game community that's there unfavourably. I would not be surprised if the servers ended up reduced to only 1 or 2. Support in the same boat as FTP hasn't wrecked the game or made it unplayable, but has certainly affected the community in a negative way.Trion changed the handling/personnel of the game around the time of the SL expansion (Not long after release I think it was...)The original support was almost instantaneous in-game and up to 48 hrs outside of, and was very fair in checking logs and being strict but properly compensating and helping.The support now seems more like 72hrs in-game and 1-2weeks outside of (I had patron status if that makes any difference -> AVID trader AH user/trader). And the support became more like talking to a telesales/outsourced helpdesk or the like where you couldn't even be sure if they even knew what the game was called, let alone help or not give 'bad robot' responses.The first big event with a death boss was a good example of this. When I tried to get to the boss it was SO chunky and the game crashed about 2 mins after I finally got there. Sounds bad.... but Trion did patches and within a day or two the event was back up and running I got to participate with only minimal lag during the boss fight. Players were also compensated if they attended the initial event just incase they couldn't re-attend on short notice.From what I heard the last time a big crash occured recently in RIFT, they just rolled back the servers 6 days instead of fixing. :O I wasn't on at the time, but well... I can totally understand some of the angst that's there.If your an original player who loved the game for having good support the current level will likely hit you like a truck full of concrete. Having said that, it doesn't wreck the game, but it sure doesn't make you wanna play/pay/support it.New players be sure to try the game, it has lots of story and content to explore especially if you don't skip the lower levels....For old players... RIFT is like any other thing in life that gets broken... it can never go back to the way things were. You either have to put up with the junk that goes with it or just leave it alone...			"

												I played Rift since the beta, I usually play rift without steam so I could've gotten more hours on record but anyway, rift. This game doesn't really have a good first impression but once you get the feel of it, it gets addicting and can be a legitimite replacement for what ever MMO you are playing now. (WoW.. Cough.) It has a unique class system that pulled me right away when I was playing in the beta. The balancing of the classes are mostly turned towards the PvE side of the game. PvP you ask?.. Well, PvP isn't Rift's strong suit... at all. While it can still be fun, the imbalances can make it frustrating and the enormous amount of 'bad' players can really make you bite your lip. I feel as though rift's PvP is more balanced for group play than solo. Also Facerolling is quite common, so it's best to bring a pre-made party. The PvE side of this game though is exellent, it really makes you think what is the best spec for each situation you are in. Actually, the class system makes the game, it is very good. Once you are starting this game, it is wise to not stick to one build; make a TON of them and make the right spec you see fit to your tastes and works in your favor. There is a lot of things going on the map at all times. Rifts, are a key machanic which the name of the game implies. They pop randomly on the map and when you complete one you could get some wonderful goodies in return. An other cool thing are invasions that wonder across the map, making the game feel alive. But during an event, these invasions can get hairy and could literally conquer a whole area. Your quest hubs will be invaded and even main cities. This encourages group play which is very nice as well. You'll usually be grouped up automatically and fight against the baddies is some type of full blown war.Speaking of wars, this game is pretty CPU intensive so big wars might make you lag, a lot. Any good mid ranged GPU will run this game well but don't skimp on the CPU, god help you if you don't. I would love to write more but I am pretty busy at the moment, it was nice to test this steam grading system out.PS: The ingame store is pretty nice, they put a lot of work into it. Also nothing in the store will give you SUPER MAX ENDGAME MEGA GEARZ. It's mostly costumes and funiture for your ingame home. The lockboxes don't have anything worthwhile inside, though it is good for gamblers or whatever.			"

												First off, I've played this game for hundreds of hours outside of Steam. I have 2 max level characters.The people who think the game is P2W haven't looked deep enough. The shop is deceiving at first glance. It shows the highest tier armor for sale for real-world currency only. What you don't see, is how to get that armor in-game for free.The highest tier (raid) armor is achieved by UPGRADING lower tier (dungeon) armor, which you CAN do for free (quite easily in fact) OR from buying it directly in the shop for real-world currency. The game is not pay-2-win, it's pay-2-skip. You can either take the time to get geared yourself or skip past that and go straight to raids.Now that that's out of the way, the game itself is pretty easy to describe. It's a F2P WoW clone. It looks like WoW, it plays like WoW, it feels like WoW. I've never played another ""WoW clone"" that gave me this feeling I never knew I was missing since I stopped playing WoW.That's not to say that it doesn't have it's differences. The class system is amazingly customizable. Put simply, remember the talent trees in WoW, pre-Cataclysm? In Rift you can mix and match the three talent trees from 11 trees per class. Mix Warlock with Stormcaller and Frostkeeper as a mage, or Marksman with Bard and Assassin as a rogue. Make familiar classes like WoW-style Warlock by mixing Warlock (affliction) with Necromancer (demonology) and Pyromancer (destruction).There are other innovations as well, far too many to go into in this review. However, none of them keep the game from playing like WoW.TL;DR: If you're looking for a F2P WoW replacement, this is by far your best option. It is also not P2W though it may appear so at first glance.			"

												Game play, graphics & storyline was great. But since this game is free, there are a lot of restriction in it, unless you are willing to pay. For example, bag slots, armor slots (earrings). I can understand the game need to make money in some way to keep it running but for bag slots or and armor slots? I personally think it went a bit too far. Most MMO now a days are more or less the same but only apply to skins or mounts, for ""want"" item(s) and not a ""need"" item(s). Therefore, sadly I ahve uninstalled the game.			"

												So I was recommended this game by a friend. Character creation is pretty limited, but the classes/races/sides option sounded pretty cool. I started the game, got maybe 10 minutes into it, was killing mobs, leveling up and all of a sudden I get randomly banned out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere. All I was doing was killing mobs in the starting area, then when I click the link for ban appeal, it takes me to the login screen, well when I try to login to ban appeal, it responds ""The account you're trying to login has been banned"" How the ♥♥♥♥ am I supposed to appeal a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out of the blue no reason ban if I can't login? So I had to make up a random email so I could appeal the ban and the little brats never responded. I honestly want money back even though I didn't spend a penny on it. You people can downvote this review and think what you want but it doesn't change the fact that this company is ♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥ you, and rot in hell Glyph, ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥s			"

												Rift is by far one of my favorite MMORPG games I have played in many years. It has a great leveling system and a customizable abilities and skill point tree system. The skill points can be placed in one of 3 catagories and most classes have 6 sub classes to choose from. It has your standard experience point leveling system and a good crafting system. The mobs are fairly self explanitory just like most MMO's are. Now the community is a little slow. There isn't a gigantic community like WoW but there are some really good people and great guilds out there. The graphics are good and the gameplay is great also. It has a customizable UI/HUD and many positive points. Now I do have a few problems with the game. But that is with all mmo's. The mob spawn rate is a little fast for the amount of travel for the missions. Also it is now A FtP game and that makes it a little bias cause we as free players are stuck with lower stuff and I understand that but there should be a way for us to get the same stuff without a sub. All in all a fantastic game i recommend to everyone			"

												I dont rly write reviews, but I need to share my thoughts about Rift.A lot of ppl say its a cheap copy of WoW. Well, i can tell you that its not true, at all.A lot of ppl complain that they get ban for no reason. Again its not true at all.Rift is an awesome game. Its free to play and because of that you cant just compare with a game who have Subscription.Rift has a lot of unique system. Like how class system works, how rift sistem works e.t.c ( if you are interesed, you will find more and more in the game ).Here, when you start to play, you will feel that ""Adventure "" . An adventure that in a lot of MMORG is lost.Personaly i rly think that Rift is a good game,i like it, i play it, in the future i will buy from them if  i want something. ( and if you have a little problem with money, worry not, Trion offers REX, a consumable which you can buy DLC with, classes etc. all that with game money!I wish you a great day ! "

Grind Till Ya DropOverviewAfter tapping both the ""Yes"" and ""No"" buttons several times in response to the question ""Do you recommend this game?"" I realized that I'm kind of indecisive about the whole thing. My view on it is completely torn down the middle. In some ways, Rift is incredible. In other ways, it's downright terrible. In the end, I find that ""fifty percent"" isn't enough to recommend the game. I have to say, sorry, but you should pass on this one. But don't leave without reading why I think so. There's a lot of ground to cover.Before you comment on this, I reinstalled the game on the Glyph launcher and stopped playing it through Steam. It might not track my hours correctly, but I have been playing for about 3/4s of a year.What I liked about the game:1) RIFT borrows heavily from WoW, especially early iterations of it. The UI is the same, the cooldown and GCD system is exactly the same, the crafting, the queueing for dungeons and battlegrounds-- I'm sorry, ""warfronts""-- the talent trees (again, this is more like early WoW, not the garbage ""three choice blocks"" WoW has nowadays), the combat, the classes, and even the stats each character needs is strikingly similar to WoW. If you've played WoW, you can pick up RIFT very easily.2) The talent trees are intuitive and creative, because they can be customized. You can have a build-your-own-spec based on three trees you can pick from and place points in. This makes for a very fun experience in creating your own class. Many of the best specs in the game were found by other players just messing around with the custom talent trees.3) There is something in the game called ""Instant Adventures,"" a sort of endless barrage of instanced questing zones that you can enter with 20-something people. It's the dungeon instance 2.0, and works great. Well, while you're leveling, anyway. After you're max level, they're obsolete.4) The graphics are breathtaking and realistic. I definitely prefer it over WoW's cartoonish style.What I didn't like about the game1) At first I thought to say ""This game is well-populated"" but then I forgot that only two servers really are. The rest are deadzones, especially the oceanic server. If you play in the UK... you will be forced to play on a North American server, in timezones opposite of you. That... sucks.1) At 65 (the current max level) the game sort of... halts. You will not be getting into raids very soon, and I can guarantee you that. You know why? Because you need a certain amount of ""hit rating."" This is RIFT's equivalent of ""item level,"" except to an insanely unfair degree. The grind for gear is literally endless, and not at all fun. The methods to obtain gear may also be totally obscure to you when you ding 65, as it was for me. There is no set path to take. You might get gear by either winning warfronts (and no, you can not buy gear with the tokens you obtain from warfronts-- you have to get it from the box), or by doing what is called ""Nightmare Tide Expert Dungeons"" which are exactly that-- a nightmare. Neither of these things are the least bit fun to do, so naturally, it seems even worse when you're doing them just to upgrade gear.Now, when I say you might get gear, that's because gear isn't guaranteed to drop in the box you get for winning a warfront. You have a chance at it. And if you're like me, you will lose so many games that the chance at gear is even lower than average. I have so many unspent favor (""honor"") points because none of it goes toward anything special. Apparently, people tell me that I will use them later to ""upgrade"" my new gear I get from the boxes from winning warfronts. And it takes tens of thousands of these tokens just to do that. And yes... you HAVE to upgrade them, because otherwise you won't have enough hit on your gear to do raids... or anything else. So even after you get the pieces you need, you still have to lose hundreds of warfronts, get tokens, upgrade all the pieces... it's awful. God awful.So, you don't like to PvP? Okay! Do NTEs instead. And wipe constantly on bosses. When you finally do about twenty painful dungeons and get a piece of gear you need, you have to also upgrade THAT with tokens. But not with the PvP tokens. You need ""fragments"". These rare, coveted Fragments of Darkness and Fragments of Madness are mostly obtained through daily dungeons queues and months and months of weekly quests. I say you'll be doing them for months, because that's how long it'll take you just to upgrade a few pieces of your gear. It is the most sluggish, hellish, most boring end-game I've ever played in my life. It isn't even an ""end game"". It's just grinding gear. ""End game"" should imply being able to do things at the end of the game.Because of this boring charade, most guilds are casual, because they're forced to be. There do exist raiding guilds, but progression is so slow that you never hear a thing about them.More than one person in RIFT has explained this to me: ""Trion Worlds made the grind so long because they want you to give up and shell out the dough to buy all of the gear for credits"". At first I thought ""that makes no sense,"" but now... it kind of does. You can buy gear with real money in RIFT-- for hundreds of dollars. No average-income Joe can just buy the gear and P2W because it's so expensive. But over months of time... an impatient person could very well buy the gear they need one piece at a time, and it all adds up. I already know a few people that dumped real money on gear pieces because the grind is so bad. I think what they're saying is true. It's all because of greed.And no... being a patron (""subscriber"") does not help with this. You have to grind it out just as much as the freebies do. Which brings me to my next gripe:2) Patron status sucks. I get nothing for being a patron exect a crappy weekly ""gift"" (usually a trove box with junk in it worth nothing) and something called ""affinity""-- yet another type of currency stacked upon the already massive mountain of currencies in the game. Affinity buys you mostly casual, cosmetic crap, and very few things that improve your character. Yes, patrons get bonuses toward mount speed and experience... but the increase isn't by very much, so it's not worth it. You also get ""loyalty"" for spending real money in the game. Loyalty also gives you mostly-cosmetic junk. No gear, though. Or anything else that might be useful.3) Notoriety (""reputation"") grinds. Because having to grind out a faction's rep on top of grinding for gear and grinding for crafting mats adds to the fun!4) Dream orbs. You remember enchants in WoW? Okay, think of those, but only imagine they once in a while gave you a useless stat on your gear that means nothing to you, so that you're forced to sink hundreds of gold on them to get the stat you need. Sounds like crap, doesn't it? Well, that's because it is.5) Lockboxes and troves. Trion will dangle rare prizes in your face in hopes that you're stupid enough to drop a hundred bucks on these ""limited editions troves"" they release. They do that by showing you this sparkly, awesome mount that can be won inside. The chance at getting these mounts is extremely low. It's been tested a few times by people with even more time on their hands than I. You'd have to buy over a hundred boxes at five bucks a piece. Come to find out, people are stupid enough to buy these, so they keep making them. Keep it up, RIFTers. Keep being part of the problem.6) Plat is hard and slow to earn unless you spend real money on tradeable creditsFinal Thoughts""Gear-grinding"" is used as ""game content"" in place of real game content.

												RIFT is a free-to-play MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game. Wow what a mouthful) set in the plane of Telara, a typical Tolkienesque fantasy world with a twist.Both playable factions are arguably good and arguably evil. The Guardians are religious and magic-centred, and despise the technological Defiants, whose machines they see as blasphemy. And this is where you come in; as an Ascended warrior, brought back from the dead to fight the corruption of the Dragons and the sinister Regulos, who want to destroy Telara to save the other planes.You will be sent back in time in a Terminator-esque plot to stop the invasion of Telara when it starts - when the rifts came. Rifts are tears in the dimensional fabric of Telara that spew out monsters from other planes - and fun events where you fight waves of enemies falling from the sky. They're what makes RIFT what it is.With low specs, lack of ""pay to win"" features, interesting story, and fun monster-fighting events, you'd think I'd recommend this game. Well... No. Most of the gameplay (not including rifts of course) is actually pretty dull. I would like to know what an Ascended warrior fighting against the game's equivalent of demons is doing picking mushrooms.I tried out the Autumn Harvest event, as I was bored with the regular gameplay. It was actually a bit of a disappointment - the usual dull grinding, except this time you're given the quests by a devil-like creature in a tiny orange clearing. I was hoping for a Hallowe'en themed rift.In short, the game is for the most part dull grinding with few rewarding areas, although the Devs throw a lot of free stuff at players. I would not recommend using your hard drive space on this game unless you don't mind hours of mindless grinding.			"

The game was fun. fairly simple and intresting to see how different i was to other mmorpg'sComing back and trying it again.... this game is very lackingI check the game is free now pretty cool, micro transaction, uhhhh not a big fan of that but sure but playing this game for a while. i felt like this game is just pay to win or grind really hard i know you would be expected to grind in mmo rpgs but this is like 2X the grinding to the old rift and i just wanna play some dungeons do some rifts meet some new people. Now most of the time its just grind.			"

												Nice alternative to WoW, it really is F2P if you dont want to have extra things like Auction House, but you really can play the game for free and reach max level and get the best gear all for free.  In addition you can farm hard to get enough currency (highest being Platinum or plat for short) and buy an item called a REX thats a $10 item, making you no longer F2P.Its has some features that make it unique like the rifts, and having a dimension (a house basically) which is friendly to RPers, (I just duel people in my dimension to avoid lag or interuptions for anyone)Pretty good.(IMO just spend 10 bucks to get to the point where youre allowed to use the AH, then make millions of in game currency, worth it)			"

												Increased grindwall to wear out playerbase so they end up paying for the gear that would take months to get.Increased microtransacctions.Someone ought to tell Trion that grinding to upgrade gear isn't a form of ""end-game content"".Difference between ""patrons"" and ""free players"" gets wider.It's declining.The fact that even with this Rift stands as one of the ""best"" mmo's out there should show how dark the scenery is at the moment...I can't recommend it unless the player is aware that more often than not, gear will come paying in real cash, not in game currencies, and no amount of time except a lifetime or grinding solitude will ever get near to.

												Game industry is quite big and we have many ""aka"" World of Warcraft games to play. I've spend in WoW too much time and ny now i can tell you that RIFT is in many ways best so far. Nothing personal, I'm respecting WoW, i really do. But RIFT is installed on my PC, not WoW. (Use to play WoW since Europe beta for several years. Im old_school player of 41 years old)You have uniqe and pleasant game play, by uniq i mean - uniq. No more today's MMORPG games can give you so many options in one game at once. I'm dont wanna make any propoganda here who is number 1 and who is not and why is that.What i can advise is just to spend some time on youtube videos comparing RIFT and WoW and I'm sure you'll get the difference.If you love to play MMORPG and in love with kinda WoW game, my advise to you - Just Try RIFT.

												So here i am again... thought ill reinstall and see if things got better, some stuff fixed, optimized.But reading the reviews, that's not the case.Won't reinstall and obviously wouldn't suggest to.Its your typical F2P game, you can (and must if you want to stay fully F2P) sink loads of hours into it, grinding different currencies, daily missions and so on.You can also use the auction house to aquire enough standard currency to buy shop services from other players.Or you can just pay for it in real money.There is nice features, like instant adventures and random groups for instances.The style and design ist bizarre in the nightmare areas, very funny if you like that, i did.The mission system is a bland ""fetch x amount of this"", ""kill x amount of that"", ""talk to person x"".As such the game is nicely done, don't get me wrong.I sank a lot of hours into it and most of them were fun.But much of it wasn't fun and with time that part becomes bigger and bigger.The grinding becomes soo very grindy.And if you don't want to spend hundreds of bucks on this, you will have to farm the daily and weekly missions on a regular basis... soo tedious, like having to go to work every day.The FPS drops in populated areas are ridiculous: 10 FPS for a lot of people... constant complains about it in chat.With the FPS issues come lag spikes and disconnects... lots of them.The anti hack measures regularilly mix things up, many people need to ask for confirmation emails to unlock accounts on a regular basis - many email providers in europe autoflag those mails from this specific company as spam or even won't let them through in any case.These issues have never been openly aknockledged let alone adressed by the devs while i was there.As a result the general mood between players and staff was asinine last time i played.Add to that, the fact it is rather old now... only the starter areas and the endgame areas are populated, in between it feels almost like a single player game.And it is in that stage of an F2P that i'd call the harvesting cycle.Money is made, by offering the same mount like last week - but this time in blue instead of red.... isn't that sweet?Real new content is only reluctantly added, so the long term players won't run away, and this content is implemented in a glitchy manner.Be aware, that after a steam download, you will require a lenghty update download from the games website.

The people throwing out accusations that the game is PTW are mostly from F2P players upset that the new expansion is paid to be honest.  Either way the game is still f2p for the vast majority of content.  If you want to find out whether the game is any good, give it a shot.			"

												F2P? Not anymore... While technically you can spend 100s of hours grinding to buy the SP exansion, you can no longer do anything without it. Yes, there are still are still things you can do F2P, mostly solo now as everyone who still plays has moved onto SP.Yes, you can still PVP but you get matched against xpac players so you can't really do anything because the bolstering system is broken. You are probably wondering why I am complaining about the grind when Nightmare Tide was worse? Well everything about Nightmare Tide were small modular grinds that when paced right don't feel like a grind at all. SP is just a straigh up $40 grind to continue having any fun in the game.I don't know if SP is any good but if you are planning on playing this game without paying you have to grind so much that you will get burnt out before getting there.If you are the type that doesn't mind paying for games, I think you are better off with Newer, more populated games at this stage...Sorry if this seems like a rant, I'm sad that a great game has been ruined by being locked behind a paywall.

												I played this game since beta until recently. The optimization is bad, and the cash shop rules all. When the game first went free to play it was great, but they keep moving more and more towards a pay to win model. RIFT started out as a phenomenal game, the first expansion was pretty cool, and the second was good until they started focusing far more on their cash shop than on fixing any bugs (there's a LOT) or on improving optimization (I can run anything else on max with a decent framerate... RIFT needs to be on low or medium to get 30fps in town).Great game that Trion's exceptionally poor management has ruined. (Kinda like they did to Archeage)			"

												RIFT in and of itself is a decent game. However, there's some things about it that make it really hard to recommend.Pros: - Graphics are relatively good (better than Everquest 1/World of Warcraft but not as good as Elder Scrolls Online)- Invasions are a regular thing that can take over a zone and kill quest NPC's. In some cases you have to participate in the invasions to get them out of your way to do other quests.- Content is split up into solo content (open world), group content (mostly instanced things) and raid content (instanced with a few in the open world)- in group or raid content only 1 person has to enter the instanced and it'll offer to pull everybody else in the group or raid into the instanced as well.- Once you ignore somebody it ignores their entire account (the character, any name changes and all present/future characters on the account)- The wardrobe system is awesome. Whenever you achieve a weapon or armor graphic by having an item in your inventory it's added to a permanent account-wide list. From this list you're able to choose what weapon and armor graphics you want your character to have. - Guild quests are an interesting concept that I haven't seen in any other game. The fact that your entire guild can be sent on 1 objective is a cool idea. The perks gained from leveling your guild up through these quests also can increase quality of life greatly in game.Cons:- On the note of invasions they can also be a con because they kill quest NPC camps. Sometimes there can be so many invasion mobs in one camp that it looks like a herd of cattle except their all stacked on top of each other.- The community. A good portion of the community has made it to my ignore list due to how they act in groups, PVP or in general chat. On the bright side, the game seems more pleasant when you get all the bad apples on ignore.- To do random dungeons to get the daily reward bonuses you HAVE to have a full group. Therefore even though it would probably be possible for me and 2 buddies to complete a dungeon we still have to get into queue and gather 2 more people.- Dailys and Weeklys. You find yourself doing the same 10 repetitive quests because that's how you receive currency to achieve new armor/weapons. Somebody once asked me in a group what they missed because they've been gone 7 months from the game. I responded with ""about 7 months worth of dailys"". - The wardrobe system also has some downsides. To get all of the graphics for armor and weapons you, in theory, have to do raids as well. Some of the raids require a number of people to even enter the instanced even though the content itself would otherwise be soloable in future expansions.			"

												As someone with over 500 hours in this game, I think I'm qualified to say it's worth your time. Is there a lot of grinding in the end-game? Yeah, there is. But there's grinding in any MMO with end-game content. It's unavoidable. That being said, end-game will be the only thing you're grinding for. There's no grinding before you hit 65. And the leveling/questing process is one of the best I've ever seen in an MMO. I should also mention that dungeons/raids/pvp aren't the only end-game, either. There's amazing new questing zones once you hit 50, and all the current expansions are free and will remain free (though the new expac will be buy to play).As for earring slots, they ARE pay walled. BUT, you CAN buy them if you grind out 50k voidstones (which, honestly, isn't that hard). Some of the souls are also pay walled, but any extra souls are just fluff. This game is not, and never will be, pay to win.			"

												After 3,500+ hours ingame, I can't recommend this to anyone anymore.   There are good points to the game of Rift - all of them deal with the players. There are bad points to the game of Rift - most of them deal with the developers.Buggy game is buggy. Devs slow to, or don't act on many bugs.The state of current Pvp would be a joke, if I could bring myself to laugh about it. It's sad.If you ever plan on raiding for the top tier weapons/gear, give up that hope now. If you're not in one of the top raiding guilds on one of the top tier rotations, you won't ever even see a good portion of the raiding maps.Log in issues (search 2024 or 2025 error) blow. Shouldn't happen.Trion devs are in massive damage control mode on forums - dropping permaban hammers on anyone that dares not agree with everything they feed you.I could go on, but no. If you're going to be a casual player who logs a few days a week to have fun for free, by all means go for Rift - you'll enjoy. If you have plans for anything past that... I doubt the game will be around long enough for you to achieve all you want.			"

												In my 63 hours of gameplay, I have come to know RIFT as the best MMORPG I have played so far. With a fun and addictive gameplay, I may not know much about the game, but it truly is amazing. TRION was very creative with this game, and the storyline promises loads of excitement, both with friends and on your own. What impressed me the most hoewver, was actually how they turned the respawn mechanic into part of their storyline. It may seem minor, but that proves their creativity.			"

												This was once an amazing game. It felt like WoW with more depth. Soul trees. Artifacts. Closing rifts. All amazingly fun systems.Now it's an empty pay to win nightmare that is kept alive by the whales who have already sunk loads of money into the game and refuse to admit that it was dead a long time ago.If you are a wealthy person and have a few thousand bucks to ♥♥♥♥ away for giggles this might be the game for you.Trion has absolutly destroyed this game.

												This free to play gem is a wonderful addition to anyone's library (hell it's free and worth your time to at minimum check out).  The core mechanics of the game are fine tuned and honed to the point where they deserve to unthrone the other kings in the MMO realm (looking at you World of Warcraft).  The free to play system does not sway into pay to win, and actually overall has improved the quality of the game from when it was subscription based (I played for 4 months at release).  The graphics in the game are of high quality, but not to the point where it takes the rig of God to run it.  The environment is well done and captivating.  The soundscape is something I was very impressed with ...  from the music to the combat sounds to the dialogue (it isn't overloaded with dialogue thank god) it all sounds just right enough to help immerse you in the game.  The combat mechanics and skill trees have been very fine tuned since the initial release.  They have become quite a charm.  The about of talent customization you can have in this game is....jaw dropping and awesome - an MMO theory crafters dream come true (I happen to be one).  Controls are as most 3d MMO's go, and is straight forward.  The UI is good, and there is a fair amount of UI customization mods available on curse.  I recommend this game for anyone seeking a good RPG or MMO that doesn't want to pay a lot of money, or any at all.			"

												RIFT is a solid alternative to World of Warcraft. I've tried other free-to-play MMOs (Tera to name one), but they felt really linear and they wern't structured that well (if that makes any sense). Not RIFT. This game has everything you'd expect from an MMO. Dungeons, various PVP battles, and (my favorite thing about RIFT) RIFT has A LOT of world wide random events that encourages every player to come together and conquor. RIFT is by no means a pay-to-win game either. Everyone has access to everything. The only limitations free-to-players have is only having two character slots, a currency cap of 2500 platinum (which is a lot), and not being allowed to create auctions (which may sound bad to some, but there's trade chats, no player-to-player trading restrictions, plus you can earn that privilage by buying REX from players with in game currency). I highly, hightly encourage you to at least try it.			"

												I used to play Rift alot some years ago. Logged in again got to lvl 64 and then i saw that i cant go past lvl 65 if i dont pay 40 euros at least to get the expansion. Ive already paid 20 for the souls and i would be happy to pay anything from 10 to 15 euros for the expansion. Im sorry but i'm not paying 40 euros for the expansion, even if I did my friends would not so its a waste of time and money... Uninstalling right now... THIS IS A JOKE. If you make it F2P or lower the prices of the content send me an email... FYI , IM VERY FRUSTRATED...			"

												RIFT is a MMORPG kind of game . As in all RPGs, the player assumes the role of a character. In RIFT, powerful rifts threaten the entire world as they rip into reality and release powerful forces that threaten to devastate all of Telara. New characters, events, treasures, and more are introduced with each breach and rift. The world is consistently changing around you and is dynamic.The rifts have created divisions and schisms among the Telarans. Players are given the option to either seal the rifts forever or to use the power of the rifts in order to create their own power.Thus, it is your choice to follow the one of the two rival factions, that, both want to save the world, but with their own unique way. Guardians are the chosen of Telara's gods, the Vigil. When the tyrant Aedraxis called forth the power of the Plane of Death and devastated Telara, the Vigil chose the most powerful souls taken by the Shade to be the archons of the next age. A golden age awaits, but Telara must first be saved — by deed, by example, or by the sword. Its people must be redeemed, its corruptors cleansed. Only then will the Guardians be imbued with the divine and ascend to a higher level.The Defiant do not care whether the gods abandoned the world or not. To them, this entire planar convergence disaster is the gods' fault in the first place. Indeed, as soon as things went from bad to worse, the gods suddenly and inexplicably disappeared. Instead the defiants worship machines and technology.Enough with the lore, now onto gameplay. RIFT™ has both PvE (Player vs Environment) and PvP (Player vs Player) systems. In each mode, players attempt to uncover the secrets of the planes. The game also features an innovative new class system, called ""The Ascended "" that has limitless possibilities to build and advance your character. The player chooses a soul from one of the four callings: warrior, cleric, rogue or mage. These initial souls begin weak, though as the player progresses so does the soul. As these souls become more specialised, the player will be weaker in for example combat, but will gain magic strength. Players can later choose to augment, or even replace, embraced souls with other souls from within their calling. This is called ""Soul Attunement"".As far as content go, I mentioned PvE And PvP content. PvE content consists of Dungeons, Raids, and - what else - Rifts. Rifts are a main feature in the game ""Rift"". Rifts appear first as tears in the fabric of Telara, and eventually fully open on their own. They can also be opened using a Planar Lure. Dungeons are instanced areas designed for a group of 5 players to complete. Players can create their own groups or find other players through the looking for group tool. Raids are instanced areas designed for groups of 10 or 20 players to complete. All raids are designed for level 65 (At the time of composing this) characters. PvP content consists of battlegrounds called Warfronts that are tiered by level, and conquest, a huge scale battlefront consisting of three factions striving to conquer the zone.			"

												I am very difficult when it comes to MMORPG. Don get me wrong WOW apart from the cartoonist graphics has put the bar way way high when it comes to game play and everything else. Problem is that after 7 years of gaming and a ton of money i decided i won't play games with a monthly subscription. I want either free to play games or just buy to play games. After wow it was so hard to find an MMORPG game and i was looking around for months trying all the free to play games or at least free to try games. I wanted a game with a great content , good community and game play like wow but with different elements and different if not better graphics.I found Rift and i tried it. At first it felt a bit strange compared to wow although very similar. I loved the graphics and the game play so i continued (It is free anyway so nothing to lose apart from some of my free time). The more i played the more i loved it until i fell in love with it. Overall it is a great game and it can be perfect. What i didn't like to the point that i can say i hate about it is   first the macro thing. I was used to play wow with just 3 to 5 keys where i had all my rotations. Here you can't do that . Now about the money. It is a fact that if you want the dlcs or the extra packs you have to pay alot money. This things are overpriced. It is also bad marketing. A gamer that respects himself won't pay that money. For example i see that the DLC is about 30 euro and the packs start from 25. If i am going to pay 30 Euro i am expecting not only few more classes. i am expecting a new race, at least 5 more lvls , and new content with at least 10 new dungeons and raids. a DLC or a PACK the way they are in rift shouldn't cost more than 9.99.To tell you the truth they should be 4.99 . And guess what! The company would make more money like this cause almost everyone could and would buy then. More people would start the game and less people would quit. For 30 to 50 euro i am not expecting a pack or a DLC i am expecting a new game or at least a really good and huge expansion .So as not to get me wrong or cheap .I am 41 and spending 50 or 100 or even more for my hobby is nothing but i am expecting equal value. Today i log in to steam feeling i want to spend  money on a new game or on an old one. This review came from a man that 9 months ago spent 4.000 euro for a new desktop pc and hotas joystick and pedals just to play Star Citizen. I am angry and sad about Rift because i love it and want to continue play it and see more people play it . In order to have that , The company has to start giving value back for the money they want. Content people !!! CONTENT, make the customers happy. Make things cheap so people will be happy to throw some money for value at you. Today as i sead i wanted to really spend some money in to Rift. Call it shopping therapy if you want, so i logged in to the store looking the DLC and the packs, comparing them looking at the price and the value i am gona get and i didn't buy anything because i was disappointed.I appreciate the fact that it is a free game and people especially younger people that don't have money to spend can enjoy the game up to a good point. I was more than happy to spend about 50 euro so far progressively as i was getting to know the game for things like earring slots, extra bug slots, extra char slots and staff. I was happy to give back to you in the form of money the enjoyment i was getting and i want to continue give you money. I mean 750 happy hours for 50 euro is nothing. Plz help me and give me reasons to give you more money. Revive the game, add meaning full contend and price it low so all that can pay will buy it. The rest wont anyway.Maybe i got it all wrong and you are progressively making content and soon more lvls and continents and dungeons and all that and that content will be for free and for everyone and in that case i am sorry cause i got it wrong but still for the 30 euros you could add a new race for example. Anyway Right or wrong i had to take everything out of my chest.Overall it is a great game and you know what ..now that i am thinking about it i feel alot better and will go back in to the steam store and find a way to spend money in Rift . It might be the DLC or a pack or in game currency as a thank you for everything i got for free so far. Maybe we the people with money to spend can help you keep it free for the people without money.			"

												It's a reasonably good game.  It has a story line you can get into and nice combat mechanics.

Requires a PURCHASE. What an amazing start for the wonderfull tagline Free to Play: No Trials. No Tricks. No Traps.I played it at the start when it came out now it is free to play so will still need to see how things have evolved since then but doesn't seem good, the general feeling is still very boring, compared to Neverwinter where the flow of the action is fast moving and fast combat, It takes forever to kill mobs in Rift...Right now it deseves no more then 4/10 I will play on perhaps things will get better but it looks grim.

												Rift at it's heart feels like a complete and informed reworking of warhammer age of reckoning. The rift system is very similar to the public quests however they spawn randomly, are elementaly based, and tie into larger invasions where swarms of monsters wander around a map and it takes raids of people to clean it up! The class system is extremly open, there being 4 classes with each one having 8 diffrent trees (similar to a single tree in wow) that you can mix and match to have 3 trees at once. Healing mages, tanking rogues/clerics, an amazingly nice looking world, mixed with some top notch content for a new game. Once you reach lvl 20 is where the real pvp and instances begin, expect a new instance every 4 levels, then once you reach max lvl progress in heroic instances and raids, or work on lvling up your pvp rank. Rift is a fresh face in the mmo market and welcomly accepts the old style of plays into it, taking heavily form warhammer and wow but doing so with style and effect.			"

												Excellent MMO as it is, but it's also free?? Yeeeeaaaa buddy! This game exceeds  much more than any other MMO i've played AND it's free.Each class has 3 skill trees that you can spec into. Not only do you earn abilities by picking talents in the tree, you also earn abilities by just putting points into the tree, abilities that are game changers.With SO many choices for each class it makes it hard for you to have a set ONE that everyone follows. Personal favorite is the assassin for the rouge class.With a support role added, it adds a whole new sense to raids and dungeons. They can switch between healing and damage with one button making them very universal for all instances.Over-all a very well made game, esspecially for being F2P.Seems rare now days for a game to be built for the gamers!

												After so much time spent in the game I finally drow the line... The thing that drove me here in the first place was the diversity in class system. It offered so much possibilities and promissed that you'd never run into another player with same skill set as you... but not anymore.Game before:-Huge open world to explore-Many interesting zone events-Many ways to make a skill build-Interesting and challenging dungeons and raidsGame now:-New expansion brought a new piece of land (a comet; even though it doesen't look and feel like one) and you have 4 and a half zones to explore (after 5 months in the expansion 1 zone is still not finished)-Zone events are repetitive and the same in every piece of land (kill 100 invasions, close 6 rifts and kill boss)-The game forces you to make certain builds (hybrid builds unusable anymore; tanks that don't make a build in a certain way get one-shotted by the raid boss)-4 dungeons (2 new, 2 old, rehashed ones), ""expert"" difficulity is too easy to do and one dungeon is still broken with no fix for 5 months, 1 ""raid"" (it is actually a 10 man expert dungeon if you compare how ""hard"" it is with no trash mobs) and one old raid in the making that will come out some day (no one knows when)If you are planing to play this game, DON'T. It's not worth it.The dev team doesen't know what they are doing it seems. Bugs everywhere (bugs discovered on Public Test Server weren't fixed and ended up on live server), skills unbalanced (will probably never be balanced), the game crashes even on high end machines... Simply stay away.P.S. Stay away from the forums for this game as well. Forums are highly moderated in the way that any kind of criticism is severly dealt with (any kind of criticism).			"

												I'm a returning player.  Bought the game in 2011 and quickly leveled a rogue soul to 50 back then, maxed crafting to 300.  At some point, got bored and quit and went on to other games as happens in this industry.  And then it surfaced as a ""free to play"" MMO in my Steam queue.  I'm so glad that it did.  I decided to check it out and I'm hooked all over again.  Just a few bullet points for the returning players / original box set purchases on what you'll find:- All my characters were on the trial server.  Easily transferred to a ""real"" server.- If you purchased a box set back in the day, you've already unlocked some of stuff new players have to pay for.  Namely, a few extra character slots, auction house access, extra bag slots.  That was nice to find out.-  Graphics have been much improved.  I logged in once before this and thought, no way, graphics are too dated.  Well, at some point along the line, they did a major overhaul.  It looks nice.  Could still use some optimization, won't lie.  I had to bring my settings down some and my machine is not a slouch.  But neverthless, still looks good.Here's what they have added off the top of my head since I played:-  Instant Adventures:  Think instant raids that level you quickly and give you quick coin.  If you don't relish the thought of leveling all over again, this is the way to level up quickly.  It's also a way to get a ""dungeon group"" of sorts since noone really does the dungeons actually in the game anymore.  Scales to your level starting from level 10.-  Minions.  New collectibles that go out and run adventures for you and bring back loot.  Sort of a card game as well.-  Costumes.  Unlock costume items as you find them and now make your character look how you want no matter what he/she is actually wearing (I love this, won't lie).-  Diminsions - Housing essentially.  You get a personal house and your guild can purchase one.  You can purchase diminsion items to decorate and your minion can go on missions to find items as well.-  Chronicles / Planar attunement - Honestly, no idea yet since this is all stuff you do with your character post level 50 and I actually started a new character to refresh my memory on how to play this game again. :P  I have looked it up and it seems as if it's a way of customizing your character even further however.At any rate, yes, the standard ""pay"" features are in this game as any:- Pay for extra soul walks or wait for a cool down.- Pay for extra bags- Pay for additional soulsAnd so forth.  But they are not as obtrusive as other games.  And frankly, I've already purchased the $24.00 add on pack and might consider others in the future.  I like the game that much again.			"

												I really like Rift, but Trion insists on users using Glyph.  Glyph has to be one of the worst programs that I've seen in recent memory.    It plagues my usage of Rift constantly.  I'm tired of researching workarounds and reinstalling Rift because of this program.			"

												When this game first came out (before it was on steam) it was an amazing and relatively innovative mmo that I really enjoyed playing. At the time it was similar to WoW in that you had to pay a monthly subscription, which kept income flowing for Trion but I guess some time after I quit playing many others must have aswell because it was then recreated into a free to play format and put on steam. basically what im saying is this game has changed alot from its inception and not for the good.

												One of the best MMORPGs hands-down.I've mainly played this outside of Steam (hence the low playtime), but the depth and level of customization that RIFT gives you for your class is incredible, and blows WoW out of the water. Sure, other things (like the dungeon experience imo) are better in WoW, but RIFT compensates with lots of really cool smaller features that add up quickly. For example, if you outlevel a dungeon/zone, but want to go back and grab the quests, you can set your 'mentored level' down, which essentially allows you to temporarily lower your character's level at will. Player housing is also present, and you can view other player's intricate designs on persistent leaderboards based on user votes.Combat is similar to other ability based RPGs, such as WoW, with the exception on the level of freedom that you get to design your own class. You can manually choose all your abilities from a set of about 10 talent trees (called 'souls') for each class, of which you can have 3 active at once. This means that almost every class can fill almost every role (DPS, tank, support, healer), and you can save your ability sets to allow you to change between roles on the fly (eg DPS → healer), giving each character a lot of versatility. Note that as this game is now free-to-play, some souls are locked behind a paywall, although at £15 if you shop around, it isn't too bad.Moving onto the game's implementation of free-to-play, you can easily complete the game (and the expansions – which are free to access) without paying anything, with all the in-game shop stuff being optional. If you do subscribe (£8.99/month last time I looked), you get the usual XP boosts etc that you would expect from a sub to a free MMO. A nice change however is the fact that the game was originally designed to b pay-to-play, so all the quests and story etc is scaled to those at 100% XP rate – subscribing just allows you to skip out parts as you see fit (and the XP boost can be toggled off). This is a nice change from other games like SWTOR, which feels like it's the subscribers that are getting the 100%, with the free players left at about 75%.Overall, it's a solid offering from Trion, which I feel is equal to, and better than is some cases, WoW.

												Buy an expansion pre free to play also get extra content from other bonus deals... get 3 ... THREE days of their ""premium"" content which INCLUDES the ability to use the auction house to sell crap. Oh boy they sure treat their paid players! (buy more to get this option)Then top it off the majority of the player base at all level ranges are diehards that adore every aspect of the game and will victim blame any new user for this stuff then put the company on a pedestal! Guess I shouldn't be shocked given the companies history. Highly recommend NOT getting this game at this point. Low content, weak player base, and a pay to win structure. With all the other F2P MMOs upcoming and currently out this doesn't offer anything worth giving it the attention.			"

												Rift is a little 'smile because virtually every element of the game was caught by some other MMORPG and proposed in a similar, if not identical, to a group of developers whose creative effort has been, well, decidedly modest. And that does not do well in a market that is now lacking in ideas. Despite everything, however, the MMORPG from Trion Worlds is a bit 'a summary of the best of the genre and if it is true that developers are cloners Kaminoans worthy of Star Wars, it is equally true that the final product came on the market in one It was almost perfect, finished, content rich and free of burrs or technical problems: a job that deserves much praise, considering the disastrous launch and the paucity of the contents that characterized some newer products. In effect, Rift nowadays is the real alternative to the two best MMORPG theme-park market, World of Warcraft and The Lord of the Rings Online, and this is not a trivial matter.			"

												I loved all the great potential this game had and I gave it a big try and  put alot of time into it. But recently, Ive been feeling kind of alone while playing it and causes me to fall back on playing it that much. I suggest instead of making all those servers with mid-populations and small servers to just combine them for at least more people to talk and associate with in the game. At this point, just put all your focus into that one server and find a way to get back more players. It has ALL this potential and i could see it making it far, but no one to enjoy it with is a big problem and players like me have gave up playing or just don't play it like that anymore.			"

												Very good and fun game, all in all. They have really limited the F2P options recently and I've stopped playing due to some of their decisions that feel like a last ditch cash grab to the player base. They had a great product, it has the potential to be great again but I think it's very unlikely they can recover from the recent downward spiral.			"

												I really wanted to love this game. Me and my friend bought it together. We went around questing. Killed a rift. Went to lean on a few bushes to gather something. Go kill a goblin, go kill an enemy across the map for a quest. Run across the map again to collect an item. Kill another rift. The quests were all the same, kill this guy gather this item. Now do it again across the map.We joined a guild to help us out with new content but they said there wasnt really much else to it other than maybe trying PvP.Very repetative game.After it went Free to Play I hopped back in. I wanted to give it an honest try and I gave up after 2 days of bordom.I see the appeal to the game, I feel it has a lot of potential but I do not recomment this game overall. But I do encourage people to try it out since it doesn't have a monthly sub anymore. If they love it, then all the power to them to play the hell out of it.5/10			"

												What is RIFT?  Pretty much a FTP WoW, but without some of the annoying crap.  Like playing the MMOs, but also like to do a lot of soloing?  This is for you.  I personally did not care for WoW's dungeons due to the pettiness.  Here, RIFT forces some group play via randomly (and constantly) spawning Rifts on the main board.  Join group, close Rifts, kill mega-boss, collect loot.  No gripping, whining or trolling. Then go back your soloing.For those enjoying dungeon crawls/raids and are not anti-social, the dungeons are fun and sprawling.  The final bosses have unique game mechanics and good loot drop.  The dividing is based on the roll-need-greed system.Trade-chat.  It is what it is.Is it really FTP?  Yes.  You can buy cosmetics, pets and unique rides, but most of these can also be bought for platinum.  The only thing I am disappointed about is that you need to buy into the Auction House to sell items, or buy REX off the auction house to open it up.  Really though, it's only $5 (USD), ordyou can earn the plat and buy REX, which with some creative mat gathering won't take forever.TL;DR:  Free except auction house.  solo-friendly. "

So far ( level 30 ) I have not paid anything, yes there are limits to the free to play model but honestly not been hindered by any so far it can get a bit grindy geting materials for professions though gathering this wilst leveling keeps it fun. Played wow mostly solo up to Cataclysm max level and stopped playing as paying for PVE content in wow lost its edge.

												At its core it's an MMORPG, it makes no attempts to hide this at all.It is a highly polished one though, with a surprisingly fair monetization system due to its history as a subscription based game.The RIFT events especially, which consist of high frequency invasions of areas by elemental monsters that players must put a stop to, gives rise to some excellent emergent cooperation which is rarely seen within the genre.If you're looking to scratch that MMO itch there's plenty worse than this.

I always seem to come back to Rift no matter what.  For those who miss the good old days of WoW,  Rift will be right up your ally.  Great character customization, cool pay-to-win system that doesnt give crazy advantage over F2P players, good story lines and constant action.

In my opinion, it's the best f2p mmo on the market, and provides a lot of what I expect from a traditional EQ-style mmo.As a casual player of this title, it seems like there is always something fun to do, and the game makes it very easy to hop into group content (the Instant Adventure feature is particularly great for this). The customizeable player housing is also a major highlight. I'd recommend this to people who are looking for a free WoW / FFXIV alternative.			"

												  Great game overall, the community is well behaved, and Trion are some great guys. With the return of Hartsman, I'm sure this game has a bright future ahead. That said, It's been awhile since I've played. I played back at the release of the game and cleared through majority of the content at release in around 100 hours.  If you're looking to go far in this game, like most MMOs you will need a guild to get you through to the end. I'd definitely reccomend something organized, with a website, raid times, DKP, etc. There are a FEW people in the game that will try and spoil things for everyone with trying to ninja loot, or screw up quest lines. Though like most games, the rating changes based on the online play - I would never rate a game based on the community, but rather the support of the game by the developers and the amount of content available. Since I've played they've added a lot to the game. If you're looking for an MMO to spend an ample amount of time on, check this game out! :)			"

												I picked up this game when it first came out and quit about 3 months after (stupid friends stopped playing grrr). I have recently come back to this game to find it is still enjoyable to play. Much of the game is as I remember it which is not bad by any means. I restarted leveling from lv 1 again because friends joined me. The game is easy to pick up and has a bunch of things you can do right out of the gate. There have been some changes since the last time I have played and I think they are nice additions to the game. Ill be here honest when I first saw that I had a house I was kind of meh over it. 2 hours of organizing my house went by and I remember why I shouldn’t play games that let me collect things. It was surprisingly fun to play with the housing and I wonder why wow still doesn’t have something like this. The new rifts and zone events are very cool. I have not yet made it to the 50+ content but so far I’m enjoying being back in the game and look forward to playing more.			"

Sure, it isn't even half of what original WoW used to be. Even the world feels artificial. But on the other hand, if you want MMORPG that's free to play and in general fine way to have fun while wasting time, then that's the game for you.

												Listen to me very carefully before you think all im going to do is praise this game just because i give it a thumb up. This game has a lot of faults, yet at the same time it does a lot of things correctly as well. Not specific enough? Well lets get specific. The good things? It is fun, the grind isn't bad at all - you can literally get to level 50 in 1-2 weeks without even noticing it - and still get good gear provided you know what you're doing. (If you pvp, do warfronts, and you'll get plenty of pvp gear.) PVP is very accessible - it doesn't require you get the best gear on the right away. PvE is very fun as well, and is diverse provided you're progressing at a good rate.Now comes the bad stuff. For me this game got old really fast at level 49. I didnt bother to do quests because, well, i was already outleveling them because i was pvping. (Although you could de-level by mentoring and do them to get a 'challenge.')  Additionally, this game is not rewarding. The loot is terrible most of the time - and if you're pvping you'll never ever use it simply because you'll probably have enough 'favor' (ingame currency) to buy better rift store gear, and as another addition, the auction house is locked down until you've managed to either shell out five bucks, or get a rift-exchange in order to get 1500 credits.Now the AH and pvp doesnt make the game. There's a lot i didn't see, and a lot i didn't get to do. Among more pros, the classes are diverse, and you can play more than one role, making switching 'easy-as-pie' if you want to try something else. But for me, the game got repetetive, and in the end, despite the innovations, still reeked of the deriviative mmo-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t most mmo games tend to smell of nowadays anyway. Not much new. However, still gets a 'recommended' simply because its enjoyable.To sum it up.PROSGood and diverse classes. Easy to play multiple roles.Diverse PvE content.PvP can be fun, and is easy to get into.Something i did not mention - Professions are enjoyable.The grind is barely noticable. (Until 50-60)CONSLoot is a joke, and the rift store reflects on this, making this game absolutely unsatsifying in some instances.Gets repeteive.AH is locked for selling (You can still buy.) down unless you shell out 5 bucks, or save a bunch of ingame currency to buy a rift exchange. (rex)Overall, good mmo, but has its fallbacks.			"

												I started playing this game when I got bored of lotro (Lord of the Rings Online) and I can't put it down now. :p I enjoy this game imensely and plan to play it for many, many more hours! This game has everything that you could want in a MMORPG, it has:-Massive groups/dungeons/raids.-Friendly people who just like to have fun-Guilds to make tons of friends in and help each other.-Many types of crafting to occupy your time.-All kinds of different class combinations.-There is even a LFG that actually works!All I really know is that I REALLY enjoy this game, always have fun people to run things with, make friends.

												Recommend this game yes and no. Interesting new elements but thin story make for a boring game. MMO developers might consider paying a professional fantasy author to flesh out a game for them and write up a story to follow. Totally in house seems to create a game where you seemingly achieve nothing at all, just grinding away doing much the same things over and over and over again and the game environment showing nothing for your efforts.It is hard to realise how much a solid story impacts Lord Of The RIngs online, until you spend time playing another MMO without a story, just activities seemingly done without purpose and leaving no result.Instead of playing through a story, you simply spend a whole game on empty side quests and instances. Still some fun in it just a bit thin.			"

												I'll update this review as I play the game some more, but here I go: Rift is a WoW clone, and this is a good thing. At least, it is if you like WoW. It plays like WoW, the interface mostly feels like WoW's, but there are more world events in this game ""Rifts."" The Rifts are kinda cool, especially because they are a feature that is open to players of all levels. I'm only a few hours into the game, and not even level 20 yet, so I can't give a great review yet. But if you like WoW, and wish it was free, then you'll like Rift.			"

												RIFT - a great option for MMO players. Great graphics, beautiful and detailed landscapes. You can customize your character the way you want to by using different souls available within your selected class. For example, take a bit of Pyromancer for offense, a lot of Elementalist for some serious pet capability, and some Chloromancer to heal the party. Rift also has several pre-built options for those who like to get in and play quickly. Beyond all of the systems in the game, the standard things about the game are also very well done. The audio is phenomenal, and the controls are pretty intuitive. Glitches are very infrequent, and minor anyway. Besides, the game is still fairly new so such things are to be expected. Leveling up in this game is not grindy at all. The game frequently keeps you on quests (storyline and otherwise) which level you up as you play the game, rarely (if ever) forcing you to pull off to the side for some time to just level up. The solo-play material is well-handled, as is the group-play material. Gameplay is mostly solid, and the freedom to progress however you wish is definitely a bonus. The quests could benefit from more variety – something Trion should keep in mind for future content updates – and the overarching story is easily lost beneath the endless strings of ‘Collect this!’ and ‘Kill those!’ If you go in expecting total originality, immediate disappointment is sure to follow, but spend some time with the game, and you’ll be impressed with what Trion has to offer. Rift breathes new life into the genre, restoring otherwise tired old concepts and proves success isn’t always built on originality.			"

												Horribly overpriced for what you get. ALOT of grind for tokens, reputations and such before you even can get into the core of the game. Without paying for that grind you basically have to be unemployed to have the time. Gets small constant update but it's all cosmetics usually like new mounts that you have to play up to 20$ for (and some are just remakes with new colors). New raid gets released a few times a year but all it does is make your gear obsolete so you have to start over from zero again. Community is your standard toxic and elitism, although you can find a new player friend guild and enoy it at your own pace. On the good side I think the core of the game is quite good, I love the classic skill system where you can customize your characther tot the max, eventho there will always be a ""best meta"". The class variation is also good and each class has a different feel for it (Melee, Ranged, Magic, Healer or Tank). The PvE is quite good and if you've played WoW you'll find yourself almost as home. I'd play this game 100% of my spare time if I didnt have to spend almost 100$ / month to stay competetive (this is after the monthly patron payment). In it's current state I'd advice you to stay away until they lower prices, alot, and even remove some of the pay walls.			"

												From launch through the first year of free-to-play, the game was a joy: beautiful scenery, well-executed dynamic content, and lots to do from pvp to dungeons to fun open world to chasing artifacts.In the last year, however, it has steadily gone down hill as the publisher has squeezed the screws to harvest more money from the players and the somewhat old engine has become decidedly creaky with poor frame rate, frequent crashes, and very annoying visual bugs. The latter is probably also money related since it appears they have cut developer staff to the bone and they can't afford or choose not to invest further in the core engine.It is free to play, so you can get a taste of it at little risk but not likely to be a long term game for anyone these days.

												Having logged 700+ hours on my old account, I installed it on this one simply to write this review. And I can safely say this is the best F2P MMORPG you will ever play.Pros:1) Even though the combat is tab target, it manages to retain aq dynamic feel. All your skills work together in some way so finding the perfect rotation is always interesting. Combat is also incredibly smooth and is really quite enjoyable.2) The Soul Tree system is perfect and will find a way to fit your play style effortlessly. You can even have custom classes unheard of in most any other game. A mage that doubles as a tank? If you want. A warrior with group healing? Go for it. A cleric with insane DpS? Hell yeah!3) PvP is AMAZING. I really can't expand on this any more. Try it for yourself. There is very rarely two players using the same build as there are so many possibilities. Endless fun :D4) The game has a solid storyline that really engages the players. You feel compelled to continue with the main quest line, although that shouldn't deter you from doing as many side quests as you wish. Quests have decent rewards, such as new equipment and a massive pile of cash. 5) Leveling up isn't a huge grind. Granted, there is some grinding to get new equipment or to get PvP gear. But unlike most, it isn't the same quest in the same area over and over again. The quests can be in different areas, and different objectives. Cons:1) Dungeons and monsters can get fairly tricky unless you keep on top of your equipment or have some fairly powerful friends. Join a guild for a group of regular party members.2) You need a hell of a computer to run this game on anything over medium graphics. I currently have an Intel i5, 8 GB of RAM and a Nvidia 640 GT and I can only run it on high at 50-60 FPS. For max you will really need good components. 3) If you don't pay for subscription, it doesn't affect anything a huge amount but you have a few restrictions that are kinda irritating.i) You can't buy or sell at the auction house. ii) Pretty small bag space. Probably most annoying.iii) It will take a LOT of grinding, however, to get a mount.Overall, a very fun, addictive, and engaging game. Definitly one you should get. It's polished and feels like a paid game. The highest praise a free game could have.			"

												At first, I loved RIFT. The open world, the collectibles and unlockables, the innumberable quests- Plenty to discover and do without ever getting bored, and as a Free-To-Play, no pesky subscription to shell out every month. Unfortunately, in an effort to monetize the game without making it Pay-To-Win, they developed equally innumberable special events for players to complete, to earn prizes- usually in the form of vanity mounts. Who doesn't love those, right? Gotta catch 'em all!The problem: Each event has its own special currency, through which players progressively earn their prize mounts. And. There. Are. No. End. To. These. One is bombarded on a seemingly daily basis with in-game notifications about ""Last Chance!"" this and ""Don't Miss Out!"" that. The stacks of currency actually built up in my inventory, to the point that I was having trouble making room for quest items, let alone all of the crafting materials needed for my three professions. (Seem like a lot to keep track of? It is.) The myriad events and currencies and quests and storylines all start to get so overwhelming that I eventually gave up. It was fun while it lasted, and many players will find this easy to overlook, but I needed a break from the barrage.			"

												Having never played World of Warcraft makes comparing MMO's such as RIFT very difficult to do. As it stands, RIFT delivers an exceptionally well crafted world that's as diverse as it is gorgeous. Lore plays a huge part within RIFT's story, and content is implemented in such a way as to reduce an incessant grinding of monsters to close level gaps, content gaps, and so forth. Expansions are forthcoming and add a fair amount of content at each pass, shoring up the longevity of the title.RIFT's biggest claim to fame currently is the players ability to have near complete control in class building, skill building, and content pathing. Any variety of class is up for grabs, and is subject to change if the player wishes it. The ability to switch between roles and create role-reversal classes is top knotch, and open to imagination. There is absolutely a huge array of variety to be had. The combat system in RIFT is nothing spectacular, but more of the same - such is the case with most products of this type. The PvE content is a blast and is (in my humble opinion), what RIFT is really all about. PvP has its place, but unfortunately in its current state suffers from the ""free to play"" mentality. Trion, in its infinite ""wisom"", has decided to block defined access to most events, and now require Patron status to proactively pick and choose an arena, raid, or dungeon of the users choice. RIFT will undoubtedly continue to develop two flaws for every boon, as its age begins to show. Now, along with Patron changes to the system, RIFT has been charging steadily for certain beneficial upgrades such as extra skill sets, class sets, and availability of equipable traits (such as foraging, mining, etc). While RIFT still maintains its ""free to play"" philosophy, it has also been funneling players into purchasing certain upgrades such as a mounts ability to traverse bodies of water, extra item slots, and generally items and allowances one would imagine to be free or, kindly, earned ingame. Now, generally speaking... these extra touches that cost a bit of money aren't of negative connotation, but if every progressive benefit costs an arm and a leg...In the end, RIFT will continue to be an enjoyable experience tinged ever so slightly with the negativity of a free to play state, and is perhaps only worthwhile to those with ample change in their pockets (ironically), or as extremely casual players. RIFT is at present an entertaining title with slowly developing flaws, comprised of quality content, albiet a flawed ideology.			"

												Well, I honestly forgot to write a review for a long time because I was having too much fun with the game. It's a pretty good MMO and the story reminds me of an atheist vs theist world. Atheists had the power of science and theists were told by Gods to destroy this blasphemous technology. This severely weakens the fire power the people had, allowing for an evil force who resembles Satan named Regulos to nearly consume all of Telara. So atheists basically travel back in time 20 years to a Telara where the beginning of Rifts (It's like the Oblivion Gates) start appearing. As for guardians side, you're a theist that works under the Gods and dies defeating Regulos's shade. The Gods notice your power and ressurect you 20 years into the future where Regulos and the Rift holes start appearing because of your power. This is all given to you during the tutorial, which is not the main game and world of telara. Even after the tutorial, there is quite a steep learning curve and the game will continue to provide new hints, you can turn them off if you want, but I don't recommend it until you read them all at least once.Naturally, if you're in a PvP server, there is more heat between the guardians and defiants. There will be moments where you'll be thinking, ""Will that guy attack me or not?"" And you're waiting for them to respond and see that they think the same thing as well. Definitely adds more tension into the game. PvE enviroment is a lot more casual, so the game works well for both casual and hardcore players of the MMO genre.You also get to have your own dimension, which acts like a house and can be decorated. Adds a little bit more to the roleplay if that is your thing.			"

												I really dont understand, why there are no streams on twitch for this game. I know its not so popular game , but its still the most interesting and worth of attancian game. Ive played only 40 h and as ex-wow player I can say , that this game is absolutly the best mmorpg Ive ever played. I recommend it for every type of mmorpg palyers. Everyone could find here w/e he needs or expects.			"

												If you can play an online game but only focus on single player content and noob dungeons and adventures, go for it. Tip for newbies: every class works, so choose your own. To enjoy rift to its fullest, don't read class forums. 6/10 would be coin locked again			"

												Rift carries a D&D style with not so nicely aesthetic characters, tending to more realistic and practical designs, also bringing a few of the usual races of the popular TTRPG system with your classic ""lots of races that are pretty much human"" like elves, dwarves, humans and similar variations. Even though that's not it's best point (if you don't like it that is), the game truly shines on what really matters for a MMORPG: Gameplay, Customization and Lore.Gameplay-wise Rift doesn't rise above most of the titles of the genre, having at least a proper responsive point-and-click combat that feels just right. It is in Customization that this game sells it's name, mostly in Class customization, since it allows your character to freely choose 3 from 8 or 9 (maybe more) talent trees that will both decide skills and passive abilities of your character. Reseting such skills is free of real money charge, so switching builds freely will be pretty much your joy in this game, and something you will wish to have in any title you come across after playing Rift. Character-looks-customization-wise, the game simply offers an equipment look tab that allows you to equip anything you have on it, disabling the equipment stats but prioritizing its looks over the equipment in the normal tab. Simple, practical, effective: Awesome.Lore-wise this game shines probably just like WoW or D&D, it's deep with all kinds of stories in loading screens, NPCs, quests, books to read through the game that can be collected, collectables with stories that become prizes and other things, the game is huge and clearly RP friendly.If I recommend this game? This is a seriously well built MMORPG, for both a game and for a MMORPG. If you like the genre and don't necessarily want inovation but something just well done, get in just now, it's also free!

												What's the point in making a World of Warcraft clone game without any intention of trying to make it better? Without anything that would make this game interesting? Sure, this is a free to play game but c'mon...If you ever played WoW and you are looking for good MMORPG game that can offer something cool - you will need to look around a little more, since RIFT isn't a good game. There is nothing new, we had everything this game can offer in many other titles.			"

												Fantastic game but you will need the expansion which is about £20 or you will not see the later levels. (Many areas are underwater, you'll drown without the expansion.) When you do see the later levels it's wonderful... *UNTIL* you hit max level, then there is a huge gap in gear, with no in game solution, that will prevent you from progressing... unless you spend at least £20 on some store gear. These are not huge sums and perhaps this is not a huge issue, but it feels disingenuous for a 'free to play' game that constantly promotes it's products in game. Overall, after many hours of fun, you start to feel that the developers have a hand on your wallet just waiting on your word to remove cash. Despite this I still recommend it, as there's plenty of fun to be had here.			"

												Rift,This game is possibly one of the best MMO's i've played, the game has great graphics, runs smoothly, easy controls and great machanics.The game is free to play, which evidently means that there are some pay to win aspects to the game but nothing major that can ruin the gameplay.Unfortuently the game isn't as popular and only has a small playerbase but the community is great and friendly! I really like the sense of fellowship with Guilds, although the censorship of certain words like ♥♥♥♥, have recieved me being kicked from my pretty elite guild, ♥♥♥♥ you too! btw.Due to the small playerbase, expecting to get into a PvP arena is very rare, as well as raids.The game has amazing seasonal events, and it really brings the playerbase up and allows for new and fun challenging quests to arise that seperate it from the other quests.TL:DR; What have you got to lose? It's FTP.			"

												It's WoW without the subscription. Some content is locked and waiting for your credit card details but the devs gotta make money so don't them for it. The locked content won't subtract from the gameplay, i dare say it actually gives you a bit of a challenge. (except your backpack size, that ♥♥♥♥ is crazy small.) It doesn't do the best job of showing you your objective but an hour in and you'll get use to it.Combat is fun and simple, there are world events that help with the XP grind. There is also some form of shared looting so you won't have to que at bosses waiting for your turn to get item #1556841. Don't expect to have an intense story unless your into reading, instead grab a friend and make up your own. It's more fun that way.Bottom line: It's a free to play MMO, what more can I say about it. Download it, play for a couple of hours, if you don't like it then you uninstall it. If you do like it, throw some money at it, grab some DLCs and get back into the fight.			"

												I have somehow managed to put 200+ hours into this game, and I regret almost all of it.Pros-Instant Adventures are pretty fun.-Sidekicking is a great feature.-The idea of rifts are cool.-Really customizable UI.Cons-Combat is incredibly boring.-Animations suck.-PVP is insanely unbalanced.-Microtransactions.-Leveling is unfathomably boring.-It seems as though there is nothing to do in the world.-Only one starting zone for Guardian and Defiants, instead of race starting zones.-Race design is crap.-World Events are boring.-Female dwarves don't have beards.A good 25% of the cons are nitpicks, but if these types of things bug you, as they bug me, it's definitely not the game for you. Other than that the game is somewhat decent for being free.			"

												Probably the best free to play MMO out there. A robust character system (not as robust as ArcheAge, but that's totally pay to win) and good crafting system. rift events (mini raids, if you will) are open to everyone in the area and don't require you to queue or to find a group. Just roll in and be rewarded based on your contribution.It's very much like the now dead Warhammer Online in quality and play but, unlike WHO, has the player base to keep it alive and prospering for now.It's no WoW killer, but its pretty damn good.

												Fun MMO game to get into and play with mates, PVP is fun aswell as dungeons/raids are awesome and a great implementation to the game. Tones of quests! so if you love doing quests on the based stroy line then trust me you will have a great time playing this at no worries of being bored. always people looking for groups so you are never alone in the world of rift. The rifts that you come across ingame are immaculate, by this I mean there is not a bunch of things surounding you so it's good for battle plus people with not so good computers. Rift will run on a lot of I would say mid way computers, there are ways to boost your FPS like enabling multi-core so it allows RIFT to use all your CPU cores. [RIFT is a F2P but NOT a Pay To Win] I have spent over £100 on this game and the things you get is really for yourself like a new mount,bags,new powers,skip minions and things like that otherwise I would be OP as anything.[Overall: 7/10] Would I recommend this game? Why yes I would!Download it and give it a try.			"

												A good game, with the potential for greatness. The recent trip to free to play has opened it up to a lot more players, but playing can become costly, especially if you like playing more than one character. The nice thing is that most of the additional content is optional, even bag space, since you can buy extra bank slots with in game currency, however there is no denying the fact that the extra content tends to be on the pricy side in comparison to other games, so keep that in mind when you decide to stay. All things said and done, I recommend you come and try it out for a bit, you wont be sorry. It's really how free to play games should be, playable without spending cash, with stuff you actually want to spend cash on.			"

												If you are looking for a solid free-to-play MMORPG, then you need look no further, because RIFT is an amazing game. While some might argue that the combat is more old-school or maybe slower paced than other MMOs (see Neverwinter or DC Universe Online) its method of combat is tried and true (see WoW). And if you can get a group of friends or guildmates together for its many raids, dungeons, random events, and quests it gets even better, however soloing is in many instances a viable option as well.In regards to the game being free-to-play I did not find any pay walls that hindered my ability to continue making progress in-game. Granted you can buy better equipment with real money, but the only time I feel like this would be very necessary is if you were going to do PvP (which the game offers as well). After 20 hours of playing time I did invest 5 dollars towards getting a mount for my character, and was able to get many other things beneficial to my playtime in that investment (equipment, inventory slots, etc.) in regards to F2P probably the most efficient 5 bucks I've ever spent.Overall I have found the game to be incredibly enjoyable, and if you are looking for a decent MMORPG to get into, I suggest that at the very least you give this one a shot.

												If you miss WoW but don't have the time to dedicate to a subscription based game this is a great alternative. The quests are your standard kill these or collect this. However, Rift features many other things to do practically right from the start.Closing rifts - Randomly spawning rifts that have several waves of mobs that must be defeated, each a little stronger. Best done with a group but can be soloed. Some good xp and loot from doing these.Instant Adventures (starting at level 10 I believe) - Go into an instant adventure and get put into a group all working towards completing the different quests culminating in a big boss that is best done with a raid. Great for taking a break from quest grinding and earning some good xp, in-game money, and loot.I have not tried PVP yet but I have heard it is good.The part I appreciated the most is that as soon as you have the coin you can buy a mount. Big relief not to have to run everywhere.The professions are your standard gather/crafting and need to be leveled and new recipes purchased.This is a free to play game and quite honestly one can play and not have to pay anything. However, until a real money purchase is made the Auction House is locked to sales and the amount of coin held on a character is capped. I believe a small purchase of only $5 will unlock these but since I have yet to purchase anything I'm not sure. This is not a pay to win type of game. You can get boosts, open up bag and character slots, purchase vanity items and mounts but nothing looks like it will give you an edge over free players.			"

												This is your typical MMORPG, but my favorite thing about it is the rifts.  Monsters from another plane rip into the world and it happens often and all over.  It's easy to find where they are on the world map so you could just hop from rift to rift if you'd like.  When you are at a rift you get the option to ""Join Public Group"" which puts you in a raid group with the other people there while you take down the rift.  Invasions are the most fun.  I've done a lot of leveling this way instead of questing and you don't have to worry about gear because the rifts drop loot, including a currency which you can use to buy gear upgrades.			"

												Although it is fairly similar to other MMO's, there are some aspects in RIFT that I have yet to see and make it a bit more fun than the rest. It wasn't too hard to get to their max level (currently 60) and start grinding towards the top tier gear. Although, starting as a tank as the first character made it some-what difficult as there is no specific tank gear until the 50-60 range and even then not much until level 60. It made tanking somewhat difficult and (not sure if my fault) I just about wiped nearly EVERY dungeon (just a 5 man dungeon.. not even a raid) even though I did the tank role correctly(kept all aggro, pull adds from heals/dps, etc). You certainly don't feel like a tank until level 60 - or atleast that's how I felt. Other than the slightly slow start as a tank the game was still able to grab my attention and hold it - A feat not many games can do.			"

												The game starts out a little slow but once you hit level 10 it gets really interesting. It has a great storyline and the RIFTS are really fun along with all the other events that happen while you play. Customization of your character is outstanding, you can build it however you want or follow a preset build path which is helpful for new players. There are plenty of things to collect in the game for rewards like pets which is what I really enjoy in mmorpgs. Dungeons are long and bosses are fun as hell. I also really appreciate how the game can run in low render for terrible laptops like mine, I can play the game just fine and even on low settings it's quite beautiful. ;3			"

You are taken to the world of Telera in hopes to start the ultimate evil- Regulos and the dragons. The characters are immersive-because of the character creation setup. There are 4 classes Warrior Rogue Mage and Cleric. When I saw this though, I thought aww thats not enough. But what I didn't know was that there are these subclasses called Souls that can further increase and specify the gameplay that you want. I have played for about 2 days and I am already level 23. Overall this game is AMAZING! And I don't say that about a lot of games.			"

												The best WoW-style MMO out there.WoW fans looking for something familiar yet refreshing needn't look any further than RIFT.The Instances are challenging, ranging from 1/2-man Chronicles, 5-man Dungeons, and up to 20-man raids, which can get butt-clenchingly difficult for the hardcore crowd at endgame. PvP is great fun, although it could do with more maps and modes to spice things up. Open-world questing is fairly standard, but dynamic zone events like Invasions and the titular Rifts keep you on your toes. For those who want it, there's Crafting and Dimensions (player housing) as well as a well-structured cash shop, with some purchases for freeloaders that want to get serious being well-worth the money. The 'Soul Tree' character builder is the big selling point here. You choose one of 4 Classes (Warrior, Cleric, Rogue or Mage). Inside that Class, you can combine any 3 of the 9 (soon to be 10) availible Souls to create a completely new play style. Mix up the Beastmaster Soul with the Paladin Soul to tank with a pet! Dual spec a Mage to have Elementalist and Necromancer Souls to wield all the elements as well as the power of death! The possibilities are endless. With the forthcoming update, every Class will be able to fulfil any Role in the game (the Roles being tank, dps, healer and support). A Warrior healer? Why not. A Mage tank? Go ahead. Even players new to the genre needn't fear - there are now many audio/visual tutorials added to the starting zones that should be really helpful for easing you into the world of Telara. It could do with more PvP love and some more fantasy elements to heighten the immersion, but Rift is definitely worth your money. Oh, wait - it's free! :)			"

												This is an awesome MMORPG that is slightly different then most. For example there are 4 classes and each class has 8 different skill trees(Reffered to as Soul Trees) for different play styles and each skill/soul tree is like a subclass. CLERIC SUBCLASSES:CABALIST- The Cabalist is an offensive Cleric who draws on powers that others fear. Using ritual and sigil to call forth seeping death and suffocating water, he devastates the battlefield with powerful attacks that catch all of his enemies in his gripDRUID- Druids are melee Clerics who forge bonds with Fae creatures, strengthening their bodies, minds, and spirits by drawing upon the magical energies of their companions.INQUISITOR- The Inquisitor is a cleric who no longer follows the doctrines of life or death alone; instead, they stand between these forces demanding purity from both. An Inquisitor passes judgment on those who are worthy, and damns those who are corrupt.JUSTICAR- Justicars are healing clerics who fight shoulder-to-shoulder with their allies in close combat. Conviction builds with each swing of their weapon, bolstering nearby comrades and powering the Justicar’s potent healing magic.PURIFIER- These Clerics draw upon a pact with their long-dead ancestors as the source of their offensive power. While Purifiers wreathe their allies in flames, they can unleash a spirit vanguard to visit wrath upon their foes.SENTINEL- The Sentinel brings the blessings of light to all who do the will of the gods. Capable of healing many wounded at one time, Sentinels bolster their allies and protect themselves with divine wrath.SHAMAN- The Shaman binds the power of the icy north to his very being, wreathing himself in pure elemental force. This power augments a Shaman’s attacks, making him a powerful melee combatant, and provides shields and reactive healing.WARDEN- Echoing the soothing ebb and flow of the tides, Wardens specialize in slow healing that escalates over time, making them ideal for prolonged fights that would exhaust most healers.MAGE SUBCLASSES:ARCHON- Archons are support specialists who steal their opponents’ strength and convert that raw energy into beneficial magic. These mages bolster their allies and unleash potent kinetic blasts, quickly turning the tide of battle.CHLOROMANCER- The Chloromancer is a healing specialist who draws on the vital energies of plants and nature to find a balance between life and death. They harness these energies into a devastating force, or recycle destructive magic to heal their allies.DONINATOR- The Dominator is a support Mage who terrorizes opponents, leaving them unable or unwilling to act. Those who muster the courage to assault a Dominator will find themselves at the mercy of arcane shields that turn the fury of their own blows against them.ELEMENTALIST- Elementalists are mages who specialize in manipulating and controlling the raw energies of the planes. Through fierce discipline and strict study, these mages dedicate themselves to commanding the harshest and most chaotic forces known to exist.NECROMANCER- Necromancers are damage dealers who synergize with their pets. The majority of a Necromancer’s damage comes from a fully supported and buffed pet. In an emergency, Necromancers can also serve as secondary healers by sacrificing their own health to their allies.PYROMANCER- Pyromancers are destructive mages whose sole focus is the mastery of fire, from launching massive incinerating blasts, to trapping their opponents behind a smoldering wall of flame. No other Ascended can match the sheer destruction at the Pyromancer’s fingertips.STORMCALLER- Stormcallers are mages who channel the raw fury of the wind and water to command the battlefield, chilling their opponents to the bone or stopping their hearts with electric shock.WARLOCK- Consummate practitioners of the dark arts, Warlocks embrace the grim forces of entropy and death. Protected within a cloak of shadows, they lurk on the edges of the conflict, as their deadly energies inevitably consume all that stand in their way.ROUGE SUBCLASSES:ASSASSIN- Masters of subtlety and subterfuge, an Assassin’s ability to walk in the shadows allows them to bypass obstacles and launch devastating surprise attacks. A rare few survive the initial assault, only to succumb to virulent poisons.BARD- Singing the songs of battle and playing heart-stirring cadences, Bards embolden their allies and cripple their enemies through rhythm and rhyme.BLADEDANCER- Blade Dancers are masters of wielding edged weapons. They specialize in ritualized combat movements that are lightning fast. Blade Dancers can overwhelm even an accomplished opponent's defenses, setting them up for a devastating coup de grace.MARKSMEN- Marksmen are offensive sharpshooters trained to thin enemy ranks with ruthless efficiency. They combine swift hit-and-run attacks with devastating volleys, endlessly harassing targets, sowing the battlefield with dead and crippled foes.NIGHTBLADE- Possessing deadly agility and mastery of the blade, the Nightblade can also draw upon the planar magics of fire and death to deal doom in a variety of ways. Favoring light armor, their ability to stalk and quickly eliminate their adversaries means the unfortunate quarry rarely has the chance to defend, let alone counterattack.RANGER- Rangers are consummate hunters who know the strengths and weaknesses of every beast, taming animal companions to augment their considerable prowess in ranged combat. This synergy between bow and beast allows Rangers to handily overcome the most daunting obstacles.RIFSTALKER- The Riftstalker is a defensive specialist who bends the planes to enhance his constitution and shift in and out of the physical dimension. These highly skilled and survivable combatants keep their opponents’ focus while easily evading incoming blows.SABOTEUR- The Saboteur is a cunning Rogue who uses explosives and other incendiaries to cripple opponents and control the battlefield. With proper preparation, a Saboteur can destroy enemies without ever giving them a chance to join battle.WARRIOR SUBCLASSES:BEASTMASTER- This Warrior's journey begins by bonding to a spirit companion. The spirit beast fights beside the Beastmaster with speed and strength and sees him through his darkest trials.CHAMPION- Champions are powerful Warriors who excel at melee combat. Wielding massive two-handed weapons, these battle-tested fighters find few equals in one-on-one battle. Champions strive to become one with their blade, constantly honing their fighting skills to win glory through warfare.PALADIN- Righteous defenders of the weak, Paladins use heavy shields and divine blessings to stand as a bulwark against their foes. The Paladin’s large shield not only offers protection, but affords many opportunities to launch devastating counters in close combat.PARAGON- The Paragon moves like a furious storm, never giving his enemy time to regroup. A master of dual-wielding, he uses parries and disciplined forms to build up power attacks and stay out of danger.REAVER- Reavers are warriors who combine the art of combat with the entropic energies of death. The slightest touch of their weapon can spread disease, incite madness, and death to those unlucky enough to face them.RIFTBLADE- Riftblades are Warriors who learn to enhance their attacks with elemental magic, allowing them to cast bolts of force across the battlefield and strike with boundless energies.VOIDNIGHT- The Void Knight is a defensive Warrior who uses eldritch techniques to counter magic-wielding foes. Spells that would bring another Warrior low are shaken off by a Void Knight, reflected back at the caster, or stored in pacts the Void Knight can unleash to devastating effect.WARLORD-A Warlord’s commanding presence expresses itself in auras that inspire her comrades to victory and cow her enemies into submission, allowing her to control the field of battle.8.5/10 Great!

												Rift has what most games these days have lost. It provides an enjoyable experience rather than an endless grind to the next level. I've only played about 12 hours but i wasnt worried for a second what my level was or how i was going to get to the next level faster. if the progression in a game is what you're worried about maybe you should worry about the progression in your own life			"

												I spent a lot of time playing WoW and I paid a lot of money to have a toon run around in their substandard world.  I won't say that Rift breaks the mold completely; it is still a toon based grindfest.  But, it is completely free to play and it offers a few things that WoW never did.  Rift has a lot of angles that appeal to the different tastes of different players.  If you want to craft, you can, if you want to quest, you can, dungeons, PvP, instant quests, artifacts... there is a lot to this game.The tl;dr takeaway is that it is free and you'll find it is a pretty good investment of your time.

												I started playing Rift when it was pay-to-play and leveled up quickly. Too quickly, which killed it for me as I was able to try different builds with very little effort. I decided to pursue other games on the market till the free-to-play came on the market, and I came back to give the game another shot. Leveling is still easy, and classes are either pro or gimp, but I still find it amusing to play. Ultimately my favorite aspect of the game is the PvE, and the idea of the rifts bringing people together to play as a team. Really love that community aspect of the game, as it aids in higher level PvP. If you want a free game that you can sink 300+ hours into without feeling drained, make a few friends, and kill a few baddies, then Rift is the game for you!			"

												Taking the best aspects of the games that came before it, improving on them and adding its own unique elements has Rift poised to be a long term power in the MMOG community. If you play Word of Warcraft much then you'll love this Free to play MMORPG ! Hours and Hours of gameplay guaranteed. Explore the world quest after quest , battle it out in PvP mode, Ride your mount into the unknown or get a combat pet. Learn how to fish or how to mine. What WoW was to Everquest Rift is to WoW. It's incredibly polished with loads and loads of content. The unique, fun, thrilling Rift system and other dynamic events can be triggered by players, scheduled by the development team, or even occur spontaneously. Dynamic events within the game can lead to a range of changes across the world, including everything from minor events to dramatic shifts in the game's landscape and the opening of new areas. Players will connect with hundreds of thousands of other gamers to battle creatures overrunning the world, as well as each other. Rift offers an amazing class system allowing you to create the class of your dreams. It's all up to you , good or bad. Highly recommended if you are an extreme MMORPG player.			"

												A good game, with the potential for greatness. The recent trip to free to play has opened it up to a lot more players, but playing can become costly, especially if you like playing more than one character. The nice thing is that most of the additional content is optional, even bag space, since you can buy extra bank slots with in game currency, however there is no denying the fact that the extra content tends to be on the pricy side in comparison to other games, so keep that in mind when you decide to stay. All things said and done, I recommend you come and try it out for a bit, you wont be sorry. It's really how free to play games should be, playable without spending cash, with stuff you actually want to spend cash on.			"

												Gameplay-  While it dosen't re-invent the genre, RIFT's tried and tested formula holds up amongst the ocean of MMO's out there. What you get that is different, is a streamlined, polished experience thoughout all its offerings, with extensive options in general PvE and leveling (with a fanstastic instant adventure feature), Standard MMO fare pvp, and enjoyable crafting and Hobbies ( RIFT has a suprisingly addictive fishing aspect to it)9/10UI's/Menus - RIFT has a sleek UI, But once again dosen't break the mould. Standard MMO fare here.8/10Content - There's plenty to see and do on your way to the level cap, with the Storm Legion expansion adding twice the content of the original game, just for journey from level 50 to 60. You also have an absurd amount of collectables to obtain on your journey, with a lot of artifacts that you simply find in your travels worth a fortune on the AH. When wanting a break from leveling you have PvP, Closing the games signature RIFT's,  Crafting , Artifact Hunting, Achivement hunting and Exploring, and maybe RIFT's best feature, the incredible Dimensions (RIFT's Housing). Dimensions add this amazing element not generally seen in mmo's since SWG. I could write for pages, jump in and experience them for yourself, and the amazing community built dimensions with waterslides, puzzles and bars!.10/10Subscribe or F2P?Personally, This game is beyond worth the subscription. The developers deserve the sub fee, and the Benifits you get from it are worth it. You get the equivelant of 8 hours a day of 200% XP, Currency , and Noriety Gain (if you want) as well as a daily and weekly Gift, which often include hard to gain Artifacts, Potions, and vaulable Currency.On the F2P side the game does feature a robust in game money shop, with decent prices for unlocks. I've never been a massive F2Player and I honestly dont understand why people complain when they don't wanna pay a sub fee but expect the whole game free.If your a fan of Fantasy MMO's , or looking to get started, RIFT is a fantastic choice. The game has a great community and if you get into a great guild your set.Final Score 10/10			"

												It's immersive, beautiful, easy to get a hang of, and generally fun to play. I love the fact that you can either play alone, doing your quests and deciding on the best build for your character, or join groups for dungeon raids, adventures, or just rift together with somebody whose playstyle fit yours.I recommend this game; but I have to warn you, can get kind of forget about the time or all the other things you had to do once you get into it!

												Play this game!Rift and WoW is a similar comparison to Diablo and Path of Exile. It copies the systems but is much deeper with skill trees and personalization. The graphics are also really nice and the story is pretty cool.IT IS FREE, completely free if you want, and even if you do want to spend some money the pricing system is pretty damn cheap!If you want to play an mmo but dont want to pay for or play WoW, PLAY THIS GAME.

												Updated 08/2016I first reviewed this game in October 2014. I'm back in 2016 and it has sucked me in again this year for many hours. Rift was a $70M mmo development project, making it still one of the ones mention on the bestmmorpg website. Its Instant Adventure option and mentoring are still some of the most supportive play options ever: helpful leveling and instant access to whomever is running. There is so much complaining lately that Rift is P2W, or Pay 2 Win. I can't really argue with that and the game is brilliant at it. I have definitely hit my credit card hard a few times while playing, but if one is careful (look for the original ultimate edition to get some from free mounts and those all important bag slots), and the expansions are worth the cash if you're putting in hundreds of hours. So many folks just click P2W dis-recommend and are done. But, in truth, if one spends $60 on a front running MMO, gets as many hours out of it as GW2 or TESO, hasn't the time and money invested about worked out? Rift does so very much well: player housing, sidekicking, the full range of cosmetics. The graphics are a little dated now -- we must concede that. But, there's so much to see and the world is huge.It has been a long time since I've burned my time in an MMO. I'm a player of some of the classics: Dark Age of Camelot (remember that one?), a year or so of World of Warcraft, another year of EQ2, and several years of LOTRO. Finally, I couldn't resist the bug anymore and decided to check out Rift since it was F2P. I was not disappointed. The game pushed the art of game designs beyond what I had experienced in some very rewarding ways:1. Design your own player classes. Yes, you have to choose the overall categories of Warrior, Rogue, Cleric or Mage, but out of the 8 skill trees available for each one, you can pick whichever 3 you wish. For very small prices, you can also assign different ""roles"" to your character, meaning that you can have one build set up for solo, another for PvP, and yet another for Raids. Very special! I am an inveterate tinkerer. I love tinkering with Rift class design.2. Free form player homes. In Rift, player homes are called dimensions. Players may have access to many dimesions of their own, and each is a separate instance. Yes, you can invite your friends, and there is one for your guild. But, the degree of customization and construction you can do in each would make a Minecraft afficionado proud. Gone are the hard limits and creativity-stifling ""hooks"" of LOTRO. Now you put your items where you want them, the size, the angle, the stacking of item on item for actual built objects, etc. What a new world! I got to see in a video where one female player had taken one of the smallest dimensions available and built multiple dwellings in it, including a theme house for the three bears. Amazing! and lovely! BTW, some of the plants and trees can blow in the wind. Wonderful.3. Instant Adventures and Rifts: Some of the special things Rifts will offer you is, on 10th level, your character can run off and Instant Adventure. These are happenings that form instant PUGs where basically everyone runs to kill things or manipulate objects from event to event as long as you can stand it. Since players are sharing experience, this is a fast expereince machine, a great way to discover players to make friends with, and -- if you're like me and you're running a lot of characters -- Relieves the boredom of doing the same missions over and over. It at least interrupts them. The Rifts dynamic is fun because you sometimes discover where the next planar rift could occur and you can open it yourself. Then, players will zoom into your area to help you fight the denizens of the rift and close the thing back up. All of the benefits of instant adventures are in the Rifts, plus the granting of mucho neato loot.Finally, it should be mentioned that this is a game where you could easily spend and spend without limit. Many of the bundle packs for sale are quite pricey, although comparable to the price you'd pay for a year of playing a charging MMO. The in-game store can be pricey for some things, but if you are a careful shopper you can also buy things for loose change, including mounts. f you want to break down and completely outfit your character with weapons and armor, you can do the whole package in high quality stuff for a few dollars. That's nice if you've got a character you love, although the balance without purchased stuff -- if you don't make the mistake of accidentally attacking red (elite) enemies by yourself (which I have)  -- the balance is still good with what the game churns out in your quests. I'm hooked. This is a great game. I'll be playing it for a while. Take it on and enjoy!Telp			"

												Rift is like most MMO's coming out today, a Clone of a Clone, of a clone. It is a hotkey mmo, with grouping elements in it, as well as a ""Rift"" system.  The pvp is bland, and the tri-class make up system makes up for it's overall lack of orgianality.

												This is an awesome MMORPG that is slightly different then most. For example there are 4 classes and each class has 8 different skill trees(Reffered to as Soul Trees) for different play styles and each skill/soul tree is like a subclass. CLERIC SUBCLASSES:CABALIST- The Cabalist is an offensive Cleric who draws on powers that others fear. Using ritual and sigil to call forth seeping death and suffocating water, he devastates the battlefield with powerful attacks that catch all of his enemies in his gripDRUID- Druids are melee Clerics who forge bonds with Fae creatures, strengthening their bodies, minds, and spirits by drawing upon the magical energies of their companions.INQUISITOR- The Inquisitor is a cleric who no longer follows the doctrines of life or death alone; instead, they stand between these forces demanding purity from both. An Inquisitor passes judgment on those who are worthy, and damns those who are corrupt.JUSTICAR- Justicars are healing clerics who fight shoulder-to-shoulder with their allies in close combat. Conviction builds with each swing of their weapon, bolstering nearby comrades and powering the Justicar’s potent healing magic.PURIFIER- These Clerics draw upon a pact with their long-dead ancestors as the source of their offensive power. While Purifiers wreathe their allies in flames, they can unleash a spirit vanguard to visit wrath upon their foes.SENTINEL- The Sentinel brings the blessings of light to all who do the will of the gods. Capable of healing many wounded at one time, Sentinels bolster their allies and protect themselves with divine wrath.SHAMAN- The Shaman binds the power of the icy north to his very being, wreathing himself in pure elemental force. This power augments a Shaman’s attacks, making him a powerful melee combatant, and provides shields and reactive healing.WARDEN- Echoing the soothing ebb and flow of the tides, Wardens specialize in slow healing that escalates over time, making them ideal for prolonged fights that would exhaust most healers.MAGE SUBCLASSES:ARCHON- Archons are support specialists who steal their opponents’ strength and convert that raw energy into beneficial magic. These mages bolster their allies and unleash potent kinetic blasts, quickly turning the tide of battle.CHLOROMANCER- The Chloromancer is a healing specialist who draws on the vital energies of plants and nature to find a balance between life and death. They harness these energies into a devastating force, or recycle destructive magic to heal their allies.DONINATOR- The Dominator is a support Mage who terrorizes opponents, leaving them unable or unwilling to act. Those who muster the courage to assault a Dominator will find themselves at the mercy of arcane shields that turn the fury of their own blows against them.ELEMENTALIST- Elementalists are mages who specialize in manipulating and controlling the raw energies of the planes. Through fierce discipline and strict study, these mages dedicate themselves to commanding the harshest and most chaotic forces known to exist.NECROMANCER- Necromancers are damage dealers who synergize with their pets. The majority of a Necromancer’s damage comes from a fully supported and buffed pet. In an emergency, Necromancers can also serve as secondary healers by sacrificing their own health to their allies.PYROMANCER- Pyromancers are destructive mages whose sole focus is the mastery of fire, from launching massive incinerating blasts, to trapping their opponents behind a smoldering wall of flame. No other Ascended can match the sheer destruction at the Pyromancer’s fingertips.STORMCALLER- Stormcallers are mages who channel the raw fury of the wind and water to command the battlefield, chilling their opponents to the bone or stopping their hearts with electric shock.WARLOCK- Consummate practitioners of the dark arts, Warlocks embrace the grim forces of entropy and death. Protected within a cloak of shadows, they lurk on the edges of the conflict, as their deadly energies inevitably consume all that stand in their way.ROUGE SUBCLASSES:ASSASSIN- Masters of subtlety and subterfuge, an Assassin’s ability to walk in the shadows allows them to bypass obstacles and launch devastating surprise attacks. A rare few survive the initial assault, only to succumb to virulent poisons.BARD- Singing the songs of battle and playing heart-stirring cadences, Bards embolden their allies and cripple their enemies through rhythm and rhyme.BLADEDANCER- Blade Dancers are masters of wielding edged weapons. They specialize in ritualized combat movements that are lightning fast. Blade Dancers can overwhelm even an accomplished opponent's defenses, setting them up for a devastating coup de grace.MARKSMEN- Marksmen are offensive sharpshooters trained to thin enemy ranks with ruthless efficiency. They combine swift hit-and-run attacks with devastating volleys, endlessly harassing targets, sowing the battlefield with dead and crippled foes.NIGHTBLADE- Possessing deadly agility and mastery of the blade, the Nightblade can also draw upon the planar magics of fire and death to deal doom in a variety of ways. Favoring light armor, their ability to stalk and quickly eliminate their adversaries means the unfortunate quarry rarely has the chance to defend, let alone counterattack.RANGER- Rangers are consummate hunters who know the strengths and weaknesses of every beast, taming animal companions to augment their considerable prowess in ranged combat. This synergy between bow and beast allows Rangers to handily overcome the most daunting obstacles.RIFSTALKER- The Riftstalker is a defensive specialist who bends the planes to enhance his constitution and shift in and out of the physical dimension. These highly skilled and survivable combatants keep their opponents’ focus while easily evading incoming blows.SABOTEUR- The Saboteur is a cunning Rogue who uses explosives and other incendiaries to cripple opponents and control the battlefield. With proper preparation, a Saboteur can destroy enemies without ever giving them a chance to join battle.WARRIOR SUBCLASSES:BEASTMASTER- This Warrior's journey begins by bonding to a spirit companion. The spirit beast fights beside the Beastmaster with speed and strength and sees him through his darkest trials.CHAMPION- Champions are powerful Warriors who excel at melee combat. Wielding massive two-handed weapons, these battle-tested fighters find few equals in one-on-one battle. Champions strive to become one with their blade, constantly honing their fighting skills to win glory through warfare.PALADIN- Righteous defenders of the weak, Paladins use heavy shields and divine blessings to stand as a bulwark against their foes. The Paladin’s large shield not only offers protection, but affords many opportunities to launch devastating counters in close combat.PARAGON- The Paragon moves like a furious storm, never giving his enemy time to regroup. A master of dual-wielding, he uses parries and disciplined forms to build up power attacks and stay out of danger.REAVER- Reavers are warriors who combine the art of combat with the entropic energies of death. The slightest touch of their weapon can spread disease, incite madness, and death to those unlucky enough to face them.RIFTBLADE- Riftblades are Warriors who learn to enhance their attacks with elemental magic, allowing them to cast bolts of force across the battlefield and strike with boundless energies.VOIDNIGHT- The Void Knight is a defensive Warrior who uses eldritch techniques to counter magic-wielding foes. Spells that would bring another Warrior low are shaken off by a Void Knight, reflected back at the caster, or stored in pacts the Void Knight can unleash to devastating effect.WARLORD-A Warlord’s commanding presence expresses itself in auras that inspire her comrades to victory and cow her enemies into submission, allowing her to control the field of battle.8.5/10 Great!

												Rift is like most MMO's coming out today, a Clone of a Clone, of a clone. It is a hotkey mmo, with grouping elements in it, as well as a ""Rift"" system.  The pvp is bland, and the tri-class make up system makes up for it's overall lack of orgianality.  While i would say avoid this MMO if you're a WoW player, it is simply worth checking out if you have friends to play with or...one of the many times it comes on sale for 5 bucks.			"

												This game is Riftastic.Gamplay: 8.5 of 10Graphics: 8.5 of 10Sound/Atmosphere:  9 of 10Community: 7 of 10End Game/Replay Value: 9 of 10Don't let my play time fool you, I have 3 characters lvl 60 and 1 with top gear (I just reinstalled my game on steam).I don't know what made me play Rift at first.Warhammer Online was dying and I found myselt not having as much time for MMORPGs. I tried SWTOR my first F2P, it was okay but the end game didn't grab me.So as a last attempt I switched over to RIFT. Tired of leveling up and going through the questing stuff I mainly stuck to the pvp.After a day or so of learning the soul system I realized that you can customize your character in an incredible amout of ways! You get four starting classes: Warrior, Rogue, Cleric, Mage. but you can customize them anyway you want, for example: tired of healing on your cleric and want to be a Tank instead? Just once flick of a button and all your skills (plus quickbars) change to reflect your role change.Really refreshing, I use the role change constantly and I see others do so as well.The game is kinda your standard MMORPG with quests and leveling, the story is pretty cool as well as the dungeons and bosses. They are hard, but not too hard.Lots of floating rocks and invading monsters to kill.Twoards the end of the game you join conquest, a massive free for all capture the node type game. The more you play it the more perks you earn, yet if you stop playing you will lose those perks as they degrade overtime.I play on the PVP server and it is active, people tell me that the other servers are doing good as well.The servers allow for cross queuing, which cuts down drastically on wait times for dungeons and pvp warfronts.The games difficulty revolves around mastering the soul system, you get 3 souls to chose from and a limited amount of abilities from each soul. Finding the right combination can be the difference of being OP and average.My advice: Don't just listen to people in-game/forums, test out your own abilities and do your own trial and error.For instance, people told me not to make a rouge/ranger as they are ""useless"" well that just motivated me to make one even more.Granted my ranger isn't powerful one on one, but in a group or duing a Warfront I can easily get top dps and I notice the support my character brings.Cons:After playing Warhammer Online I was spoiled with a good tank class that mattered (in pvp and pve). Since then no other game can seem to get it right.Which mean's RIFT is basically a game of DPS and Healer (maybe support if you know how to do it properly).This makes the game a tad bit bland but never boring.Over Powered (OP) Classes - (happens in every game) but be prepared to see an over abunence of Mage:Pyro, Warrior:Tempest, Rogue:Assassin.F2P - I understand Trion has to make money somehow but they do charge you for extra bag space. Granted I never needed it but if you want to craft or do something which requires lot of bag/vault space be prepared to fork over money.It's not pay to win (P2W), you don't need to pay to be the best in the game. Paying just really helps you get more powerful in a shorter amount of time. Like for a redicilous amount of money you could buy all the top tier armors/weapons but can also earn those items the normal way by grinding.All in all it's a very good game, they update often and I'm glad I found it.Overall Rift gets a 8 out of 10 Talzor/Lafixer PvP server lvl 60 Cleric/Rogue			"

												Taking the best aspects of the games that came before it, improving on them and adding its own unique elements has Rift poised to be a long term power in the MMOG community. If you play Word of Warcraft much then you'll love this Free to play MMORPG ! Hours and Hours of gameplay guaranteed. Explore the world quest after quest , battle it out in PvP mode, Ride your mount into the unknown or get a combat pet. Learn how to fish or how to mine. What WoW was to Everquest Rift is to WoW. It's incredibly polished with loads and loads of content. The unique, fun, thrilling Rift system and other dynamic events can be triggered by players, scheduled by the development team, or even occur spontaneously. Dynamic events within the game can lead to a range of changes across the world, including everything from minor events to dramatic shifts in the game's landscape and the opening of new areas. Players will connect with hundreds of thousands of other gamers to battle creatures overrunning the world, as well as each other. Rift offers an amazing class system allowing you to create the class of your dreams. It's all up to you , good or bad. Highly recommended if you are an extreme MMORPG player.			"

												MMO with cooperative dungeons and raids (tank, healer, support, dps).One class consists of 10 souls that have to be combined per 3 resulting in a lot of variation! You can save 6+ specs or builds! Therefore you do not have to level a ""hunter"" for ranged dps and a warrior to tank... You can just levelone ""rogue"" and get a Tank, Melee, Ranger, Hunter, Stealth and Support spec. Resetting these roles is also extremely cheap.Endgame gear uses synergy crystals that have different stats based on a main soul. So you do not need lots of different gear sets. You just swap the synergy crystal.Some of the best features Rift .+endgame dungeon content is challenging+endgame raid content is challenging+edngame is tiered (some are for noobs, others for hardcore)+very flexibile soul system (1 char could be 10 classes in any other mmo)+They did not change experience required when it went F2P, but now you can spend money on experience boosts!Downsides:-can be boring to level all the way to max level without a friend			"

												The best WoW-style MMO out there.WoW fans looking for something familiar yet refreshing needn't look any further than RIFT.The Instances are challenging, ranging from 1/2-man Chronicles, 5-man Dungeons, and up to 20-man raids, which can get butt-clenchingly difficult for the hardcore crowd at endgame. PvP is great fun, although it could do with more maps and modes to spice things up. Open-world questing is fairly standard, but dynamic zone events like Invasions and the titular Rifts keep you on your toes. For those who want it, there's Crafting and Dimensions (player housing) as well as a well-structured cash shop, with some purchases for freeloaders that want to get serious being well-worth the money. The 'Soul Tree' character builder is the big selling point here. You choose one of 4 Classes (Warrior, Cleric, Rogue or Mage). Inside that Class, you can combine any 3 of the 9 (soon to be 10) availible Souls to create a completely new play style. Mix up the Beastmaster Soul with the Paladin Soul to tank with a pet! Dual spec a Mage to have Elementalist and Necromancer Souls to wield all the elements as well as the power of death! The possibilities are endless. With the forthcoming update, every Class will be able to fulfil any Role in the game (the Roles being tank, dps, healer and support). A Warrior healer? Why not. A Mage tank? Go ahead. Even players new to the genre needn't fear - there are now many audio/visual tutorials added to the starting zones that should be really helpful for easing you into the world of Telara. It could do with more PvP love and some more fantasy elements to heighten the immersion, but Rift is definitely worth your money. Oh, wait - it's free! :)			"

I won't say that Rift breaks the mold completely; it is still a toon based grindfest.  But, it is completely free to play and it offers a few things that WoW never did.  Rift has a lot of angles that appeal to the different tastes of different players.  If you want to craft, you can, if you want to quest, you can, dungeons, PvP, instant quests, artifacts... there is a lot to this game.The tl;dr takeaway is that it is free and you'll find it is a pretty good investment of your time.

												Rift is back on steam and free-er than ever. It's a fun MMORPG with a million ways to play. Spec your rogue to heal and buff your friends or get a tanking mage or a dps cleric. It's up to you to decide how to play. Once you get to lvl 50, basically three new continents are opened up where entirely new mobs and new content awaits. Plenty of end-game content as well.			"

												Rift is quite a bit of fun to play solo but even better to play with friends. Find yourself an active guild and have a great time exploring and battling all kinds of enemies. I rarely play a game to max a character out before I get bored but Rift has captured my attention and has held it strong and I expect to be level 60 in a short time.			"

												RIFT is a defining MMORPG full of experienced players who are more than willing to help. It revovles around 2 factions: The Guardians and The Defiants, whose sole purpose is to prevent darkness from engulfing the world. I reached level 65 a few weeks ago and even though i have hit teh cap there is still so much more to do. This game will keep you busy for Months. I highly recommend this game to anyone			"

												For a free to play MMORPG this game really has it all. After putting a fair amount of time into it (currently have 52 hours) I can honestly say that this game came out before it's time. With competition like WoW this game didn't last long but then again it never got a fair run from people.What I enjoy most about this game is that the character creation is really well done. You get to modify a lot of different things to give your character that ""unique"" look that you can't get in other games. Not only that but the class system is amazing! I really love the layout of the soul tree (your basic talent skill tree). You get to pick 3 different classes and combine them however you want!! For instance I have a ""Rogue"" who is a Bard/Riftstalker/Blade Dancer. It's a really fun combination and you could spend hours alone playing with the different combinations and seeing what type of characer you can make.I highly reccomend this game to anyone looking for a game where you can have that unique character feel and not feel like a carbon copy of everyone else who is the same ""Class"" as you.

												They WERE NOT lying about the free-to-play part. You can aquire EVERYTHING worthwhile with in-game curreny. THIS IS NOT A PAY-TO-WIN GAME. The sheer freedom of this game nearly brought me to happy tears, after finding out you can make a full guild very easily. Recommended for anyone with an MMORPG itch, this game will make you addicted. The only thing I wish to see is more diverse races, because as of now there are only actually six, three rehashed, but hell, you couldn't ask for a more unique class and leveling system. This game is just too fun to pass up.			"

												With a little bit over 90 hours into Rift, I have to say that this is actually a worthwhile MMO. With the massive scale of the world map and the activities that you're able to do, solo or with friends, there are still things that I have yet to unlock about the majesty of this world. There are fixes and such usually every wenesday (as far as a holiday schedule I have no idea). Cons: Without proper knowledge of an MMO or its key bindings, mappings, or any of the different attributes that follow, new players may have difficulty with leveling or succeding where they would know should there a technical ""partner"" to be with them.

												An absolute deep MMORPG that will suck every little hour of your life away.Never been this addicted to a MMO since WoW(Which btw,alot of people call this a Poor Man's WoW.WoW seems more like a Poor Man's Rift.)Quests are so fun and great to do,game is optimized well for any pc to run and running max setts sure is a treat to the eyes,There are no lag issues and server worlds seem to be stable as they can be.Classes are extremely diverse and they are adding constant addons and modifications to existing classes,and even making new ones!As for everything else like weapons,mechanics,structure,etc,Game will be very similar to WoW in these aspects,but IMO improves on them.The game IS NOT PAY TO WIN.Let me remind you that.You don't need to spend a single penny to get anything you can't get by investing time[Which will be hella easy for you :)]Only people who want things early or want to support devs usually pony up.Of course,since I love this game so much,I myself have made quite a few purchases just to support,plus indeed I felt temptated to get some equipment early instead of waiting! :P All in all game is fantastic,anybody honestly will love it even people who aren't used to MMOs(FPS players,Racing,Anyone!)Legendary stuff right here,1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10.

There's so much to do: A decent PvP, amazing PvE, Rift Hunts, 3 professions, Quest, Dungeon, Explore and it's all free, with the option to pay for extras, IT'S NOT PAY2WIN!!!! you buy outfits, bonus vials, mounts, and many other things including a way to sell Credits for In-game currency.

												Pros: Easy to pick up and learn; has many similarities with other popular MMOs. You can change servers and recustomize your character (Excluding gender / race change) without having to pay real money. Changing servers is free, but recustomizing your character is expensive. (In game currency.) -Only 4 classes, but many different souls (Specializations) to choose from, and can have 3 souls active at a time. You can play your character however you want to. -PvP is fun in my opinion. Kind of reminds me of Unreal Tournament / Quake in the sense that it has an announcer that will announce events. ""First Blood"" ""Killing Spree"" ""Unstoppable"" etc. I found that pretty cool. -Has an in-game video recorder, which is a first for MMOs. However, it does not record sound last I checked. Not for me anyway.-UI Customization is good, you aren't too limited in that regard.-Average playerbase is usually friendly and helpful.-Can be played even on very bad computers. (Obviously your experience may not be ideal, but you should generally be able to play the game.)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons: Only 6 races. 3 per faction. 4 of which are literally copy, pasted, and reskinned. There are only 2 unique races. Bahmi and Dwarves. -Game is not incredibly populated. -Only a few servers that I know of that have a decent playerbase, the rest are dead. For lack of a better word, the questing is, what I'd call, corridor questing. There aren't multiple same-level zones to choose from, should you decide you don't want to play in a certain. You have to level in a line of questing areas. No choice.(No more cons come to mind at the moment.)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There's more that can be said, but overall I enjoyed the game. It's certainly not bad by any means. It'd be better if it was more popular and had at least 1 more race for each faction that wasn't copy / pasted. If you get this game, it's certainly not a bad idea to bring a friend. I'd give this game a 7/10. It is subscription based. $15 per month. With new accounts, when you subscribe and set up a payment plan, your first month is free. (Your monthly billing will begin on the second month.)			"

												Built for players who liked World of Warcraft's layout, but wanted something a little more individual. What Rift has going for it is it's familiar, yet you never feel like a mundane, simple mortal or weakling: from the very start you're an ascended, and you feel powerful.The skills are colorful and visually appealing, and feel satisfying. Your class is determined by 3 souls (similar to WoW's specializations), only you can mix and match any 3 out of 8 that you can unlock total (plus there's a PvP soul you can also unlock.) In short, this gives you acces to a lot of skills and the freedom to pick and choose your most significant ones (much like in Guild Wars) .Leveling is quick. Quests are clustered together and never take long (a slight grind that is far faster than it ever was in WoW), yet in addition Rifts will pop up, sometimes even invasions, which players are eager to pop up and seal off due to the large amounts of rewards and XP.Great MMO.

												This is seriously one of the best MMO's I've ever played. It's not Pay to win at all, though you might just end up spending money anyway because you want really cool (unecessary) vanity items. I really did enjoy it, though it takes a while to level.Pros:FREEVery versitile class systemAwesome communityInteresting loreNot Pay to winCons:Kinda buggyLong dungeon queues			"

												Rift has been a great game from the very beginning. I bought it when it first came out and even though i have taken time away from it i always end up playing it again.  The random rift invasion style world is wonderful and like nothing else i have played. With the addition of more content it has continued to be a very fun and entertaining game. I would recommend Rift to any fan of mmo's.			"

												I have really enjoyed my time with this game! I know that I don't have many hours, but I think that this game is better than most people think! The game itself is similar to WoW and other MMOs but Rift is the only F2P MMO that I know of that isn't pay to win. Lots of people complain that it takes too long to grind for items and levels, but that's the point of an MMO. It wouldn't be fun if you were automatically level 100 with tons of overpowered items, the game would get boring fast.All in all, if you're looking for a fun MMO to play with friends that you don't have to pay copious amounts of money to play, then Rift is your game!

Originally a AAA subscription mmo.  Switched over to f2p and has a pretty generous amount of content. Until the last expansion you could get and do everything ingame reasonably. In the newest expansion it has become a little grindy to get the 2 earring slots available free for expansion purchasers.(I have the expansion) A new feature has also been introduced that has some gear only available to players attuned to the realm of water. (expansion purchasers).Saying that I would definitely recommend this game. It is the ""closest"" to early open world pvp (pvp server since launch) wow that I have played in all honesty, and I have played pretty much every mmo going since 1997.  It has so called dynamic rift events (think warhammer online public questing), a wealth of dungeons at all levels, warfronts available in brackets as you level, endgame raiding, pretty much everything you would expect.Positives for me are:1. Customisation is fantastic. Pick one class and pretty much play how you like with a mix of mage,rogue,warrior,cleric.2. Open world pvp pretty much everywhere. (pvp server)4 slight negatives for me are: 1. the playerbase could be better mid levels. Its fine 1-20 and end level.2. I found some of the scenery bland, but this could just be a matter of taste with the art style.3. Optimisation is extremely poor. Make sure you have decent single core cpu performance as this thing can bring your pc to single digit fps if you want any kind of decent graphics to look at. (there are a lot of tricks you can try but having a 4ghz+ would just make life a lot easier)4. The later levels can be too long imho. (without store bought xp pots or patron (subscription) status.This review is a work in progress.			"

												By far the best F2P mmorpg ever made. The cash model in this game is done perfectly. There's absolutely zero pay to win in this game. All the gest gear is either craftable (and not very expensive) or obtained through max level pvp. It is a WOW in all of the greatest ways (minus the wow class system). And on the topic of the class system, there are thousands of ways you can build your class. 9/10 would play again ;D			"

												I'd say this is the best WoW clone. I wouldn't be playing this if WoW was completely free. However this game is probably the most fun MMORPG i've played because they give you alot of stuff to from an early level like raids and instances. I give this an 8/10 and recommend it if you cant play WoW or if you're just looking for a free mmo play this one.			"

												It's almost as good as WoW.However, I did start playing this like a year or two ago so I came back to the f2p with minimal hassles and paywalls.So, if you're a new player you'll have quite a few limitations, but to lift most of these limitations you just need to sink 10 dollars in.

												This game is pretty awesome. It has many pros, and few cons.First, the fact that any piece of hardware can run it is nice, and even the highest-end PCs get a kick out of the best settings. There are many little things to get sidetracked with, from special events to higher level bosses. If you're anything like me, you'll appreciate the chance to show off on a special boss, or one of the many raids. But the best part for myself were the classes. You choose a side, a race, and one of four basic classes. Depending on the class you choose, from the cleric, the warrior, the wizard, and the (rogue?), you then choose what type of class you are. You could be a rogue tank if you wanted, with no regards to stereotypes, although it definitely changes the playstyle. All of it helps to define you, and determine your soul trees. You can change them later, but the soul trees help to really define you. I'll add that even though most of the abilities seem overpowered in most games, they scale well in this one. Enemies and players have very notable differences in their power between levels. Most MMOs give you the ability to fight enemies many levels higher than you if you're skilled enough. Not this one. Walking near enemies who are even 2 or 3 levels higher spells death for a solo or duo party.As with anything, there are cons. First, scaling is extreme. You can't expect to compete with people 10 levels higher, and enemies that high are out of the question for the casual adventurer. Second, and probably the only thing that made me stop playing, is the quest system. The quests are very repetitive, and if they aren't, the likelihood is that you're running for 10 minutes to where you need to go. Lastly, the story/lore is very long. If you don't like reading, this game is NOT for you. Most quests are on average several pages long of information you don't need unless you want lore.tl;drPros:Very optimized for any hardware, many events to partake in, and lots of character development.Cons:Extreme scaling of enemies and players and very repetitive and semi-boring quests.Give it a try. You can't lose much other than time and memory with this.			"

												Played since the origional release of the game. Having such a long history with the game i can only tell you the negatives since there are only a very few.If you want to pve and raid this game is unforgiving so you will need to always attend and always raid in order to keep up.If you want to pvp and rank up you can do that easily because you only need to pvp on occasion and it will still rank you up.if you expect to get everything for free well you wont because basic access only gives you the basic game. You can only level to max level using basic talents.. the Storm Legion and Nightmare Tide talents will be locked to you unless you buy siad expansions or spend hours grinding for the coin to unlock them ingame.thats about it really... 3 negs 1. without investing some time n money into this game you wont get the best of it... 2. raids take dedication above all else.3. not all talents are availible without paying or grinding for them.totally positive game imo. Slowly over 2 years of gameplay i have the SL talents NTE and a limited time offer that expanded my account to full bag space and 5 characters per server. Even tho i never managed to join a top ranking guild and raid till i drop i got to build my dimensions, pvp all day n nite, raid rift till i drop, enjoyed the seasonal events and geared into full Nightmare tide Expert gear with several upgrades...like what else can i say.

												I realize it looks like I've only played for a few hours, but I've probably played 400 hours before downloading it on Steam. This was the first game I really ever got into. I wasn't hooked at first, because it takes a while to get into the more interesting parts of the game (and I got really lost at first). But once you get there, and stop getting lost, I think it's a truly great game.A lot of reviews complain about it being pay to win. I've literally never felt compelled to pay for Patron or for any gear, etc. It's a great game without needing to invest any money into it. Yes, once you hit level 45(ish), it takes a while to earn the XP for the next level. But I've never felt bored doing so. I wouldn't still be playing it if I did. I've gotten to try Patron for free twice now, and I wasn't really impressed. There didn't seem to be enough of a difference, so I stick with free.Pros:Good graphicsPlenty of questsIf you don't feel like doing quests back to back, do one of the other million things to do (rifts, farm plants/butcher/fish, dungeons, PVP,etc)Pretty okay story linesCons:My character once got its head stuck in a table. Boss took advantage and killed me. So that suckedAlso the community is ehNot enough space in your bags/not enough unlocked spots for bagsI definitely recommend giving this game a chance. Maybe you won't like it, but it's free and very entertaining.Edit: I've now reached level 50, and I still love this game (and I'm still finding more to do). Also, they've added more areas and are (as far as I'm concerned) improving the game.			"

												After spending more then several weeks of gameplay alone with Rift, I can easily say that it's the most addictive grind i've ever done so far in an MMO. The free-form and the open events are two but many several options in this game that makes this game into a good online game.			"

												This game is a must play even if you don't like MMORPG's. The controls will be very awkward for most when you first start but you can completely change the key bindings and I would always be happy to make it much easier for you. This game allows you to really get involved with what goes on with your character. You can change everything about them and how they play against others. There is pvp where you test your skills against other players with your unique class or you can join a group and run through dungeons where you fight harder mobs and bosses. If you want to level other ways there is also the traditional questing. This is where you do something for someone in the game in exchange for experience which helps you level up. The max level is 60 and it is a very long journey. Everytime that you level up you get a little stronger and the end game level 60 content is worth the wait. So if you are considering playing this game then my advice would be yes and if you ever need help please ask about anything involving the game.			"

												What can I say about RIFT?  I'll keep this simple.  RIFT is my all-time favorite MMORPG.  It doesn't take the genre in a whole new direction.  What it does do, though (and quite successfully, I might add), is offer a stunning and exciting take on the classic MMO formula.  Classes have seeminly endless levels of customization, encouraging players to try different combinations of skill trees called Souls to build the perfect character for their play style.  This, along with the living world invasion events, where dozens of players hold off hundreds of enemies in an active zone event, comes together for an awesome MMORPG experience.  Sick of whiny twelve year olds playing World of Pandacraft?  Play RIFT.  It has an awesome community of gamers who take the experience seriously, and offer up endless help to those who need it.  It is a welcome challenge, too, offering more than just an endless chain of ""Kill 10 wolves"" quests (though those are there, too).  I have barely scratched the surface of this game in terms of content.  It's free, and it's complete, so give it a try.  If you like WoW, there is no reason not to, at the very least, give RIFT a shot.			"

												Out of all the free to play MMORPGs, this is probably the most polished wow clone. If you like PVE and PVP in wow, and you don't wanna pay a monthly fee, i recommend this as a great substitute. If you're sick of wow and want to try something else, you will probably get sick of this really fast. If that's the case, you could try TERA for it's ""action oriented combat"" and hopefully you won't notice how dull questing is there, but let's get back to RIFT! This game is packed with stuff you can do. It was worth playing while it had a subscription, so it is definitely worth checking out now more than ever!			"

												I would recommend this game to those who enjoy fantasy, Medieval, MMO's. To be honest I find this game way better than WoW. And I don't want to get into details on why I don't like WoW as much. Rift has interesting ""portals"" known as Rifts that occur in the game. The game itself is quite interesting, however I don't know a whole lot about the story to really summarize it for you. However if you do like fantasy, Medieval, MMO like games. Then this game is for you. Other than that I can't really explain this game without being able to summarize the story, which I can't do for you.Issues I have with the game:1. The fact that there's guns. I don't mind that there is guns in the game, I just wouldn't use them myself, but when it comes to a Medieval, Fantasy, RPG game. I don't imagine guns being apart of it.Other than that the game is great! And like I said, I don't know the whole story of the game to summarize it for you.			"

Having such a long history with the game i can only tell you the negatives since there are only a very few.If you want to pve and raid this game is unforgiving so you will need to always attend and always raid in order to keep up.If you want to pvp and rank up you can do that easily because you only need to pvp on occasion and it will still rank you up.if you expect to get everything for free well you wont because basic access only gives you the basic game. You can only level to max level using basic talents.. the Storm Legion and Nightmare Tide talents will be locked to you unless you buy siad expansions or spend hours grinding for the coin to unlock them ingame.thats about it really... 3 negs 1. without investing some time n money into this game you wont get the best of it... 2. raids take dedication above all else.3. not all talents are availible without paying or grinding for them.totally positive game imo. Slowly over 2 years of gameplay i have the SL talents NTE and a limited time offer that expanded my account to full bag space and 5 characters per server. Even tho i never managed to join a top ranking guild and raid till i drop i got to build my dimensions, pvp all day n nite, raid rift till i drop, enjoyed the seasonal events and geared into full Nightmare tide Expert gear with several upgrades...like what else can i say. The game is amazingly fun even for just casual players. MMO done right imo. =)			"

												I played this game when it was originally released and I just couldn't get into it.  Why on earth would I pay-per-month for a game almost exactly like WoW when I already am successful on WoW?  Now that I've left WoW, Rift being free-to-play is a perfect new home for my addiction.  It has the best free-to-play model I've seen in a MMO.			"

												This is seriously one of the best MMO's I've ever played. It's not Pay to win at all, though you might just end up spending money anyway because you want really cool (unecessary) vanity items. I really did enjoy it, though it takes a while to level.Pros:FREEVery versitile class systemAwesome communityInteresting loreNot Pay to winCons:Kinda buggyLong dungeon queues			"

												I had previously played this game before it became a FTP model for many untold nights. The grind is not as bad as people make it out to be, it is not a pay to win game to say the least. I had previously made a review regarding the game on my channel. It might help you decide if the game is worth your time and effort.

												Pros: -Amazing Art/Music/Trailers.-The hype buildup is real. -Class systems is 16/10, you can be any class you want! (You can have several classes, but not once you start out. You can always change though). -On Ultra settings, this game is super (running with GTX 570). -Guilds are very fun and interactive, crafting system is cool and has a variety. -This game is 100% free to play, you can get everything that you can buy with in game money (there is no limit you reach when playing FTP). World is huge and fun to explore as well.-Game is relatively new if you're into that kind of thing. Oh yeah, the world events are great. They pop up all the time and you get some cool loot.-The rift system is awesome and Nightmare Rifts are my favorite thing <3 -Haven't done a lot of PVP, but the line seperating Guardians and Defiants is prominent.-This game updates frequently.Cons: -Meh combat, I don't find it to be bad, but it's not that entertaining. There is definitely a HUGE variety in skills between classes though (good thing!). -This game could also use more players IMO			"

												Do NOT download this game through Steam.  The version on Steam is unpatchable/unplayable.  It's a waste of time and 18 gig of data.  Go to the developers site and DL it from them.  Good game, but don't get it through steam.  Just FYI, Typhoon Eddition does NOT give you ""2"" extra bag slots as advertised.  It's the only expansion I have purchased, so I know there were not overlapping bonus bag slots.			"

												Rift is pretty great. I say this as a longtime fan of the genre and a veteran of many similar MMOs. While it still doesn't quite reach the pinnacle of combat design polish of a game like World of Warcraft, it gets damn close, and I'd easily call worthy of the silver to WoW's gold. The class or ""soul"" mechanics that are used in developing your character's abilities make for a wider variety of potential characters than any mainstream MMO I can think of, while retaining a reasonable level of balance (no MMO is ever completely balanced, sadly).More importantly than those two things in playing it today though is the question of whether going F2P has changed the game for the worse. I've been playing since shortly after release, and I feel pretty confident saying that the game has constantly improved since that time, and shows no sign of slowing, even after the change to F2P. The ""restrictions"" (as all F2P games tend to have) on what you can access without paying any money are pretty reasonable. You can access all zones and raise your character to cap (60, as of this writing) and then continue on and participate in endgame content as you please. You won't have access to the Storm Legion souls (new souls, one for each class, originally added in the expansion, now available by themselves, as the remainder of the expansion content is free), but that's about it (as far as I understand it, I've continued to be a paying customer since the conversion).

												First off I just wanna say I've mabye spent around 1000 hours on this game off of steam. Anyways this game used to be really good, it had a large community of players, the pvp was amazing, and many raiding guilds to join. Although as the years went by, Trion has made the game more and more Pay2win. Also pvp has become very unbalanced because they buff powerful classes thinking it helps somehow. Overall they ♥♥♥♥ed up the game in a span of 4 years. Its worth playing to level up all the way to max level, although once at max level there isn't really anything to do.			"

												After playing a wopping 10 years of World of Warcraft, i sit down and play a very ill advertised game called RIFT: planes of Telara, and it blows my ♥♥♥♥in face off. I found in Rift what i thought Warcraft had forever ruined, it was a breath of fresh air with a very familiar and comfortable feel.Pros: -Huge area wide events that are constantly and randomly occuring.-Rifts.-planar invasions that can turn into whole area raids with rewards that make them worth while.- fun dungeons that compliment an area's story.-plenty incentive for all the loot ♥♥♥♥♥s out there.-the raids are a ♥♥♥♥ ton more entertaining and well put together, some of the best ive seen. ( compared to WoW)-a free to play system that is NEVER invasive and never restrictive.- a friendly cash shop experience where only cosmetic items, vanity, and low powered gear are available.-game is so full of content that it is sometimes overwhelming.-encourages you to play with other people, and features and easy public group or ""pug"" system.-Offers more than one way to quest and level your character.- a massive amount of character customization via the wardrobe tab.-game has a artifact system where you are rewarded for exploration.I havnt found many cons since i enjoy mmos anyway and am looking to play such.I find most negative reviews are given by people who dont actually enjoy mmos or ignorant people that did not understand the game's many systems or where trying too hard to compare the game to another mmo. Ive also seen a lo of bad reviews from people who are most likely trying to play it on a system that is sub par to the recommended settings. this game requires a high end to mid-high end machine.Overall you should give it a try, give it a chance and you will be hooked.(I have logged well over 400 hours outside of steam)			"

												One of the better MMORPG's out on the market currently with undoubtedly the best Free-2-play systems available. You don't need to spend any money to unlock zones, or quests. You can hit level cap without ANY hinderence. Unlike other f2p MMO's they tend to penalize the experience gain, well in Rift everyone earns 100% but subscribers earn even more experience!Rift has a very rich PvE experience, Such as:- A very fleshed out end-game raiding. Multiple 10 and 20 man raids that vary in difficulty and tiers, whether in organized guild runs or Pugs in general chat.- Plenty of dungeons to run with expert mode(heroic) which allows for greater challenge and better loot and badges/emblems/tokens to redeem for epics.- Chronicles, which are single or 2 player story-based instances that drops blues/epics that may be slightly weaker or on par with expert dungeon gear - they are usually pretty quick and can be done once daily to help gear along with dungeons for pre-raiding.- Huge open world content! Giant boss battles that dwarf whatever Guild Wars 2 dynamic event bosses have to offer, As well as huge rifts in which potentially several raids participate in.Pros:- A very classic/BC WoW feel. Very good class building and talent/skill system.- Player housing! Be as creative as you can be! Crazy things can be done here, albeit not as indepth as Everquest II.- Casual and Hardcore friendly. Enjoy exploring the world, doing quests, collecting mini-pets and mounts, and searching for artifacts across the world, collecting titles and achievements, also items for your house! There's also plenty of things to grind for the super hardcore players.Cons:- The grind can get tedious if you're not used to the older style of World of Warcraft, however It's still easier than some of the more hardcore old school MMO's.- Auction house is not usable unless you have spent at least 5 dollars in-game OR have bought the game or subscribed for at least one month.- PvP is kind of lacking, very basic WoW-style battlegrounds is all you're going to get here. PvP ranks are also very long to grind.- While most of the game is completely free, you are not able to play the expansion ""souls"" (classes technically) without buying them seperately or owning Storm Legion. They can be bought in-game for around 20 dollars and it includes 4 souls (classes) Not entirely necessary, but definitely useful to own end-game raiding when multiple roles are needed.Overall it's a great MMO, especially for older WoW veterans and newer MMO players a like. Very accessible but also has a lot of depth in terms of class building and skills.Subscription can also be bought with in-game gold, although it will be very difficult for newer players, if you manage to hit level cap and do a bit of farming you'll be able to afford it without too much of an issue.It's free! Give it a shot, the first few levels might be a bit rough and boring but once you get going it's a wonderful ride!			"

												'There was once a lone wonderer in RIFT. His name was Tangociss. He dished out justice wherever he went, slaying bandits and killing mobs. With his allies on Skype and in his guild, he would adventure throughout Telera and bring justice to the poor NPCs who would offer him quests. He would avenge the poor corpses of NPCs with quests that they gave and the like. Tangociss was a fine fellow indeed, recruiting members into his guild that he formed with his buddies Gisten, BorisPower, Snatmia and Vrush. Tangociss adventured around, closing Rifts and collecting artefacts while gaining repuatation towards the different factions. With his pet and mount, they were hardly ever still in a town, always out in the world adventuring..'- Extract taken from the offical mind of Tangociss Furrociss himself: 15:43 22/08/2014 ©If you maged to read the story, then yes, you get to do all the stuff I mentioned. You close Rifts for loot and the like, form guilds, adventure around and the like. Trust me, it is indeed a good game. Just so ya know, play it with some buddies so ya don't get bored. As for class wise, there are 4 of 'em. Warrior Cleric, Mage and Rouge. There are some rather nice sub-classes within the actual class, so if you choosse warrior, you can be a warlord, or beastmaster (apologies if I mispelt the names) depending on yer playstyle. There are 2 main factions, the Guardians and the Defiansts. Depending on the faction you choose, the starting location and tutorials area will be different along with quests and NPCs you will encounter, but gameplay wise it will still be the same. As for pets and mounts, you use coins (in game currency) which are silver, gold and platnium. You can also buy credits for real money but it is used mainly for cosmetic items. To buy pets, you can buy 'em with loot gained from turning in artefact sets or use credits. You can get a mount in the 2 factions main citys. The mounts range from horses to pandas to even Hellbugs. Quite fun indeed. If all this sounds enjoyable, go ahead and give this game a go. Oh yeah, our guild is recruiting. Doesn't matter what faction yer in, we take any and all members, if you wanna join us, give this guild 'Righteous Alliance' a look in the guild finder, and just say ya read this review or whatever, so I can invite ya in. Happy adventuring my friends!			"

												One of the better free to play MMOs that there is, probably because it didn't start that way.  There's some interesting dynamics and things I don't care for.  The fact that each class has the ability to be dps, tank or healer is convenient but the fact that each one can switch their spec on the fly makes building a dynamic group difficult because everyone can do everything... so you are not needed.  They will constantly change skills and trees in an attempt to balance, but they overdo it to the point where you have trouble keeping up with the changes and sometimes ruin what you had.  Like most MMOs these days, top level and end game has a huge gap, to the point where you feel like you're a level one fighting a top level when you face off against a top geared player.  Lastly, the constant paid DLCs result in paying even more money than if this game weren't f2p... $355 for all of it?  This game has a lot of fun stuff but not worth getting attached to.			"

This allmost happen every single patch you are forced to wait for them to fix the graphics bugs. in this case the char select screen does not load properly. This is the only reason i cant recommend this game. The installer you get trough steam does not install microsoft visual c++ 2010 redistributable that is needed to run the game properly so it has to be installed separetly or if you install dc universe online steam will install it as a first run process but rift installer does not install it.

												This is a solid MMO. While the gameplay is a bit old school (tab targeting) it is fun. The class system is awesome! You can be anything simply by switching builds/gear which only costs a small amount of gold (the build switch). The F2P model is very fair. The only annoying thing is the auction house lock for completely free players but you can unlock it for 5 dollars and that 5 bucks can buy you a decent bit of stuff.  Some people say making earing slots exclusive to the expansion is Pay to Win, but I disagree. Earings give minimal stats, are obtainable in game, and make zero difference until the very end game.  Farming a bit of in game currency instead of paying for a full expansion seems like a decent tradeoff in my opinion. Overall, fun game.			"

												Was a great MMORPG before it went F2P, then things kind of just went downhill.  I'm not saying that because I'm some bitter P2P guy who just hates all the F2P gamers.  The community really did drastically change when the game went F2P, especially in the lower levels.   It can be a bit frustrating at times rolling a new character.  The chat spam is ultimately what turned me away from the game.  No matter what you do, you can't keep up with it.  You're nearly constantly spammed.  I have spent quite a few of my sessions ignoring spammers a lot more than what I should have to.  Albeit, this was all around 6 months ago, so maybe things have cleared up.  This was an amazing game in it's prime - easily beating out every other MMORPG I have ever played.  But, sadly, I just can't recommend it anymore, which is sad because I made some great friends and had great times in RIFT....			"

												I got this game back at the ""From the Embers"" update, before it was ""f2p"" or even on steam. Back then, it was my favorite game. Everything about it was great: the graphics, the story line, the unique form of pve, and the amazing soul system. When Trion (damn them) made the game free, it all started going downhill. The became lazy with updates, most lacking any solid story, not to mention the fact that the quests were repetitive. I could tolerate this to an extent. However, the deal breaker for me was the major class changes. Every class could play every role, which got rid of the diversity, and even changed some of the souls completely. My main was a reaver tank, Therefore, my entire character was torn apart and made irrelevant. This game had so much potential, and I enjoyed it even more than WoW. Sadly, Trion took it down the wrong path, and it seemed to become a completely different game. Therefore, unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												First off lets get something straight, you can currently play all content without paying a penny, so many people are complaining its P2W but its not, i've played a small amount of time in rift (currently 1.7k hours) and if i didnt want to i didnt have to pay anything, yes there is a new expansion being released which you are being asked to pay for but you can get it for as little as £30 atm (prob cheaper elsewhere if you know where to look) but then how many wow expansions have you had to pay for ? oh all of them.The game is great imo, plenty of people playing and assuming you get talking in local you can join a decent active guild like i have.  My current guild mates purposly did dungeons they had completed ages ago to get me and others geared (my newest character that is), Yes you can pay cash to open certain things like earrings but you can also use ingame currency for that too (which currently takes no time at all to get).The gfx are great and trion have recently introduced quad core support but only time will tell if it improves my already decent fps or not.Would i recommend this game ? yes, its an mmo so get yourself into an active guild (there are plenty out there) enjoy all the current content (which is free), If you are thinking of spending a bit of real life cash then get the expansion (out on 16 nov).All in all I love rift and will hopefully be playing it for years to come.

However this game has so many features like  dungeons, Instant Advanture, PvP, dimension, and skills like crafting that you will never get bored! Once you are bored at doing dungeons you can simply do PvP instead and if you are bored again, do some dimension!! Especially when i first found out about dimension, I was amazed that I could build my own house and other stuff! It was like minecraft within MMORPG!I really enjoyed playing this game myself and I highly recommend this game to everyone.			"

												It's that one game I keep forgetting why I had uninstalled, but then quickly remember why.-Pvp is completely dead, and there's only one server for open world pvp, which is also dead. -The jew store prices keep going up and you must buy things if you want to actually level up to 65 without dying in the process. -community just ♥♥♥♥ posts in map chat and doesn't do jack ♥♥♥♥, so doing dungeons is unheard of.-Completely pay to win-no one does the fun group ♥♥♥♥just don't bother with this ♥♥♥♥ing game unless you are rich, because you'll be homeless if you aren't			"

												Came back after many years, found a world where everything was teleporting and rubber-banding about.  I'd shoot at enemies and they'd vanish, so I'd try to walk away, only to find a few seconds later I would be zapped over to some new location and locked in melee with that foe - who was still standing fifty feet away in another direction, but we were in melee anyway.Also I discovered that I could now walk through walls.  This seemed awesome at first until I tried to go back into town but realized that I couldn't, because instead of climbing stairs I just kept walking through them instead.  At no point during this experiment did I ever see another actual human player.As for the parts that did still work... well, it was never impressive to begin with.  The entire MMO industry has degraded itself into little more than a machine to produce WoW clones, and this game is no exception.  The graphics may change and maybe, just maybe, some games will add a whole third faction (this one does not), but in the end it's all the same tropes, the same combat, the same classes, the same mounts, the same grind and the same empty, meaningless themepark ride for a world full of ""chosen ones"" that only exists to be a barrier between the new player and the max level guild/clan raiding gang - the ""whales"" of the industry who can always be counted on to trade in their college fund for a one point PvP advantage that only lasts until the next DLC/expansion pack comes out.In other words, if you've played any three other fantasy MMOs in your lifetime then you've already played RIFT, or at least you may as well have.  You've already seen everything that you'd see in this game.  If you still want to put yourself through this year's re-skinning of that same game then have fun with that, but to me it doesn't matter what kind of sauce you put on tofu - it's still just tofu.Now you may not agree with this but again, not one other human player this time around and honestly, I never saw more than half a dozen outside of the towns even when the game was brand new.  So don't just take my word on it - look around.  Forget the zombie survival games, this is your real ""Last Man on Earth"" experience right here.So considering all of this and the general state of the game I'm not the least bit surprised by their new big push to sell an expansion pack (you know, those things that most other MMOs give away for free?).  Well of course they're trying to get everyone to buy a $40DLC.  That last cash influx will make for nice golden little parachute for the company executives  who are probably laughing all the way to their banks in Switzerland before pulling the life support on this vegetable and heading off to the magical realm of comfy retirement.

												Pros:FunNice classes, great skillsMany cool mountsRifts are fun and ppl do do them, well most of them.Cons:""best-in-class Free-to-Play model"" Mmmm wrong. Its not the best nore the worst but they do lie sense it is a trick/trap to lure you in till you are lvl 30ish then you learn the hard way-Cant use the AH unless you pay $$ outright for loyalty to use the AH. To do so you need to grind for a month to buy 1 Rex that will give you the ability to use the AH and it cost 1.3k-p.Cant equip earrings, you need to pay $$ to unlock early on or use Rex to get credits to unlock it, again that is a 30 day quest grind.Servers are dead, you can spend 3 days trying to sell an item in chat at 60% lower then AH and still will not sell a wanted item.ill just thumbs it down sense im at 50/50, it has enough thumbs up.

												Rift was my third true MMO love. I played WoW from launch till BC, I played LOTRO from pre-order to Lorochel and then I played Rift. I loved Rift. Rift isn't what I loved. It's now a microtransaction riddled face-roll spamfest. If RIft ever want back in time Id give it a solid 8/10 but today I'd have to give it a 2/10 because there's no challenege, no fun.For instance, I logged in after not playing since right atfer the first expansion, so that's 2 years? I decided to see how the game was with my wife who always played with me. We logged-in to our lvl 50 characters ahd queed up for a new 'hard mode' dungeon so we could gauge the gameplay. We found a group rather quickly with me queing as a Tank and Her a Healer.  I was unable to locate my shield for whatever reason it was just nowhere to be found. I'm thinking we're going to be screwed, hopefully the group doesn't realize I'm tanking without a shield and kick me. Maybe a shield will drop before anyone notices. :P We're killing everything so ridiculously easily that we're pulling entire rooms and she's barely even playing. SHe goes AFK halfway through the dungeon and we easily complete it without her... Pathetic.			"

The bag space issue for f2p accounts can be pretty obnoxious but considering some of the greed machines out there like swotor, and omfg evolve (I know it's not an mmo but freaking for real) they set a pretty good baseline for thier business mod.The games best innovation is really based around their soul system (talents, traits, or whatever) that really allow you to customize your playstyle to where your almost designing your own class.

												Something that I have to say about this is that it pretty much stands in its own pedistole. It's fun for a while until you realize that almost, if not all, players in the game bought their gear with microtransactions. Therefore making it a bit Pay-2-Win. The game is complete Free-2-Play and releases frequent updates and patches. Pros:- Amazing graphics for an MMORPG- Great PvP- Free-2-play- Frequent Updates- Great community- Best parties/dungeon raidings I've seen in an MMORPG yet- Amazing EnviromentCons:- Pay-2-Win- MicrotransactionsOverall, if you're a fan of the MMORPG genre, then this is a must play game.

												Rift is an excellent first mmo for anyone and a nice relief for WoW veterans. the class system is creative and lets you make a ton of different combinations. the rifts are a nice touch and to tell you the truth i didnt think i would care much for them. the rifts add a sense of urgency and unity in the community and offer decent rewards. the graphics in and outside of rifts are just short of top notch. extremely tiny bits of lags but other than that no technical problems to speak of. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants all the good of a traditional mmo with a twist for fun.			"

												RIFT!!! Everyone then scrambles to get themselves together , mounting and running across maps and get in on the kills of creatures breaking forth from a portal busting/tearing through reality for epic loot and rewards. Thats this game. A RPG MMO with a style and theme that runs with a very in depth fantastic storyline. The world of Telara is pretty much in ruin by a bad guy sorceror evil evil guy. His names Regulas, charismatic with followers and evil evilness. No one can seem to defeat him and the 2 factions Defiant and Guardains are just as much at war with each other as with Regulas. So with crazy ancient technology that is very artistic and themed throughout this game. Kinda reminds me of Stargate SG-1 stuff, create the ascended with souls and this crazy technology steampunk stuff. Thats you, an ascended and off to character creation and off to the story line of grooming yourself to go back in time to kill Regulas for your faction and save Telara. YAY. Factions of Guardians ( chosen of the gods) or Defiants ( we got this bro) is more of race selection. Guardians have humans, elfs and dwarfs. Defiants have humans, elfs and bahmi. Bahmi are the games created race and seem orcish spiritual brutes. So with that there is classes-Warrior, cleric , mage, rogue. SIMPLE? no. this is where RIFT brings more to the custimizable table. True you have a class, but for each class you choose 3 soul trees out of a large list of souls. Each souls tree brings a very specific playing style, abilities, skills. So mix/match what you want to do as your chosen class with 3 soul trees. There are lots of souls, you can change the souls according to role or gear or w/e AT ANY POINT OF THE GAME. You can definantly be so custimizable with your class its nuts. Its fun. Warrior that has a warrior pet? yes. Rogue with a bow that heals? yes. So with the possibilities endless and the freedom to do it. DO IT. Thus then you play the game, like I said going back in time to prep yourself for the coming battle against Regulas for honor of your faction.  Aspects of the game of equipment and class upgrading is typical of RPGMMOs. Points and better gear and abilities and such while leveling doing quests/missions and grinding. Crafting is about the same of choose what fits your class or what you want to do and do as follows to get better. Armorcrafting, runecrafting, outfitting and such. Fishing and survivialism everyone has and starts off with . They are nice ''food eating health buffs'' and time killing crafting. Higher levels is higher rewards, but harder to craft. Fun and rewarding.  This game has 2 neat little aspects of minnions and demensions. Minnions are little creatures that you collect and send off to do quests to gather stuff ( crafting stuff) for you and level up and Dimensions are little homemade houses and areas you collect decor on  and make your own. These have become the new standerd of RPGMMOs, Rift does fill that void and does a good job implementing their own style and theme into it.  oh and yes, .... RIFTS?! are little portal/tears in reality that element specific creatures do spawn out of, and show up randomly, accessable to anybody and when shut down through waves/stages you get epic gear and loot. trust me, you want in on them whenever/whereever possible. its the game. its fun.

												Played from closed beta in december 2010 to about the start of 2013. Over 1000 hours clocked on all my characters combined and I can say RIFT is one of the best MMOs out there. I stopped right around the free to play model kicked in, but it arguably has the best F2P model out there for an MMO as well. I can't speak for the current content in the Nightmare Tide expansion, but back in vanilla the raid Hammerknell Fortress really stood out. That is without a doubt my favourite raid, EVER. But that is of course past content I'm praising, so I can only vouch for this game for what it once was ... But that game was easily a 10/10.			"

												I came back into the game after a long break, had all classes level 65,  T1 raid gear on all, ready to try to get back into it. First expert dungeon, got kicked by some very busy guys because of my dps (rusty on the rotations and all, but sill good for an expert).Ok. Trying some PvP. nearly one shoted by a pyromancer, the numbers on the health bars and on the dps meter are kinda depressing. Very well. I start to remember why i left this game.Checking my currencies, my reputations and stuff, i realize that im going for the same old repetitive frustrating grind if i stay. ok. Alt F4. Then, i reopen the game, log in on a lvl 35 rogue, and start queing for some pvp. I have always found low level pvp extremely fun, mostly because once you understand what build and what stuff is godlike at certain levels, then you just walk on the maps slaughtering anyone who did not, and have some cool fights against more prepared people.So i wait 30 minutes, get into a match. Ok 20/2 cool will be fun. Queue for another wait 7 hours (really 7 hours), alt f4 another time, unistalling the game this time. Bye rift.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! PVE IS EASY MODE no CHALLANGE you can easily beat it without gear; items you craft dont effect the out come of ANYTHING. i.e. potion buffs or heals potions wether you used them or not doesnt change out come of encounters. PVE further is a ghost town, you will never find anyone doing quests. PVP can be fun, however TRION can care less about balance, they have all the dps k/d data for YEARS and still encourage only ROGUE DPS or Inferno classes, which you will see 75% rogues then kinda a mix of everything else, considering the dozens of class combinations, that is REALLY SAD. Tanks are useless unless you are doing PVE and even then you can do all the dungeons primarily with your eyes closed.  ITS A GAME OF DOING THINGS JUST TO DO THEM, WHAT YOU ACTUALLY END UP DOING IS BASED ON WHAT IS THE LEAST BORING< NOT WHAT IS THE MOST FUN!!!			"

												The few hours I spent playing this game were painstaking. There was absolutely no redeeming factor to the fact that the combat was bland and there was nothing fun about this game. The first class I picked, some sort of stealthy assassin rogue-like class, was apparently so underpowered that it was completely unplayable. It took me 15 minutes to find a friendly player to tell me that that class is practically unplayable because you can't even kill the beginning monsters. I had thought I was doing something wrong. Apparently, the interesting classes need someone to heal them 24/7 and their attacks are weak. The rest of the classes, as far as I could tell, were the generic Warrior/Mage, etc. classes.  Already off to a rough start, I find out there is a subscription (ugh, what is this, Club Penguin?) and that there are also microtransactions and starter packs between $40 and $150.Quite honestly, this game could easily be worse than most RPGs. It's unbalanced classes, money-eating methods, and absolutely NO exciting things about the game leave it to be just another generic piece of crap designed to eat your money. I know this may sound a bit extreme, but without anything to redeem this game from all the bad stuff, what can be said to be good about it?If you're looking for an RPG, try anything but this. Now that I think about it, I think I found more good things in Bad Rats than I did in this game.2/10, generic RPG, don't waste your time			"

												Graphics are good, game mechanics are good, community is good and the fact that you can puchase extensions/dlc with in game cash is good. I like the Rifts, and in big area events, where dozens to hundreds of people fight together some bigger than life enemy. I've played WoW from vanilla to WoTLK, countless hours. I played Guild Wars 2, 4charcs to 80 and then some. I've tried Age of Conan, Warhammer Online, LoTR Online, Secret World, Perfect World, Rusty Hearts, TERA, etc. But RIFT is still my all time favourite. Thank god there is variety, so if this is not your cup of tea, you can try something else :)			"

												Very fun and addictive, if you enjoyed WOW, then you will like this, it is very easy to pick up and the game mechanics are pretty good when you spend a little time into them. there is a slight downside but only very slight, as the game is free to play there are some players that pay to win, but you dont have to pay to enjoy this game. i ended up going ahead and became a patron (buying a subscription) mainly because the benifits of playing the game are really fun and i figured that i will contribute to something that i like as anyone does with things that they like. i would recommend that you are careful because i have seen players spend a lot of money into it and not pay attention. all in all its a fun experience and a well developed MMO. also the side quests/games are pretty fun as well.

												RIFT is an amazing game for WoW transitioners or MMORPG gamers alike. It has all the similar elements of raid events, group bosses, and various quests and tasks for you to do so that you're never really bored playing RIFT. The graphics are a bit outdated but by preference it matches the theme of the game itself. The gameplay is smooth and always action packed, although skill and pet effects may be a bit lacking.Overall, I definitely would recommend this game to anyone, first time and veteran MMORPG gamers.

												I played this game for a couple of hours and wasn't at all satisfied. The graphics are dated, but the fps is horrible, which doesn't make any sense (very, very bad game optimization). The quests are quite generic and boring. While the game adds something new to the genre with the addition of Rift events it really isn't worth your time in my humbble opinion. This game generated a lot of hype, but I think it's just overrated - people say it's good and feel it's good just because they read on Gamespot or IGN that it's good, and those sites get payed for their reviews.4/10			"

												RIFT!!! Everyone then scrambles to get themselves together , mounting and running across maps and get in on the kills of creatures breaking forth from a portal busting/tearing through reality for epic loot and rewards. Thats this game. A RPG MMO with a style and theme that runs with a very in depth fantastic storyline. The world of Telara is pretty much in ruin by a bad guy sorceror evil evil guy. His names Regulas, charismatic with followers and evil evilness. No one can seem to defeat him and the 2 factions Defiant and Guardains are just as much at war with each other as with Regulas. So with crazy ancient technology that is very artistic and themed throughout this game. Kinda reminds me of Stargate SG-1 stuff, create the ascended with souls and this crazy technology steampunk stuff. Thats you, an ascended and off to character creation and off to the story line of grooming yourself to go back in time to kill Regulas for your faction and save Telara. YAY. Factions of Guardians ( chosen of the gods) or Defiants ( we got this bro) is more of race selection. Guardians have humans, elfs and dwarfs. Defiants have humans, elfs and bahmi. Bahmi are the games created race and seem orcish spiritual brutes. So with that there is classes-Warrior, cleric , mage, rogue. SIMPLE? no. this is where RIFT brings more to the custimizable table. True you have a class, but for each class you choose 3 soul trees out of a large list of souls. Each souls tree brings a very specific playing style, abilities, skills. So mix/match what you want to do as your chosen class with 3 soul trees. There are lots of souls, you can change the souls according to role or gear or w/e AT ANY POINT OF THE GAME. You can definantly be so custimizable with your class its nuts. Its fun. Warrior that has a warrior pet? yes. Rogue with a bow that heals? yes. So with the possibilities endless and the freedom to do it. DO IT. Thus then you play the game, like I said going back in time to prep yourself for the coming battle against Regulas for honor of your faction.  Aspects of the game of equipment and class upgrading is typical of RPGMMOs. Points and better gear and abilities and such while leveling doing quests/missions and grinding. Crafting is about the same of choose what fits your class or what you want to do and do as follows to get better. Armorcrafting, runecrafting, outfitting and such. Fishing and survivialism everyone has and starts off with . They are nice ''food eating health buffs'' and time killing crafting. Higher levels is higher rewards, but harder to craft. Fun and rewarding.  This game has 2 neat little aspects of minnions and demensions. Minnions are little creatures that you collect and send off to do quests to gather stuff ( crafting stuff) for you and level up and Dimensions are little homemade houses and areas you collect decor on  and make your own. These have become the new standerd of RPGMMOs, Rift does fill that void and does a good job implementing their own style and theme into it.  oh and yes, .... RIFTS?! are little portal/tears in reality that element specific creatures do spawn out of, and show up randomly, accessable to anybody and when shut down through waves/stages you get epic gear and loot. trust me, you want in on them whenever/whereever possible. its the game. its fun.

												Edit: I'm not quite sure who the target market for this game is. MOBAs in general have much more lively and balanced pvp matches. And they are f2p as well. Raiding in general is a laggy low-fps jerkfest. My hardware isn't the top of the line, but it handled GTA5 at a decent detail level and framerate. Maybe people who like terrain puzzles and hunting artifacts? Maybe that's the real target market of this game still? Maybe the 5mans? Except that you'll be waiting for a 5man queue to pop maybe once an hour? The scintillating general chat?Edit: The other thing that annoys me is how the expac souls are engineered to be so much better than the vanilla souls, so that you'll be forced to buy and play the new soul packs. So, if you are say, a mage, you will be forced to play harbinger, whether you want to or not, just because it does the required amount of dps needed to pass the content. Just one example of how f2p ruins a game over time. Another gripe would be how pvp rarely ever feels balanced, where almost every match feels like you're stomping the other team or you're getting stomped on. It's rare you see comebacks or even close scores at the end. It wouldn't matter except that they merged pvp and pve gear together, so that any change in pvp now affects pve, and if there's one thing pvp is always lobbying for, it's change, change, change.Edit: The thing that really annoys me about this game is the lag. I'm sure that other MMOs do trickery to mask the underlying network latency, and perhaps Trion should look into that. That and the annoying little bugs related to the UI and display that have been in the game since launch. Their QA isn't nearly up to the level that Blizzard's is. And instead of fixing the bugs, Trion seems more interested in rolling out game after game after game. With probably the same sort of bugs in them too.Edit: Not really pay to win, unless you're willing to shell out $100s. I'm guessing like all freemium models, they're relying on a few big whales to fund the playtime for everyone else. The current level cap 5man experts are decently hard. I can see where they tried to require teamwork, but all it has really done is make the tank shoulder an unequal burden in a PUG. Hence, players willing to tank are rather rare and you will be sitting in an expert queue for quite a while. The entry level raids are also decently hard too and do require even more teamwork to pull off. All in all, if you refrain from being a whale, it's a decent amount of content for not much money. PvP is rather laggy, if you ask me. I asked other people whether this sort of lag was normal and they said yes. So if you like crisp clear PvP, be prepared to be a little bit disappointed.I played this game when it first came out. At the time, it was quite challenging, the 5man experts required quite a bit of teamwork to pull off properly. I left it when it was still hard, and still a subscription game, mainly because the internet I had sucked at the time. Can't really heal when you're lagging 5000ms. Not really fun either.I decided to revisit it again, seeing as it's now f2p and subscriptionless, just to see what it's like these days. Everything is now easy mode, you're only in danger of dying if you get out of range of the healer. Otherwise the mobs just die in front of you and give you that sweet XP. The world is also ridiculously easy too, they've set the aggro radius on most mobs to be quite small, it's fairly easy to saunter in somewhere, hit a quest and then saunter back out.I'm disturbed by the fact that you can now buy purple gear at the level cap. It may be a tier behind and the current tier you may have to play for, but it looks a lot like pay to win. I've no objection to paying for things, and in some ways, f2p makes for a nicer experience. Because nobody's on the clock (either you or the game designers) you don't feel that urgent need to zip through the levels to get to the cap, so you can get on with raiding. And the game designers (who you're really playing against) don't feel that need to slow you down, so they can get more money out of you. Time is money. You want to move fast, they want you to move slow.But paying to win goes a bit too far. I haven't reached 65 yet (only 55 now), so we'll see.Everybody (if you're willing to pay for it) can now do every role. Mages, can literally tank. Yes literally. The mage tank is no longer a joke. Warriors, can heal. No, not with bandages. They really can heal.But if you just want something to kill time with, and all you care about is questing and 5mans, there's a lot of free content they're just giving away. Even if all you do is just dps with one of the original soul combos, it'll probably take you at least a month to get to 65. And then you can just move on to something else :P			"

												This is a pretty good MMO. It's free, but I would totally pay money to have it. There are a few microtransactions in it, but they aren't necessary to have fun in the game. They're actually pretty pointless, but I guess they have to make money some how. The basis of this game is all about rifts (how the title of the game originated). There are MMO-typical quests throughout, but there are also rifts which are tears into other dimensions. These rifts produce monsters, and you must fight them off to seal the rift. There are many types of rifts, from fire to water to earth to air, and many others I didn't mention. Several mobs appear which you have to fight off (sometimes alone, sometimes with friends). There are different stages within a rift. The higher stage you get to, the harder the mobs become to kill. When a rift is finally sealed, you get rewards. Most importantly, you get planarite (how much you get depends on the stage you reach). Planarite can be used to buy planar goods, which can help you with battling more rifts or by improving your armor to make you more OP. So far, I've only gotten to level 21 or 22, but I can tell that I will be playing this for a long time.			"

I am an avid RPG player and enjoy the thrill of leveling a charecter to fruition and exploring strange places, meeting new people and trying to be the best there is.What I found with Rift was a horrible user interface coupled with poor AI, poor graphics, and no tutorial on how to play.

												Pay2Win gear clearance for any gear and appropriate slots have turned me off to this game. You can either pay 900 platinum (a lot) of in game currency for the access, get 100000 void stones for it, (3 weeks worth since theres a weekly cap of 47000 and you gain less than 50 at a time) or you can give Trion 25 dollars for it. (defeating the purpose of F2P)You were supposed to get me, a returning player, back into the game by offering my new features, places to go, and things to do until I hit level 65. By then Id be back into the game enough to where I wouldnt be bothered by something like that. But you cant seriously expect me to instantly dump a bunch of money into something I cant experience at all just on a whim. How am I supposed to get hooked back into the game when the first quest in the game offers me a level 59 quest reward item that REQUIRES THIS CLEARANCE. Right off the effing bat. Im not grinding for 3 weeks for it, nor am I shelling out money for it. And since I dont have that kind of platinum, Im uninstalling this game again for the 3rd time. The first time was before it was even on Steam, the second time was a year ago when I got bored, and this third time is within an hour of playing it again because of the realization that Im instantly behind a money wall as soon as I try to quest in the new area.

												Rift, this is your average MMORPG. Nothing to make it standout. Yet, It use to be pay to play, so it might have a little bit of more polishing and features than the average MMORPG. Crafting, PVP,PVE that sums it up. A alot of random events, and a lot of mounts. No flying yet though. This is the routine you're going to be doing : Leveling, Grinding Gear, Grinding Gear. Yup. Expect to do that for the rest of Rift life. Still a great game if you enjoy those things.			"

												I gave this game a fair chance, but I must say I disliked it. I played for a hour or so and just got bored. The game was repititive and kind of boring. Charactor creation was donep nicely like with Elder Scrolls Online. The game was strangely configured in my opinion. Enemies didn't really act agressive to me until I stabbed them or there was a prompt to. I just couldn't get a good experience out of this game. I really looked forward to and wanted to play it but it was as good as the sun on a stick.			"

												This game is VERY good. The learning curve is much higher than WoW's with many elements of design to progress your character however the main mechanics and interface is very similar. The free-to-play format is quite good even with that element of pay-to-win staring you in the face, though it is not necessary. You may find many hours spilling into this game based on good quest lines and dungeon/raid designs. The community is quite large and finding people to play with in this huge world is never a problem. Many of the player base has in fact played World of Warcraft at some time or still does. The game is power hungry on cpu/gpu so if you got it, be prepared to enjoy some of the best visuals in this MMORPG. Kudos to the Trion team for support and continued design and expansion of this superb title!			"

												This is a very fun game. Me and my friends are always online together. There is so much you can do on the game that it doesn't get old. There are always quests to do, instant adventures, and PVP battles. Only complaints I have is that many of the more useful items to buy from the shops are bought with platinum which takes a while to earn. My tip is to play the instant adventures. It is the quickest way that I have found to earn platinum fast. They also have a different currency on the game dedicated to those who have put their own money into it. There are lots of items and such that you cannot buy from the store unless you pay with money. Bummer but its a free game so I expected it in the first place. It doesn't effect the gameplay any and the game is just as fun and addicting whether you decide to put your own money in it or not. Also it doesn't give certain players an advantage over one another just because they use money and not in game currency, which is nice. I have found that trying to get into a PVP warfront is difficult if you are a lower level and i have had wait times to get in to be extremely long. Overall I love the game and I would highly recommend it.			"

												I only recently attached Rift to Steam but I have WELL over 1,000 hours into this game, so I guess I can speak on it.  I do think you can play this game as a F2P game but like anything else if you want the extras then you have to pay - the company has to make a living too.  I personally pay to be a patron monthly and think it's very reasonable and worth it for what you can included.  I would recommend trying the game and seeing what you think and then giving patron's a shot if you like it enough.  I like as much or maybe even more than WoW.  Pros:- Dynamic boss battles.- Fun dungeons and quite a few of them- Very nice graphics.- Always something to work towards and quite different than a lot of the other mmo's out there.  This gives you a great variety of ways to go for leveling your character as well.  - TONS of end of world content!- Very good raid content.- You can transfer to other shards for free.  So, if your friend is in another place, that is fine - just transfer over.  There is also an in-game option that allows you to play with other people who are in other shards without any fuss at all.  This is VERY handy.  Cons:- Sometimes a bit glitchy, but Trion always works it out and makes it up to their customers eventually- PVP is decent but not as good as WoW.- Armor design could be a little better - could use more variety.  But still decent.  - They nickle and dime you on the really nice mounts.  However, you can get a normal mount without having to put real money into it, so it comes down to a vanity thing.  - This game might not be the best for a person who wants to play solo.  There are a lot of almost forced situations in which you really need to group up with people to complete a task.  If you are ok with just randomly grouping and then going your seperate way then you'll be fine.			"

												The few hours I spent playing this game were painstaking. There was absolutely no redeeming factor to the fact that the combat was bland and there was nothing fun about this game. The first class I picked, some sort of stealthy assassin rogue-like class, was apparently so underpowered that it was completely unplayable. It took me 15 minutes to find a friendly player to tell me that that class is practically unplayable because you can't even kill the beginning monsters. I had thought I was doing something wrong. Apparently, the interesting classes need someone to heal them 24/7 and their attacks are weak. The rest of the classes, as far as I could tell, were the generic Warrior/Mage, etc. classes.  Already off to a rough start, I find out there is a subscription (ugh, what is this, Club Penguin?) and that there are also microtransactions and starter packs between $40 and $150.Quite honestly, this game could easily be worse than most RPGs. It's unbalanced classes, money-eating methods, and absolutely NO exciting things about the game leave it to be just another generic piece of crap designed to eat your money.

												Graphics are good, game mechanics are good, community is good and the fact that you can puchase extensions/dlc with in game cash is good. I like the Rifts, and in big area events, where dozens to hundreds of people fight together some bigger than life enemy. I've played WoW from vanilla to WoTLK, countless hours. I played Guild Wars 2, 4charcs to 80 and then some. I've tried Age of Conan, Warhammer Online, LoTR Online, Secret World, Perfect World, Rusty Hearts, TERA, etc. But RIFT is still my all time favourite.

												RIFT is good. If you need free, and you have a friend that will play this with you, go for it. And when you do, give it a real try the same way you would a paid game. It's easy to shelf a free game if it doesn't feel amazing within 30 minutes. But if you pay $40+ for a game, you usually give it several hours even if it's mediocre.However, if you haven't played Guild Wars 2, you should try that first. It used to be pay once to play forever, but now it's free to play except the expansion (past level 80). GW2 is a lot better than RIFT.So, I guess even though I'm recommending RIFT, it's for a specific group of people: someone that can only play a free game and has played GW2 and TERA and SWTOR so much that he's tired of them.

												Great game, I enjoyed that the world fights back essentally, and the graphics are well done in my opinion. The part that sold me was the rifts, while out in a zone you randomly encounter smaller ones, but during zone events there are numerous rifts and have to be delt with or certain quest hubs would be taken over by mobs, so the whole zone fights together to get rid of them and a final boss spawns in the end and everyone gets loot for contribution (pvp servers be prepared to fight over zone achievs)WoIn a nutshell, WoW UI, Final Fantasy Graphics, Interactive zones ( The Job system is reminiscent of Vanilla WoW's trees, veryyyy customizable)			"

												Going to say beforehand that I have a lot more hours on Rift then shown, as I played game through ncsoft launcher for most of the time, and only picked up the steamversion when it was on sale.For me Rift was at one Time on of the best MMORPG's out there, even when they went f2p the Game was awesome. Do not get me wrong the Game had problems, for me foremost the Hero engine as your character just does not look smooth when he performs spells/Actions, but that is just a Problem with the Engine in general.However sadly the good Times are gone now or at least for me, the ingame shop has been getting worse and worse and currently I would classify Rift as Pay2Win (not completly p2w yet as you can get pretty muc heverything by grinding too, but the Advantages of the online Shop are destroying your motivation to play this game actively)What also will turn of new players is that you have to spend a stupid amount of Money just to start with all Classes/Souls, as you not only have to buy the expansion but also essential pack. Which is just stupid beyond belief since it hinders anyone new from coming to Rift without spending around 110€. And now to the bigges Problem, Trion, as a Company just gives a ♥♥♥♥ about its customer base/players, and will pretty much ignore any Problem and bugs, and then blame testing Guild for not pointing them out even if they did, this caused pretty much all top end Guild to leave Rift, which a MMORPG needs to have, without the active Hard-Core Community a MMO just isn't as fun.Anyway I would not recomment this  Game for New Players or returning Players, as a beginner you will just have so many Problems and will have to spend so much Money to go to a buggy End Game that it is not worth it, while as returning Player you will just be angry for what  Rift has become.Better remember what it once was, then what Greediness has turned it into.

												RIFT!!! Everyone then scrambles to get themselves together , mounting and running across maps and get in on the kills of creatures breaking forth from a portal busting/tearing through reality for epic loot and rewards. Thats this game. A RPG MMO with a style and theme that runs with a very in depth fantastic storyline. The world of Telara is pretty much in ruin by a bad guy sorceror evil evil guy. His names Regulas, charismatic with followers and evil evilness. No one can seem to defeat him and the 2 factions Defiant and Guardains are just as much at war with each other as with Regulas. So with crazy ancient technology that is very artistic and themed throughout this game. Kinda reminds me of Stargate SG-1 stuff, create the ascended with souls and this crazy technology steampunk stuff. Thats you, an ascended and off to character creation and off to the story line of grooming yourself to go back in time to kill Regulas for your faction and save Telara. YAY. Factions of Guardians ( chosen of the gods) or Defiants ( we got this bro) is more of race selection. Guardians have humans, elfs and dwarfs. Defiants have humans, elfs and bahmi. Bahmi are the games created race and seem orcish spiritual brutes. So with that there is classes-Warrior, cleric , mage, rogue. SIMPLE? no. this is where RIFT brings more to the custimizable table. True you have a class, but for each class you choose 3 soul trees out of a large list of souls. Each souls tree brings a very specific playing style, abilities, skills. So mix/match what you want to do as your chosen class with 3 soul trees. There are lots of souls, you can change the souls according to role or gear or w/e AT ANY POINT OF THE GAME. You can definantly be so custimizable with your class its nuts. Its fun. Warrior that has a warrior pet? yes. Rogue with a bow that heals? yes. So with the possibilities endless and the freedom to do it. DO IT. Thus then you play the game, like I said going back in time to prep yourself for the coming battle against Regulas for honor of your faction.  Aspects of the game of equipment and class upgrading is typical of RPGMMOs. Points and better gear and abilities and such while leveling doing quests/missions and grinding. Crafting is about the same of choose what fits your class or what you want to do and do as follows to get better. Armorcrafting, runecrafting, outfitting and such. Fishing and survivialism everyone has and starts off with . They are nice ''food eating health buffs'' and time killing crafting. Higher levels is higher rewards, but harder to craft. Fun and rewarding.  This game has 2 neat little aspects of minnions and demensions. Minnions are little creatures that you collect and send off to do quests to gather stuff ( crafting stuff) for you and level up and Dimensions are little homemade houses and areas you collect decor on  and make your own. These have become the new standerd of RPGMMOs, Rift does fill that void and does a good job implementing their own style and theme into it.  oh and yes, .... RIFTS?! are little portal/tears in reality that element specific creatures do spawn out of, and show up randomly, accessable to anybody and when shut down through waves/stages you get epic gear and loot. trust me, you want in on them whenever/whereever possible. its the game. its fun.

												Overall I have played many MMO's mainly for the PvP. Ive played played RIFT in BETA and for the first year of its release. Revisiting this game recently as it went F2P I wanted to see what has changed and if the PvP was competitive. The game has no open-world pvp, I couldnt find anyone to fight other than lvl 65's which as a lvl 28 mage would have been suicide to engage. So I was left to que for warfronts that did pop fairly regularly.The class balance in the game is terrible, a decently geared bard will never die. Add to the pay to win store that pretty much means you either smash the other team or you get obliterated. Good, fun, close, tough matches are unicorn rare.For me the game is a terrible choice if you like PvP, if you like PvE I am the wrong person to ask. "

												Great game, I enjoyed that the world fights back essentally, and the graphics are well done in my opinion. The part that sold me was the rifts, while out in a zone you randomly encounter smaller ones, but during zone events there are numerous rifts and have to be delt with or certain quest hubs would be taken over by mobs, so the whole zone fights together to get rid of them and a final boss spawns in the end and everyone gets loot for contribution (pvp servers be prepared to fight over zone achievs)WoIn a nutshell, WoW UI, Final Fantasy Graphics, Interactive zones ( The Job system is reminiscent of Vanilla WoW's trees, veryyyy customizable)			"

I havent payed a Dime and I can get top 50 healers world wide NP. dont believe me look for Jtqunn@hailol. If someone complains about being ubder geared or that this game is pay to win they have no idea how to play... The only issue I have is that you may have 2 toons per shard. BUT the fact that I can play with anybody from different servers at any time fixes that! just add the persons name like so name@(shard name) and then you can warp to their shard once they join ur party!      The class system is legendary in this! because i can make my character exactly how I want! although still keeps some basis to what your starter class is. although this can also be a downfall because most people dont know how to set up a class right. although there are pre sets so dont worry!

												What rift did rightRift when it first came out made WoW fans angry saying its a rip of of wow, And at the base it is but it works in its favor. This is a List of what Rift did right that WoW should of done or did.1. Basing/Ripping off WoW: This might seem like the games bigest weakness but instead its also its greatist thing. They looked at wow and said this work the way the classes are set up and the 2 sides fighting wow fighting a bigger evil. They made this its base, It at the core WoW. but theres more then just that2. improved Graphics: I know this is simple but the game looks good.3. Charter Creation: The Charter Cration makes wow look like ♥♥♥♥, It only needs more races. You can really customize a charter. And there are a lot of class options that break down from 4 simpler classes. And also custom armor, sy you have really good armor but you think it looks ugly, you can put other armor on top of it so you look cool but still kick ♥♥♥.3. less over sextualzing women. Instead of less covered up better armor its the other way (atleast from what I seen) at the start your like in a bikini, but as you play more it covers you more still keeping you sexy.4. F2P. ever wonder what WoW would be like F2P this is it, just like wow only no meber ship and the DLC is optional like wow. Member Ship is optional though for bonuses.Keep in Mind Am reviewing this game only from a few hours of game play because it I was really enjoy my self am sure theres more to come. (sorry no spell check) well see you all next time on my next game review!			"

												This game is a mmorpg and does seem like a clone of other popular mmorpg's such as World of Warcraft but as you will see it is much more. However with a price tag of $0 a month it is a must have! The whole concept of Rifts and alternant dimensions makes it feel not just like a clone! Rift is a fun and well structured game with a friendly user base and supportive staff that really try and make your gaming experience as smooth as possible.			"

												Personally, i can't reccomend this game. Atleast not to anyone with an average graphics card, or someone who's played things like Fable 3. I was dissapointed in this game, i think. It took me 3 days to download all the patches, all the updates, EVERYTHING. And then i was excited about the character creator, thinking ""Oh, this looks like a good game! I'll spend 15 minutes creating a really good looking character and then play the game!""Oh if only i knew.First of all, it controls like a tank. Making A and D move your perspective? NO THANK YOU! I'd rather use the mouse for that!Second of all, CAMERA ANGLES. This game is full of awful camera angles, and when i was being attacked, I COULDN'T EVEN TELL WHERE I WAS GOING!And that's another thing. In the beginning of this game, EVERYONE LOOKS THE SAME. Why bother having Humans on the Defiant side if theres Humans on the Guardian's side AS WELL? And maybe that would be fine if there were mostly demons (Or whatever they're called) On the Defiant side, but NOOO! OF COURSE the defiant side is just FULL of humans! I couldn't even get to the second mission, finding some chick named daria or something, without getting lost and ending up on the Guardian's side, and I couldn't even tell they were Guardians before they started ATTACKING ME FROM ALL SIDES.And lastly, the graphics sucked for me. It might just be my graphics card, or maybe the game is just THAT OLD. But you could have atleast tried to fix it.In the end, all i got out of this game was that the character creator was fun.While it lasted.			"

												I like Rift and am playing a second time, introducing a friend to the game.   This time around it seems like an easier learning curve allowing new players to slowly explore the world, fight and level up at their own speed, good given the relatively complex features of the game.  The game has large worlds with many quests and items.  I enjoyed it playing single before and will enjoy cooping this time around.  Finally I was a Patron before and will become one again feeling it is a fair value for a high quality game of such large scope.			"

												I don't care how long it says my play time is, I have not played this game. And not because I didn't want to. It took me a week before it finally allowed me to create an account. And now I cannot login. It keep throwing up a connection error when I have a perfect connection and nothing will make it go away. How can I play their game and maybe give them money if I cannot even get into the game. I'm pretty patient when it comes to games that look great but I can only wait so long before I give up and go somewhere else. Do yourself a favour and give this game a skip.			"

												A great game for the F2P model with a huge amount of pro's despite many who go ""pay to win"" and ""grindy"" (Welcome to an MMO kid.) - Sure there are pay to win options - what Modern MMO doesn't have this? Level Boosts, Exp Boosts etc, for the free-to-player Pro's & Notes.- Like many Player Housing Scemes; there in lies the issue; hooks,  forced placement, in RIFT unlike many it is free to build if you so wish and have the patience; sure the dimension has boundaries, but it does not generally restrict you in too much minus your creativity.- Invastions; Recurring thing, perfect to leap into, Rifts and other such things; a nice addition to the general living feel of the map, and game world.- Good Story; I love RIFT's story, for those who say there is none - explore more.- Crafting; Again I adore the crafting system, simple, easy to use, and generally done well.- Graphics; Though not the Next-Gen type all Milleniel Kids want; the Graphics are still decent overall, sure they may not be -the best- around, but far better than other f2p games of the same genre.- Wide Array Of Content; from Solo, to Group to Raid Group, and generally entertaining on a multiple play-through experience.- NOT A Money Grab; despite many such ""Reviews"" which are literally one comment venting an opinion like a tool; it is not a money-grab game; unless -you- make it; like the SWTOR-generation of MMO's it offers X thing from a Store, these are optional, (Then again imo as a review is mostly just that, an opinion; these are the types whom claim the game is grindy, again welcome to MMO.)- Guild Questing; a grand system; have seen implimented in things like BDO more recently; just pointing out pretty neat.- Wardrobe System; Anything you have one worn you can cosmetically wear over yourself again; a nice system, and requires nothing more than previously owning an item or weapon. Good for Roleplaying.- The Game Is Not Dead; Though the game may be dead to others whom for one reason or another have left it, it is in fact quite populated.- Ignoring Someone; Ignoring ignores the toons on that person's account widely - in that, no more need to worry about a multi-gold spamm seller, ignore once, ignore them all.Con's & Notes.- Daily & Weekly Quests: Not really a COn but needed something here, A grindy way to get currency"" (Welcome again to MMO's.)- The Community: I'm joking once the bad egg's are on ignore it's perfectly fine (Or just don't involve yourself in the 'general chat' nonosense.- Okay this one is a slight..eh gripe more than a con: Invasions can kill quest NPC's...eh slightly annoying if you have horrible timing.- Bad Reviews: The Store Page has 'Bad' Reviews, I do not mean they are all negative, I mean some are just...bad, for the sake of people thinking they are funny, though in their defence, I suppose Children are allowed to own a PC under the age of Twelve these days.That's about it. Overall the game is good full time or casually; a solid 8/10.			"

It is easy to lvl but there is always a boss in the fields that you need to go kill. The armies of mosters are endless and will over run you if not careful. Not a lot of dungeons to clear, and the ones that there is are too hard for lvl 15 below. Its a good game but if you want to pull off Kirito, well you need to train hard and get your lvl up.

												This truly is what I think MMORPG's Should be, and the fact that everythings free and earnable IN GAME makes it amazing. So many MMO's have forever had a sorta Pay 2 Win System, where most of the things you need you had to pay real money. BUT NOT THIS GAME this game blows that away and truly makes you work for your reward. No player is better than the other because of IRL Money purchases, and anyone can become strong and become a hero. Trion really knows how to make their MMO's And I recommend you get this game because everything is literally in reach for you in this game.			"

												This game is very good. It has a certain charm about it, with its Warcraft-esque elements and exploration. The customization is in-depth, giving each race/class its own space. The controls are easy to understand out but hard to get used to. With both the A and D keys and the right mouse button controlling pan/look direction, it feels awkward at first when you need to figure out which one to use.The game is beautiful, but if you're expecting high-quality graphics, don't get your hopes up; The textures are a little basic, but everything looks bearable.

												Rift called by many a WoW clone is (regardless if it's true or not) a great game. Great F2P Model, good gameplay, goo story and overall very engaging.Like all MMORPGs you start off with a specific combat type, however, unlike many other MMORPG this combat type is highly dynamic offering you countless types of classes.You are set in a world interacting with multiple worlds, in the sense that the world where you do your regular actions is frequently invaded by planar creatures, creating a good atmosphere where regular global events to fend off attackers take place. These events are called rifts  (tears in the fabric of your universe). I'm still in the beginning of this game so I will update this review as I progress through it, but so far I'd highly recommend this game for its fair model, and hell, it's free. Give it a shot!If you are a fan of MMORPG you won't regret downloading it!8.5/10 "

												Okay so I fortunatly played this game awhile ago and had a lot of fun with it. However, I recently tried to play and to no avail. Glyph, the scorge of launchers, absolutely ruins the game. Glyph launcher is absolutely riddled with bugs. I personally was unable to log in to my old account so I tried making another account. This was a pain in the ♥♥♥ as Trion's website barely ever responds and constatly times out. However, when I evenutally created my new account i went to sign in on Glyph's launcher... I was given ""2024 error message"" which currently has no easy fix. I then found a large work around for this god awful bug the game would never patch as I received a plethora of other errors. Searched all night on Trion's unresponsive website to contact customer support and no email has been found to this day... shame was actually one of fun MMOs. Well here I come Neverwinter.			"

												The wow clone of all wow clones.  Don't be fooled by the ability to customize your spec in many different ways.  I thought being a mage healer was cool until I realized I'm just a shadow priest.  Pvp battlegrounds are basically WSG, AB, and AV.  Seeing a legendary staff that looked identical to that of wow is when I finally quit.  Don't be fooled by he rift gimmick which is simply an uninstanced mini dungeon.It is free so it has that going for it but it's pretty dated and lacks many current mmo features.  But you get what you pay for and it has a good population compared to other free mmos available.  I'm unsure on the endgame Pvp status, possibly super grIndy and not worth getting in to.I tried this again recently and nothing got me back into it, I suggest vanilla wow private server Kronos over this.

												   Rift is a fun to play MMO. Especially for a title that had made the move to a free to play game. I think Trion has done well with the store integration and the game it still very playable to the level cap even if you don’t pay for a thing. I have played many MMO titles free and paid and have found Rift to be one of the more enjoyable.    I have seen complaints from others of how Rift has become a pay to win game, they have broken the PVP system or the game is full of bugs. I personally have seen nothing in these regards that would cause me to have any complaint. Yes, the store is full of items and such that I would call “stupid expensive.” I remind myself that the people who buy these items are helping to make the game free and I can just work for something for a bit and still get good and powerful items if I have a little patience. However I did buy one of the expansion packs and felt it was well justified as it had many useful items and I have no subscription to worry about. As for people complaining about PVP all I have to say in response is I suck at PVP so it is broken in every game for me, I am missing nothing on this front, lol. As far as bugs go, I have experienced a few crashes and glitches in the game but no more so than many other games I have played. I have not had a glitch or crash that has caused me anything more than the minor annoyance of waiting for about a minute to get back to doing what I was doing.    Over all I find my experience of Rift to be quite enjoyable. Before starting to play Rift when it became a free to play game I had considered going back to WOW, but I am glad I gave Rift the chance. It is just as much fun, has more story, I die just as much in PVP, and I don’t have to pay costly subscription. "

												Its honestly a copy of World of Warcraft with less races, but more class customization. Oh and there isnt a subscription but there are items you can buy via Rift Store. Overall, I give this game a 7.5/10.  I'd give better if the armor looked better. Some looks okay if you wear plate armor, but clothies are overall doomed to look pretty scrubbish.			"

												This is a really good game. The server are filled with very nice people and there are many guilds to choose from. There is a huge welcoming world, well not welcoming. It also has a cool skill changing system. I highly recommend the game. But when there is a good side there is a bad. The quests don't really help you find what you look for. It is easy to lvl but there is always a boss in the fields that you need to go kill. The armies of mosters are endless and will over run you if not careful. Not a lot of dungeons to clear, and the ones that there is are too hard for lvl 15 below. Its a good game but if you want to pull off Kirito, well you need to train hard and get your lvl up. Other then that don't kill the dear. 7/10			"

												if you are so inclined to play this, do not pay for anything in this game. once among the best mmorpgs, now all that remains are the memories of an epic game that has been on the decline since going free to play. be careful of any game that has the trion name attached to it, they embedded this poisonous business plan to all their games and by paying for anything that trion offers in their ingame cash shops, you encourage this elaborate scheme to further evolve and keep itself operational.best to avoid this game but if you cant stop yourself from giving it a try, take a good look at the patron status, the cash shop and how you can buy yourself into endgame, look at some of the patch notes and people's responses on the forums. please do not support this kind of exploitation. rip telara.

												I don't care how long it says my play time is, I have not played this game. And not because I didn't want to. It took me a week before it finally allowed me to create an account. And now I cannot login. It keep throwing up a connection error when I have a perfect connection and nothing will make it go away. How can I play their game and maybe give them money if I cannot even get into the game. I'm pretty patient when it comes to games that look great but I can only wait so long before I give up and go somewhere else. Do yourself a favour and give this game a skip.			"

												Rift is an excellent game. Plenty of content, graphics are wonderful, and class combinations allow you to create a great customized character to fit your playstyle. PvP is a blast too. One of the small things that makes this game fun is its awesome and detailed animations and spell visuals. If you enjoy GW2, WoW, or Everquest, this is a must try. And now that it is F2P, why not?

												One of the few games I can keep coming back to, which makes it one of the better MMO's out there.There is so much freedom, character creation wise, you can either go with a pre-made skill tree, or you can put one together yourself, I've found myself to do this more frequently, not one character I make is the same, ever, this keeps it interesting, not to mention I can unlock more if I ever find the desire to spend the money to unlock it with, not yet though, there's still much to explore without spending a dime!I've spent about 10 Euro as I'm writing this, and compared to a lot of the games I've played, time/money ratio is excellent,¨(I am an extremely patient player, so this may vary from person to person) So even if this is a F2P game now, don't be afraid of spending a little cash, unlike some games, what  you buy stays with you, so you don't get screwed over and feel like you're being punished with a ""demo"" once you quit paying. I'm looking at you, DDO, LoTRO and you other little ninjas hanging out there.One complaint though, it's way too easy, with the group I frequently play with, not even well geared, we can handle dungeons undermanned, we can solo rifts meant for a standard group, it's actually one of the reasons I never play this game longer than a month or two at a time, before having to take a break again, as there's no real challenge, it can't be right that I can tank an entire boss as a mage without getting hurt. I hear this was very different before it became F2P, why it would change for the worse, I don't really understand, mass appeal for the casual gamers out there perhaps?There's a few features that I'd like to see implemented:- Being able to play music, I was once a very loyal LoTRO player, and there was nothing better than freestyling on a lute for me, in my house.- Lotteries, chance to win ingame cash, mounts, pets, cosmetics as long as you sign up from the marketplace perhaps.- Actual challenges, I hate fighting a boss and suddenly seeing 50+ people taking them down in a matter of minutes when it was supposed to be difficult - force their damage to event related bosses, to be lowered perhaps? Anything?Also, it seems to be headed in the direction of WoW, where you can win by simply rolling your head on the keyboard, please don't do that, it's the reason I quit playing that game (back when you could only be level 40 or so).- I'd love to see more races with more unique traits, it doesn't seem like that anything you pick will ever really be more than a simple convenience for you at times, where most of it only functions out of combat, or makes such a little difference that simple looks wins the battle over practicality, and doesn't even deserve a spot on your hotkey bar after you reach up high in the levels.- Fix the auction, I'm at that point in the game where I don't care if I buy one thing for 2 platimum one day, and 32 for the same thing another day, simply because I make so much that money has lost its value to me entirely. There is no sense of consequence about frivelous spending whatsoever.- Progress is too fast and ""linear"", from the time I started I feel like I could max everything out in no time at all, on top of that, once you've played through the first time, you find yourself rushing things because there's only a few different paths you can take before you've played every single mission and storyline, add a little more factions, areas, rivalry between factions (meaning you won't be loved by everyone in the end, add consequence and critical thinking!!)- Add more variety to the adventures, they stay fun for 5 minutes, then you start seeing the same pattern repeating itself over and over, this makes me quit, repetition is a game killer.All that being said, I enjoy this game more than most, it just needs that little kick to actually keep me in the seat more than what it does, and it's a sure winner in my book.

												""Beauty is only skin deep."" That is how this game felt like.Seeking for a new MMORPG to play, I saw this game's trailer and was attracted to it. I started to download it and was surprised that it was over 18GB and thought that it must be really awesome. After the download, there was a patch that was over 13GB so I became impatient and was like, ""This better be good."" Then after gruesome hours of waiting, I was able to enter the character creation (which was unimpressive), and was finally in-game.So first look, the game is visually good (just visually though). I ran around, explored and quested for several hours and this is what I have observed:1.) The game is too passive and lacking- I can't believe this was released in 2011 and it still plays out like an incomplete game today with little to no scenario and AI. It feels like those custom made warcraft maps in the works where only the terrain and units were layed out and has nothing much else to offer. Mobs are just standing all over the place or roaming all over the place with almost no purpose. There are a lot of things you can see and interact with that seems to have no significance at all.2.) Poor mechanics and balance-Special mobs or bosses, don't seem any different from the regular ones, just higher hp. Character's normal attacks are almost negligible, skills suck, your hp goes down almost the same rate as whatever it is your fighting then you regen everything so quickly after being out of combat for some time. Potions felt so irrelevant, you get mobbed by two enemies of same level, you use one, not so much hp recovered and the cooldown is so slow you just die unless you run, good thing the system is so undeveloped that if you just run with low hp you'll survive somehow because all of the nearby mobs just ignore you. They say dynamic battles in their site, but i don't see anything dynamic at all even in their videos.3.) The interface and controls are not so user friendly- This is the first time in my whole gaming history where it took me quite a lot of time to figure out how to navigate and use the interfaces. Equipping, buying, selling, etc. everything was just ugh.. not so convenient and the game heavily relied on right-clicking for no good reason.4.) Unattractive and unamusing character 3D models- For a game that looks so grandiose with a folder size of 37.5GB, it is just so sad that the character model's designs and movement are so mediocre and generic. Aside from the disappointing character creation options, I went in to battle just to find out how lame these models move. I can't believe that I was already using or chaining skills with what I was seeing, as they were not so far off from looking like a normal attack.5.) Lots of features and game elements- This game has a lot of content: multiclass characters, mounts, fishing, crafting, cooking, alchemy, blacksmithing, rifts, bigass bosses, etc. Aside from the visuals, this was the only other good thing about it. The system was just so bad despite being a non-beta game that I spent most of my gaming hours just fishing instead.In conclusion, this game is such a waste. It has a lot of good concepts thrown into it that you just don't see or feel being projected in-game. If they can rework and improve their system, then it can probably be one of those games with ultra large communities that last for years.			"

												I've been playing WoW on and off since vanilla and with the last expansion I finally just got bored.  I tried Rift when it first came out purely for the graphics which still to the day are phenomenal but I just didnt get into the whole solo ability of the game. Now, Rift has exceeded WoW's expectations for the last expansion and the new patch, I absolutely love the solo ability especially those long nights by yourself. Not to mention how relaxing and fun leveling is. Lets just say I'm addicted.			"

												This game does, in my opinion, have lackluster combat, it is not that thrilling. Starting out, it is very slow, it will take awhile to get to the more fun areas. BUT, once you do get those levels and a decent skill tree, you will find a beautiful gem of a mmo. The developers have taken very good care of this game and not turned it into a forced profit based design. The community is active and lively, between guilds, raid battles, and amazing world boss event battles, this game is worth every minute of time it takes to level into the higher areas. Once you are able to get into the lvl50 areas, you will find a world ripe with rich story, colorful and horrifiing landscapes, and creative npc's.			"

The graphics are beautiful. The land is strange and exotic. The characters and classes are cool and less cliche. The map works like a dream. I have absolutely nothing to complain about.

												Most underrated MMO.I played Rift in the beta and into launch, as well as over the course of its life (sis years now!). I can hands down say that it is one of the most in depth and engrossing games I've played. The content is rich and plentiful; the class system is my favourite of any MMO that I've played; the maps are well thought out and exciting; the quests are engaging; the player and guild housing system is INSANE; the crafting is intriguing and worthwhile; and maybe best of all, the community is fantastic. Not only is Rift beautiful, but it's fun as hell and very addicting. Love Rift and definitely recommend it!			"

I’ve played Hundreds of F2P MMOs and I was really surprised by how Fun RIFT is / was  Ive only just scratched the surface of the game but my goodness its a joy to play a lot of the Problems / annoyances you have with MMOs are sort of removed here ,  The leveling is fast passed , the combat is fun and one of my favorite thing is the variation of Different classes you just Don’t pick a Mage there’s Multiply classes In one now of Course this is sorta Pay to win but not really your never half to buy any thing its up to you Over all if your looking for a Fun non Stressful MMORPG to play I highly Suggest RIFT  :)			"

												I've been playing WoW on and off since vanilla and with the last expansion I finally just got bored.  I tried Rift when it first came out purely for the graphics which still to the day are phenomenal but I just didnt get into the whole solo ability of the game. Now, Rift has exceeded WoW's expectations for the last expansion and the new patch, I absolutely love the solo ability especially those long nights by yourself. Not to mention how relaxing and fun leveling is. Lets just say I'm addicted.			"

												This game does, in my opinion, have lackluster combat, it is not that thrilling. Starting out, it is very slow, it will take awhile to get to the more fun areas. BUT, once you do get those levels and a decent skill tree, you will find a beautiful gem of a mmo. The developers have taken very good care of this game and not turned it into a forced profit based design. The community is active and lively, between guilds, raid battles, and amazing world boss event battles, this game is worth every minute of time it takes to level into the higher areas. Once you are able to get into the lvl50 areas, you will find a world ripe with rich story, colorful and horrifiing landscapes, and creative npc's.			"

												RIFT is a GREAT free-to-play MMORPG comparable to World of Warcraft but with several advantages, like many more classes (known as Souls) and of course the lack of subscription.RIFT is clunky in some areas such as animations and hotbar bloating, but most of these issues are minor nuisances rather than a game breaker.For a quick overview of the game, including pros and cons, feel free to check out the video below:http://youtu.be/Fdz1wDGorhY?list=PLklrkLw7j3VRjVPlrlF4tNcvFfmNewO6r "

												Best F2P MMO out there feels just as good as WOW but you dont have to pay monthly, alot grinding to be done to get best gear at start but enough to keep you busy. Great little Minion adventures you can use that will reward you loot/artifacts and more.Enjoy the Dimensions aspect where you can Build your own Safe Haven where others can visit and see, loads of variety in items to use and manipulate to make it as you want.Will say this only downfall i see in it as from this point is as a F2P Player you can not Create AUCTIONS, although doesnt look like you have to spend much to gain that ability just a bit annoying.

												It's a game that because of the soul tree system, holds onto some of that Vanilla WoW feel, which I prefer. I like lots of customization which this game provides compared to most MMOs.			"
