												This is the game the never, ever ends. I picked this game up thinking I wouldn't like it having never played a previous TES game before. Sat in my Library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge.I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong.This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on steam. Add in the unlimited potential of modding, and it's an adventure that continues forever. I've probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten Alduin once. ONCE. There's still so much more do to and explore that I'm still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. I still can't believe how much there is to do and I'm still finding more.At it stands I'll probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as Skyrim with how much I've played.And I'm totally ok with that.

												So ive wasted my life on this game. Like litterly wasted whatever 1500 hours of time comes out to, ive discovered every location on the map, played every DLC there is, collected every item, even items the console doesint want you to have. Ive memorized every dungeon and done every quest. Played every class-type and got every skill to legendary 100 and even over a few times. Ive played this game so much I know where everything is down to the elves ear cluster behind you as you walk into white river watch to the medium coin pouch on the main mast of the ship in broken oar grotto. And the mods. SO MANY MODS. But, at the end of the day what I love most about this game is that after all this time playing, I can annoy my friends by reciting the full heimskr speech word for word and repeating generic guard speech in real life when I get bored. I mean all the speech. You know youve played too much when you tell people on the street that steel is solid and true and that they fancy one handed swords, not those clunky two-handed weapons. Ether way get this game-its got dragons, magic, awesome weapons, brainwashing(the good kind), and replayability. And an entire modding community behind it. Enough said aye.			"

												I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds – the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user – but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words – each Shout has three – hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

												Best game I ever bought.In this game, you'll be sent back to the times where people fought with swords and bows. A brilliant setting, if you ask me.The game lets you do whatever you want. You can customize your character to your own style, own personal favorite race, and you'll be able to fight any style you want.Do you want to play the sneaky Elf archer, with the bow? No problem. Do you want to play the sneaky Kahjiit thief, with the daggers? No problem! Do you dislike weapons and love to use magic? No problem, there's even lots of different spells, either Destruction or Illusion, maybe Necromancy is more your style? Being a healer is no problem either!You can make your own weapons by Smithing, you can  make your own potions by gathering ingredients and mixing them into a potion with Alchemy, you can upgrade your weapons by using Enchanting, there's so much to do!Want to settle down after some adventures? Get to a town and drink mead at the inn, or purchase a house or a piece of land to build a house, with self-found materials, or maybe bought materials? Whatever you want.There are so many different playtroughs, so much quests to play, heck, I've played this over 275 hours and I still haven't completed all the quests!I completely recommend this game. I bought it at the releasedate, 11-11-11 and I'm still not done with it.Did I mention the Steam Workshop? Millions of mods to download, without any fee!Enjoy!			"

THE ELDER SCOLLS V: SKYRIM - An open world RPG of epic proportions, a true masterpiece  || 9.5 || Score Comment   Graphics 9 Skyrim has a free High Resolution Texture pack available as DLC (and if you can run it I would highly recommend it), but even without the graphics are clean with nice details and textures. Ambient lighting and effects are excellent and the designers have succeeded in creating a diverse and atmospheric landscape. Character creation is good with a lot of customisation possible. All this, however, is completely and utterly eclipsed by what is possible with Mods. With Mods (readily available from the steam workshop) gamers are able to create breathtakingly stunning vistas, highly realistic characters, followers and NPC's. With over 24 thousand mods (at the time of this review) you can change the appearance of or add in pretty much anything you can imagine (the sky really is the limit). There is of course a performance trade-off when applying the ultra high definition textures and graphical mods so I recommend following one of the excellent guides available to find the right balance for you.   Audio 9 Music is grand and epic, very fitting to the feel of the game. Sound effects and voice acting are both excellent throughout and considering how many characters and quests there are in the world of skyrim this is quite a feat. Personal favourites for voice acting include the aptly named khajiit: M'Aiq the liar and the deranged murderous jester: Cicero.   Gameplay 9 Skyrim is a joy to play, its not perfect but its pretty close. Controls are intuitive, responsive and work well with either mouse/keyboard or controller. There are many choices to be made throughout the game with real consequences, factions will favour you or attack you depending on your actions and alignment with other factions. There are many different playstyles and strategies to Skyrim, finding what works best for you is all part of the fun. Skills and abilities progress as you use them so you aren't completely restricted to a class such as mage or ranger, want to use a little bit of magic but also kill with a bow - no problem. Skyrim is often compared to its predecessors (Oblivion and Morrowind) to highlight some of flaws in the game, and while its true to say some of the missions and areas feel overused (oh? another cave filled with draugr you say?) and there are other occasional glitches, considering the massive scope and scale of the game these seem fairly minor. Skryim in certain ways surpasses its predecessors and is at very least well deserving of its place in this legendary series.    Story 10 So much detail, so much depth, the lore and background to the Elder Scrolls series is second to none. In Skyrim there are huge libraries packed with books containing everything from children's stories to hidden tomes of magic to the history of the lands. Talking to the people you meet tells of their individual struggles and also adds to the overarching story of a land rife with conflict and caught in far reaching changes of which you find your character the center. Skyrim is rich with background and story, as you explore and interact with the characters around you its very easy to feel part of the world. Quests are (with a few minor exceptions) interesting, challenging and varied with each of them building your understanding of the world and your place in it.   Replayability 10 You only need to look at the number of hours people put into this game to realise how much Skyrim has to offer. Personally I had already completed this game many times before I got it on steam and was still able to get many more hours of enjoyment than the average rpg, I'm sure it wont be the last time I play Skyrim either. Modding here also helps immensely with the community creating a huge collection of different locations, characters and quests.    Overall 9.5 An outstanding game, if you haven't tried it then your missing out on a truly amazing gaming experience. The DLC's available (Dragonborn and Dawnguard) are worthwhile playing and some mods will require them (so pick up the GOTY if you can). More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree?

												It really bothers me to see a lot of the 12,000+ negative reviews about the game due to the workshop. Not all of the reviews, but enough to make the game go from a 96% rating to a 91% rating (@♥♥♥♥ard <3). These reviews is supposed to be about the GAME not about the Workshop. Yes, it was a cheap way for Steam to get money, and yes it was very angering, but in NO WAY does that make this game bad. The authors of the review even end the review saying that the game is great but give it a negative review due to the workshop war of 2015. ITISANAMAZINGGAME			"

												Day 1: This game sure looks nice, there's just....so much to do.  I mean, the map's all over, they expect me to actually walk to each place, there's barely any quest markers, I don't know where the hell...Screw it, I'm going to walk in that direction and see what I find. Day 5: Hey, this game's starting to flow a bit now.  The quest system is starting to make sense.  It's kind of fun to wander about and explore these random caves and what not. Plus, my toon looks pretty cool with this helmet with the big horns sticking out. Day 10: I'm uh...I'm not sure, but I think my wife may be angry with me.  I told her I was going to go play some more Skyrim, she said 'fine, whatever I'm going to be.""  Hope I'm not spending too much time with the game! I can't help it though, now that I figure out how the quests and exploration works, it all feels pretty good.  I think I'm going to play with some graphics mods, that realism mod sounded kind of cool. Day 15: How in the hell do I have 110 hours played in this game already? That can't be right!  I didn't think I was playing THAT much.  Then again...I haven't seen my wife and kid for a few days now that I think about it.  I uh...maybe I should go check on that, make sure they're okay.  I'll go just as soon as I'm done forging these iron daggers. Day 20: My new wife Lydia becons me back to to Breezehome, I've been gone so long.  The Dragon of North Summit is no longer, so it is time to return.  I feel sorrow for leaving her and the children alone as the war with the Stormcloaks rages on around us, but I am Dragon Born and I have a duty to keep Tamriel safe from the scaled death that soars high in our snowy skies! Day 50: I was once an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow to the knee.			"

												If I could, I would take this game out, buy it dinner, have sex with it and call it the next day. Then we would start going out regularly, we would fall in love eventually. We would become the couple that has their own inside jokes and are always teasing each other and everyone else would be jealous of us. We would get married and have a child (Fallout New Vegas, the second best game ever). We would grow old together, on my death bed as I lie there about to draw my last breath, TES: Skyrim looks at me with tears in it's eyes ""Thank you for everything, you were always so good to me"" and I would take TES: Skyrim’s hand, look it in the eye and say ""No, thank YOU"" then pass away.

												For those who dreamed of a game that allowed to cross the woods, discover secrets and explore a world full of dangers and full of opportunities, the release of The Elders Scrolls V: Skyrim is a dream come true. Bethesda improves what has been done with Oblivion, putting a cure realization and amount of content that we never expected. After about forty hours of play, apart from the main quest, we did not come at the head of almost anything, many are content, things to do and those that perhaps we will never make. There is some venial sins and approach the statistics to which we must get used to, but the fact remains that Skyrim is a masterpiece, the kind that has a duty to live if you love RPGs and those video games that only some software companies are still able to do.

												I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds – the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user – but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words – each Shout has three – hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

												TLDR: A very good game that can become a NEAR PERFECT game depending on the mods YOU pick.Maybe you'll be happy only playing it one time, with one character. Maybe you won't. Maybe you'll get to a point and think, ""Maybe I could have done that differently,"" so you go back to a certain point and try it again. Maybe you'll wonder, ""Will the NPCs treat me differently if I play a dark elf, or a khajiit, or an Argonian?"" Or maybe you just want to try a Redguard, or Breton, or an Imperial, and see what that's like...Maybe you'll find an aspect of the game annoying. It could be one of numerous bugs, it could be the simple combat or magic, or the graphics. Maybe you'll decide you're done with Skyrim.Or maybe you'll realize there are mods.Mods to fix the bugs (Unofficial Skyrim Patch). To extend the scripting (SKSE). To enhance combat (Duel, Deadly Combat, Ultimate Combat, Combat Evolved, Mortal Enemies). To improve magic use (Better Magic, Enhanced Magic, Empowered Magic). To enhance character creation (Race Menu, Live Another Life, Disparity, Imperious). To improve the interface (SkyUI, A Better World Map). To improve the lighting and graphics (Climates of Tamriel, Realistic Lighting Overhaul). Maybe you'll go all in and try a complete overhaul (Requiem, Perkus Maximus).Maybe it doesn't stop there.Something for dragons, something for werewolves, something for vampires, something for Alchemy, Smithing, or Enchanting. Something that makes your game play like a Disney cartoon, or one of the 'better' episodes of 'Game of Thrones'. Something that adds armors and weapons from other games from other worlds, or that blend in so seamlessly that you'll wonder if they've been there all along.And then it happens. You find one thing in the game that bothers you, that no one has made a mod for. So you make a mod for it. And this is where your epic quest TRULY begins.Skyim is a good game. Maybe even a great game. But with the right mods, it becomes YOUR GAME. At a certain point, you're no longer just playing. You are CREATING.			"

												The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action RPG open world game, developed by Bethesda. This is the fifth installment in the series, being released worldwide on all platforms in November 2011. Skyrim is renowned for its vast open world that allows players to explore, in a first person or third person view. You begin the game and create your character in the same way you do with every other RPG game, choosing from various number of races which all have their own traits which suite different styles of play. After the opening scenes the world is your oyster and you can do pretty much anything you want. The main aspect of the game is completing quests for other characters in the game; and buckle up, because there are plenty to do. I spent the first twenty four hours of my play through just completing side quests for the random characters in the game, ones which have no major story behind them but still had their own plot to follow through the progression of the quest. This allowed me to explore the world to an extent that let me see plenty of interesting sights and to equip my character with new equipment, spells, and abilities.  Throughout the game you will come into contact with “guilds” these guilds offer you a chance to join them, but you have to complete a long quest line in order to help their cause. This adds another 20 hours onto your play through with an extremely interesting story line to each of the guilds, as well as some captivating game play and mission objectives.  After all that, you have the main quest, which one of the most  interesting I have played. Taking you from being a prisoner of war, right the way to being the Dragonborn and slaying dragons at will; the plot could be taken straight out of a movie, it is that good. Graphically, Skyrim on its original release does look good. It has a flush environment that pleases the eye, as well as some stellar animations. But as we all know about Skyrim, the graphics can be modded to extreme degrees using mods. I only used a handful of graphic enhancing mods, but it increases the visual fidelity of the game tenfold. The mods are incredibly easy to install if you use Nexus Mod Manager, and they just make the game look so much better. Skyrim is fully voice acted, every character that you come into contact with will more than likely have their own dialog choices to choose from, letting you dig deeper into lore if you so desire. The game’s sound effects are brilliant too, and the soundtracks throughout the game are some of the most memorable you will hear in an Elder Scrolls game. The game can be played on various difficulties; I played on the medium settings and was moderately challenged. You will die, so you should be remembering to quick save often, and I was actually quite happy to be dying since I don’t enjoy games too much when I am an overpowered character just slaughtering everything in my path; there needs to be a risk of failure to make it fun.  Some quests and bosses are more challenging than others, as well as a good amount of puzzles that you have to solve too. Some people complain that Skyrim is as big as the ocean but has the depth of paddling pool; I do not believe that to be the case. There is so much content in this open world, it is hard to do it justice. Every building has a story to it, something of interest that you should be checking out. There are hundreds of books about the history and lore of the world you are in to be found. Hundreds of side quests that will keep you going for days on end. There is adventure to be found in every direction that you turn. I am in the middle of my second play through of the game, and I have put about 50 hours into it so far. My first play through took me about 120 hours to complete, and bearing in mind, this was my first play through so it should be remembered that I was exploring more than usual. I am expecting my second play through to finish at the 120 hour mark as well, due to me wanting to finish all of the side quests and guilds quests too.  Even after you finish the game, there is still plenty to do with the modding scene still going strong; you can download new quests and adventures to play through. The possibilities are endless with this game and you will not be surprised to know that people have got their hours into the 500s+. As with all Bethesda games, the game was launched with a number of bugs and glitches; most of these got ironed out in post launch patches, but you can still find bug fixes online to patch up any left behind. I would strongly recommend people play the game with the mod SkyUI. This makes the game’s interface much more user friendly for the PC player using keyboard and mouse.  It should also be noted that you can play the game with a controller; but for the optimal experience, stick to your trusty keyboard/mouse. To sum up, everyone will probably have Skyrim, and most will have even played it – I put off playing Skyrim for years because I was put off by the amount of content on offer and I felt I would be swamped by wanting to see it all. But of course, I had to take the plunge at some point. I plead to anyone, who has been putting off playing this behemoth of a game, to just do as I did, and take that plunge. It is simply amazing and it still continues to amaze me even to this day at how good this game is. This is a show case as to how good gaming on PC can be, and you should definitely be experiencing it.  The game’s regular price is just £9, 99, which is absurdly low, so if you can get it at the sale price of £2, 49, you are practically stealing. You will easily break the hundred hour barrier with this game so you are well and truly getting your moneys worth.

One of those ""must experience in a lifetime"" things. The previous games are up to their name, too, and this continuation is just jaw-dropping.------------------------Pros:------------------------- open world, a beautiful one in that regard- incredibly moddable, just don't use steam workshop, use Skyrim Nexus if you really want the best- the best damn sense of adventure and exploration you'll ever find in a game; if you're a curious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you'll love this to bits- immersive as hell, you'll really feel like you're under your character's skin- astonishing role-playing element and all you need to do is take it slow and explore, interact with the world as though you were your character- good game mechanics and skill-trees, great game mechanics if you include mods- graphics are just superb if you can run and mod them in- the atmosphere and audio just leaves me speechless!

												Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil anything here - I'll avoid anything story-related beyond the premise. With Skyrim, the stories that come from how the game works are often the best ones.It's a frozen nation, just to the north of where the previous game, Oblivion, took place. A briefly introduction sets up the plot: Skyrim is in the middle of a revolt, you've been sentenced to death, and dragons have just shown up. Good luck!At that point, you emerge from a cave into 40 square kilometres of cold and mountainous country, and that's it. Everything else is up to you.Not all of the landscape is subzero, and even among the frosty climes there's an exciting variety: ice caverns that tinkle with dripping frost crystals, hulking mountains with curls of snow whipped up by the howling wind, coniferous forests in rocky river valleys.The mountains change everything. Wherever you decide to head, your journey is split between scrambling up treacherous rocks and skidding down heart-stopping slopes. The landscape is a challenge, and travel becomes a game.It's hard to walk for a minute in any direction without encountering an intriguing cave, a lonely shack, some strange stones, a wandering traveller, a haunted fort. These were sparse and quickly repetitive in Oblivion, but they're neither in Skyrim: it's teeming with fascinating places, all distinct.These places are the meat of Skyrim, and they're what makes it feel exciting to explore. You creep through them with your heart in your mouth, your only soundtrack the dull groan of the wind outside, to discover old legends, dead heroes, weird artefacts, dark gods, forgotten depths, underground waterfalls, lost ships, hideous insects and vicious traps. It's the best Indiana Jones game ever made.The dragons don't show up until you do the first few steps of the game's main quest, so it's up to you whether you want them terrorising the world as you wander around. A world where you can crest a mountain to find a 40-foot flying lizard spitting jets of ice at the village below is a much more interesting one to be in. But fighting them never changes much: you can just ignore them until they land, then shoot them from a distance when they do.Your first dragon kill is a profound, weird moment. I rushed to the crashed carcass to loot it, then looked up. The whole town had come out to stand around and stare at the body, a thing as vast and alien to them as a T-rex in a museum.There is also a level up system. When that happens, you get a perk point: something you can spend on a powerful improvement to a skill you particularly like. Every hour, you're making a major decision about your character's abilities.They're dramatic. The first point you put into Destruction magic lets you stream jets of flame from your hands for twice as long as before. As you continue to invest in one skill, you can get more interesting tweaks: I now have an Archery perk that slows down time when I aim my bow, and one for the Sneak skill that lets me do a stealthy forward roll.Again, the freedom is dizzying: every one of 18 skills has a tree of around 15 perks, and the range of heroes you could build is vast. I focused on Sneak to the point of absurdity - now I'm almost invisible, and I get a 3,000% damage bonus for backstabs with daggers. It's the play style I've always wanted in an RPG, but I've never been able to achieve it before. The enemies you encounter are, in some cases, generated by the game to match the level of your character. In Oblivion that sometimes felt like treading water: progress was just a stat increase, and your enemies kept pace. That doesn't apply now that your character is defined more by his or her perks, because the way you play is always changing.Levelled content is also just used less: at level 30, my most common enemies are still bandits with low-level weapons. And I still run into things too dangerous for me to tackle.Taking a narrow mountain path to a quest, something stops me in my tracks: a dragon roar. I check the skies - nothing, but I hear it again three more times before the peak.At the top I find a camp full of bodies, with a large black bear roaring over them. Hah. He's still more than I can handle in straight combat, but as he reaches me I use a Dragon Shout. It befriends any animal instantly, and he saunters casually away. Feeling slightly guilty, I stab him in the back before it wears off.Which is when the dragon lands, with an almighty crash, six feet from my face. I RUN!One tweak is a huge loss, though: you can't design your own spells. Oblivion's spellmaking opened up so many clever possibilities - now you're mostly restricted to what you can buy in shops.While we're on the negatives, physical combat hasn't improved much. There are cinematic kill moves when your enemy is low on health, but whether they trigger seems to be either random or dependent on whether the pre-canned animation fits into the space you're in. Too much of the time, you wave your weapon around and enemies barely react to the hits.The exception is archery: bows are now deliciously powerful, and stealth shots can skewer people in one supremely satisfying thwunk.What does improve the general combat is a feature I didn't quite expect: you can hire or befriend permanent companions. I did a minor favour for an elf at the start of the game that earned me his loyalty for the next 40 hours of play. Sidekicks add a wild side to fights: an arrow from nowhere can end a climactic battle, or a misplaced Dragon Shout can accidentally knock your friend into an abyss.The Dragon Shouts, gained by exploration and killing dragons, are like a manlier version of conventional magic. One can send even a Giant flying, one lets you breathe fire, another makes you completely invincible for a few seconds. Even the one for befriending furry animals is macho: it can turn four bears and a wolf pack into obedient pets with one angry roar. The main quests themselves are mostly good: a happy mix of secrecy, adventure, and exploring incredible new places. One location, which I won't spoil, got an actual gasp. But then there's an abysmal stealth mission that seems to work on a logic entirely its own: guards spot you from miles away, despite facing the wrong direction. And the boss dragons it keeps throwing at you never get any more interesting to fight - adding more hitpoints just makes the repetition even harder to ignore.Everywhere else, the quests are magnificent. Chance encounters lead to sprawling epics that take you to breathtaking locations, uncover old secrets, and pull interesting twists. Even the faction quests are better here. It feels like Bethesda realised these became the main quest for many players, and built on that for Skyrim. They start small, but each one unravels into a larger story with higher stakes. Some of them feel like the personal epic that the main quest has always failed to be. These aren't engine issues, though. Skyrim is based on tech Bethesda built specially for it, rather than the middleware engine used by Oblivion and Fallout 3. It's a lean, swift, beautiful thing. New lighting techniques and a fluffy sort of frozen fog give the world a cold sparkle, and the previously puffy faces are sharp, mean and defined. Even load times are excitingly quick. On maximum settings, it runs at 30-40 frames per second on a PC that runs Oblivion at 50-60 - a decent trade off for the increase in scenery porn.The games we normally call open worlds - the locked off cities and level-restricted grinding grounds - don't compare to this. While everyone else is faffing around with how to control and restrict the player, Bethesda just put a country in a box. It's the best open world game I've ever played, the most liberating RPG I've ever played, and one of my favourite places in this or any other world.In case I'm not getting it across, this is a thumbs-up.

												If I had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. I'd pick this game.EDIT: I'm single nowON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE: This game is the best in its genre. In previous Bethesda games they made a sad balance in between Questing, and Exploration. Some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. But in Skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. Every time I have replayed this game, I stumbled into something new. For more info i'd very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. Go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it.Overall I'd rate this game an EASY 10/10. If you haven't already. Please buy it, give it a little, and I swear you will be hooked.			"

IntroSkyrim is a excellent RPG if your looking for quantity over quality. The game does not shine with impacting story as much as other more focused RPG's because of the freedom it offers. That doesn't stop it from being a great experience to most and memorable at that. The main quest takes a couple of hours but there is 300 hours of side content to go through beside it. Which is the greatest amount of content any game I have seen has to offer. The mods only add more content on top of that and give it insane amount of longevity. Advantages and DisadvantagesConceptProsConsContent300 hoursPerksWell thought out and has tons of skillsMenusGame offers a good variety of graphic optionsDefault UI is badLevel Design Nice variety of environment Due to the freedom, its not as consistently exciting as more linear gamesNpcs Plenty of interactions with modsNPC's are not very animated/expressful as other smaller more focused RPG'sLeveling All the actions you do, contribute to leveling Scaling should be bound to equipmentReplayabilityClasses and mods add tons of replayabilityTons of content makes you just want ot use console commands to change class instead of replaying it allCommunityThe Skyrim community has put alot of dedication and work into adding tons of value to this game. The steam workshop is also a nice simple addition to make mod installation easy and quick for people. This said, I would like to see more quality in game combat, although the perk system makes up for this.Mods EnchanceMods can provide you with a fresh experience and expand the longevity of the game. It improves the quality of the game with better graphics, environments, lore, quests, companions and other community crafted content.Warning: Mods can conflict, try to figure out what's conflicting, some require DLC.

												An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community.The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot.But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that.If you are interested in modding the PC version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:

												For the record I have to say R.I.P to my 360, it died one fateful night while playing this game. I had around 700 hours on it at that point with Skyrim :'( lost but never forgotten.Oh Skyrim how I have loved you, part of me thinks of you fondly when I am outside and wonder if a dragur will appear from behind a random tree. Or a hole in the earth that the city excavates to fix the sewage system, is it time for the dragonborn? Never has a game had this much impact on my outward life like Skyrim has. It joins the ranks of Grand Theft Auto in my possibly going insane I need to stop playing phases. But it isn't your fault Skyrim, you are just what the doctor ordered for me. From the smooth visuals to the peaceful mountain tops or soaring on a dragon that minutes ago tried to eat me and killed my thousand dollar throw away horse. If you need help deciding on this game then I have to say that there is no amount of words placed together that could convey what Skyrim is. Sure the main story is linear, it does not feel as epic as past Elder Scrolls games. But the sheer amount of fun and imagination that you can have in this game is leaps and bounds past any sandbox game I have ever played. But if you must hear my words and need reassurance then I will try my best. For Skyrim deserves a two part review.Vanilla:I hate vanilla, not skyrim vanilla, but the flavor vanilla. Yeah that is off topic but I always assumed that people call base unmodded games vanilla because they share the hatred of the flavor with me. Unmodded Skyrim is beautiful and has depth and a heart that is unmatched, you can do anything, be anyone, but at the end of the day you either go home to your wife and children or battle legions of dragur in some cave for hours. Where is daddy? That deadbeat is picking pockets and forging daggers so he can pay for that glass case he wants to put in the armory to show off his junk. Or maybe daddy has a secret.....maybe daddy is a vampire who lives off the blood of others in the darkness of the vale. Or as youtube has shown me.....daddy likes elaborate hidden basements where he stores the bodies of his dead O_OSkyrim vanilla has it all and more, it is a work of art that deserves your time.Modded:Now in a more serious tone I must say that this is now a different game. You can be anyone, do anything, create anything, and never run out of custom quests. You can upgrade the visuals to a stunning degree and bask in the hd glory. If you want skyrim you need to mod, you have to mod, it will call to you and you will answer and the sickness will set in and you will never be the same. But you will love it and you will never turn back. I can not go into further detail because I just can't, there are too many mods to even begin a proper review of modded skyrim. Maybe you want to weild a ♥♥♥♥♥ sword while dressed as Finn from adventuretime while pikachu follows behind you. The possibilities are endless and I implore you to mod your skyrim, just do it and you will never look back.Just buy it already and join the millions who already have found one of the greatest games of all time.

												Writing a review about Skyrim.. now... there really are more useful things to do nowadays, as there are few opinions about this game, which haven´t been already written... in various ways. But as i´ve got the request from a friend, i will give you my impressions nonetheless - So, please excuse me in advance ;)Anyways, what´s so great about Bethesdas latest part of the Elder Scrolls saga (i´m ignoring the Online part willfully here)?Is it the great story and rpg aspects? Uhm... i would guess not, as the story is there and it´s enough to give the open world some background plot, which you can follow or ignore.Regarding the rpg.. one has to say as hardcore roleplayer Skyrim was kind of a letdown from it´s predecessors (especially from Morrowind) with it´s double hand action and the great ""streamlining"" of skills and attributes.Naturally that helped though to attract a wider audience for this game, which further helped it to shine where it has it´s strengths.But where are they now really? Surely Skyrim fully opened the Open World Hype, which was copied in various ways, for example some good (Witcher 3), some not so good (Dragon Age:I). Nowadays though it has lost it´s unique place in that regard.So what makes Skyrim still one of the most played games on the Steam statistics? Naturally it is the modability, which i think is still unmatched by any other game in this genre and which let´s me even today wonder about the many screenshots players post of it, where you wouldnt even guess the base game anymore. Mods, created by one of the most impressive and innovative modding communities out there.This should also never be forgotten, nor from the mod users as well especially from Bethedesa etc. when thinking about wanting to milk money from that source.Conclusio: Skyrim deserves it´s places in the alltime games rankings, ignoring all the shortcomings it may have, it offers an unbelieable variety of possibilities to use and play in.Point Scale: 9/10			"

												Probably one of the best rp games out there, it starts you off with no information about the main character allowing you to build him as you see fit. Only other game would be Fallout New Vegas for its clean slate no story already laid out for you like Fallout 3 and 4. Both Skyrim and New Vegas allow you to be whoever you want because you start both games off with little or no back story ( Idk about other elder scrolls they probably like Skyrim also ""freedom"" wise but I never played any other). All I have to say it's a fantastic game, Way better than Fallout 4 in tons of ways performance wise and content. Ive replayed the game 100 times and I still find places or people Ive never seen or met before. Not only that, the DLC's are wonderful as well and modded questlines and items give you 1000 different ways to play.You could be a noble knightor maybe a thiefa mage a spell swordan assassinan archera rangera huntera vampirea werewolfa bandita tomb raidera soldier a traderthe obvious dragon slayera vampire/werewolf hunter a drug dealera blacksmitha bard especially with modsa mercenarya priestAll these things and anything else you can imagine you can be, make up any back story you want and ta da, a whole new game to play. This game is by far my favorite game of all time.			"

												After 600 hours put into this masterpiece (and after I hopefully started to understand most of the lore behind the Elder Scrolls universe), I think I am ready to write a review for Skyrim.Personally, the best feeling I had while playing this game was getting back to my home, after 3 days of fighting dragons, exploring dungeons and talking with NPCs. My kids were eager to see what I got them, so I gave them a lot of toys I have found in the huge landscape. They also had surprises waiting for me, plenty alchemical ingredients, and even coins.There are many races to choose from, my favorite one being the Khajit, a cat-human appearance specialised in Sneaking and Thieving. Players who don't like this playing style, but generally want to play as a Khajit (or any other race) will be happy to see that Skyrim lets them make the character THEY want. If you want, for example, a Mage Argonian, it will be, of course, harder work than for a High Elf, but as much rewarding, because you will notice how your character truly evolves during the adventure. You have tons of options, tons of playing styles (which you can mix or even change at any point in the game if you feel like it).But enough with characters. Other aspect which really felt unique and incredible was the size of the land. Not only Skyrim itself is huge, considerably one of the biggest maps seen in a video game, but it's also fullfilled with things to do. I never went from one hold to another without finding plenty of puzzles, chests, dungeons into my way. And, if you're like me, you don't want to rush through the main story and prefer instead to explore more or do miscellaneous quests, you'll be glad to take the side roads whenever you see them. They will take you to caves, mines, villages, farms, dungeons, and even dragon lairs. The exploration never had an end for me, not even after so many hours spent into the game.You are probably curious about the combat system. While technically not one of the best I have seen in a RPG, I must admit that it had massively been improved since Morrowind and Oblivion. The ''Luck'' factor is not present any more, so you can't miss a shot when you clearly were very close to the enemy. The third person combat camera is now immersive, with tons of new animations and a new feature which I like a lot: the killcam.One final aspect I'd like to talk about is the length of the game. While the main storyline is relatively short (took me around 10 hours on hardest difficulty), the side quests and guild quests make this game incredibly long. If you get Skyrim and plan on beating every single quest, clearing every dungeon, finding every landmark, you'd better get prepared for a very, VERY long journey. I myself haven't completed a quarter of the entire game yet (checked progress with a mod).This game is by far my favorite RPG at the time being, its biggest rival in my opinion being Dragon Age: Inquisition.Pros: + incredibly large landscape, mixing bioms from tundra to winter, from pine forest to stone holds;+ a lot of locations, free for player to explore; hundreds of dungeons, caves, which at their turn are themselves long and filled with enemies, puzzles, traps which will reward handsomely the player at the end;+ plenty of quests, most of which don't require the player to have completed the main questline;+ the introduction of dragons as enemies, for the first time in the Elder Scrolls games;+ residents of cities and villages all have their own lives and families. In the morning, they will leave their home and go to their job, in the afternoon they will take a break for eating, and in the evening they will close their shop and go back to their home or at the inn for some mead, where after a few hours will go to sleep;+ random encounters will let the player find more about the game; fugitives will tell you to keep their stolen item for a short while, followed by a scene where the owner finds you and asks you whether you have seen the thief (at this point, you can lie, you can tell him where the thief went, or you can be most honest and give him his item); couriers will once in a while give the corespondence to you, which can lead to impressive new quests or will update your map with new locations; you can find farmers giving their cows as sacrifice for the giants, and many, many more other events, all unpredicatble;+ the leveling system has been improved since Oblivion: after you have a high level, you will no longer see ALL enemies wearing the Daedric armor, instead you will continue to find packs of bandits, some of them having leather armor and others having more powerful armor and items;+ player can buy home in 5 holds, where he can place his loot, take his wife and kids and take a rest; this, personally, felt like a huge immersive feature in the game world;+ new powers added to the game world, called Shouts; will let you find out more about it x);+ you feel that your character truly evolves as you progress; more over, you can make what you want of your character: a good warrior, archer, thief, mage etc., by using perks;Cons: - interface is worse than at previous games; you can't sort items by criterias (feature that had been available in Oblivion), you can't search for a specific item when you have plenty of loot in your backpack, and the aspect is generally bad; thus i recommend using a mod that changes inventory;- while reasonable, the game is filled with bugs, some of which can even break a quest; again, i recommend using the Unofficial Patches;- some textures and meshes haven't been vigurously worked by developers and they look bad for 2011;Personal rating: 95/100 - Masterpiece			"

Product received for free
												The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a first-person and third-person shooter sandbox role-playing game, it is also the 4th sequel to the Elder Scrolls series and probably the most popular one. +Pros+ A well developed storyline.+ Players are really free to do what they want.+ Wide range of armors and weapons for players to choose.+ Well designed soundtracks and graphics.+ Mods increases the playability even to a larger extent+ Skills and magic elements can influence the players’ fight style greatly -Cons- Nothing major as far as I’m concerned.In this episode of Elder Scrolls, players will find themselves in the province of Skyrim of Tamriel, starting with a prisoner who is de facto a Dragonborn, the story kicks off as players escape Helgen, and develops as players meet the Jarl of Whiterun, retrieve the dragonstone and discover Skyrim further and further…..The gameplay is extremely astounding in terms of creativity, you can do literally anything you want, from daily routines such as sleeping and taking contracts as jobs, to family affairs such as getting a wife and build your own house, there are as well a sea of dungeons for you to discover. In addition to the introduction of mods available at steam workshop, overall, we can say that this games demonstrates the classic definition which the sandbox genre entails.The combat system is rough and ready, there are not a whole lot of actions available in a battle which players can perform. However, this is not implicated with the variety of weapons and armors in Skyrim, since there are too many equipments here for players to get, we can either choose to be an arc-sniper, a warrior, or a magician, they also differ from strength, which should be pretty obvious as an RPG.As to the graphic designs, Skyrim does not disappoint us being a game released in 2011, we can see detailed artwork as well as decent visual effects. About soundtracks, the presence of many types of music is also shown in the game, be it in action, adventure, harmony or leisure strolls. Altogether, I cannot really find any major flaws in Skyrim, thank you for reading my review until here. Albeit I know that this game is very popular and most people are already professionals of this game, I hope that it has still been helpful maybe to some of you.			"

												Well, I think it's time I do a review about Skyrim,after all is one of the games I have played most ^^ (I also have like 700+ hs on it when I played in console)...Now,let's beginI have to say this, Skyrim rediscovered the way I see video games, and I owe the appreciation I have to RPG's and The Elder Scrolls SagaIntroductionThe Elder Scrolls V:Skyrim is set in Tamriel,one of the biggest,overwhelming and deph universes I had the pleassure to see.Everything from the races to the lore itself makes one to know more about the world they are playing inHaving played Oblivion and Morrowind,one easily realises that the game has suffered an important casualization in many of it's mechanics.Nevertheless,Bethesda achieved in building a game that can be friendly with new players and introduce them to the TES universe and deliver the series' followers a game more than deserving of it's nameGameplayThe Elder Scrolls have always been games that gives the player full freedom in the way they want to develop their characters,it's personality,the way they fight,the allies and foes they have,just everithing and Skyrim is not an exception.Although Skyrim simplified the way you interact with NPC's and their routines,it's not something to worry about The game has for me,one of the, if not the best, character pogression system I've seen in an RPG.It consist in several abilities,some are passives like Speech or Smithing,and some others involve combat like Marksman or Destruction,so the more you use them,the faster they will level up.This feels fresh instead of the ordinary XP system where you have to kill enemies or complete quests in order to progress and gives Skyrim a much more immersive feeling of progressionVisuals I think it would be unfair to compair a 2011 game with recent ones although you can mod it to madness to get better graphics,so I will just review the artistic side of SkyrimFrom the frozen mountain peaks to the vast tundra,Skyrim performs a varied and huge region where to forge your own stories and where it will take time to get bored of.Bethesda did a great work in making this province come to life,as it did with previus TES gamesSoundThe soundtrack composed by Jeremy Soule,author of many other magnific works,is one you will never forget,every TES game has to have the perfect music to every situation and Skyrim did it extraordinarilyI mean, you get to feel that warmy and friendly atmosphere of an inn and the thrill of every battleStoryStory may be one of Skyrim's weak point,by this I not mean that it's bad,but it could be much better.However,its epic and memorableAnother downside of this aspect is that you have almost zero fredom of choice during the main quest,it's too linear compared to,for example: The Witcher 2 game that was also launched in 2011I still prefer Oblivion's or Morrowind's story,in which your weren't the center of the universe and was fuller of mistery and discovermentModsIn my opinion,this game has the best and biggest modding community out there,huge textures,ENB's,better models,animations,quests,fixes,new stories,new weapons and armors and furthermore Posibilities are just endless and gameplay hours can be multiplied by infiniteConclussionWriting this review made me realize one thing: I can't review an Elder Scrolls game. It's my favorite video game saga and I would never be capable of describing with words how much I love it. Sometimes I may complain about some weak points it has, but those are absolutely nothing compared to the good things that makes it The Elder Scrolls, so then I go back to Tamriel and get immersed in this awesome universe and forget about everything.

												While I was peacefully walking through Skyrim forest, I met four bandits. These courageous fellas weren't embarassed by the fact that I was wearing Dark Brotherhood armor and that I had legendary daedric artifacts in my hands, so they decided to attack me. I used Storm Call shout and summoned heavy rain with deadly bolts of lightning which were striking bandits every few seconds. First bandit fell on the ground dead, and I immediately started to feed on his corpse, because I was wearing The Ring of Namira, then I sliced another bandit with the Mace of Molag Bal and trapped his soul inside one of many soul gems in my inventory. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? The other two bad guys weren't scared by those terrifying, brutal, disgusting and supernatural actions I was doing. They were bold and dedicated, they were fighting like lions. and they died bravely on the battlefield moments later.I will never forget those strong-willed daredevils. They will be greeted like heroes in Sovngarde, and when my soul joins them and other warriors in The Hall of Valor, I will drink a toast to those bandits!			"

Who needs GTA when you have Skyrim?First of all, I have been a faithful fan of the TES series since I was a wee lad and I was wetting myself in the streets of Whiterun where my family lived.I thought that Oblivion was one of the best RPGs ever made. And then, this bad boy hits us in 2011.Skyrim basically knocked down our front doors, grabbed us from the hair and dragged us out in its magnificient, detailed and incredible world. You just can't resist it, it's an addiction. The more you play it, the more you want it.Oh, and to make something clear: THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER-FREE. Got that? Let's get to work then, you filthy milk-drinkers.TESV introduces the province of Skyrim, the home of the Nords in this universe. It's the northern territory of Tamriel and it's full of dense forests, green hills, snowy mountains, beautiful rivers and frozen lakes. All of them, and more, are depicted with an amazing detail that will immerse you as soon as you make your character.As soon as the tutorial finishes, you will be shocked by the sheer scale of freedom you have. Nothing constraints you, you can be a mage with heavy armor, a necromancer, an archer, a hunter, a paladin, a healer, anything. You can even destroy your foes with a fork for all I care. The complex and diverse landscape makes exploring seem endless, but not boring or weary. You will find yourself finding new areas even after your 5th playthrough.That's Skyrim's magic. These places are exciting to explore. Your only sound is the cave's drippings, or the howling winds as you discover old legends, lost artifacts, forgotten cities, haunted tombs, even ancient civilizations.As for the gameplay, your actions determine your proficiency. Your character gets better at whatever you do: from firing arrows and magic to swinging huge battleaxes or sharp daggers. In Skyrim, your talents are unrestricted, there's no class to determine your playstyle. No words are enough to express how good this gameplay is, you just have to see for yourself and test the endless combinations that exist.Story-wise, there are tons and tons of quests. From fetching wood and ingredients to hunting down the Nordic Dragon God of Destruction, you will never be disappointed by the quest quality and diversity in the way you can finish them. Everywhere you go, you will find new missions to complete that will introduce you to Skyrim's history and lore or the tragedy of the civil war that has struck it. the content simply feels endless.And the best part: MODS! Since 2011 the community does its best to improve Skyrim and add new content. New questlines, weapons, armors, locations, houses, characters, gameplay elements and many, many more are present in both Skyrim Nexus and the Steam Workshop. Personally, I finished the game in around 50 hours and then moved on to modding. Mods kept me busy for 250 extra hours. That's just crazy. And it's magnificient to see the quality many of the mods have, it's simply astonishing. And, what's best, new stuff are coming out every week. It feels like this game will never die.Even though there are some drawbacks, like an easy to deal with AI once you learn the game and some quests might feel unsatisfying compared to other RPGs or previous installments, mods are there to improve these flaws and make the game even more perfect than it already is.RATING:Gameplay: 9.5/10Presentation: 10/10Story: 9/10Unique Factor: Modded Content: 9.5/10OVERALL: 9.5/10 "

ONLY WRITING THIS REVIEW BECAUSE THE GAME DESERVES AN OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE RATINGGraphics: (per 2011) 19.5/20Gameplay: 20/20Sound: 20/20Story: 19.5/20Lasting Appeal: 20/20The Amazing soundtrack, great gameplay, awesome graphics and a perfect world/map work together to make one of the best Rpgs ever. Don't pass up on this game. If you have a great computer, go ahead and get the Special Edition, but if you're running on a mid-rig, get this one and use mods to make it look better without the fps drops. Mods are free and often times expansive. The base story is a little weak, but side quests and dlc make up for it; GET THE GOTY EDITION!!! it adds so much to the game. Overall: 99/100 My favorite game of all time.Edit: And to whomever down voted this for absolutely no reason: Screw you in particular, good sir.			"

Updated 28/04/15:Paid mods are gone (until next time, at least), and all is well in the world! 


Announcement: Removing Payment Feature From Skyrim Workshop 
, Apr 27, 2015

			We're going to remove the payment feature from the Skyrim workshop. For anyone who spent money on a mod, we'll be refunding you the complete amount. We talked to the team at Bethesda and they agree.		


Thank you all so much, everyone who spoke up against Valve's implementation of paid mods!Paid Steam Workshop protest review below, Never forget! (This review got 11208 positive reviews out of 12000 over the course of three days, before Valve changed their minds):Valve introduced paid workshop mods for Skyrim, as a result changing my review to negative.  You don't get to charge people for mods and try to sell them as dlc, Valve.People can and should support mod creators via donations, and a 'Buy me a coffee!' button on the workshop page would be good, but putting them behind a pay wall is god damn atrocious.

												""What's better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?"" By Paarthurnax One of the most majestic phrases of video games. We are all different and our nature comes from our birth. There are those who are born with a good spirit and are educated to maintain, while others have to fight a battle with yourself to overcome their evil nature and redeem themselves. Only these people know the true essence and bad characteristics and so will not get tempted again. This rhetorical phrase also offers an answer to all those who give up of those born with defects.

												What is there to say about 'The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim'?First off, this piece of art is one of those games that really sucks you up. It can be 23:00 when you start playing and after what feels like 10 minutes it's actually 1:00. The grassy planes around Whiterun, the mountains in the Reach, the swamps in the Rift and the snowy tundras of Winterhold will make you want to quit real life and just live in Skyrim for the rest of your mortal life. But beware adventurer! The province of Skyrim isn't all fun and games. It may appear to be a peaceful place, but once you enter the deep caves or get lost in one of the treacherous swamps you will see its true face. For Skyrim isn't just the home of the Nords, but also that of many dangerous predators. There are the Draugrs, who live in the many tombs under the face of the earth and will attempt to kill you if you enter their final resting place. Or the frostbite spiders, who will attack you with their poisonous webs once you're close enough. The most famous predator in Skyrim would perhaps be the dragons, who are returning to Skyrim. It is your goal as the 'dragonborn' to put an end to this. Though you speak their language, which offers many advantages, they will not think twice about attacking you. Skyrim offers many options, like talking and helping out the townspeople, other adventurers or complete strangers as sidequests.When you're not busy with the main storyline or these sidequests you'll find out the province of Skyrim has alot more to offer. Roaming around Skyrim will make you realize how big it actually is. However, make sure you are prepared before entering the wilderness because as I said before, many predators will attempt to put an end to your life. The $19,99 you pay for this game is a very fair deal when you consider how much time alot people put in it.I hope this review convinced you to buy this masterpiece.			"

												What an amazing experience. I'm coming back to this game years after its release and its still amazing. Beautiful. Engaging. Exciting. Peaceful. Relaxing. The storyline and questlines are fabulous, well-written and entertaining. The combat is dynamic and fun. Two things to improve: a slightly better UI such as the SkyUI mod, and let me drop quests that I don't want to complete. Plus a cover system for stealthing would be nice. But those are small details and actually don't detract from the experience in my opinion. Just a mindblowing game.			"

												First and foremost, I have to give props to the art department at Bethesda. The art direction for this game is so far above earlier titles that even comparing them to this game is utterly pointless. Its literally in a class by itself and this is evident everywhere you look. The most obvious and impressive improvement has to be the design of the clothing, armor and weapons. The intricate designs are truly breathtaking. Even the cheap equipment you first start off with is stunning. For example, one of the first shields your introduced to in the game is the Hide Shield and its absolutely beautiful. Large metal rivets circle the outer diameter and intricate designs adorn the leather. It even has the dents and nicks one would expect to see from a shield that has seen its fair share of battle. This attention to detail is seen everywhere and it goes right down to the bindings of the books and the crackle glazed dishes and pottery found adorning most tables and halls. When you add this to the significant improvement in graphics....well, what you get is a level of realism that simply blows earlier titles out of the water. This is hands down the best art direction I have ever seen from a video game and ultimately it gives this world a level of realism that we simply haven't seen before.The world itself is absolutely beautiful. One of the first open scenes I came across was a large flowing river that had huge rocks jetting up creating white water/rapids. Large mountains were in the background with wisps of clouds running all up and down the side of the mountain. It was absolutely stunning. I had to just stop and stare for a few moments. The draw distance has been significantly increased and the detail, as I wrote up above, is amazing. The landscape itself is just one big work of art. Traveling around and discovering the land for yourself has always been one of the big enjoyments for fans of this series. Well, Skyrim doesn't disappoint in this regard. In fact, this is easily the best title yet in regards to this aspect of the game. No other game series can compete with the size and scope of the worlds that Bethesda creates for this series and no other game in the Elder Scrolls series even comes close to matching what Bethesda has achieved this time around with Skyrim. They have significantly leapfrogged anything and everything they have done in the past.An issue I feel compelled to discuss is the huge improvement with the 3rd person perspective in this game. As I am sure people are aware, 3rd person perspective in Oblivion was pretty bad. Actually, it was awful. You could switch over for short periods but the game was pretty much unplayable from that perspective. Well, the improvement Bethesda has made in this aspect of the game is nothing short of amazing. Your character no longer looks like he is walking on air and your easily able to interact with your environment. Basically this game is now wholly playable from this perspective. I prefer playing in 3rd person perspective when I am just traveling around and its just really nice to see Bethesda finally take the proper steps to fix this aspect of this series. If your going to include it than at least make it playable and Bethesda has done just that.You can immediately tell that this is an Elder Scrolls game but dont let that fool you. There are a lot of changes behind Skrim. One of the most obvious changes is with the skill system. The skills themselves are pretty much the same. You have Alchemy, Illusion, Conjuration, Destruction, Restoration, Alteration, Enchanting, Heavy Armor, Light Armor, Block, One Handed, Two Handed, Archery, Sneak, Lockpicking, Pickpocket, Speech and a new one Smithing. The big difference lies in the fact that you now have specialty skills for each skill category and there are multiple branching paths one can take. For example, the Stealth skill has two different branches that one can take, one that focuses on stealth (Muffled Movement, Light Foot, Silent Roll, ect.) and one that focuses on blade skills (Backstab, Deadly aim, and Assassins blade). This ultimately adds a significant amount of depth to character progression and it also adds to the games re-playability factor as there are now so many different avenues one can take. On top of this there are no longer character classes. You still have the different races of character to choose from but choosing a class is history. What kind of character you become (Spellcaster, Fighter etc.) is solely dependent on the skills you choose to upgrade or in other words its dependent on how you play your character. Personally I love this new system as it doesn't lock you into a specific mold for your character and it leaves everything open for you to explore. Its just a far more organic system and ultimately I think its a significant step forward for this series in regards to character development.Another big change is with the menu system and this is easily one of the best changes made in this game. The new menu system is just far more intuitive. Basically the menu system has been broken down into 4 distinct categories. There is Skills, Items, Map, and Magic. You have to press the menu button to access the menu but once you do that, you no longer need to press buttons. Simply press the left stick in the direction of the menu you want and it automatically changes. Once you have done this, a new subsystem of selections will come up and pressing the left stick to the right will take you to the next menu and so on. No button pressing needed. Basically the left thumb stick controls all of your movements within the menu system, with no button pressing needed. I may not have described it very well but its hands down one of the best menu systems I have ever used. Again, its just a far more intuitive system and it just has a great feel to it. You never leave the main screen when accessing menu's. It just blurs out a bit and acts as a background to the menus themselves. This basically does two things, it helps to keep the menus from detracting from the game itself and it ultimately makes the menu system far more attractive. They have also updated the item menu with 3 dimensional representations of the in game items. You can now spin items around a 360 degree axis, both vertical and horizontal. Its a small detail but a very cool one, especially for the weapons and armor.I also have to mention the skill menu as the way they have graphically laid this system out is...well, its nothing short of stunning. Each individual skill is represented by a constellation in the sky and beautiful gaseous nebula act as a background to the constellations. The visual effect is gorgeous. You can cycle left or right through the skills/constellations and when you access the branching skill set associated with each skill, you suddenly zoom into the constellation itself and the different branching skills are suddenly represented by the individual stars in that particular constellation. Its kind of difficult to properly explain but trust me, the effect is not only stunning, its also nothing short of ingenious. Its EASILY one of the best, if not the best, molds of form and function I have seen yet in videogames. Words simply cant do this games art direction justice. It really has to be seen firsthand to be fully appreciated.Combat has also been overhauled and what we wind up with is a system that is far more fluid, and ultimately a lot more fun, than previous releases. Characters are now able to duel wield both weapons and spells and can even mix up the two. In other words, you can assign a sword to one hand and a spell to another hand or you can go with a staff in one hand and a spell in the other. You can mix it up anyway you want. This new system fits perfectly with the new character system (that being one with no character classes).If for some reason you don't have this game, BUY IT!			"

												I was mixed up in some Stormcloak buisness and was due for Sovngarde. However from the skies of Nirn came a dragon. It was black as night and its eyes demonic. It caused a comotion that spared me from the blade that was a few seconds from banishing me to Sovngarde. After i escaped i was told to go to Riverwood and ask for help. I was scared and ran in compltly opposite direction. Before i knew it i was in a city called Markarth. And yet again i found myself wound up in a bunch of criminals called Forsworn. After making ends meet between Markarth and the Forsworn. I had the courage to and strength to go to Riverwood and complete my quest. As i went on i met many Warriors and Mages that i helped and in return they helped me. I found myself to be Dovahkiin. Dragonborn. A legendary hero whos destiny is to defeat Alduin with his own weapon. The Thu'um. The Voice. I then realised. That the dragon that saved me. Was Alduin. On that day he had already lost. And so i went on. I tried to find some old man in the ratways in Riften but i ended up becoming master of the thieves guild, a deadly assasin, a werewolf, tamer of dragons themselves and i even became Archmage. And finally i became the hero that the scrolls had told of. BUt my journey wasn't over. The dragon menace was dealt with but one more menace remained. I took off to a castle near Riften and was told to look at a cave. This cave could lead to the victory over the new menace. After activating a blood seal. A coffin rose from it. And out came a woman. Her face was pale like the moon and her eyes where like fire. My eyes widened as i realised. This was a vampire. My sworn enemy and on her back. I almost lost my breathe. She had an Elder Scroll...

												I guess you could say I like this game.But seriously, I have spent 3 Months, 2 Days, and 21 Hours playing Skyrim.  And many of the other reviewers have triple- or quadruple-digit playtimes as well.  ""How can a singleplayer game be so enduring?"" you might ask.  Well, there are two main reasons for this, both of which I'll go into a little detail for:First, Simplicity.Now, this isn't the kind of simplicity where the game is lacking in content.  This is the kind where the game can be played by practically anyone, anywhere.  It doesn't matter if you're a ""good"" player or a ""bad"" player.  It doesn't matter if you've played the previous Elder Scrolls games or are a newcomer.  It doesn't even matter if you're familiar with the RPG genre or not.  Anyone who can use a mouse and keyboard can pick up this game and have fun.  ""But doesn't that mean the game holds your hand the entire time?""  Yes and no.  In my opinion, Skyrim holds your hand just enough so that new players don't lose their interest, but experienced RPG players aren't too frustrated that they can't enjoy it.  For example, I myself purchased Skyrim and Oblivion at the same time.  I started off playing the latter, as I wanted to get a feel for the older game.Now, I do love RPGs, of all kinds; however, my fine motor skills are a little lacking, so complicated game mechanics kind of turn me off.  (also, I hope whoever invented quick-time-events is doomed to a Sisyphus-esque torment of eternal QTEs in the deepest corner of the void.)  Anyway, immediately after starting Oblivion, I was beset by many confusing choices, such as class, birthsign, etc.  I know those are often brought up as key arguments in the Skyrim vs. other TES games, but for me personally, they were off-putting and seemed pointless.  As soon as I left the starting dungeon, I found myself asking ""What the heck do I do now?""  I had heard that the Elder Scrolls series was known for its sandbox style, but I felt, well, alone and lost.  So I wandered towards some ruins - and promptly got slaughtered by bandits.My experience was completely different with Skyrim.  After the tutorial, I was guided to a town by an NPC, which allowed me to both get a feel for the enviroment, and put me in a postion where I could find things to do - because, as every RPG player knows, towns are the source of many quests.  After having been given a task by another NPC, I felt I knew enough to get along alone.  And before I knew it, I was making my way through the ranks of a group of thieves, and thoroughly enjoying myself.  I knew enough to get my momentum going, but I didn't feel coddled or pressured.  And that's when I discovered the second reason this game has endured.Mods.Mods (short for ""modifications"") are the backbone of Skyrim's longevity.  Mods have been a part of the Elder Scrolls series since at least Morrowind, and that in turn gave Skyrim a leg up over other moddable games - a large, dedicated community that was ready to go as soon as the game came out.  And five years later, we're still getting dozens of mods a day - including fixes for things that were previously deemed ""unfixable"".  Unlike other games, where mods are mainly anonymous, or just one-offs, for Skyrim, almost everyone in the community has heard of the greats - people like Chesko, Arthmoor, Nazenn, Caliente, and Elinora, to name a small few.  Modders are dedicated, hard-working indivudals who saw something wrong with the game, or even just something that could be improved, and set out to make it better.  I know I wish I could be among them, those near-gods who wield the Creation Kit and 3DSMax like a hammer and forge.  And the diversity of mods is nothing to sneeze at - you might say, ""there's a mod for that"".  Sometimes, I like to play as close to the vanilla game as possible.  And other times, my game is almost unrecognizable.  Either way, and anywhere in between, mods can make Skyrim the game you want it to be.I'm sure a few of you scrolled down here just to get a summary of my thoughts.  Well, here you go, you lazy n'wahs:Take a look at the playtimes of the reviewers, check out what other games they play, what they have to say, and ask yourself: ""Will I want to spend hundreds, or even thousands of hours on a game with nearly limitless potential?""  If the answer is ""yes"", then you should definitely get this game.  If the answer is ""no"", then there's not much I, nor anyone else, can do.			"

												The province of Skyrim might be frigid, but the role-playing game that takes place within it burns with a fire few games possess. Yes, Skyrim is another enormous fantasy RPG from a developer that specializes in them, and it could suck up hundreds of hours of your time as you inspect each nook and crevasse for the secrets to be found within. The game returns you to the continent of Tamriel, where you explore the northern realm called Skyrim, home to the Nord race. In these northern regions, snow flurries cloud your view, and platforms of ice float on the chilled waters. Nighttime often brings Tamriel's version of the aurora borealis, with its gorgeous blue and green ribbons stretching across the heavens. Skyrim's predecessor, Oblivion, featured prototypical fantasy environments-pretty but not quite evocative of the lore's darker undercurrents. Skyrim embraces its darker elements. You might feel an eerie chill as you glimpse a half-sunken ship through the mist, or watch as a dragon comes to life before your very eyes under the swirling firmament. Closer inspection reveals hard edges, plain painted-on textures, and other visual flaws that are conspicuous should you seek them out. But like many enormous games, Skyrim makes a fantastic impression not because its individual elements are sharply honed, but because they contribute to a grander whole. There's so much to do that your quest log becomes an embarrassment of pleasures, offering dozens of choices at any given time, each one as enticing as the next.It's impressive enough that there's so much to do; it's even more impressive that most of it is wonderful. Not every dungeon is a joy to explore. Stone-turning puzzles occasionally bring the fun to a halt, and a few repeated cave designs could dampen your spirits. But overall, every task has an excellent sense of context, and surprises lurk around many a turn. Skyrim also uses scattered books and references to enthrall you. You may not be a big fan of reading books in role-playing games, but even so, you should make an effort here.The combat in Skyrim is the  tightest Elder Scrolls combat yet, the visual and audio cues normally providing proper feedback with your blows and zaps.Some death blows result in Fallout 3-style slow-motion kills, which retain their power because they're not overly frequent. Movement, too, has seen improvement: you can now play from a third-person view and feel like you're moving across the land instead of floating above it. All in all, Skyrim has some minor issues but as a whole is a brilliant RPG.			"

												Okay, where do I start?General:This game is able to shock you and make you laugh time and time again, even when playing it for the 3'rd time. It takes about 130 - 200 hours of playtime to finish all of the quests, and I guarantee that in the time you will not discover everything there is to discover.If you do not feel like questing, take some time mining, scaring people with magic and shouts, undressing them, stealing, stealthing, killing dragons or giants, throwing cabbages around or simply reading 1 of about 250 integrated ingame books and stories.Graphics:This game has pulled off something I have thought to be impossible and pushed the whole gaming industry to the new levels. It has successfully integrated superb graphics into a lot of content. World is beautiful, vast and full of variety and although a bit dark by default this can very easily be changed by just picking one mod from the workshop.Workshop:Why does this deserve a special tab? Because thanks to workshop, earlier mentioned 200 hours of gameplay easily turn into thousands of hours of gameplay. Don't like any part of the game? Change it! Modify it! Add to it!A huge amount of mods are being made every day, and whether they spawn an extra cupcake in your house or add new cities with their own storylines they will all change your experience and prolong the fun. Name what you want to do, it exists. ALL OF IT. Cons:- Few possible glitches, but all have their fix, just need to be googled out.- A bit too confusing and overwhelming at the start. A lot of unanswered questions may put you off the game. This happened to me on the first two attempts to play the game. I ended up going to the first town, becoming a woodcutter, killing a chicken and getting chased by the guards. But once you push on, you will be nothing but glad you did.Who am I even writing this for? Is there any poor soul out there who has not yet played this game? BUY IT. NOW. Please?			"

												Great game.  One of my all time favorites.  It won multiple awards over the years and is still fun to play.  Pick it up, 100% beat the game, add mods, do it all over again.  You can spend hundreds; if not, thousands of hours playing Skyrim.  It goes on sale often because it's such a huge title, so just wait for then and get the legendary edition for pretty cheap.			"

												Journal Entry 1 After a harsh struggle with morals and general common sense I have decided to take on the life of a Serial Killer. This was a difficult decision, but none the less my career will be full of adventure and creativity im sure. Journal Entry 2 I stumble upon a small village in the middle of a lush green valley. The town is very cute and has lots of character, The trees lay down gently caressing the mossy roofs of the residents old homes. There is a quiet calm stream the flows through the center of town. yes.... this is my ideal place to begin my career. Journal Entry 3 I start by scanning out the town guard's positions, from what I can tell there are only 3 of them. With such a small town who would ever think to need more guards?.... perfect... Now we just need to carefully pick our victim. I scan around, I see a few older ladies, a few older men, A boy walking with his dog.... But who do I choose? ... so many choices Journal Entry 4 While scanning the small crowd of residents I hear a women's voice from behind me say some type of vulgar insult about my clothing. I turn around to see a ugly women with a sneer on her face. She sticks her nose in the air and shoves passed me. I can hear her mumbling something else as she walks away but can't quite make it out. I think we found our first victim :) Journal Entry 5 I decided to quietly follow her, she goes to the market and picks out fruits and meats, she wanders over to the stream and glances at it for awhile, she makes small chit chat with another women. Finally she starts walking out of town down the road for a ways. I quietly take cover in the forest and sneak along. She leads me to what appears to be a small mill on the edge of town. She walks into the older looking home next to the mill. Its still daylight and I don't want to risk an attack that she can escape from... better wait till night. Journal Entry 6 I wait until about 1am, its pitch black out and all seems quiet.... time to get a closer look at her home. I lockpick the door and sneak inside. The walls are decorated with all manner of animal heads, swords and shields. She has the fire lit and the light from it bounces off all the corners of the room. I find her quietly sleeping on a bed in the corner, I pull my dagger from my cloak and raise it. With one mighty stab she gives out her last breath and sprawls out silently on the bed. Now to leave my mark, earlier on I purchased a small quantity of blue flowers from a market, this will indeed be my insignia. I position her arms so that they are across her stomach, I then gently place the blue flower in her chest. A respectful position and a perfect mark for my career. Journal entry 7 I have cleared out most of the valuable items in the house....*Door slams*.... ""OH NO"" I hear shout from behind me! Its the husband! I should have done my research better, I should have noticed the large pair of boots next to her bed, they were far to big for her... How could I be so stupid. The man turns and runs out the door... I'm going to have to catch him or else im done for. I give chase, as I burst out of the door I can see that he will get to town far before I can catch him with my dagger. I pull my bow out, im only going to get one shot, if I miss im going to have to make a run for it. I take a deep breath and steady my aim, I carefully pitch my bow up and down... trying to gauge his distance as he runs. I release my arrow, it sails gracefully through the air... then I lose sight of it....Did I miss??.. I wait...Horrfied... hoping... begging.... I see his body fall face first to the ground, a perfect shot, a perfect kill. Journal Entry 8 I quickly run over to the mans body, we are now only about 20 feet from town but luckily there are no guards walking by yet. I grab hold of the body and drag it into the woods. I decide that maybe its time that the guards know they are not in control anymore. I drag the body to the mouth of the stream that flows into the town. I pull him into the water and let go, the stream's current is weak but its enough to float him into the town. I proudly strut into town to await his body's arrival, the guards are all gathered around the center of town with lit torches talking. I wait patiently beside the market.... then I hear one of the guards yell ""A Body!"" The guards and 2 other residents run over to investigate, gasps and mumbling begin to develop around the group. I turn away and start heading out of the town.... My work is done here... Many more towns to visit in skyrim :)			"

												★ = Poor ★★ = Fair ★★★ = Good ★★★★ = Nice ★★★★★ = Awesome ✔This game isn't boring even when you play it slowly, just look around, enjoy the beautiful scenery and explore the world of Skyrim.Whether you are killing bad guys or exploring the unknown, you need a trusty follower by your side!Mods, there are tons of mods out there that can make your game as realistic as possible and as beautiful as possible. Tons of quest too, that also include custom quests made by fans. Wide range of class like;Warriror, Archer, Mage, Battle Mage, Spellsword, Rogue, Nightblade, Ranger, Necromancer, Ilusionist, Cleric, Thief and many more, it all depend on your playstyle. Of course you don't have to go around killing people, you can always enjoy hunting animals if you like, or exploring the whole Skyrim.			"

												Despite what you may have heard, this game is not actually about dragons all that much. The story centers around Vietnam vet John Wayne, a devoted husband and loving father troubled by his past. When Jarl Snowden summons John to his court in Bethlehem the player is given the first key game mechanic, the ""look at stuff"" feature. This feature is innovative and fresh, giving the player a new way to interact with the game. Using the mouse, the player can move John's head and experience what stuff looks like through his eyes. Or, if you're a pro like me, you'll want to toggle to third person so you can see John's back aswell! This new feature has never been seen before in any game, and renders the genre fresh again.After Jarl Snowden talks to John about some N.S.A. leak scandal, you must take on the role of John's alter ego, Rage Cage, and spend the next day and half walking to Hyrule. Once there, King Hugh Jayniss informs you that you could of just fast travelled here instead of walking. Upon which, I put down the game to write this review.			"

												Simply put, Skyrim has surpassed every hope I had for it when I first purchased it 2 months ago. I'm glad I got to experience such a beautifully put-together game at it's maximum potential (on pc). Mods can add even further longevity to an already thriving ecosystem of character dialogue, customization,  and the original artistic portrayal of The Reach in Skyrim. The dedication of the fan base's continued support of mods is testiment to the appreciation of what has become more than a game at this point. Well orchestrated music; rich, graphical landscapes and near endless customization have captured my heart and lead to an inevitable appreciation of the Elder Scrolls franchise. Please play Skyrim if you haven't already.			"

												One Word: AstonishingThe Definition: Amazing; confounding with wonder or fear.That’s exactly what Skyrim was to me. My journey with TES series is based on this very definition. I journeyed into TES starting with Oblivion. At the time, I didn’t find the game all that exciting nor filled with “wonderment.” I was bored with the game, I found much of the game” broken” and a lot of “bugs & flaws” within the game. The dungeons were long…tiresome and a chore to really go through. So when Skyrim came out, I was very hesitant on playing it. When the time came to play it, I was moved. The Score of the game is absolutely stunning. I own the soundtracks to Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim (all composed by: Jeremy Soule) whom is Legendary in his music composition. Skyrim (let alone the entire TES series) wouldn’t be as is without him. He makes up a large “piece of the pie” of the greatness of TES: Series.TES:V – Skyrim what is expected to those anew to the series? Here is my exposition:I recommend the player to accomplish as much (if not all) the “Achievements” they can. The achievements for Skyrim will introduce the player(s) to Three Things:1.	Exhibition – this opens up the player to much of the great “creativity and artwork” displayed throughout Skyrim. The amount of “work” that went into this game (The Fine Arts: smithing, archane, enchantments etc…) there’s many classes to exhibit from. I myself Mastered: Archery, Smiththing (The Art of Forging Weaponry) archane, enchanting and sneaking... The Journey of the classes of Skyrim is to be “savored” and they will be rewarded.2.	Exploration – TES series is known for its “open-worlds” Bethesda has done exactly that in the Country of Skyrim of Tamriel. The amount of Scenery is to be examined. I myself was in awe on how much Beauty is throughout the game (from landscapes to the “heavens”) astonishing… There’s also the exploration of being introduce to the many side-quests that fleshes out the game’s story (understanding TES story-lore) to Skyrim itself on how much you really want to immerse yourself in TES Universe. I truly recommend if you want to enjoy the game’s full-potentiality.3.	Accomplishment – the “achievements” of Skyrim is to “flesh” out the game’s performance in full. To acquire the full-potential of the game’s nature. It’s to be enjoyed, savored and in the end when the player reaches that Last 75th Achievement he has fulfilled all of the game’s value. He has “experience” what Bethesda fully intended each player of their fan base. Does “one” have to do all 75 of the achievements in Skyrim? No. Do I recommend it, yes because I’ve seen and experience (and from it) the appreciation of the amount of: Work, Creativity, Passion, and Value that went into this game; I truly look forward to the next installment of the series.

												Perhaps one of the biggest and best games of the RPG genre that is one of the few games that continues to improve with age due to the massive modding community who continue to produce incredible extensions to an already beautiful fantasy world. You play the role of the Dragonborn, and the only hope to save the world from destruction from the legendary dragon Alduin the World Eater. Alongside the imminent destruction of the world, a fierce civil war has broken out, and you must decide who to side with, to bring peace to the citizens of Skyrim once again.Skyrim is a world that gives you the freedom of choice. With such a variety of classes and builds to choose from, you can create the character you want to play as. Create your own story, and follow your own path as the Dragonborn. With superb story-telling and a first-person perspective, you can really get immersed within the Elder Scrolls universe. Or perhaps create your own universe by installing multiple mods.Having only played through Skyrim with a single character so far, using a selection of mods to improve graphics and features, I still have only brushed the surface of the game. Although an Enhanced edition is now available, this original can certainly look just as good with the right graphical modding. These mods do require a little bit of fiddling, especially with mod organisers, but it is worth it. The enhanced edition does have fewer mods available at the moment, but many modders are working hard to re-release them. Whether I come back to Skyrim via the original or the enhanced edition, time will tell. But I definitely have not had enough, and will return.Pros:+ A Massive fantasy open world done right+ Superb story-telling+ An incredible immersive experience+ So many classes and builds allow you to create the character you want to be+ Well designed dungeons making great use of shortcuts back to the entrance+ Build your own home, get married, and start a family+ A Huge amount of side quests available alongside the main questline+ Massive modding community to create the world you want+ A lot of the cons can be improved or fixed with modsCons:- Lots of bugs (without the unofficial patches)- A lot of the dungeons can look and feel the same- Random appearances of dragons can get a little tiresome- Not that many interactions you can do with your family- Not many options to choose from when building your own home- Children look like potato-head people- Too tempting and easy to just revert to your previous save if something doesn't go your way, which can take the immersion out of the experienceMy Score: 9/10 "

												Very good game, I love RPGs but this one sticks out, with mods there is no end, this game has to be on the top of games.I really like the balance of the game, and everything is just great.The level system is very balanced to with 280 perks (vanilla) and you can spend hours creating your own character. If you play alot without mods, you will probably complete the whole game with 1 character in like 350 hours (that is the quests) and the level is infinite so...., and with story mods, it can take forever.If I forgot to mention, there is a Creation Kit in the ""tools"" bar were you can create and edit your own mods, Nexus Mod Manager is a program that I strongly suggest.It's a very good infinite game and an allround awesome game, like all Bethesda games.

 Skyrim is the latest installment in Bugthesda's legendary Elder scrolls franchise,games which have always been touted as ""genre defining"" & it pleases me to say that skyrim is no exception. With it's barren vast open world landscape & it's cast of interesting characters skyrim is the definitive RPG experience that you will ever get to play. In order to elaborate on this, I am now going to give you the reasons as to why you should get The Elder scrolls V Skyrim. Pros
 Flying mammoths Gorgeous game world with 512 x 512 & 256 x 256 textures ( 1024 x 1024 with the HD texture pack ) Excellent companion AI that hinder quests by stepping on to traps as well as triggering them for you in order to make you feel more immersed in the game as well as blocking doorways & always being spotted by the enemy especially if you want to roleplay as a sneaky character. This is another feature that makes you feel more immersed. No dependence on mods. Unlike the other games in the franchise Skyrim is not dependent on mods to keep it interesting even after 300+ hours of gameplay cause who doesn't love replaying the same opening sequence for the 6th time.  Easy & glitchy dragon fights. Who needs challenging boss battles when we can just kill dragons & feel like gods. Screw timing & skill required in your average game boss fights. Skyrim did it right so much so that you don't even have to lift a finger in most fights. You can just let the other Npcs handle it for you. It's not like the game says that you are the only one who can kill the dragons. Broken quests. This is the most important feature of the game as it encourages the player to keep playing the game again & again in order to complete that quest. And at times it also forces the player to delete saves & hence reducing progress you have made so far in the game.This further increases your game time. Bugthesda are one of the true pioneers of this feature & other games have also started adopting this. Paid mods is the latest innovation that bugthesda in collaboration with valve have brought to the table for skyrim. Although Skyrim is not dependent on mods but it is still a good option for the players cause who doesn't want to pay for something that may or may not work & could possibly harm your saved game.  To be honest i can't think of a single con for this game cause it's just so perfect and i think i have made that very clear with the features mentioned above. I think my only gripe would be that the soundtrack is just so meh in my humble opinion. Final verdict : 11/10  Skyrim is a game that definitely deserved the critical acclaim that it got back in 2011 although it was released in the same year that saw games like i don't know Deus Ex Human Revolution, Batman Arkham City, Dark Souls, Uncharted 3, Witcher 2 but hey those games don't stand a chance against skyrim & all of it's innovative feautures. A clear GOTY winner "

You can go climb mountains, explore caves, discover settlements, meet new and strange people from traders to assassins. Best part? If you found somewhere but your not in the mood to explore it, you can leave and come back later with fast travel allowing you to keep on exploring those beautiful regions.Another epic thing with this game, is you can never actually say you have ""finished"" it. You complete the story, but still have loads of quests left to do, items to sell, houses to build, lands to own etc. You will always keep thinking there is something more to do until you 100% finish the game.Community Mods and DLC bring so much more into this game, house building, new locations, deadly weapons, new people and quests etc.If you enjoy open world games, buy this game. Simple as that. Totally Recommend this to everyone!			"

												Latest game in the Elder Scrolls series (prior to Elder Scrolls Online), many elements of the game have been dumbed down and/or streamlined for more casual gamers to get into it. If you ignore all the great things from previous games though this game stands on it's own merits as a fun romp through a sandbox world.The singlular reason to buy this game on steam rather than on the console is the capablity to be modded. Check the Steam Workshop and the Nexusmods for details on that.You are in control - you can change the difficutly at any time, you can install whatever mods you want to make the game more enjoyable. Anything you want you can do. If you want to challange yourself, legendary difficutly + difficutly enhancing mods exist. If you want it easy, then novice difficutly lets you hack and slash your way through the story and of course there are all shades in between.Swords, Maces, Bows/Crossbows, Shields, Dual Wielding, Magic, and more. Play the way you want that's the name of the game. Your experience is what you make of it, imagine you are in a story and play that way!			"

												Note: to see this review in its true form go to:http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/04/gameskyrim.htmlAh, Skyrim, the King of RPG games and the game that led to a flood of crappy ""arrow to the knee"" jokes that swarmed the internet for months. I doubt there is anyone who doesn't know of skyrim by now but i'll give you my two-cents. Skyrim is a action-RPG that plays out in a masvie open-world with thousands of side quests,things to plant/gather, and to fight. Skyrim is in a bloody Civil war between the Storm Cloaks and the Imperial army. But under the surface even more factions are fighting for turf, The Thieves guild, its glory long gone, strives to reclaim their title as masters of darkness. The Dark Brotherhood, crumbling and in despair seeks out new opportunities to return to the day when people feared them and respected them. The College of Winterhold, a old school for Mages, that fell into hard times after half of Winterhold fell into the ocean, uncovers a powerful relic that could allow Infinite wisdom or Infinite Destruction. That is just a sample of the deep story and background of skyrim. the world of skyrim IS alive and many a writer spent long hours making a amazing and life-like world.The Best part about skyrim is there is so much to do! want to be a Vampire? you can do that! want to be a werewolf and murder people? you can do that! want to kill people and eat them for dinner? guess what? you can do that! (<-- You know that is a slight bit creepy.) but really, skyrim is an open-world dream. the main storyline is fun and engaging the side quest sometimes turn into their own winding paths that take hours to complete. this makes skyrim a HUGE source of fun and gameplay.there are a few problems with Skyrim however. The game crashes often on some PCs. but some mods on the Nexus mod site will help with that. and of course with some a HUGE world there are also bugs a-glore. and with Bethseda gone off to The Elder Scrolls Online, chances are that they wont get fixed. But! the mod community has dealt with these bugs and most can be fixed by downloading the Unofficial Patch.the Steam Workshop and Nexus Mods provide an endless source of game-changing content, from new armor to flying houses to brand new branching quests. and that there is the BEST part of Skyrim on PC, The mods available explode your game-content. you play as a king of skyrim, you can marry (and kill) multiple wifes. you can get thousands of new weapons, even lightsabers! Gamers with epic gaming PCs can download the free ULTRA HD texture pack from Bethsdea themselves, and if you want to take it a step forward you can download Ultra ENBs. Skyrim Really is a different game with MODS. . some players may feel that the game is too easy. there's a mod for that. some players may feel that the cities are too empty, there's a mod for that. some players may feel like there should be more NPCs. there's a mod for that. my point is that with the MODS available on PC you really can custom your Skyrim experience to what you want,so even if you already own Skyrim on PS3 or Xbox 360, you should still pickup The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on the Steam store.

												Pros:-Rich lore-Fun first/third person combat-Massive weapon, armor & outfit variety-A very interesting open world with lots to explore & discover-The music is amazing-Lots of little random events scattered all across the setting many of which lead to profound experiences. Every replay is different yet there's so much variety I have yet to start a new character. -The PC version allows for modding. There are a TON of mods which adds hundreds if not thousands of hours of replay value to the game. Cons:-Performance. It's pretty hit or miss depending upon your system configuration-Story. While the lore is rich the main story is rather bland and most of the characters are either annoying are rude/bigoted. Their plight didn't inspire any sympathy within me due to how unkind most of the characters are towards anyone not like them. That said YMMV. On a personal note I thought the story in Oblivion was much better and the characters more likable and easier to root for. It's a shame that the most interesting characters in this game are the ones written about in some of many books you'll find scattered about the landscape. All in all I'd say that while the main story is hit and miss in regards to quality there are plenty of great side-stories. It offers hundreds of hours of gameplay even without the addition of mods and the world it takes place in has a very 'lived in' feel thus adding to immersion. I'd give it a 9.5/10. Despite some of its flaws it's one of the best rpg's I've ever played.  "

												Boy, oh, boy. Skyrim. When I started the game, I did not knew how strong I will be hooked to the game. I am glad I bought the Legendary edition with all the DLCs.So after completing the main quest, I've decided to write an review. 77 hours is what steam says, but probably 2-3 hours and loading screens and pause screen so around 73-74 hours is okey to write an review.Of course I like completing all kind of side quests and you can get the main quest much faster, but I love how the world is alive, I love to explore the beautiful land and interact with the NPCs. I've found many interesting stories, many interesting quests, funny moments that kept my addiction to the game and of course, even after so many hours, I still have many quests to play and I still did not complete the two DLCs- Dragonborn and Dawnguard. Of course this game is amazing and thanks to mods, the game is becoming quite unique. I am using some mods that tweek my game and make it very special for me and of course there are so many mods out there- Nexus (I have not tried it yet, steam community and many other sites).It is up to you to chose a mod and play it.The music is outstanding and it is contributing to the lovely atmosphere of Skyrim. The sounds of everything are very high quality and sometimes I just enjoy sitting on my balcony of my manor that I've build and just enjoy the weather, the birds flying in the sky and animals passing by.The graphics are beautiful, even without any mods for it. Yes, the mods can make the graphics much more different and beautiful but know that you will need much better hardware to run it smoothly.As for the gameplay, well it is a open world game and you actually can do almost everything you like- you can kill innocent people, kill bandits, animals, vampires, monsters, orcs, elfs, DRAGONS, trolls and many more.Oh, yes, dragons.In the beginning of the game you don't want to encounter a dragon, but when you level up and start making your character stronger, you start to hunt those flying leviatans. When you kill a dragon, you absorb his soul and this soul is needed to learn a new ""shout"". The ""shout""s or the Thu'um s are pronounced with the dragon language, which sound like ancient nord language.And of course, you are the Dovakiin- Dragonborn with a dragon blood and the world needs you to stop the World eater- Alduin to stop devour the world. Will you do it or will you lost in the labyrinth of the mods, it is up to you to decide.I will continue playing the game, because there are so many things to do, so many mods to try, DLCs to play, naked chicks to watch, oh, boy, oh, boy.

												The Elder Scrolls V: SkyrimWell... well well well..... I really have no clue from where to begin so ill JUST!DO IT!!Ok, So Skyrim is one of the most perfect games (BETHESDA!) that I've ever played, fully honest with you guys, this game is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!The incredibly great and wide open world, The unique missions (SO DAMN MANY!!), The huge amount of weapons you can use, from rocks to war hammers to balistas (mod..), bows swords - every middle time weapon you can imagine IS IN THE GAME.One of the things I find which makes this game really unique is the huge amount of NPC's and different inviduals that you can communicate with, fight against (or get allied with), buy, sell, trade, deal, EVERYTHING is in this game,-Graphics: There's no argue in here, this is an 2011 game, and for that time this game was just a fantastic mind blow when it comes to graphics. The NPC's movements, the cruitures, the battle scenes, its all looks so sharp and great and so relaistic its sometimes even scary (For example, a bigass dragon that stands 1 inch from you and blowing fire on you. Thats nasty).-Gameplay: Well the gameplay of Skryim is just addictive, you can just play and play and keep on playing for days with out stopping cause of all the fun and joy this game can give and make to a player. The gameplay man, its just awesome! so many different fighting movements, arenas to fight on and just destroy your mouse and keyboard from the stress and feel you give into this game when you're in combat. To anybody who's into fighitng and combating, you really should try the Arenas in Nexus-Mods. They're just awesome.-Voice Acting & SoundTracks: GOOD JOB!!! As always, Bethesda knows what they are doing when it comes to Voice Acting in their games. ""Can It Be?... YOU Are The New Dragonborn?"" oh man, every NPC get his part on this game when it comes to voice acting. From fancy lords to warewolfs and vampires, from a cute little bunny to a nasty troll, the voices and soundtracks man... Also the whole environment sounds, its just magnificent!So, before I summary Skyrim, lets talk about the different DLC's this game offers, ill summery them shortly ;) :DDragonBorn- I'm starting with this speciffic DLC because its my favorite. On this DLC you gain a whole new map in the Skyrim world. You gain a new city with new quests and NPC's and new unique weapons and cruitores. So I wont spoil you guys more than that ;) Dawnguard - 1 word, VAMPIRES.This unique DLC adds you the old days myth and war of Vampires VS. Werewolfs. annnnnd thats pretty much summerys it.Hearthfire - So this speciffic DLC I can only recommend to people who feel like building their own house and having their own property... Nothing really to spoil, the whole DLC is that you get an offer to buy a land, build your house in there (Which takes huge amount of time...), decorate it however you want, putting 1 NPC in there to be the Guardian of the town or the leader of whatever... and thats pretty much it. I recommend buying it on some sale tho its only 5 bucks....Summary: Skrim, oh skyrim, 260 hours of my life I wasted on you and I dont regret not even 1 minute I playing you.Definitely one of the greatest games of the century so far. This game will WOW even the most sceptical guy on Earth. and Narnia.Highlly recommended!			"

""How could we have ever worked out?!"" Her replyechoes in your head, a shout. It's been days sinceyou last heard Summer-Rain talk to you, havingbeen avoiding you in school. Your grades havebeen slipping, and the boss at the bookstore isunrelenting in his idiocy.After a hot shower and instant noodles cookingon your desk, you sign in to Steam once more,thumbing through your games before seeingwhat many consider to be one of the greatestgames ever made.THE ELDER SCROLLS V: SKYRIM.Cold chills run down your arms and your headbows down a little in a small form of reverence,as you remember you have heard many thingsabout Skyrim, but never got around to playingit because of your runaway relationship withyour ex-girlfriend, Ms. Novocaine. After a fewbite-gulps of your noodles (chicken broth, noless) you click 'Play'.You enter Skyrim a prisoner, taking almost anhour to make sure your character is perfectfor this game. Alduin, the World-Eater dragonruins your execution and the world of Skyrimis now yours to freely explore! Join the rebelStormcloaks trying to free Skyrim as a nationunto itself, the Imperial Legion, who wish toreintegrate Skyrim into its borders or simplyskirt both sides, choosing neither.A million and one side quests keep youoccupied and then some, with a vast array ofweapons and armor sets for you to go nutsover. The mods are insane, with you downloadingall the Assassin's Creed outfits and taking a likingto running around in Shay Cormac's templaruniform from Assassin's Creed Rogue.In time, you break a supernatural curse thatafflicts the Thieves Guild, become a Nightingale,a sort of superpowered Thief hero for the guild,while after another series of missions you savethe Wizards College and even become theirHeadmaster. You lose track of time and black out, at the critical moment where you trap Alduinwith the 'Dragonrend' shout.""Hey."" A voice calls you from the blackness.You wonder if this is Oblivion, and the voicesounds sweet as honey. ""Wake up... pleasewake up."" Your eyebrows scrunch in a raised,quizzical way. Is it Meridia? No... too sweet.Azura? No... the voice sounded too kind. Perhaps she was Noctural? The voice wastoo sensitive, and not like Nocturnal's regaltenor. You open your tired eyes.Once more it seems you're on the floor ofyour room, and Summer-Rain is cradlingyou with your head in her lap as she peers over you. ""Welcome back, truant."" She saysin a Noctural-like way, sounding more likethe Daedric Prince herself. You struggle, and feel bristles on your face brush against yourhands when they accidentally graze you inyour stupor. Stubble.""It's been 10 days since I last saw you inclass, truant."" Summer-Rain scolds you,folding her hands and pouting in hertsundere-like style. You feel your face again, and think of how the most beautiful girl in the world has seen you at your absoluteworst now, and all because of this game.""Hey!"" Summer-Rain snaps her fingers infront of your face, her face growing redder.""You listening to me, Truant? You can'tplay games like this all the time and skipclasses! I won't always be there for you allthe damn time-""""Summer."" You state plainly, and it isenough for her to fall silent. You look at herdeliberately. ""I wanted to lose myself because out of all the things I've lost or I've had to bear, I cannot stand the thought of you treating me like Ms. Novocaine did.""Tears sting your eyes and roll down yourface as Summer-Rain looks down, looksaway and holds herself with her own arms,as if she has seen something impossiblystrong break. ""It's how you've been treating me after that call, Summer."" Shelooks up and tries to reach you, but youcannot. Not after the truth and memoriesthat you once knew this girl for the longesttime in the past, and she ignored you outof some misplaced sense of nobility.""No, Summer. No."" The words are spit outin desperation now, as you shrink from hertouch. ""Get out."" You hiss. ""Get out."" A sharp crack echoes out in your room, andyou feel a sharp pain across your face.""Truant!"" Summer-Rain shrieks, her facea mask of insane fury and a half-smile,her eyes watering from holding back herfeelings. She shouts at you once more.""My teeth to your neck!""With a crash, both of you end up on thefloor, Summer-Rain staring into your eyes,both of you wild-eyed and frantic, afraid ofwhat the other might do. A few secondspass, and Summer-Rain lets her eyes flutter,looking overcome by your emotions.""Nivahriin joore. What twisted words haveyou uttered my way?""She holds you fast, there and then, quietlycrying in the crook of your neck. You holdher, your Summer-Rain, and you know evenif things go back to normal later, for thismoment, the girl you've known from yourclouded past is truly yours and yours alone.After a time, both you and Summer-Raindisentangle yourselves and she busiesherself at your computer, ordering you toclean up and not be late for class tomorrow. ""I'm going to make sure you come tomorroweven if it means I have to come breaking into your house to check up on you again.""Summer-Rain states, taking over your game in Skyrim as you bathe and re-civilize yourself.""So... nothing happened again, Summer?""""FUS... RO DAH!"" The shout echoes from yourcomputer, Summer-Rain having finished offa Dragon with a shout from your character,who is running about with Shay Cormac's templar uniform and brandishing the swordDawnbreaker with Mehrune's Razor.""That's right, truant. Clean up and get somerest okay? I'll see you tomorrow.""Little would you know that tomorrow wouldbring the key to make Summer-Rain yoursand yours alone, after an eternity of waiting.THE ELDER SCROLLS V:SKYRIM. "

												10/10This is the Game of the Decade. Absolutely immersive and legendary, possibly dangerous for some. I have heard that it can be more addicting than heroin. The graphics are fabulous and even more so with the thousands of mods available. There is no restriction on how you must play- other than how you want to. Skyrim doesn't get old until you reach like 1000 hours and even then, not always. I'm gonna go ahead and say that this game is better than Fallout 4 and the previous titles. By agreeing with my review you don't necessarily have to agree with the Fallout bit. LOL. Bye.			"

												I have a confession to make: I really hated Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. That was the first Elder Scrolls game I was acquainted with and I was disappointed. Who knows how many times I started playing it and I always gave up after an hour or so. Considering the above, I didn't expect much from its fifth instalment called Skyrim. But hey, I thought, I should at least try it and give it a chance. So, there I was, couple of hours in the game, hacking and slashing the enemies and doing silly things like reading the books I've collected during my travels. Couple of hours after that, I bought a house and started stacking those books on a shelf inside. The weird thing was, the game wasn't about buying a house, books and reading and stacking them on bookshelf at all!!! A new threat has risen and you are a Dragonborn, warrior destined to do many great things. You must fight and prepare for what is to come, you must save the world!! But, as it happens, you can do many things besides that: read, buy a house, collect weapons, become an assassin, thief or a mage. The world is so vast and it gives you freedom to explore and do your quests as you see fit and when you see fit to do so. Along the way, you will collect some awesome rewards. You will become the enchanter and blacksmith, you will be able to craft dragonbone armour and improve its characteristics by enchanting it. You will do many things. And that is what makes The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim so enjoyable. All in all, my opinion of the series improved and I really can't wait for the next instalment of the Elder Scrolls franchise. "

Best RPG Game Maybe To Date!Hello all that are reading this review. Ive had this game in my collection for a few years now and im just now adding this review.The reason ive never put a review in for this game is being i get so lost in the world Bethesda has created i get lost and drawn in...So i have never finished the game 100% yet lol . So when i get lost or i stop for a long period of time i reroll just to play again and live a different side or life or just to try something different.This game is so breathtaking and so amazing just playing normal as in unmodded ....As i like to call it Stock-rim lol The one thing that also makes this game almost the only RPG game you need and might be the Best RPG to Date is due to its massive modding community. If you dont like someting you can change it ! Dont like the way things look or sound ! You can change it !! The modding in this game can make this game 100% pretty much endless or always new and fresh.I know some will say i have low hrs in the game... but i played my fair share of this offline being its just a Massive Single Player Game, so no real need to be online ;) I say if you havent by now grab this game now ! I would also grab the full version also if you can so you can get the FREE upgrade to the The The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition once its released in Oct. for PC and Consoles. Just make sure you get the full game ;) So add this to your cart and sit back and Enjoy !			"

												Can't believe I never reviewed this game before. Another great Elder Scrolls game. Fun quests, great soundtrack, and a huge world to get lost in. Leveling is a little simplified in this game compared to other Elder Scrolls games, but they did a good job still making it fun. The DLC's are great and there are also A LOT of mods out there that make the game even better.			"

The Good: -Hours and hours of ""Fun""  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)-Hours and hours of not getting to see sunlight(who needs it, right?)-Great customization for both character, armor, weaponry, and homes(obviously mods are amazing)-Spending hours and hours making your character look absolutely amazing-Spending even more time making them look better than before-The story is amazing-Beat the game? No you didn't, not until you download more and more mods-Amazing visuals-Hilarious moments-Having the ability to kill Heimskir without it being a crime-Making an Argonian and naming him Harry. You're a lizard Harry-Accidently hitting a civi in a bar brawl and going to jail-Have arachnaphobia like me? Play the game over and over and you'll get over your fear.(or use console commands and kill it for the first day like me ;) )-Make mudcrabs dress up like fancy people -Make skeletons actually spooky(Spooky Scary Skeletons) #Too spooky for me-Become king or queen of your own castle -Make the game as realistic as possible by getting mods-Launching a full scale snowmen war in Whiterun-Make the game look better and better-Spend time learning an unofficial(or is it?) language and sounding smart in front of your friendsThe list goes on and on people. The Bad:-You're wasting time reading this review, instead of fighting for the true sons of Skyrim!!!!!!!!!!!!(or fighting for the empire, if you're into that)-WARNING: This game will steal your soul, your free time, and your want to do anything but sing the main menu theme in Dovazhul.

												Undoubtedly, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is one of the greatest role-playing games ever made. This game gives you an opportunity to go on your own adventure to explore the world of Skyrim. There are so many quests and RPG elements to make your character truly yours. There are many things to craft and discover, though you'll likely end up wandering off from where you originally were headed because there are too many things for you to explore. Bethesda Game Studios has taken their games to a whole new level by bringing their games to life, allowing us to have a great gaming experience unique to other RPG's. Mods are compatible with this game which just makes the experience even better. If you are playing this game in high or ultra-quality, you will experience some of the best game graphics you most likely have ever seen. Also, this game gives you an atmosphere from the Middle Ages, enabling you to learn about many things from the Medieval times. Without a doubt, this game is a game that you would most certainly enjoy and if you do not own this game yet, it is highly recommended that you purchase it or put it on your wishlist. My rating for this game: 10/10 If you enjoyed this game as much as I did, I recommend that you buy The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition - a remastered version of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim "

												I have been playing games almost my whole life (15+ years). I can honestly say this is one of the best games I have ever played and I will tell you why. I have had around 500 hours invested into this game across multiple platforms and playthroughs. (PC is the best version) First is the graphics, I've added mods but just the standard game is one of the best I've ever seen. The trees, grass, animals and the level of detail that the game includes is amazing! I literally spent about 4 hours the first day of its release back in 2011 just wandering through the world examining the different things in amazement at how detailed and beautiful it was. The second thing that makes this great is the commentary, it's all voiced and basically everyone can be spoken to in the game and everyone plays a part. (More on that later)Next is the content 100+ dungeons around 10 major cities and a few extra small towns there is much to see and explore I can honestly say through about 500 hours of gameplay I still can find new places or things I've somehow missed over the hours. Quests and random events are all throughout these places you will not run out of things to do (and if by some chance you do there are mods! haha). Now that being said most everyone in the game is ""killable"" and if you kill them it may stop a certain small side quest from being available. So you really have to make decisions wisely. Choices matter and if you don't watch yourself you can miss out. Which can hook you into another playthrough like I was. You can play mostly as a mage, as a sworded warrior, an archer or create something of your own it's all up to you! Now before I'm done I will add that the 3 DLC packs (Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn) are all great additions. If you have the money buy the Lengendary Edition of the game it's worth it. Dawnguard adds some extra gameplay and features, Hearthfire add the ability to build your own home and adopt children (actually really cool additions) then Dragonborn adds a whole new questline and location to play on. They are all worth the money and you will not go wrong buying this game. Only minor things not even worth mentioning are problems in this game and I would not hesitate to give it a 99/100 easy.But as one final warning it is possible to lose yourself in this game. I've spent roughly 500 hours playing this one game and still far from laying it down. It can take your life and give you a virtual one (think with Hearthfire; home, wife, kids... A whole life!). It's an amazing game and I highly recommend you buy it. "

												This review is basically my take on a timeless classic, but with the addition of a few mods that I believe greatly improve the beauty and immersion of the game.The Game Itself.The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is already acclaimed as one of the greatest RPG titles ever. It just won yet another Steam award, for ""Standing the Test of Time."" I couldn't agree more; I'm still loading up my modded save once a week or so to complete one or two of the myriad of side-quests I've yet to play through. It is uniquely engrossing even now, with so many years under its belt, with an atmosphere that just has to be experienced to be understood.The Civil War questline was at first one of my favorite parts of the game, but even after replaying it for all possible outcomes left I felt like there was a bit of unexplored potential. (there are ultimately only two outcomes, not counting the option of simply ignoring it, even if the player negotiates the truce while playing through the main questline.)However, the main questline was seamless from start to finish, even at the places where it touches the Civil War questline, and it literally left me staring at the screen, mouth agape, uttering alout to myself an awed ""Wow."" Perhaps not everyone felt the same, but that's why there's a review button for every player. :whiterun: The final location could perhaps have been a little more played-up, but it was more than enough to drop my jaw during my first playthrough.The DLCs, which I have completed, were outstanding examples of what a paid expansion should offer: Entirely new gameplay mechanics, enough added content to make the buyers feel like their money was well-spent, and enough added gameplay hours of campaigning to satisfy plot-hungry fans. I was especially engrossed in the two DLC alternate dimensions: Dawnguard's ghastly Soul Cairn and Dragonborn's twisted Apocrypha tomes. Bravo, Bethesda.My Modding Reccomendations.I played vanilla Skyrim for roughly 35-40 hours before deciding to begin modding. By the time I started playing, the Skyrim Nexus was already teeming with so many great mods that there were at least five different choices for every fix or change, oftentimes many more. Thus, as the game is now, modding is about personal taste. My game is different from everyone else's, because it's seasoned to my own tastes both aesthetically and mechanically.However, everyone starts somewhere, and if there are a few people out there who have not modded their Skyrim yet, I urge you to look up a brief beginner's guide (I believe the one that got me started was on Rock, Paper, Shotgun) and then take a look at my, or a friend's, list of other more in-depth choices. I'll include a few of the ones that satisfied me most here. Seasons of Skyrim ENB[www.nexusmods.com]. This is the pivotal ambiance that defines your mod setup. There are many, many presets, but SoS is, in my opinion, the prettiest. ELFX[www.nexusmods.com] for a complete indoor/dungeon lighting overhaul. You'll actually need to use that torch if you're not a Khajiit. aMidianBorn Book of Silence[www.nexusmods.com] for 2k weapon and armor textures. Superior Lore-Friendly Hair[www.nexusmods.com] to replace every NPC's ugly plastic do's with far more realistic, high-texture hair. (I'd also recommend using other mods for real NPC facelifting but those are legion and entirely up to the user's taste.)Thanks for reading!P.S. Death to the Stormcloaks! "

 About The Elder Scrolls V: SkyrimEPIC FANTASY REBORN The next chapter in the highly anticipated Elder Scrolls saga arrives from the makers of the 2006 and 2008 Games of the Year, Bethesda Game Studios. Skyrim reimagines and revolutionizes the open-world fantasy epic, bringing to life a complete virtual world open for you to explore any way you choose. ~ Release Date: 11 Nov, 2011 GraphicSkyrim has a free High Resolution Texture pack available as DLC,but even without the graphics are clean with nice details and textures. Ambient lighting and effects are excellent and the designers have succeeded in creating a diverse and atmospheric landscape. Character creation is good with a lot of customisation possible. All this, however, is completely and utterly eclipsed by what is possible with Mods. With Mods characters, followers and NPC's GameplaySkyrim is a joy to play, its not perfect but its pretty close. Controls are intuitive, responsive and work well with either mouse/keyboard or controller. There are many choices to be made throughout the game with real consequences, factions will favour you or attack you depending on your actions and alignment with other factions. There are many different playstyles and strategies to Skyrim, finding what works best for you is all part of the fun. Skills and abilities progress as you use them so you aren't completely restricted to a class such as mage or ranger, want to use a little bit of magic but also kill with a bow.All in All Skyrim is a Good Game !!!8/10 From Me Sweep	 "

												So Valve and Bethesda  have taken away paid mods. Cool and all the power to them but I belive Valve should still make it easier to donate to mod creators, especially on a game that's so heavily dependant on mods from the community. The base game is so open and full of promise, but it's also empty and borning. It's as if they made the game expecting mods to make it better.Original Review: Was a great game and still is but I'm just gunna give it a thumbs down for the forced payment of mods now. I figure if we the community can shove this games rating down far enough then maybe valve will reconsider the forced payment option and maybe let devs have a donate option instead.			"

10/10The EPIC, super LEGENDARY, most AWESOMENESS OF AWESOME GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!.I spent hours (Don't be fooled by my steam given hours), days, weeks, and years playing this game and it still doesn't get old, you know why? I'll tell you later.When I first played Skyrim, I spent a day just doing one mission because of looting every single thing and exploring every single corner of the god forsaken dungeon I was in. Moving on later in the game, I discovered some exploits and some other things to make things easier, finishing the main story and moving on to the side quests. After all that, I discovered, (I'LL TELL YOU WHY IT NEVER GETS OLD) MODS!!! THAT'S RIGHT, MODS! It took me a month in total to get all the mods I've wanted, still new mods are released to make other mods look like crap and once again, modding the game.This game ruined my life (not really but in a good way). I would want to tell you the story and some mechanics on why this game is good but I am not a serious reviewer. I just want to tell you guys this is the bomb right here. This game is just plain awesome.P.S. FUS-RO-DAH!!! "

												This game, with mods, will create a strange sort of paradoxical space/time field around you that will make years and aeons fly by as you slowly whither away into a slightly decrepid, old, wrinkly and beardy version of your former self. You will cuddle up in blankets as you build tents with Frostfall to avoid the bitter cold of Skyrim, emerging from your cave beneath the fortress of Helgen only to enter that place that the mere mortals call ""outside"" just to get food, water and caffeine. Your social life will slowly collapse like a flan in a cupboard, and all contact with this ""outside"" they speak of will eventually cease.Five stars			"

												The Elder Scrolls V is my first classic RPG, and have found it to be as an enthralling a gaming experience as the world of Skyrim itself  is magnificent. This game is a masterpiece in its scope, variety and beautiful vistas. Skyrim is what a player wants to make of it and I for one have discovered a new passion in pc gaming. I highly recommend Skyrim to you as well worth trying.			"

And people are quite happy to down vote games because of there buisness practice and this is no different .Bethesda and Valve made a shameless attempt to make a  cash grab on mods . They failed only because people stood up to them other wise we would  be paying for mods now in most games. What makes it worse is both companys own a large part of there rise and success  down to free mods.Suggesting a donation box for the actual developers of the mods who put time into making it and not a requirement to get the mod just a donation optionPeople telling me to change the review are the same people who where trying to tell us all why paid mods is a good thing.White Knights of Valve and Skyrim please insert your tears and buthurt in the comments section below i only charge $1 per comment			"

												I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds – the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user – but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words – each Shout has three – hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.The game has one of the largest active modding communities of any game. This helps to spice up gameplay and graphics. With new residents, new weapons and armor, incredible house mods adding giant castles, and visual mods. You can spend hours upon hours finding mods that suit your needs in the nordic lands of Skyrim. It is worth to note that you should know the game to an extent before modding, as it can corrupt save files if not done properly. If I'd have to rate it, it would be a 10/10.			"

												The Elder Scrolls V - SkyrimSkyrim, the latest entry in developer Bethesda‘s beloved The Elder Scrolls series, is a role-playing game of truly epic proportions. Similar to its predecessors, Skyrim’s main allure lies in its extensive scope: huge landscapes to explore, a plethora of quests to solve and a wide variety of enemies to combat. The game is set in the very north of the fantasy continent Tamriel and tells a compelling story of dragons, magic powers and high adventure.After a surprising absence of some months, veteran composer Jeremy Soule returns to the podium to write a score, which unquestionably proves that he is still at the top of his game. Skyrim is easily the most accomplished score in the Elder Scrolls series yet. Never quite holding back when scoring for fantasy settings, Soule kicks it up another notch for Skyrim; a tactic which is already foreshadowed in his testosterone driven main title cue “Dragonborn” that boasts male choir and thumping orchestral accompaniment. It is a joy for every Elder Scrolls fan to hear the famous title theme in such an exciting arrangement. Originally, the idea to use a male choir for the main theme stems from the game’s producer Todd Howard. Yet Soule responds soundly to this challenge by extending his familiar orchestrations (in the main title and beyond) to fit the tone of the rigid and harsh landscape of Skyrim.Still, the heavily thematic and catchy album opening may set the expectations too high. Most of Soule’s music is solemn and melancholic in tone and focuses strongly on underscoring the quiet beauty of Skyrim’s landscapes. The composer relies heavily upon string crescendos, subtle harmonic progressions and careful use of horn and woodwinds. His orchestrations are subdued and subtle, the majority of the cues low-key and melodically evasive. Fans of Soule’s music will notice immediately how he hesitates somewhat to stray too far from his comfort zone (one is reminded of Guild Wars: Eye of the North every once in a while). Indeed, Soule’s trademark sound remains strongly apparent throughout. What sets Skyrim apart, though, is the sheer quality of the compositions. The soundtrack impressively draws on the whole spectrum of musical expression - be it drama, tension, beauty or action. “Far Horizons” in particular is a beautifully written and well developed cue and one of the album’s highlights. As a stark contrast, “Awake” will send shivers down your spine with its haunting horn melody. The arrangements for choir and orchestra in both “Aurora“ and “Sky Above, Voice Within“ will impress you with their stunning clarity and clear emotional impact, white “Into the Darkness”, “Caught off Guard” or “Blood and Steel” keep tensions high and get your pulse pounding with brassy action arrangements, sometimes even reprising the Elder Scrolls theme. Unfortunately, when it comes to memorable themes, Soule holds back considerably. Even though he confesses more than ever that his strength lies in magnificent horn passages (“Unbound”, “The White River”), and even though the main theme makes an appearance here and there (in percussion and choir in “Sovngarde”) through certain melodic progressions which harken back as far as Morrowind (“The Jerall Mountains”), Skyrim remains, overall, considerably more atmospheric than thematic.As far as the release of the soundtrack is concerned, four disc of Skyrim’s music is certainly a heavy dose. Soule did his best to arrange the cues in a diverse way in order to keep the listening experience memorable and entertaining, but it would certainly be a veritable tour-de-force to listen to all the discs back-to-back. Instead, the sheer quantity of music entices listeners to come back to it again and again over a couple of days, perhaps even to create a playlist with a personal selection of best-of tracks. Certainly, the generous release is a testament to the epic nature of Soule’s effort and well worth the money. Surprisingly, however, the soundtrack album lacks any kind of booklet with information on the score or liner notes to the music. Such an added value would surely have heightened the enjoyment of the score as such – a missed opportunity! Still, the release must be commended for the sheer massiveness of its scope.One could criticize that Skyrim is essentially nothing new. Soule stays true to his characteristic-sounding type of music, the familiarity of which remains hauntingly obvious throughout. One might say that, except for some novel facets, most of what Soule has written for Skyrim already exists in his own Guild Wars: Eye of the North. What this criticism would obscure, however, is the true quality of this soundtrack (both in terms of its music and its release) compared with the seeming standard of today’s game music industry. Soule’s contribution to the latest Elder Scrolls title is as vast and enticing as the world it was written for, and it captivates the listener with the same restless intensity as the game captures the player. It may be that Skyrim is more of the same, but in this case, it is essentially more of the best in game music, today.Truly one of my favorite games - 10/10, Recommended.			"

												Let me take you back to mid-2011. When I first heard of Skyrim coming out later that year, I wasn't thrilled at all. Having played Oblivion briefly in the past, and not being convinced at all, Skyrim became the most over-hyped game I could think of. When it eventually went on the shelves and I had a few glances at the Let's Plays that popped up all over YouTube, I looked at it in sheer disbelief. It looked awful, very awkwardly wet textures, that was one of my main issues (honestly!). I decided, however, and that was after the initial euphoria with the gaming community had died down a bit during the frosty nights of early January of 2012, I might give it a go, once a legit price drop had occurred and the big hype had completely dispersed.So then, in April of 2012 I finally ordered a retail copy from the UK. I had ordered it together with a dear friend of mine, that regularly orders games from the UK (on account that they are much cheaper there than in Germany), and he encouraged me to boot it up.I had a good time with it, but it was, well, just good. I had tried a few mods from the Steam Workshop for my first time playing, mainly the HD Texture Pack and a few other minor tweaks.I continued to play the game and eventually I became aware of the much larger modding community of the Nexus Pages. And this is where my interest in the game finally sparked immensely. Modding became more of a challenge and I needed help. This help came in the form of Gopher's modding guides. Gopher offered a variety of concise and easy to follow guides to modding games on his Youtube Channel, as well as, and that was the gist of it all a very entertaining series of Let's Plays of Skyrim. His play style is somewhat different to what I had had in the past, but it so verily applied to how I feel about games in general. Games are the perfect medium of literary immersion. A game can engage you on so many more levels than a book or a film can ever dare to. And that is exactly why Skyrim eventually became such a dear game to me. Skyrim is a game that rewards engagement in its lore. It can become so lively, so intricately designed, but only if the player is willing to go further than bluntly playing the game. It is a living, breathing world with a back story so rich, that one can not ever learn all of it. I myself regularly lose myself reading through the articles on the Elder Scrolls Wiki Pages, stepping from one topic into the next.The Story of Skyrim is very iconic in the way that it is written. Joseph Campbell's ""monomyth"" or ""The Hero's Journey"" in which the Protagonist is called from his normal life to adventure, on a quest to save the world. There are obstacles along the way, wise teachers and climactic action. The Monomyth is a pattern that works well and it does so in Skyrim too. The internal development of the Dragonborn hero however, is up to the imagination of the player, and this is where immersion comes into play again. If you are not willing to immerse yourself in the game and identify with the Dragonborn, the game will have no lasting value to you.The gameplay also intrigued me. Having slight prior experience with RPGs I have touched the basics of typical RPG game play. Skyrim however stands out from the crowd by making levelling an organic process. You swing a sword at an enemy - you get better at sword fighting; you get hit - your experience with armour increases; you mix ingredients together - you learn their effects and become better at creating potions. This process, this ""learning-by-doing"" feels very natural, very logical. Much more so than the typical RPG practice of gaining experience through completing quests or fights and then choosing yourself what you want to become better at.Another great implication of this levelling model is that it essentially resolves the issue of class-restrictions. You can be whoever you want to be: you can be a heavily armoured mage, you can be a lightly armoured, two-handed weapon wielding killing machine, you can combine magic and one-handed weaponry, and, most importantly, you are allowed to do all of them at once if you choose to. The Combat itself runs in real time, like its predecessors, and there is no automatic hit-and-miss calculation involved like it was the case in Morrowind for example, ergo, you hit - you hit, you miss - you miss; an action-style combat system. However, and this is a big however, there is no locational hit detection, so that head shots or blows to specific body parts on enemies generally have no different effect from hitting any other body part. This is made up by the fact that certain perks add chances of critical damage to their respective weapon types.The world design of Skyrim at times is stunningly beautiful, awe-inspiring vistas, gloomy caves and warm, inviting inns. And then there are times, when everything looks a bit dull. This is owed to the fact that Skyrim is such a resource heavy game, that in the development Bethesda had to work with a lot of ambient lighting which is not always practical and doesn't look very good. Vanilla (modder's jargon for ""the unmodded game"") Skyrim, therefore suffers a few drawbacks in regards to its looks.And so, we come to my final argument. This argument may be the strongest of all, because it might eliminate all of the issues that I have with the game. It is the “moddabilty”. Through the use of mods, that can also be created by the player itself using the free Creation Kit that came with the copies of the game,  every mistake, every bug, every minute inadequacy can be remedied. If you don't like the look of something, you can mod it. If you don't like the way something works, you can mod it. If you feel something is missing from the game or something it is need of, you can mod it in. If something is broken, you can fix it with mods. Modding can add to the game in such a grand way, it can change your experience entirely, or it can just enhance it. And it can make Skyrim play the way you want.This is what ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"" is all about: player choice. If you will, you can play it for a couple of hours and then never touch it again. But if you are willing to engage yourself further, there is so much more you can do with it. It can become your very own epic poem.			"

												Before Skyrim, there was Oblivion. It was flawed, unbalanced, dated and had DLC for horse-armour, and yet it was still loved because despite these things, it was still one of the best games of this genre.Skyrim is Oblivion but without the bad bits.I still don't understand why there aren't more games like this. You are let loose in a massive open world and are allowed to do what ever you want. The closest games to it would be MMOs or Grand Theft Auto, but Skyrim is a single-player experience. You'd think that this would make it lifeless and unrewarding, but you couldn't be more wrong. The entire world is lovingly hand-crafted. Every character you see had to be placed there. They had their face, personality and clothing picked by a developer of this game... and then you're free to come along and end their life with one slash of a blade. Or not. The choice is yours.I didn't expect much from this game. I had kind of seen through Oblivion and it became lifeless for me, and I thought that since this was constrained by the same hardware that it wouldn't be a large leap, but I was so wrong. I couldn't wait to explore every crag and valley simply for the sake of it, accompanied by the amazing LOTR-style soundtrack. I happily gobbled up the quests and have had countless exciting memories of this game where I've accidentally picked a fight with some one bigger than me, or where the game glitches out spectacularly. What ever happens, it's a joy to behold.Even if you're not a fan of this sort of genre (come on, who isn't? The Elder Scrolls games are a genre in their own right!) you need to play this game. Get it when it's cheap and you'll more than get your money's worth, even if you only play a fraction of what there is to see and do. You can live a virtual life as a fisherman, merchant or fighter and unlike the older games which required a bit of imagination to pull off, this one has the depth and complexity required to make it enjoyable.The down-sides? The dragons are too easy to defeat, though this game has since been patched to include harder ones. You'll hate it when somebody dies through no fault of your own (damn you, radiant AI!) and you're left with an empty shop where you once purchased your stuff. You'll end up with far too much in your inventory as you plunder tombs and your companions become more of a burden than a help as you level up, transforming into mules to carry your rubbish as you battle against the undead.But really, who is going to be reading this review without an idea of what this game is like? Who hasn't seen the thousands of mods available for free for this game? They make the vanilla 100's of hours of gameplay turn into 1000's. You'll have no life for weeks after picking this game up!In short: buy this game.			"

												Let's make short and simple: If you are on steam, and you don't own this game, then you're doing it wrong. WRONG. The game is immensley vast, atmosphere is so.. cool. The game will just suck you in. It has LOADS of contents that will keep you busy for 100+ hours for sure. And mods are just icing on the cake; if you're a graphics-hungry person, mods can make this game look better than most ""next-gen"" games out there, if modded correctly. And the sceneries, oh the sceneries, I just feel like sitting on my chair and just keep staring at those vast fields of beautiufl grasslands. Totally recommend this game. 15/10.BUT, but, one and only con that I found is of the fighting mechanics; it is just so bland. Nothing else I dislike about this game.			"

												A game that is complicated to critique. For the first 30-50 hours, you will be completely absorbed in the beautiful and vast world, with seemingly endless opportunities for exploration and questing. As you continue to play, the cracks start to show. The gameplay systems are incredibly shallow, the characters wooden, the world still beautiful but the dungeons copy/pasted 120 times over with the same enemies, the same meaningless loot. The complication arises when you realize that while you are slowly starting to loathe the game, you've had 30+ hours of fun before hitting that point. So the question is, was it worth it?			"

												The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, where do I start with a review. When this game was first released, it was still unfinished. There were many bugs and issues, some of which made playing the game difficult to say the least; However, it was still one of the best games of 2011. Over the years, these issues have largely been addressed and the game is now more stable. The visuals in Skyrim were stunning, absolutely stunning, when compared with it's predecessor, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, released Six-years earlier. Using the then new Creation Engine, Skyrim is a hyper-realistic world for the player to explore much like Morrowwind, with a size similar to Cryodill in Oblivion. Skyrim has several DLC packs, Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn all of which are a part of the Legendary Edition. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, is a game every RPG gamer should have in their library. Most of the bugs and issues, present when the game was first released have been resolved. There is also a library of Mod's available for Skyrim if you know where to look to personalize the game the way you want it. If you enjoyed Oblivion, you should also enjoy Skyrim, as it has a more realistic world design from Oblivion, though is similar in actual overall size. ~Potential Spoilers~Skyrim, takes place 200 years after the events of Oblivion, in the Northern Lands of Skyrim on Tamriel. You play as the Dragonborne, someone who has the ability to absorb the souls of a Dragon and call upon the magical ability, Thu'um, known as the Shout of the Dragon. While navigating the story to understand what this means, you are also caught in the middle of a civil war between the Empire, who are now allied with the Alderi Dominion, and the People of Skyrim.

This game is the kind of  type game where it is not about the end its all about the journey. I have played a lot of rpgs in my day, and in most the quests have been bland and the main idea was to explore however this game can be  both the quests are great, the story is great the map is amazing, Yeah there may not be as many random encounters like fallout, however when exploring you will allways find something new, and as we are pc master race we also get the privlage of mods that add alot more to the game which is amazing, i mainly enjoyed some of the modded quests, and horror quests.

There's always something to do in Skyrim, always new quests, new locations, or dragons to slay, and the graphics are amazing! Everything is great, and even though I feel that the NPC's could've been programmed a little bit better, it's nothing that doesn't make the game experience amazing.

												The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an epic fantasy RPG games where you can waste countless of hours in-game.You want to be an Archer? Grab a bow + heaps of arrows and start shooting people like a boss!You want to be a Swordsman? Wield or dual wield the countless amount of weapons in Skyrim and start slashing peoples!You want to be a Sneaky Basterd? Level up your One-handed, Sneaking, Speech, Lockpicking & Pickpocketing and you can be silent as f*ck killing people and grab their $$$ or talk your way through to get things go down your way!In this game, you imagine what you cannot achieve in real life. The world is massive, the mechanism is flawless and there's infinite amount of quest that you can do in this game. Of course there's bug here and there but in its way, this game is fun to play.Don't forget the amount of mods already available today. After 3 years of its release, this game is still living and mod is one of many reasons Skyrim still one of the most played game. I myself play this game with using mods that increase immersive such as RnD and I imagine being a Solo-Player like Kirito with Elucidator & Dark Repulser.Do what you want, be what you want.

												This game truly deserves the title of ""near perfection"", being one of those rare milestones that comes every so often in years of gaming. Skyrim itself, is probably the best release from Bethesda's Elder Scrolls series. Story wise, this is one of the most developed storyline from the series, giving much enjoyment overall. In all honesty, we can say that the community is one of the most desirable aspect of Skyrim, due to their dedication in further releases of modifications - improving much of the overall gameplay (it never hurts to crank up those graphics). It would be a pity to not try Skyrim in the course of your lifetime, so it's advisable to go ahead and try it!			"

												You need to buy this. You don't need to follow the quests. You can join groups and become a hitman (Dark Brotherhood) or a master thief.(Thieves' Guild) Much more groups. You can hunt animals and admire the graphics. Very real. A game for 2010 is better than some games that just came out. I'll see you playing it! I'll rate this 1000/10 dragons. Oh yeah, that right. There is a workshop of this. If you get bored of this game once you complete you can download mods.			"

												This was my introduction to the elder scrolls games and at first I thought it was great, but i quickly got bored.That all changed once the creation kit came out.With over 300 mods (alot of merges, patching, and edits) I've made skyrim the best RPG I've ever played, ever could play.With hardcore realism, survival, immersive, overhauls, and just plain fun mods - easy to create the game you want.Base game:I honestly don't know where to start. This game is amazing.First impressions upon playing the game; where do I startImpressions on 'finishing' main story lines;  Now, what will I do next.There are loads of quests, hidden secrets, hidden lore, tones of areas to explore and loot - Then beat the game and start again with a new character.Although there is a fast travel system in the game; don't use it. It's an RPG - go exploring. Discover the land and her secrets.With more than 800 hours offsteam and 800 more, this is possibly the game that I've sinked the most time into.And I still sink time into.Sure skyrim is really ""dummed down"" compaired to older TES titles, but then mod it up - there's a mod/overhaul for everything.   Really hard to dislike anything in the game.Also, avoid Steam workshop - Use nexus mods and stick to the Nexus Mod Manager or LOOT. Save yourself from massive headaches.And hey - No paid horse armour!That is all. Crap review over. Talos guide you.			"

												I don't know, haven't really played the game much.I guess it's okay.Okay, let's actually review this game.__________________________________________________The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a continuation  to the series by Bethesda, and despite Bethesda having made several games after it by now, Skyrim remains not just with popularity and constant sales, but also with very loyal player base. Last I heard, Skyrim is already in the top 5 of the most played videogames EVER. That doesn't mean that the game is flawless, infact, far from it. Bethesda has somewhat of an history of releasing games that at the first glance seem to be only half-finished. With Skyrim, this manifested in the form of countless bugs, strange situations,factions and story that many felt was inadequate and other issues. Yet despite all that, the game is the favorite of many and more. The answer is community created content, ie. mods. Players saw these flaws in the game that bethesda didn't seem to acknowledge, and attempted to fix them, or improve the game, or add something new to it. The mods that the community has created for this game rank from the absurd to amazing. You want to replace all the dragons with the Thomas the Tank Engine models? Easy. You want to turn the game into a hardcore survival experience in a cold, hostile land? Easy peasy, Lemon-squeezy. The possibilities are near endless.So, as an idea, the game is very good. As an actual product, it's clearly flawed. But when considered it as an platform for all these modifications? It's excellent. To me, the game with mods offers so many possibilities, it's mind boggling. I am the kind of guy who gets bored rather easily when doing the same thing over and over again. Thus, when playing  Skyrim, instead of trying to do everything with one character, I will focusing on to only a few key aspects of the game, and create a new character to explore the others. It is not a game to win, it's a journey to be experienced.So, is this game worth buying? Absolutely. I recommend you get all the dlc's s well, so just go straight to the Legendary Version. And in the possible case that you are new to the modding and don't know where to start, both Steam Workshop and  the Nexus Mod site for Skyrim mods[www.nexusmods.com] offers a good way to start. And I am sure you can find help on the many skyrim modding forums on both internet and steam itself.A reminder here that you can only mod a PC version of the game. Console players are sadly out of luck in that regard.			"

												Over 1100 hours played, in two years of owning this game, and I believe I have barely scratched the surface of this game. I have discovered many locations, have achieved high levels of gameplay (albeit a lot of that with installed mods), but I truly believe that a person could grow old playing this game, and not ""complete"" it, as such. I am not very good at this review-writing, but the company behind the name, Bethesda, truly made a work of art here, and I do hope so much that, going forward, they can continue to update and otherwise add to this game, and not let it simply die out. With that being said, they are about to release Skyrim Remastered, or whatever the 'official' working title is, and I am chomping at the bit in anticipation of the release date, which I believe is the 28th of this month (October).You go, Bethesda! Don't the haters stop you from continuing to provide quality entertainment.			"

												It probably already goes without saying, that if you don't own or even heard of Skyrim, (which you will give me a heart attack, if you haven't.) you're really missing out on a fantastic game. Borrowing many elements from this game's own prequels, everything from the leveling up system, to the wide arsenal of magic to be learned or discovered, the untamed, fearful dragons and monsters that lurk around every corner of the game's world, The carefree and quirky races that inhabit the beautiful lands, villages and meadows, and the many different hobbies with skills involved, such as cooking, weapon smithing, magic crafting, item synthesizing and studios book reading, This game is what I call 'fantasy ectasy' and is a king amongst most action, role-playing games.Each unique race has a special ability, that again is unique only to them and solely based on the player's personal preference. Such as the Argonian race, being immune to poison and the gills with skills to breathe underwater. Or maybe the wood elf, being the deadeye master of the bow and arrow. As you can tell, there are many races and strategies that would help out either sooner or later in the game, depending on the race of character you have chosen. What's best about this is the vast ways you can customize the physical appearances of these races, ranging from nose types, eye types, ear types, hair types, body types, etc. Even I'm guilty to say I've spent countless hours trying and failing, to create a Nord, reminiscent of my appearance. And if you ever need a helping hand with extras, look no forward to the mod community. They of course definitely help out not only with your character's physical appearance, but also along with everything else.The world of Skyrim is diverse, solid, beautiful, secluded, peaceful, amazing, creative, magical and the list goes on. You could explore for hours upon end of this game's landscape and not be surprised on how much detail and development has been put into it. From the untouched wilderness to the ancient mythical buildings that dot Skyrim's land, it's definitely no surprise on how this game keeps you occupied and truly captures the imagination of magic and mystery in the process. It's as if a lucid dream came to the unconscious mind of a sleeping, video game geek, who is subsequently pitching a tent.There's the main story with the long-whinded yet slightly repetitive missions, where you play as your main character and eventually learn that you are the legendary 'Dragon-born' and depart for one hell of an adventure, to save the beautiful land of Skyrim while causing a ruckus for bandits, wizards, giant spiders, the undead, the royal knights and all around powerful dragons at the same time. But, what this game truly dishes is out is simply a marvel to behold. And when I say this, I mean that this game is offering an immense load in the side-quest and mini-game section, along with the many uncharted locations and hidden caves that are just waiting for your epic hero/heroine to discover. With rewards and many different possibilities and alternate outcomes to unlock in this wonderful game. If you go out and mind your own business by robbing the local residents, just make sure to blatantly put a vase on top of their heads so they don't suspect you of theft and go into a killing frenzy. Just a tip for you all.If you're into huge epic tales set in a fantasy and mythical environment, or just blatantly love a great storyline and narrative, with a huge variety of memorable characters, creatures, dungeons and dragons, this massive game of amazing preportions is definitely for you.

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												It's an overall excellent game. It has its quirks, but it's a very good experience and the modding community alone can be a reason to buy this game. It has some flaws just like everything else, but despite that you still have things to do after 100 hours of gameplay. It's not really a game where you should rush stuff.It's different than most other RPGs and open-world games though, you probably either like it or you don't, but it's worth a try.I recommend you to buy the legendary edition for full experience and for full modding potential, plus you also get Skyrim SE which in itself is nothing extraordinary, but it has excellent modding potential. You can probably expect a new rush in the modding scene soon. If you don't know why you should use mods then keep reading. The game is usually *cheap*; you can get it for €7-8.  Bethesda for some reason got the price up because of the new Special Edition.Longer stuff here:I have been a fan of TES for a long-time. I started playing the TES series with TES IV: Oblivion. Morrowind never really got me for some reason.However I'll try to write a review here without comparing this game to its predecessors.PROS: Usually cheap, you can get the legendary edition for €7-8. Look out for sales (spring, Christmas) Mods!!! There are very high quality mods. The engine; the technology behind it. Big open-world game. Open-world also means that almost everything is accessible inside cities too. Basically you can visit almost every building in the game. Almost ""simulation-tier"" mechanics regarding NPC behavior in the game. Most NPCs have their own daily routine. They have their own house and you can even break in and take their stuff if you want. Play however you want, you aren't restricted to classes, you can use any combination of skills in any way you want. You don't need to be strictly a thief, warrior, assasin or mage. There are no classes! Interesting lore. You can read books in-game. Fun Lot of quests and stuff to do. You can pick potates for money, you can be a hired assasin, you can also be a werewolf or a vampire or maybe a vampire hunter? Whatever floats your boat or goat or dragon or whatever you have there. Oh, wait... you can (almost) be all of those at the same time. Familiarity with previous titles not needed. It's a TES game which means it's unique in a way like none other. Todd ""Never Lying"" Howard (Ok, this point is a joke.) Excellent community support. Mods include bugfixes. Unofficial PatchHonestly you can see some points are very similar, but I did that on purpose to emphasize some stuff.The engine, the technology behind the game receives a lot of negative opinions, but honestly it gets the job done in a way which allows for very good opportunities modding- and gameplay-wise. For example it's pretty easy after a modder made a weapon to actually have the NPCs inside the game treat it as a weapon, evaluate its stats, etc. NPCs can travel through the entire map without constraints and a modder can really easily accomplish something like that.The modding community is awesome. Many excellent mods are made like gameplay overhauls (magic, combat, ai, etc overhauls), bugfixes, new games (yes, totally new games. see Enderal), companions with professional voice acting and all kinds of cool stuff.One of the three essential mods I would like to mention are SKSE,  SkyUI and The Unofficial Skyrim Patch (a combined one exists for the legendary edition). SkyUI gives the game a nice UI, meanwhile the unofficial patch fixes thousands of bugs!!! SKSE provides functions for mods to use and some bugfixes. There is another mod called bugfixed I would recommend which fixes some bugs inside the game engine. I recommend installing them for a proper vanilla experience.For mods check out nexusmods. It's kinda the official go to site for mods and you can use their mod manager quite easily.***Generally it's recommended to familiarize yourself with the modding scene. It will keep you from having difficulties later down the road regardless whether you want bugfixes or a whole new game by applying 200 mods.***CONS: Modders will fix it philosophy. Bethesda can release very buggy games due to numerous reasons I won't discuss here, but this can cause problems to new players. Installing the unofficial patch is always *necessary*. Some parts of the game; quests, guilds can be a bit shallow. However the amount of content included and overhaul mods can easily make up for it. It's quite easy to become very powerful and ""break"" the game, but being very powerful can be great fun too. The game has been balanced for a more casual market. This might be a big no for some people, but mods exist to balance it in the way you want it. From hardcore overhauls like Requiem which turn it into a more classical RPG to handpicked overhaul mods working together, you can do whatever you want to do. Putting various separate overhauls (magic, combat, AI, perks, stealth, etc.) on your game each focusing on a different aspect allows you to personalize your experience in whatever way you want to. Stupid AI. The default AI can be pretty stupid. Mage characters are a lot weaker than warriors with the same amount of time invested. Altough if you pair it with a stealth you can be an unstoppable ninja one-hitting everything; I'm not sure whether this is a con or a pro. I think it can be both. Not that challenging depending on playstyle. See the previous point. Perks are bit one sided and simplistic. They make you more powerful, but the variety is lacking. They either enhance some gameplay feature (like lockpicks never break) or give a buff to something (more damage, less magic cost, etc.). It can still be fun though. (You can always use mods.) The lore in this one compared to its predecessors isn’t that dominant. The engine... it's really a pro and a con, the two sides of the same coin. It's the source of many problems and at the same time it's our savior giving us the ability to produce mods easily.To give a clearer picture I have to say this: depending on what you do you can get pretty weak in the game. Most of the game breaking is caused by experienced players or by players who employ a more tactical playstyle. However most people sooner or later will feel that the game (combat) is weaker; they need/want more challenge and that's the problem.Summary:I recommend this game.Despite its flaws this game is a very enjoyable experience and you still have things to do after 100 hours of gameplay. The main storyline almost feels just like another quest... among the many.The depth and possibilities in the game compare to no other games on the market, except its predecessors. (For the record the newer Fallout games by Bethesda use the same tech, so as the old jokes says it they're Skyrim with guns...) It's like living a whole other life. No please don't compare it to Witcher they are quite different games for many reasons.Mods provide bugfixes for vanilla players and interesting new stuff for players looking for something different or harder. You can even turn it into a survival simulator where you need to eat, drink, sleep and keep warm. The potential is endless. The graphics can be enhanced using ENB.I also recommend looking around on Youtube and watching some vanilla and modded gameplays. Don't worry even if they spoil something for you, they can't spoil everything, there's just too much content.			"

												On the surface, Skyrim is an open world first person role playing game or third person with the press of a button. A FPS RPG so to speak. Skyrim and the Elder Scrolls as a series are games that let you do what you want, play how you want. If you want to be a big axed barbarian, a thief, an archer, a mage, a healer or any mixture of them, you can do it. If you just want to mess around and shout goats off of cliffs, go for it. You'll be able to select a race, each with its own look and perks. You can even be a lizard Argonian or a cat Khajit. Whatever floats your boat. You'll even be able to turn into a vampire and werewolf. The NPCs are a lot more diverse with facial hair, body sizes and so on, its a good step forward to bring Elder Scrolls to what other games have had for a decade. The game offers nice diverse gameplay for any style, you can stealth around, avoid combat completely or just run in swords blazing! The game has excellent killing animations that are new to Skyrim. You can sink hours, days, months into this game and even if you were to run out of things to do, mods would still provide a lot more content.So what's the story? Dragons are back and only you can save Skyrim after one of them levels a town. The story is unimportant. Its basically the same story from Oblivion.... portals pop up and destroy a town. You are Dovakin and gain the ability to shout. What is shouting? Its like magic with a button of its own. Its really nice having a quick magic button. Much better than the former way of having to call upon a spell. Now in Skyrim the game, you can equip each hand with weapons, shields or spells. So dual weilding magic or weapons if you want or a big weapon in both hands. It makes for something fresh and new healing in one hand, fire spelling in the other all while shouting to stun your enemies. The combat feels a lot better and less generic than before. The spells are a lot more fun to use with good visual effects.The dragons are notably awesome. They fly around burning down villages, mercilessly killing everything and they'll follow you. You'll see them burn down towns, not because its scripted, but because that's what the AI is programmed to do. You'll see villagers pull out daggers, clear out of houses all to fight these dragons. Once a NPC is dead, they're dead. So if it was your favorite shopkeeper, they're gone. Sure there are spells to make them return as a zombie and fight for you, but the game is forever or at least until you console hack. You'll be able to fail quests if NPCs die and you don't get that quest back.The AI and its interaction has always been interesting in the Elder Scrolls series. You'll see guards defend towns against attacks. You'll see bandits attacking people. Now in Skyrim you'll see wolves hunting lesser animals like goats, chickens and foxes. It makes the game feel alive and you can use that AI to your advantage. Since nothing is scripted, its all your experience. You can talk about how you were saved by a ranger on a horse or how you baited a strong bear to a group of hunters that killed it.The game has an abundance of dungeons and each one feels like a healthy chunk of gameplay, especially for explorers. The Elder Scrolls series has come a long way since Morrowind. The prefab dungeons that all look alike are gone. Every location looks beautiful, dungeons, exteriors, vistas, and they somehow even made the sewers diverse, gorgeous and rich with color, style and interest. There are plenty of monsters and seeing giant spiders is just nightmarish. Even playing all of the horror games I do, no other game has made me as squeamish. Enemies have random levels, random loot, weapons and armor so you're never really fighting the same enemy twice. The cave entrances are a lot more realistic and actual caves rather than doors. While that's not exactly important, the game is really all about the look. That seems to be the big takeaway that I get from this game.For those that don't like deep dungeon delving, other than the first dungeon, you don't ever have to enter another dungeon. You can hang out in cities, exploring the wilderness, hunting, thieving from people, murdering everyone, running from guards, mixing potions from ingredients, doing quests, making spells and a beautiful new system to make armors and improve weapons. It feels much better and realistic than the old method of using hammers generically. Now you need to find a blacksmith, use his forge and grindstone. Enchanting and alchemy are similar processes, you can't just do them on the go, you need to find an alchemist and enchanting table. It makes sense and it doesn't seem like a step back from what it was, it just feels more realistic. You'll also be able to mine for ore and chop wood for gold.The game has a healthy length, more than most games and that's even when you use the game's fast travel system. Exploring is a lot of the fun though and you can't just fast travel to a new location, you need to find it and there is something around every corner. On your way to ancient ruins, you can climb a mountain, find a bandit hideout and do everything but actually reach those ancient ruins.Skyrim is a cold wintery place inhabited by mostly nords. It is very reminiscent of viking culture and that's a good thing. It makes the game feel far different than Oblivion and Morrowind. New to the series is a breakaway from typical direct face to face dialog. Instead you'll be able to talk to people as the world around you still lives. There is a new minimalistic menu instead of a giant text box at the bottom of the screen. It is all designed to look like a photograph and not break immersion. Everything is fully voiced and masterfully voiced, but the only catch is there are only a few voice actors for thousands of lines of dialog. Speaking with someone is a typical dialog tree, and this game, more than the previous games make me feel like this game matters with the things you say to people when given a choice.Like all open world games and previous games in the series, there are bugs and flaws. NPCs have a daily cycle and you'll see them disappear in front of doors as they enter. The animation is pretty awful and stiff fro the NPCs, watching them run, turn, then run some more is painful to watch. You can easily knock clutter around, but not nearly as easily as Dead Space. None of this is a game breaker. These are small prices to pay for a game so good and it never really breaks the immersion as much as I make it sound.Since the game has been out so long, its been on Steam sale several times, along with the Legendary Edition that comes with all of the official DLC. The game also makes full use of Steam's workshop to easily add mods and keep them updated. This is an amazing game, if not the best of its console generation.			"

												Skyrim is one of those games that will steal hours of your life away and it'll be worth it. You could play over a thousand hours and you'll find something new to discover. It may not be the most technically stable of games out there, but guaranteed at least 80% of the time it'll make you laugh (giants can launch animals and NPCs into space!). It has a rich story-world, filled with so many characters and hundreds of quests. You can play hundreds of hours of this game without touching the main story. If you want a game where you can get lost in, and just explore the vastness of the world for hours on end and create a character to your heart's content, buy this game. Like I said, you'll always discover something new, which will continue to make it seem as though its your first time again. "

												This game is really, REALLY addicting. No joke. I feel like I started playing this game only yesterday, and yet here I am, already close to 100 hours and more than 70 hours of gaming these past 15 days. I definitely recommend it, unless you don't want your life to be taken away from you.English isn't my first language, but I'll try to put my feelings into words anyway: Excellent game, with very good graphics. I stopped counting the numbers of screenshots I took of the sky, aurora borealis, mountains and forests. So many quests to do, so many possibilites. Everytime I play I can feel all the work that has been put into the making of the game. So many details and things to discover. You can also relate to many characters, so it's amazing.I really am in love with this game. I'd say the only negative thing I could say about it is that it has taken my life away from me... But hey, at least I'm having fun, so is this really a bad thing?  "

												This is one of the best games I have played in my lifetime. And no, I'm not 11 years old... :p Add 40 years to that. Yes, 51. My life is extremely busy and video games have always been my number one activity to leave the standard world. The Elder Scrolls series of games has been one of the best sources of fun I have found and Skyrim is simply the best one of the series by far! Do download the DLC (Downloadable contents) right away as the latest DLC (Dragonborn) includes very potent aspects to the game as the ability to receive TWO perk points when reading ability books!  BUT! Yes, there's a but. The game is so vast that there are some bugs... You need to play this with the Elder Scrolls Wiki (http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Quests_(Skyrim)) opened in a browser (ideally in a separate monitor) when playing to see the various issues with each quests or dungeons (like how not to completely mess up the ""Blood on the Ice"" quest so you can get to finally buy the somptuous Hjerim house in Windhelm). BUT number 2. Yes, there is another issue. You may SERIOUSLY consider adding a few ""mods"" to your game since they may fix some of the ""bugs"" mentioned. For exemple : adding the Dawnguard DLC will make Vampires appear and KILL potentially VITAL characters depending on the sort of build your are trying to achieve for your character! Geeez. You would think they would have thought of a way to hold these attacks until you start the quest? NO they didn't! But.... There's a ""mod"" that actually does this for you : preventing ALL vampire attacks (which may KILL city vendors and other characters) until you actually start the quest! Yep, this means, sorry lad, but you REALLY should take a stroll around the modding area, easily accessible in Steam by clicking the Workshop button under your PLAY button in the Games Library (once you've selected Skyrim). There are a few really cool mods I like apart from this one. One is called Run for your lives! And also makes all villagers run inside when there's a DRAGON attack. Again, preventing important characters from simply being wiped out before you get a chance to kill them yourself! :p Apart from that, the game is just insanely good... I have played it from beginning to end many times and still discover new things. :) "

												The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is built solely on the idea of discovery. In the very beginning you have no idea who you are, where you are, or why you’re aboard a carriage filled with condemned prisoners. All you know is you’re an outsider, and once you’ve reached your destination, your execution awaits.The caravan arrives in the small forted village of Helgan, where you’re pulled from the carriage. Your captors fail to recognize you; they’re just as puzzled by your appearance as anyone else. Are you a man or woman, an Argonian or Breton? This is your first opportunity to ask yourself who you are and who you want to be in Skyrim; it won’t be the last time you ask yourself this.Lucky for you, the execution fails, granting you an opportunity to escape Helgan. This is where Skyrim commences and where your story within Bethesda’s world begins. You’ve been told to visit a town not far north of your escape, but nothing other than the word of your new friend is there to compel you to visit it. The entire province is at your fingertips.Skyrim is structured in a loose manner, allowing the player to discover its world and various narrative strands at the pace that they desire. Characters will tell you where you should go, but there is never any real urgency to do any of it. The world is cluttered with distractions and what makes this experience unique is the distractions form the very heart of Skyrim. The core narrative, as it is, is a mean to an end, an excuse to pilot you from one corner of the world to the other. It’s hard to imagine anyone following a single narrative strand when it’s impossible to travel from one quest point to the next without stumbling upon some sort of ruin, cave, encampment or fort. The narrative has its high points, but it’s always made secondary by the next undiscovered location on your compass; and that’s because Bethesda wants you to pave your own story.Undiscovered locations dot the entire province of Skyrim, leaving the map a venerable piece of swiss cheese after a few dozen hours. Discoveries are the actual loot and tracking every single one of them down is the addiction that thrusts players headfirst into Bethesda’s fiction. Every location, small or large, is populated with its own personal story, which makes every journey feel special and rewarding. There’s an understanding that this world, this place, existed before you fell upon it; there’s also an unshakable feeling that it’s all been staged for you.Skyrim would have you believe it’s a dynamic world that’s constantly in flux, when in reality it’s more like a car stuck in neutral, waiting to be put into gear. Characters go about their daily routines but they merely exist to bestow quests or impart dense records of lore; no-one is truly alive when you’re not engaged with them. One of the principal quest lines revolves around the Imperials and the Stormcloaks, two factions waging a purportedly bloody, savage civil war that has split the region in two. In each and every town across the land nearly every single person is happy to share an opinion on the war, telling you how dire the situation has become. But there is no war, no conflict, not unless you decide to take part in it yourself; you may see hundreds of random encounters in this Nordic land, but you’ll never see the ‘War for Skyrim’ unfolding.Fiction aside, Skyrim is a vast, majestic world to discover. Bethesda is unparalleled when it comes to world building and when you’re wading through brooks, scaling mountains or eviscerating another cave full of bandits it’s an absolute joy. It’s a remarkable, liberating feeling that this province was crafted specifically for you; a huge playground with apparently no rules or boundaries. That isn’t the case. Skyrim has its rules; they’re specific and they have a nasty way of reminding you this fiction was written in binary.Every city subscribes to a simple bounty system: commit a crime and you’ll be struck down, pay a fine, or spend the night in jail. There is a clear consequence to crime, but it’s merely an illusion. On my first evening in the town of Morthal I snuck into the Jarl’s house and then into the private quarters of her daughter, where I then attempted to pickpocket the young sleeping woman. Without the deftest of hands, the girl arose, alerting the guards of my treachery. Not wanting a fight or untimely death, I submitted, volunteering to pay my bounty and spend the evening locked up. The following morning, strolling from my cell, I bumped into the sleeping girl once more: she asked me to deliver a letter of utmost importance for her; she trusted me.The bounty system is a dirty way to gloss over any real consequence for your actions. There is no gray area; everyone is either a friend or foe. When an enemy is nearly defeated they may beg for mercy, pleading with you to spare them. You can sheath your weapon but they will never flee, every single one will get up and rush you. Once, a villager followed me into a vampire’s hideout, hoping to avenge the death of his wife. Madness erupted and amid the scuffle I inadvertently grazed him with a fire spell, turning him immediately against me (note: the vampires who killed his wife were still very much alive). Afterward, instead of arriving to a town full of indebted villagers, I returned to an armed welcome and an outstanding bounty. There was no way to explain how the town learned of my accidental deed and no way to silence the vengeful widower – I tried killing him several times.Once you’ve found the parameters that Skyrim works with, it’s not difficult to play by its rules, and even enjoy it. There is a huge, jaw dropping world to discover at whatever pace you desire. Along the way you’re free to author your own story, defining your unique character and experience through whatever style of play you prefer. When you’re lost in its rich landscape and enthralled within its fiction, Skyrim thrives, and is truly unparalleled; it’s when you take a closer look, you can’t help but discover the seams holding this tapestry together.A Must Play "

												Skyrim is undoubtedly the best purchase I have made in the past year. It's worth every $ that it's listed at especially when considering the insane amount of content you are given. I have only spent about 100 hours in the game (this is short in comparison to a lot of people on my friends list) but I can assure you that those hours were all packed with immersive content.Here are some key features that hooked me into the game..1. Dungeon Complexity - When I say complexity, I mean that the design for the game's dungeons vary greatly from simple to complex. You just have to keep exploring and you'll eventually run into the intricately designed areas that get you to pause for a moment and think before being able to progress. At times.. I ALMOST felt as if I were playing the latest Tomb Raider once again. I also found it quite neat that you could use your shouts to bypass/solve a few of the puzzles.2. Playstyle Freedom - I'm sure tht a lot of people take similar routes but the game does offer a great deal of freedom with its perk system. It's definitely a step up compared to games like Kingdoms of Amalur. Do you enjoy melee combat? How about magic? How about a balance of both? There's a lot of possibilities.3. Expansive Lore - As I've mentioned, the game has a ton of content. Playing through everything (especially if you are aiming for complete achievements), gives you perspective on the whole story and it really is interesting when some quest's lore ties into another - maybe even forming a bigger picture.Skyrim definitely has a lot more charming qualities but these are the features that I really wanted to highlight. They stood out for me and it was for these reasons that I ended up buying the game last year (only to play it now - 2014) during the summer sale. With that said, I paid $30 for the legendary edition. Wouldn't you agree that for all this content, it was pretty much a steal? How many games can you list down that provide hundreds, nearly thousands of hours worth of content (especially if you count the mods) for that kind of price. Just remember, multiplayer games don't count!10/10. Buy it when it goes on sale during this upcoming summer sale event.			"

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is the fifth installment to The Elder Scrolls series which are very successful so far. The story is about the return of the dragons that lived thousands of years ago along with them appears the dragonborn whose objective is to stop their return. I do not want to spoil anything beyond this, that's why the story explanation is brief.TLDRFor those who didn't want to read a lot here's a short part of the review.Skyrim is a very large RPG with lots of things to do and you can be pretty much whatever you want to be. It's hard to determine how much time you will spend playing this game, its very unclear and it depends on you the most. There are numerious quests and events for you to do. Skyrim is vast, beautiful and dangerous, take your time to explore it. It certainly won't be wasted money, you'll have a lot of fun playing this game. Eventually if you find the game ""lacking"" you can always look for mods to enrich your game.Be sure to check out the Special Edition.Character creationWith each release Bethesda strives to improve their beloved Elder Scroll series in every extent. The character creation system has a lot of options once again and they really outdid themselves with the presentation of each of the races, they look very immersive and lore friendly. Next we have the attributes and skill system which is quite simplified in comparison to the previous release. Sadly, while this is not entirely negative, some might view it as so, because with the removal of attributes and merging of some skills they have limited the building of characters in a way. The removal of the class selection is one of the most disturbing, but its not all that important to your character build. Although it is one of the important features of RPG games. And finally the birthsigns, while they were never really cleverly balanced, I kind of appreciate their usage in Skyrim because of their ""weak"" impact. I also despise them because you can simply choose which one you want if you find it and afterwards you can always change it. I forgot to mention the skill perks that were first brought into Oblivion then altered in Fallout 3 and finally finetuned in Skyrim, a very good feature if I may say so, makes the game feel like it has more complexity. You're gonna have a lot of fun creating a character or its gonna be a pain, it depends. Take your time.Wilderness, landscape and habitatsThey put a lof of effort into this. The landscape is very breathtaking, immersive and worthwhile. Take your time and explore the great and vast lands of Skyrim. This is a very big plus, they really spent a lot of time on making the surroundings very detailed and immersive. Besides enjoying the game with its gameplay itself you're also presented with the option of absorbing the environment without actually indulging yourself in some pointless slaughter and you can have a companion who will from time to time say something interesting. I do not want to spoil too much of this either. The cities are very immersive and they look great, some of them look too similar, some too small , I guess this is something that they still need to improve. The dungeons and forts looks pretty good, they still lack a bit of morbidness and darkness though depending on the denizens. I think this is the greatest feature of Skyrim, please do take your time to absorb the environment.The creatures and humanoids and othersThe AI is dumbed down, at least that's my impression of it. I think the creatures behaviour is better than that of the NPC's. Once again they've added some creatures that will most likely rip you apart when you're low level and playing on adept or higher difficulty, a good example would be the saber cat. I'll be honest with you, I'm scared of that beast. Just like in Skyrim, in Oblivion it was the mountain lion or a Yao-Guai in Fallout 3. I'm glad that the trolls are still depicted as dangerous and annoying. The wildlife is very rich and quite immersive in this release ( disregarding the occasional random behaviour ). I like the presentation of most of the enemies, they all feel very lore friendly. The city folk are still a bit lacking in my opinion, but that's about it. Finally the dragons are a big disappointment. Not their looks or the animations and so on. It's that the combat is poorly designed for them. Not to mention that the dragons are very weak. Storywise well presented in general.Quests and EventsWhile some are immersive, some are very poorly designed. I think they made progress overall in comparison to the previous game. Some quests are really worth the time, but still a lot of them lack challenge. I think it's still worth to take the time and try them all out. I think the player is given too much freedom sometimes, which results in some events and quests looking a bit poor.ModsWhen trying to use mods, execute extreme caution, you might end up having to reinstall the game a lot of times before getting them all to work well. Feel free to ask me for any advice since I have years of experience with this. Luckily for us, we have a very solid modding community since the days of Morrowind. There will be plenty of amazing mods out there for you to choose from. While new players tend to stick to cosmetic mods and adding more ""stuff"" mods, there are plenty of quest mods that need to be given thought.MusicOnce again the music is composed by the legendary Jeremy Soule, his music enchanted the experience of the previous installments ( Oblivion and Morrowind ), including this one. I hope The Elder Scrolls will continue to be blessed with his music of epic proportions!While this review is long, I still could have written a lot more, but I don't want to include some spoilers. Looking forward for the next release. Still having fun playing this game. A big thanks to my friend who gave me the game, King Viking!Thanks for taking your time to read this.			"

												i've played skyrim since it first came out, way back when on the PS3. it was honestly the source of a lot of fun and was a common topic to talk about with friends. with that said, let's get started. Pros	 many alternate endings. you ultimately get to choose where your character goes, from the very beginning. no two characters will follow the same path open world. this may just be a personal perk for me, but open world games give off a sense of independence and freedom to the players. i like to be in control of where i go. many quest lines. there is of course a main quest line, but there are extra guilds you can join and random side quests. i have around 400+ hours on skyrim (including console) and i haven't completed all the quests. the humor. plenty of the characters within the realm of tamriel have humor we can all relate to. ♥♥♥♥ you j'zargo. the skill system is very organized and easy to figure out. plenty of mods to add to the game if you get bored of playing vanilla. Cons	 can get boring playing vanilla. i spent a great deal of time playing without mods, and now that i have played with mods there is no way i could play vanilla again.  as it is an ""older"" game, the graphics are of course not up to par. repetitive after awhile. after 400+ hours and many characters later, i find myself dreading that carriage to my death for a different reason. ancano is a ♥♥♥♥ Summary + Final Thoughts	overall, i believe skyrim is a good game. i've wasted my life on it, and so should you! this is the only game i have felt strongly enough about to spend time on a thorough review. i do however suggest getting the legendary edition that comes with all the dlc, building a house and spending hours on it is rewarding. happy skyriming!

												(Shady attempt at Mod monetisation aside) Skyrim has stood the test of time to become established as one of the greatest action RPG’s developed (and should most definitely win the Test of Time Steam Award), reaching such a pinnacle in part due to the superb modding community- that must be mentioned in conjunction with the vanilla games’ effort- elevating it into a true time killer even if you’ve put hundreds of hours into it- like I did- on console first.

It's a game for everyone: you could choose to be good or bad, to hack and slash or to shoot around with bow and arrow, the mages also get what they want. And the best of all: you are free to explore. There are almost no boundaries. Are you tired of the main quest? Then you just explore some dungeons and find great loot. It's a never-ending story plus when you start over you can try a different angle. Be another character, level some other skills. Play it completely different than what you always do and still have fun.			"

												Gameplay: 9/10The gameplay or combat is not perfect as the game can take a turn towards the easier side of things when you start leveling up but that can be easily countered by increasing the difficulty. AI are smart as difficulty goes up but it's good enough on normal difficulty for it to be fun. The skills system is extremely modular and can go which ever way you want making it the ultimate RPG game. There is an infinite number of quests that are randomly generated but the normal game content of quests is enough to keep you going for a few hundred hours. UI and menu and items from loot to smithing to alchemy are all well done and can be changed or improved on by mods.Graphics 8/10The base vanilla game has some pretty low textures in comparison to some next-gen games and the colour filter of the game is really grey and boring but can be changed yet again with the help of mods. With mods, the graphics get changed to 10/10, sometimes even competing with next-gen games and look even better.Audio/Music 10/10The voice acting in this game is superb even if you can hear the same voice actor over and over. All dialogue is voiced and most NPCs have interesting back stories or lines of dialogue. You won't start hearing dialogue appear over and over until you've played the game for a couple of hours but it doesn't at all take away from the immersion of the game. The music is fantastic and one of the best video game soundtracks I've heard. Jeremy Soule does an amazing job as usual creating a tone and setting for the world of Skyirm. The game sounds from the world are really well done. From the sounds of fire burning away at corpses to the cries of the wolves or bears. The ambience of travelling through the forests to the blowing winds of the snow peaked mountains to the ambience of dungeons and the soothing relaxing tone of the taverns, Skyrim makes no mistakes when it comes to immersing you into the game world through music and audio.Content/Replayability 10/10The amount of content this game has is far beyond any other game I've ever played. With only 2 large DLCs being Dawnguard and Dragonborn, it still manages to have content of which I've never seen before. This game's size in terms of content could match even that of large scale MMO titles and is not as repetitive as those games due to the fact you can play this game however you want. Skyrim is the game that'll define a genre of RPG games and Bethesda has not compromised much in terms of content in the game.Overall 9.5/10No game is ever perfect but The Elder Scrolls Skyrim comes close to being one of the best games over made in my opinion. The sheer amount of work put into this extremely immersive world is beyond that of any RPG I've ever played. Though after a few hundred hours, the vanilla game may feel dry to some gamers like myself but due to the fact that Skyrim houses hundreds and thousands of mods just makes the experienece even better.

												Skyrim... probably no-one will read this, but I like writing reviews, and I think that this game deserves a good one.     I have over 350 hours on this game. And, might I add, to the amazement of various friends none of whom have ever even completed the main storyline - despite having several hundred hours themselves - this was ALL ON ONE CHARACTER.     Words cannot express how much I love this game. The gameplay... the freedom... the constant Googling whilst I tried to figure out what to do and where to go to get the coolest stuff and why I keep dying...      Tell you what, though, you have to be DETERMINED. There comes a point where, if you're on PC, you HAVE to work out how to use the console. You can't help it. The game is GLITCHY. Most of it's harmless, most of the time you don't really notice or mind, but sometimes you come across a real whopper and you HAVE to use commands to fix it. For me, this was when I bought the legendary edition and downloaded the dlc, and Vampires started attacking towns - and they killed one of the characters in one the towns (Markarth, if anyone cares) who was vital to the MAIN STORYLINE FOR THAT TOWN. I tried to bring him back (easy enough) but the quest refused to start and then another quest in Markarth went wrong, and, in the end, I had to salvage what quests it would let me (using the console) complete, and abandon the rest. Normal NPCs dying is a problem too. They tend to run AT danger with bunched fists. Living in a town with no surviving shopkeepers is a pain. I resurrect anyone important.     Some quests are just broken. You'll come across them. You'll google them. You'll find forums full of information about their various glitches. Most of the time, it really doesn't matter. Half the glitches will pass you by, anyway.      The KEY THING is to quicksave, a LOT. And don't let those saves get on top of you, it can get confuing. I'm on save five thousand or so, and I try to save over most of my saves whenever I'm in particular dungeons, but it's useful to keep a few saves from various places you've been, so you can go back to as many points as possible. Saving before and after missions is a given, if it glitches out you won't be in trouble. And don't even get me STARTED on pickpocketing. Most of my backlog of undeleted saves are of the back of people's legs as I'm about to pickpocket them and don't want to get caught and lose all my stuff, or be branded a criminal (you murder someone in the wilderness where no-one can see you, and loot their body? No problem. You steal a cabbage by accident as you tried to press A to talk to someone - YOU WILL BE MURDERED BY THE CITY GUARD, OR GO TO JAIL FOREVER).       As to modding... I have tried various mods. Nothing that changes the game, no way, just simple stuff, like bug fixes (I didn't like the unnofficial patches, they seemed to create more problems than they solved, for me at least), enhanced graphics (sometimes the people in skyrim are just too UGLY), and a couple of house mods, so that I could have somewhere better to live (hearthfire is good because you can get hearthfire based mods that make the normal houses good - hearthfire itself is glitchy, and the manors more trouble than they're worth). Other mods are quite useful, it depends on what you want to do, but mod at your own risk, and always back up. You will almost certainly, at some point, feel the NEED to find some sort of mod to fix this, or improve that - and skyrim nexus makes it pretty easy.      Speaking of the dlc, it's worth getting, for sure. Dawnguard is excellent, and the better weapons that come with it are very nice, the best in the game. The storyline is also really cool, I like killing vampires (never could be bothered to BE a vampire, too high maintenance with the blood and whatnot). Dragonborn is awesome, I really like that you get to leave Skyrim and meet new people and find new types of dungeon and quests. Riding dragons is a waste of time, I don't know why they bothered (you can't control ANYTHING), but that's not what most of the dlc is about. The new types of armour and weapons would be nice earlier on in the game (I got the dlc late), so if and when I play again I'll go to Solstheim earlier and get some cool stuff. There are also some vary nice bonuses you can pick up from Solstheim, the Black Books and so on, and they allowed me to reach a bit of a Godlike status when it came to the sheer power of my weapons and armour. Hearthfire, I've already mentioned, is OK, and mostly it's good because the best housing mods are made with hearthfire stuff in them.      I'd certainly recommend the Legendary Edition, although I don't know what it's like from the beginning of the game (especially with the vampire attacks). I'd probably turn off some of the dlc until I was a high enough level to feel comfortable fending off vampires and cultists and whatnot.      The game is beautiful, the lore is awesome, the characters all voice acted beautifully (you get over the fact that there are only so many recurring voices fairly quickly, they're very NICE voices anyway, it's just a bit odd when your loving wife has the same voice as the evil sorceress you just murdered in her bed in a cave on the way home), and the levelling and gameplay are wonderful (mostly, apart from the grinding). By late game, you have to really focus on levelling some things up, if you want the best stuff, or to get to the endgame stuff (around level 80). I spent the last ten levels of that holding up my shield to a giant and letting him hit me again and again to level up blocking. But you can mostly avoid grinding, if you're not too bothered about       The only problem I have with the gameplay is magic. It seems like a waste of space to fight with, and potions are much easier to heal with than spells, which require the use of a hand whenever you want to use them. It also seems to me that, while when I use it magic is useless against the weakest enemies, it's extremely overpowered in the hands of enemy mages. Even at my level, with my insane damage and armour rating, a master pyromancer can MURDER me in seconds if I don't quickly equip some magic resistance or shoot him in the face before he can burn me alive. Magic is only useful sometimes, and I did the whole mage storyline with a greatsword and heavy armour, and I became the head of the magical college without using a single spell.       All that said, this game is an Experience. You can play it casually (mostly) or do what I did and play it obsessively and do everything and get everything even after nothing can possibly be better than what you already have. You can level up moderately and do the main and interesting questlines only, and the bossfights will be harder but still doable (I may have three hit the end boss, not my fault, I had it on a high difficulty). Being overpowered is fun, but even I used weapons which I hadn't levelled up on lower level enemies so that it would be more, well, not violent, well, a bit violent, but a bit harder, anyway. Other things to consider are the music (beautiful), the storylines (there are so many, and so varied, although of course there are a lot of randomly generated misc quests, and 'go fetch this, go kill him' quests but you can mostly ignore them after a while if you want), the graphics (very nice, so nice in fact that I can't play any of the older games for fear of trying to kill myself, or possibly just trying to paint on my screen to make them prettier), and, of course, the gameplay mechanics, which are the nicest I've ever played with, I especially LOVE first person. 11/10, and I MEAN it. Most of the games I've played are GOOD, but this is... something else. This review is long and will probably sit at the bottom of the review pile on steam forever, but I wanted to write something about, for all its flaws (a LOT of flaws, I'm afraid), one of the most amazing games I've ever played.

												(This review is a very long one. It actually is kind of an article between, a gameplay review, a ""role-playing"" guide, a mods compilation, and story of a character. If you are not intrested, I suggest you to pass it right away.)(Content is written all by me. Please do not distribute without permission.)The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, is undoubtedly one of the greatest PC games ever made, personally the single best RPG and open-world game I've seen. It is an unlimited digital source of pleasure for a lifetime FRP lover like myself. There really aren't many words to describe such perfection.First of all, best thing about Skyrim is the fact that, things you can do is literally endless. Content is literally endless. I am at around +2.000 hours of Skyrim gameplay (Also played it a lot before my Steam copy.), and everyday, I still keep discovering some totally new things. Vanillia game with DLC's, has at least over 2.000-2.500 hours of gameplay (Around 1.500 hours without any DLC's, maybe?), if you do nothing but quests. Endless number of mods you can apply, will make gameplay way, way longer. And again, this is only possible if you do nothing but quests; no sightseeing, fast traveling all the way, skipping lore, and forgetting about the identity of your character. Still, it's your choice to play Skyrim in the way you want.I have 3 characters, and I'll talk about one of them, whom I mainly play. (Vanillia content is more than enough to play 3 unique paths (except main storyline) for 3 seperate characters. You also can alter main storyline to a degree.). But first, I'd like to talk about mods which I actively use in all my characters (Plus, there are some particular ones for each character.)(No visual mods included.)- First of all, most indispensable mod for me, is probably the ""Disable Fast Travel"". I think that fast traveling absolutely ruins the game. I never fast traveled before (Neither in Skyrim, nor Oblivion. Morrowind didn't had it anyways. Damn, I love Morrowind.), never will, and I hate people who fast travels. Fast travel system is necessary as a result of overall demand to Skyrim, but when it's being used, that's half of the games beauty gone. Some people play it just for the other half anyways.- I very much like the ""iNeed"" mod, which adds a streamlined approach to needs. You need to eat, drink, and sleep once in a while, for full effectiveness of your character. It has some nice details, like for example, you can carry a flask, drink your water from it when you are thirsty, and fill it from any water source when depleted (Even from rain!).- Static Mesh Improvement, an amazing mod which replaces some plain textures with idea of adding a feel of third dimension, with actual 3D meshes. It adds a whole new level to details all around Tamriel.- SkyUI, a must-have interface overhaul- Cloaks of Skyrim- SkyrimSpeeds, speed adjustments- Improved Dragon Shouts- Command Dragon, for manual control- Alternative Crafting System, helps role-playing without abandoning your gear potential- ImmersiveFP, for first-person dragon & horse riding- A quality world map with all roads- Touring Carriages- FNIS, custom animations engine- And, Falskaar! It's an amazing mod, which adds a new quest line, a huge new map, and a very solid lore. Very professionally done, almost like an official DLC.The character I want to talk about, is my female dragonborn assassin, last member of the Dark Brotherhood, and guildmaster of Thieves Guild. She's the character that I played the most, although she's not the character I first created, or beat the main storyline. I beat the main storyline with my mage for the first time, and I wanted continue as an assassin, created her. After completing the Unbound quest (Which is the very first quest.), I literally quit the main storyline, and completed The Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild storylines (Yea, you can do that. You literally can complete almost every side quest in Tamriel without touching the main story.). By the time I return to the main storyline, I already was a master assassin, (Skyrim has an NPC progress system; it doesn't let you level up more than usual before story, and one-shot every NPC. You'll still have an adventage tho.), so I progressed through it at ease (Except the dragon parts, where I needed to go head-on.), and I completed it, as she completed her personality. She's not a type of assassin without honour, she's not like killing random people just for money/fun, or she's not using her dragonborn powers for personal gain (Spidey-philosophy), instead, she actually delivers justice, and avenges the downtrodden. She's more like Batman, The Dark Knight, except the killing part. And all that Thieves Guild, 'stealing' part, is also like the phiolosophy of Robin Hood, or at least the Cat Woman. In the end, she's a very righteous character, in her own way.I completed a billion small quests, and some big ones like Civil War and The Companions storyline (Actually, all the big ones as far as I know.), and married with Aela (Yep, Aela is a female. Yep, I'm a female. Yep.) before heading to Dawnguard DLC. I've completed Dawnguard as a vampire. I got cured afterwards, but I'm still not sure about being a vampire, since it actually fits the concept of her being a master assassin hiding in shadows, but there are too many downsides; I won't ever be using the Vampire Lord form, since it's totally irellevant with my character, and I don't like its benefits/aesthetics anyways. After that, Dragonborn came out, and I also finished it, which actually fits perfectly to her personality, since the purpose is (kind of) assassinating a corrupt leader as the only assassin (because of being a dragonborn) who can do it, and became a complete Dragonborn. Since then, I'm traveling short distances with Shadowmere, and long distances on a dragon (Not dragon fast-travelling, I'm navigating manually.).I do some unusual things in my spare time in Skyrim, which many can find weird, but I enjoy a lot. For example, I have some favorite places (Which I won't be sharing. Be assured, finding your own places would be much more satisfying.), I sometimes toggle off the running mode, and randomly walk at these places again and again, for hours, never getting bored. I also find books in Skyrim very exciting (There are countless in-game books which you can read. Each one of them are written exclusively, with its unique content.), I have a great intrest in collecting and reading them, and I actually find some of them way more intriguing than many 'popular' real books. Some of which I can recommend: Rising Threat (4 volumes), The Wolf Queen (8 volumes), Kolb and the Dragon (That's probably my favorite book in the game. Not in terms of its story, but it is actually a ""choose-your-own-adventure"" type of book.), The Black Arrow (2 volumes), A Dance in Fire (7 volumes). As a side note, in my honest opinion, books in Oblivion were better...Before finishing, here are some mods that I use especially for my assassin:- The Dance of Death, a kill-move mod- Higher Jump- Martial Arts- Realistic Crime Radius- Throwing Weapons Redux- Faction Crossbows- Stealth ImmersionAnd, I suppose, that's all.In terms of characters, as you can see, making a character totally unique is pretty simple, it's just a matter of will. Skyrim, or any game for that matter, can only provide you the visualization and tools of role-playing; you have to use your imagination for an advanced FRP experience. And in terms of gaming perspective, you now should have an idea about how I feel about Skyrim, and you probably figured out how different you can approach to the game.In the end, conclusion is actually pretty short, and simple: Skyrim is a must, must, must, MUST have game, and a masterpiece to experience, just like a Mozart concerto, a Shakespeare play, or a trip to one of 7 Great Wonders of the World.

												Perhaps my favorite game of all time, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is without a doubt one of the greatest games of all time. There is enough content to keep you busy for hundreds of hours, but it never feels like you have so much to do that you are overwhelmed. The graphics, the artwork, and the scenery are simply breath taking. I will always remember my first time standing on top of a mountain, taking in the view as I tried to decide what quest I was going to tackle next. There is just not enough words to describe seeing these things for the first time, and with mods you can make the game look even more amazing. There are also mods for quests, items, weapons, spells, player homes, the list goes on forever. They just make the game that much better, and add thousands upon thousands of hours worth of things to do. But the thing that I enjoy about The Elder Scrolls series the most is it's lore, there is just so much you can learn by playing, or reading one of the many books that the game has to offer. If you are into role playing, or making a story for your character then you will really enjoy Skyrim just for that alone. The game also has three official expansions, and all of them are a must have in my opinion. they add countless hours worth of content, but more importantly they are my favorite to play among the base game content. I Could not rate this game anything lower than a 10/10 simply because it is just that damn awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												Before I played Skyrim, I also played Morrowind and Oblivion as they came out. Both solid games, so I had built an idea of what the next one was going to be like. When this game came out though, it literally blew away all my expectations.I don't think there's a single thing wrong with this game, to be honest. It's one of those games that have hardly any flaws, if any at all, and stand the test of time for years to come. There's practically nothing you can't do and nowhere you can't go in this game and I think that's one of the biggest points in this game for me. From stealing a horse from a stable to being infected by vampires to slaying dragons to slaughtering guards in a hold just for the sheer hell of it, this game instantly became one of my favorites due to just the flexibility of player choice.The first thing that comes to mind when I think of V is probably the mod support. There's anything from adding weapons to the game, equipment, different stories, painstakingly created new worlds, new faces and hair, and some mods that just add natural things to the game to make it feel more realistic like food and water needs and Chesko's Frostfall.Initially I bought the game from a Wal-Mart so I can't obtain card drops.TL;DR:Story: 10/10.Gameplay: 9/10.Visuals: 9/10.Voice-Acting: 9/10.Microtransactions=False.Workshop Mods: 7/10.Nexus Mods: 10/10.Mods Overall: 8.5/10Overall: 9.1/10 "

												Skyrim. The seemingly all-time-classic of western RPGs. The game nails its atmosphere with a stellar ambiental soundtrack. The world map is absolutely stunning and there is descent variety in dungeon tilesets as well. It is impressive how you can find a new quest around every corner.The core gameplay loop of traversing the overworld broken up by basic dungeon crawling feels good and works well enough.But the game really lacks variation. Each and every quest, while trying to come up with varied stories, can be broken down to ""go there, enter dungeon, kill dudes, come back"". This causes most of the experience to blend together and lack any really impactful moments.While the environment feels carefully handcrafted, the quests come off as cookie cutter and simplistic. The wooden animations of the NPCs - even during the main quest, don't help. There certainly is fun to be had, but what's on offer here is quantity, not quality.			"

												The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, or simply Skyrim, is simply too wonderfully amazing to be described in words. Bethesda went above and beyond what game developers nowadays (aka 2015) would promise :^ . One thing I found interesting was how Bethesda gives you a large, open world to ride around in and discover (that feeling you get when you discovered some place no one knows about is simply awesome) :O, where you never know what might happen next- a dragon could attack you, a pack of wolves could spring out and ambush you, a courier could run up to you with a message- anything could happen, at any time. Another thing that I loved was how the game made me feel. Their manipulation of your feelings, as a matter of fact, nearly made me fear the dark! The soundtrack is simply amazing- every time I throw myself into battle, I can literally feel my heart pounding and my palms sweating as I charge forward, hoping to halve my enemies with my big awesome battleaxe. And finally, you get to choose what you do, and how- you could be a sophisticated magician, a bloodthirsty warrior (like me), a mysterious necromancer, and so on. It's amazing. As I said before, Skyrim is too awesome to be described in words. If you want to know how utterly amazing the game is, buy a copy and play it. You won't regret it. Ever.FOOS ROH DAAA!			"

												TL;DR at the end.I first played Skyrim at its initiall release in 2011, and after many years I feel I am finally ready to write this review. What I can conclude from my many hours of play is that Skyrim is much more than meets the eye. The game's main quest can be terminated or disregard at the libertine's choice after the first stage of the quest is finished. NPCs may allocate the player additional side-solicitation, and some side-expedition have parameters adjusted supported on nearby dungeons which the player has yet to explore. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing game, playable from either a first- or third-parson perspective. The plan is determine two hundred years after the events of Oblivion and takes office in the fictional province of Skyrim. Should the gambler be stopped by a guard, they may wipe their bounty with gold or jail time, or may resist detain which will trigger an aggressive pursuit. Stamina determines the gamester's effectiveness in combat and is depleted by sprinting, performing heavy ""power attacks"", and being struck by frost-based attacks. The player may choose to join factions, which are organic groups of NPCs—for example, the Dark Brotherhood, a band of assassins. Skyrim retain the open earth folklore of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any era, and to sink or procrastinate the main-hamper storyline indefinitely. Skyrim was acquit to critical shout, with reviewers particularly mentioning the independence development and setting, and is considered to be one of the top video games of all era. Each delay their character levels, the players may choose to select a expertness-specific address exhort a perk, or accumulation perk stage for latter use. The player may readily roam over the deposit of Skyrim, which is an open earth environment consisting of waste expanses, dungeons, cities, towns, fortresses and villages. Players may sail the Olympic world more rapidly by riding horses, or by utilizing a fast-travel system which assign them to warp to previously detect locations. The lame was developed using the Creation Engine, rebuilt specifically for the game. The brood opted for a unique and more diverse Pancratium world than Oblivion's Cyrodiil, which crooked director and executive maker Todd Howard considered less interesting by comparison. Non-player independence (NPCs) populate the world and can be engage with in a number of ways; the idler may bespeak them in conversation, match an eligible NPC, kill them, or retain in a nonlethal ""brawl"". As in previous The Elder Scrolls crooked, killing certain NPCs can make some quests or term unobtainable. Some NPCs cannot be quell. If witnessed, crimes like murder and theft accrue the player a bounty, which is vestige independently in each of Skyrim's nine holds. Skyrim's capital story roll around the player describe and their stimulate to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the circle. The game pay over seven million copies to retailers within the first neptad of its quit, and has sold over 30 million copies across all five platforms. Some NPCs who are favor or hired by the player may deed as coadjutor who will accompany the libertine and foresee aid in oppose. Each of the factions has an combined quest path to progress through. Each burg and town in the Pancratium world has jobs that the player can engage in, such as agriculture. Players have the option to uncover their character. At the prelude of the game, players create their character by selecting their sex and choosing between one of several family, terminate humans, orcs, elves and anthropomorphic cat or lizard-like creatures, and then taylor-make their character's manner. Over the course of the Olympic, players improve their character's reason, which are numerical representations of their address in certain areas. There are eighteen adroitness divided evenly among the three college of resent, magic, and stealth. When gambler have drag reason enough to meet the demand exercise, their handwriting horizontal up. Over the manner of the game, the libertine completes search and evolve the character by improving reason. Earlier entries in The Elder Scrolls series used a character set system to limit which reason would contribute to the resolution's leveling, but Skyrim allows players to tell preferred art as they play the project and rewards them with more share when a frequently used aptitude is leveled. A headdress-up expand (HUD) appears when any of the player's three might attributes (health, magicka, and strength) are being depleted. Attributes reproduced over season, although this process can be accelerated by second-hand potions or regenerative spells. Magicka is depleted by the use of spells, undoubting vitiate, and by being struck by lightning-based assault. Health is depleted primarily when the player takes impair, and the privation of all sanity terminate in gangrene. However, some quests found on the might storyline being at least partially completed. The idler's inventory can be accessed from the menu and items can be survey in 3D, which may prove essential in explanation puzzles found in dungeons.TL;DR: The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as “the greatest or most significant or most influential” rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art.

												It's better than Morrowind. It does what Oblivion should have done. It's a great single player RPG. There's so much to do in this game and it just doesn't get boring. You need to play this game if you like RPGs at all. I know that almost everybody did already, but I'll still post it here. Get and play this game if you ever cared to play a game for the stor(y/ies) it has to offer.			"

												Skyrim? Yeah I played Skyrim. Picked it up when it launched on the Xbox 360 in fact. I must've put about 30 hours into it before deciding that I've seen it all.Let me break it down a bit. When I played Skyrim I did the following: I left my house, found a dungeon, grabbed the loot, sold it to the same handful of merchants (including my husband), and...that was it. Morrowind was surreal, wonderful, and just obtuse enough to be charming. With Skyrim, I felt like some cog in a Dwemer machine, trapped in an endless cycle of middling upgrades and a total lack of surprising events. I mean, for crying out loud, more dragons?! These jerks are worse than cliff racers. At the time I figured that I might as well play an MMO, at least then I could get some rare drops.So what happened? What's so different about the PC version that I would put 700+ hours into it?Do you really have to ask?Modding Skyrim is the equivalent of Alice in Wonderland. You don't get to walk up to the rabbit hole and peer over the edge. You certainly can't climb down, take what catches your interest, and climb out. No, you will fall in that hole. The only light you'll be seeing is through the dozens of mods that make up your sunny days in Skyrim. In the beginning you might pick through the mods available on the Steam workshop. A weapon here, a new set of armor, something that makes cows explode or sends people flying into space, you get the idea. But then you look at what other people are doing with their Skyrim. They've got the 4K textures, the dramatic ENBs, the glamour models with their noses just right. Now you may be thinking that you don't need all that garbage, and you probably don't.But you do.Next thing you know you're on the Nexus. It's been 10 hours and you haven't even started the game yet. Stability is the last word I'd associate with Elder Scrolls, and that's without piling on the mods. Getting your modded game to function is more engrossing than Skyrim itself. You've started the game, you're wandering around, and then...Crash To Desktop. What caused it? How do you fix it? Is there a way around it? Are you going to lose your saves? After a long enough period of time you eventually stop caring. My Skyrim is held together by old tape and chewing gum, and that's fine.Eventually you learn to stop caring about those precious game-saves. I'm going to spoil Skyrim: You are the most awesome. Everything you do is right and nobody dares to question you. Nobody will even do anything unless you're somehow involved. Sometimes being the most awesome is fun. It's escapism at its purest. A lot of other videogames tend to punish you with death. At worst, Skyrim inconveniences you. This game doesn't say ""YOU DIED."" or ""HEY POOR PLAYER!"" It just assumes you goofed up somewhere and loads your last save. There's something to be said about player-imposed difficulty, but it's hard work trying to be the least awesome. There's a phrase I like to throw around when discussing videogames: ""Making the game yours.""Usually this refers to playing games in a particular way, like a knife-only run in Resident Evil, or beating Megaman without any power-ups. It's not always about player-imposed difficulty either, it can be about creating an identity through playing. I remember reading about a Morrowind player who spent all of their time in the Ashlands. They'd camp out in a Chitin hut and hunt whatever beasts they happened to find. They made just enough from selling the carcasses to eke out a miserable existence while dealing with the constant ash storms. This doesn't sound appealing, but I have to respect the hustle. That person totally owns their game of Morrowind.When all of the rumors are true, and the player is always the most awesome, there's not a lot one can do to create their identity. This is especially apparent when every single guard you pass mentions something you could be doing (or have already done). Your alteration level could be so low that it couldn't levitate an earthworm, but that won't stop you from becoming an Archmage not long after stepping foot in the Winterhold College. I remember when being an Archmage was such hot ♥♥♥♥ in The Bard's Tale, now it's just a title any Dragonbum can get. When everything in a game takes zero effort and the results are meaningless, why not just make the game in your image through modding? If anything this will lead to new challenges, more possibilities, and *gasp* unpredictability. When I play Skyrim, I play with the intent to fill it with as much crap as I can find, see if/when/how it breaks, and attempt to undo the damage with minimal losses. It's disturbingly compelling, and that's without discussing the mods themselves. I don't settle for being the most awesome, I want to become omnipotent. Only after I've constructed this world, filled it with all of the neatest toys, and prettied it up as much as my mediocre videocard will allow, do I actually play it. At this point I'm fine with being the most awesome, because I feel like I earned that right. This is the time I put some Genesis on, and zone out while exploring, decapitating, and working on that perpetually imperfect nose. Perhaps my comparison to Alice in Wonderland is a bit off. The way I remember it, Alice falls in the hole and arrives in Wonderland. With modded Skyrim; Wonderland is a neverending hole. Inevitably you'll get bored of tearing your game to pieces and putting it back together. You want to see where your curiousity will take you. You might go digging through hundreds of foreign websites to find that anime fighting-style, or ten gigabtyes of hair-styles. You could even find yourself in a lab. What it all comes down to is that Skyrim is what you make of it. The game is fine on its own. It's certainly not lacking for content, and even without thousands of visual-enhancing mods it looks decent. However, Skyrim becomes so much more simply through the act of modding. To me, this is the ultimate sandbox game, and will likely only be bested by Bethesda's next single-player RPG.			"

												Let me get this straight, you want me to tell you a review about this game? Whoever you are, you might as well go to the curators, because if you've come for a review on this game, you've come to the wrong place. However, if you have come for an outstanding chocolate chip cookie recipe, you've come to the right place.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ingredients1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar3/4 cup sugar2 large eggs1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract1 (12-ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, or chunks2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour3/4 teaspoon baking soda1 teaspoon fine saltDirections1. Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.For a Rocky Road Bar:1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.) Cool, cut and serve.			"

												For the people who:1) Want DEPTH - A huge story behind every SINGLE quest.2) Think the NPCs are 'garbage' because they don't react the way the 'should' when the Dragonborn does THIS or THAT.3) Look for amazing & different ways of combat in order to kill your enemies.4) Think it's too ""repetitieve, shallow, bland dungeon crawler.""5) Want to add THOUSANDS of mods, not reading how to install them & then complain the game is trash because it CRASHES.This game is NOT for you.I enjoy this game very much & I think it's a REALLY GOOD game. It all depends on what kind of games you like & if you're too picky. Sure, this game is not perfect & has bugs, glitches, etc. But I'd like to see YOU developing a game like this or even BETTER. I'm sure people who don't have HIGH expectations will love the game as much as I do. Take your TIME exploring the places, doing the quests. Just add some mods if you need more action, be careful they don't conflict with each other & you're ready to go! (: 8/10			"

												I got in a fistfight with a bear and won. 10/10.Okay, now seriously. The best thing about playing Skyrim is the feeling of freedom. You can create any character you want, play any style you like and change it anytime, since you’re not restricted by choosing one class, go anywhere you want (straight up a mountain wall too) and do almost anything you want (leave chickens alone though, better go pickpocket a ghost). Skyrim offers big open world with countless quests and places to visit – from a small shrine not even marked on a map, through bandit camps and caves to massive ancient ruins. The graphics is not as breathtaking as it was the year it was published, but it still has it’s charms. Soundtrack, in turn, haven’t aged at all. Music composed by Jeremy Soule is just marvelous.  Also, mods. The absolute freedom, limited only by the power of your computer. With them you truly can achieve anything you want from your game, whether it is changing things you don’t like, adding new content or striving for insanely realistic HD graphics. Or just, you know, changing the dragons into trains.Overall, Skyrim is highly addictive and easily one of my favourite games of all time. Yes, some game mechanics are ridiculous. Yes, there are bugs and glitches. Yes, some things are just plainly stupid. No, it doesn't make the game any less enjoyable and memorable experience.To put simply, it’s a masterpiece. 10/10 without any hesitation.800 hours of gameplay when writing review. "

												There's nothing much to say about the game that too many people wouldn't know, especially now that it's so old and it even won the Test of Time award on Steam, is there?Skyrim is a singleplayer open world game that is presented in a world that could probably corespond to earth's middle ages time in Europe. Of course, by that, I am not saying it is an exact copy of history of mankind, considering there is magic and enemies like dragons and undead. But without those things, what would the game be about? All the fantasy stuff added to the game really makes it shine.To avoid potential spoilers here, I'll do my best to describe the game in a way that won't reveal something about the story.After the intro of the game, you'll be able to customize your character, every single detail on your face and your body size and such. You can also pick a race, whether you want to be the Nord, whose home Skyrim is, Elf, or many more.Every race gives you different buffs that your character will always have.Nords, for example, gain permanent 50% frost damage resistance, and can use battle cry once per a day, which is a shout that makes everyone surrender to you, attempting to run for a specific amount of time, even though being only usable once per a day, it still is very overpowered for starter players and literally useless for players that are high level of the game, as everytime you level up, most of your enemies will level up too, making them tougher as well as you. High level enemies cannot be revived as your servant, scared away or anything, even if your character level was 99 and over (yes, I know you can exploit some spells to get level 600 within 2 hours or so).You level up by improving specific skills mostly throughout battles, but also by alchemy, stealing, forging and so on.There are 21 skill trees divided into 3 sections, warrior gameplay (forging, light armor, one-handed skills...), mage (damage spells, restoration spells, alchemy...) and rogue gameplay (pickpocket, archery, sneaking...). Each skill tree has a minimum level of 15 and maximum of 100. You start the game with all skill trees set from level 15 to level 25, based on a race you picked.You level the skill trees up throughout your actions (fighting with one handed to raise your one handed level, pickpocketing in order to raise your pickpocket level and so on). Every level up, you gain 1 skill point that you can use on any skill tree you wish. You must have specific level on the skill tree to unlock certain abilities you could spend those skill points on. Skill trees have skills ranging from the ones available no matter what level you are or what race you chose (commonly the first skill you can get on a skill tree is improving the effectivity of set skill by 20%) to top tier skills only possible to get when your skill is level 100 (being able to forge armor out of dragon bones, for example).You also have 3 base stat pools, health pool, mana pool and stamina pool. You start with all of them having value of 100, but you can add a value of 10 to one of them every level up. If you increase the value of your stamina, you also increase your carrying weight by 5 points (initial carry weight is 300 points). Health pool is health pool, when it goes empty, you die. Mana pool is used for casting spells, ranging from healing yourself and burning your enemies, to summoning 2 powerful allies to fight by your side. Mana pool recovers over time. Stamina pool also recovers over time, but is used to allow your character to sprint faster and unleash more powerful melee attacks for a part of your stamina.Skyrim offers a really large map to travel through, having 9 provinces total. Each one containing one major city and a lot of environment around it, several villages, caverns, redoubts, bandit camps, hidden treasures... That's what kept me playing the game for over 750 hours.The game has over 500 quests, while many of them are being contributive to influencing the whole Skyrim on your own (join one of the 2 large armies trying to conquer Skyrim and lead them to victory, be a known valiant warrior between the guards of every province...)There's a lot more details about the skyrim world, artifacts, quests and all the stuff I'd like to talk about, but I really don't think anyone would have enough patience to read a review that'd take 10 hours to write.Graphics are beautiful and it's actually pretty easy to run the game even on a low-end tier machines. Try looking on the Skyrim community hub sometimes, you'll likely see some recent screenshot with possibly over 1000 likes, showing the beauty of the game. Probably the night sky or some forest screenshot.For users that already have a bit of experience with the game, there also is a workshop for modding the game, allowing you to change character skins, tweak the graphics of the game even further, minor or major changes to gameplay to make it better... Some of the mods are really nice, I'd reccomend anyone who's spent at least 25 hours in the game to check around the workshop.There also are 3 DLCs, Dragonborn, Hearthfire and Dawnguard. They add some nice things to the game, but compared to the price of the main game now, which even seems a to be underpriced to me, the DLCs are overpriced, considering the fact even the bigger one of the three, Dragonborn, has its main questline glitched.Now I would like to move on to one thing that is pretty much the only big con I can find about the game. Bugs, bugs, exploits, glitches and a lot more bugs. I'm going to leave the most hilarious and annoying ones I experienced on my own here:- On low graphics, you cannot see anything underwater, making it impossible to get through a specific main side quest line.- Several quests, even the main sidequests can get you stuck at one point. I'd really reccomend getting around with the console- Final boss of the main quest in Dragonborn DLC is literally unpassable without using console if you're unlucky enough, the boss would just disappear or become permanently invincible. You won't be able to loot his corpse though, making you unable to get that sweet stuff he had off him, and if you try using console to give yourself the items, it usually glitches out and gives you an item with DIFFERENT stats than it should have had- You can use a bucket to fall through the map's ground- You can make your horse fly while riding it- You can use several exploits (such as backstabbing specific someone, using specific spells...) to level yourself up unfairly fast- In the main quest line, you can screw up one thing, though it'll be your own fault and reloading at the last save will fix it unless you exit the specific area and got all the saves from before firstly entering it gone (SPOILER)  Capture dragon called Odaahviing, and while he seems totally harmless, try attacking him 3 times and then freeing him from his trap, he'll attack and there will be no way to appease him, making you unable to proceed in a quest and kill the game's main villain	- There also is an exploit how to get infinite money or infinite armor rating if you have enough resources, but I am not going to share how to do that.Summary of pros and cons:Pros:- Fairly cheap game, not to mention it can even get in a large discount- Won the Test of time award on steam- Easy to run, no need for a high tier machine, even though the graphics are greater than of a lot of today's games, even if Skyrim is over 5 year old game as of time writing the review.- Large open world- Perfectly adjustable settings of audio, gameplay and graphics- Won't get boring for at least 100 hours for anyone, considering all the unique quests and ways to play the game- 3 DLCs- Has its own Steam workshop- Dozens of more minor pros that would take a while to write downCons:- Endless amount of bugs, exploits, glitches everywhere- 2 of the DLCs cost more than the game, but add less content- Lack of voice actors			"

												As far as open-world games go, this is probably one of my favorites. Which isn't really saying much because I'm casual as frick and haven't played many open-world games, but WHATEVERI dig the soundtrack, I dig the world, I dig the lore, I dig the characters. I dig being able to create pretty much any character I want, even if I eventually wander back onto the path of the Sneak Archer. I love completing dungeons, I love learning words of power, I love looting the crap out of everything, I love collecting hundreds of bottles of booze and stashing it all away in the cabinet in Honeyside. As much as I love this game, it does have its faults. The combat can be clunky at times. Some dungeons feel repetitive. (oh boy, more draugar.) The physics engine is hilariously buggy, though this can be a definite plus if you enjoy watching inanimate objects get flung across the map if you breathe on them wrong. The main questline feels somewhat bland at times, though it's a good incentive to branch out and do the more interesting sidequests. Some of the character interactions are awkward. I forget the name of the argonian guy in the Bee and Barb, but I helped him craft a wedding ring and then I extorted his lover as part of the Thieves Guild questline. Now whenever I talk to him, he tells me how much he loves me and then promptly tells me to walk off a bridge because I suck. Also vanilla Skyrim won't let me marry Faendal, even though he has been my best bro since Riverwood. Oh well, I guess that's what mods are for.Additional points of interest: mods can really help you tailor this game to specifically meet your wants and needs. Also if you suffer from first-person-games-make-me-want-to-vomit-because-I-am-sensitive-as-hell-to-this-kind-of-stuff syndrome like I do, then rejoice! This game can be played in third person for an experience that is much friendlier to your stomach.Overall, this game is freaking gorgeous and I love it. It's not perfect, but if you love to explore, this game is right for you.			"

												Games of The Elder Scrolls series have some very clear expectations to them and must adhere to some very specific core concepts, Skyrim does not tarry too far from the mark.This game has many weaknesses that almost universally stem from it's multiplatform development - cities feel like villages and villages don't feel at all, this is entirely because of the limitations of the engine and the consoles.  Weapons and armour are one size fits all and all armours of the same material are identical, there is no wear and tear of your items...  Money from a thousand years ago does not draw comment when given to a vendor.  You have no useful journal system, instead the map tells you exactly where to go for everything.  Many things that disrupt the immersion within the game.Play this game once on a vanilla play through and then add in the mods, the base game is good, and it will help you appreciate the platform you are playing on a thousand times over when you play a second game using mods.You will mod this title, you will mod it to hell and back.  You will love it for the mods that shore up the weaknesses and enable new and wonderful things in the game.  Steam Workshop integration sounds nice, but it's not, the game's mod interface is garbage and the Workshop prevents a lot of the mods you will want.  You will end up using Nexus Mods and their Nexus Mod Manager or the Slipstream Mod Manager to handle all your mods.  There are mods to patch problems, to reenable content, replace bad textures, enhance combat, add items, add NPCs...  Whatever your heart may desire, the mods are there.The game is good, genuinely good, but it could have been so much better.  One hopes that Fallout 4 learns the lessons presented by the mods of Skyrim, rather than dooming modders to recreating their efforts in the next version of the engine.Any gamer worth their salt has already got this game and has played at least some of it.

												Do You really need reading a review before buying Skyrim? No? Ha! As I expected!Skyrim = Freedom x Game^2You basically buying Your own World. It's virtual, yes... But it has Dragons in it!I have to question You again Dovahkiin: Does our World have Dragons? No? As I expected!*Sigh* And that's a review of game? - You would ask - Not a single word about graphics, sound, gameplay, AI, design, RPG-component?But why? I have a word for all of it - Absolute measure on which equals every developer of top notch RPG.That was more then one word ^_^Hush! I meant to say Dragons!But with all seriousness - there are more than 100000+ serious reviews talking about graphics, sound, gameplay, etc. Isn't it enough? Yes? I'm sure hope so....So what are You waiting for Dovahkiin? Your path is thorny and Your future is unclear. But at the end You'll go down in history!With the release of Remastered Edition (Special Edition) I no longer need a proof that this Game has a strong claim to be called Timeless.And that's why I nominate this Game on The ""Test of Time"" AwardWish You and Yours all the best!

												Well, after 120 hours of gameplay it's time for me to write a review of this game: what should I start with? There's so much stuff in this  game! Skyrim is full of things to do, dungeon to explore, quests, ways to play, classes and weapons!There'sa lot you can do and you will always end up doing something and forget to do something else. Epic battles, addictive gameplay, good storyline and a big free roam world to explore!I recommend a lot this game if you want an RPG which mixes exploration, battles and much more stuff.Unfortunately, there are some problems: for a game of such largeness there are lots of bugs. Not so bad, they won't ruin the gameplay, but sometimes they are  really annoying.My own vote: 8,5/10			"

												Disclaimer: Before I purchased this on Steam in October 2015, I had 1,456 hours put into the Xbox 360 version, and 68 hours in the PS3 version, so hopefully that puts my low PC game-time in perspective. Since the review, I have added almost 200 hours to the Remastered version for the PS4.The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is one of my favorite games of all time. I was excited for the release back on 11/11/11, as I am a fan of all of The Elder Scrolls titles. The previews of Skyrim were beautiful, and though the game world was obviously smaller than some of its predecessors (Arena and Daggerfall in particular), the game would still prove to be larger than most modern games of its type. Skyrim was the first game I pre-ordered in over three years at the time of its release. My expectations were sky high, and yet the game surpassed them. I spent 101 hours in the game in its first week. Very few games can pull me in so mercilessly, and I play hundreds of them.This intro brings me to the subject of why Skyrim deserves your time, if you're not already one of the millions of people who own it. Skyrim is an open world action RPG that does not control how you play it, throwing hundreds of possibilities at you in terms of how you level, explore, complete questlines, et cetera. The world is packed full of content and secrets, to where I am close to having lived in this world for 2,000 hours of my life and am still discovering new things from time to time. You can choose a character from a variety of races with their own perks and abilities, and the character creation system is quite impressive. From there, you complete an introductory quest, and are set free to explore the world as you wish. You can choose to rush through the main questline, or you can spend hundreds of hours ignoring it. There are multiple full questlines for you to choose from. You can choose to complete them all with one character, or choose only a few depending on how you are building your character (an assassin build may choose to utilize the Thieves' Guild and Dark Brotherhood questlines and ignore the Companions and Mages' College questlines, for example). In addition, there are hundreds of side quests and objectives that can be picked up from conversations with NPCs, reading books that speak of legends that you can actually go out into the world and explore for yourself, or even walking through the right place at the right time. Completing quests can sometimes yield you new quests, even if not right away (completing some quests will cause the quest giver to write you a letter later, for example, updating you on events and asking you to return, even weeks after you finished the first objective).The world is lush with detail. NPCs will change their opinion of you due to things you've done, and some will even like/hate you depending on your race or who you've decided to align with on quests. Some will also agree to come on your adventures with you--permanently (or until death...which, I suppose, is still permanently). They will fight by your side and utilize anything that you give them, from armor to weapons to potions, so you can have a two person team at all times if you wish. Bards will sing tales of quests you've completed, if applicable, and people will hire thugs or even the Dark Brotherhood to hunt you down if you've somehow wronged them (including stealing from their homes or shops). Small details are in the world, from a burned down house with a corpse that has a fire scroll in its inventory, to two skeletons on a freezing shoreline, with one of the skeletons stuck in a bear trap. Hundreds of books are scattered throughout the world to give you insight into some of the lore of the world. Characters from past Elder Scrolls games are mentioned in conversations or journals/notes from time to time, giving a welcome nod to your adventures of the past if you've played previous games.Skyrim is one of the few games that rises above a ""game"" for me and almost becomes like a second life. Its level of rich detail and ability to completely immerse can make players hold grudges, make friends, and even work and make an honest living in-game, while going home to your family every once in a while (in a home that you built, if you have the Hearthfire expansion, which I highly recommend). If a companion dies, you can go to her/his hometown and visit the tomb, if you so wish. This is also one of the few games that is so much fun to go through while choosing to play it unconventionally (for example, I've done playthroughs where I've refused to directly kill anyone, using only defensive magics and conjuration spells and having a companion, and playthroughs where I refuse to use fast travel). I've heard that mods are great for the game, though I don't personally care for mods and play the game in its vanilla state.To address criticisms of the game, Skyrim is not and will never be its predecessors. Its world is just that--Skyrim--and will not have the majestical fantasy landscapes of Morrowind. Magic is quite simplified as compared to Oblivion, and the leveling system is not quite as exploitative as the fourth game in the series, either. You can become overpowered in the game, and you can end up having so much money in your coffers that it's ridiculous. I love the other games in the series, but I love each one for its uniqueness. Skyrim happens to be my favorite of them all, quite possibly because of its ability to feel so personal, like you're truly in this world and truly making friends and a difference. So while it is a bit ""modernized"" compared to the previous games, the world is so vast and there is always so much to do that it never quite feels like a video game; it feels like an entire world to escape to.Skyrim is so vast and wonderful that it is impossible to do it justice in such a review. I could go on listing this game's strengths and end up having a novel on my hands. I recommend this game more than I recommend most, and is one of the few I can legitimately give a 10/10 to, even considering its minor flaws. Do yourself a favor and pick it up if you haven't tried it yet; chances are that you will enjoy it immensely.			"

												Žaidimas paverges mane nuo 2002m, tais metais pasaulį išvydęs Morrowind prikaustė mane prie ekrano daugybę valandų. Tai žaidimas kuris pakeitė mano požiūrį apie RPG žandrą, žaidimas dėl kurio pamilau RPG žandrą. Sekančioji dalis Oblivion buvo stulbinanti kokia tikėtasi ir žinoma penktoji dalis Skyrim ne įšimtis. Puiki istorija, stulbinanti grafika, nepakartojama žaidimo atmosfera, sekė iš kartos į kartą ir taip pat Skyrim gausus šių savybių. Žaidimas nuo 2002m neapleidžiantis geriausio RPG žaidimo pozicijų. Šio žaidimo tiesiog nereikia apibūdinti, jis nepakartojamas. Mano balas 10/10 // This game is too awesome to describe. The Elder Scrolls my favourite franchise. My rating 10/10			"

												我的笔记本配置不是很高，所以开的是低画质，但是仍然不能遮掩这款游戏的魅力。买的传奇版自带中文，游戏中起到了很大的帮助(虽说全英文也能看懂，但是没有翻译的话武器名字一类的就很费劲)。剧情方面非常充实，能玩很长时间，而不像一些游戏，玩一会儿就会感到无聊和枯燥。同时，游戏的支线任务也很丰富，打通主线之后仍然会有很多任务等待玩家去完成。总的来说这应该是上古卷轴系列目前最棒的一部作品了，花这个价格去买是值得的。My laptop is not so good that I need to run this game in low graphic. However, this epic game still attracts me a lot even in low graphic(both the story and the landscape of Skyrim). Fortunately, this version includes the Chinese(language), now Chinese players can fully enjoy their adventures in Skyrim(thousands of weapons name in Chinese, which makes them easier to memorize)~ The story is substantial so that it ensure a long time game playing.(not like some games, have big maps but lack of playability). There are also lots of interesting optional missions I think u will spend a lot more time doing side tasks instead of the main story  :D  All in all, TES V: Skyrim is the best game of this series. It really worth that price.			"

												I'm very hard to please when it comes to RPG's.  I loved Skyrim, I'd say it's a 9.5/10.  It's got a few minor problems, but it's an amazingly well done game.  I'm pretty sure everyone has heard of this game, so I don't need to ramble on forever about it.  The DLC is ok, some of it glitched out on me.  I love the freedom of mods, console cheating to give myself gear/stats/perks/spells/etc, the quest treelines are awesome.Besides the ocassional glitch, the only other complaint I have is the way Bethesda prices their DLC on steam sales.

												what can i say? i love this game!you can do whatever you want, i think the elder scrolls series is one of the only RPGs that is truly open world. don't want to do the main quest? go ahead and wander the big and well crafted world. feel like you need some directions to start your new adventure? do one of the many side quests. you can make your own armours, potions and weapons, though they removed the ability to make your own spells.now the big question: is it better then morrowind/oblivion?my answer is no, although skyrim is amazing it does not have the same fantasy feeling i got while playin morrowind or oblivion. 8/10 a must own for pc gamers			"

												After noticing that paid mods are no longer a thing I say this game is worth the money, and modders deserve to get smalls donations if you truely love their stuffnow get yourself ""Mod it until it crashes""Old revieuw for the Archives""So it begins, the great downfall of our time. The community has started to crumble with people stealing each other's work to just make a profit.Let me get this straight Skyrim is a fun game but gets very boring after getting trough most content in the first 12 hours, which is why bethesda gave the modding community power and thus breathed new life in their game.Now we got payed mods, early access payed mods.noI refuse to stand for this utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on both Valve's and Bethesda's endDonations would be fine, but Bethesda cant make money of that now can they?EDIT: I found on a sub-reddit where Gabe is awnsering some questions that infact, not Valve but the Publisher of the game sets the cut for modders, so that 75% cut that is claimed is for Valve is actualy for Bethesda.for more: http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/33uplp/mods_and_steam/ ""			"

This game is briliant in many ways, the graphics are pretty decent on the year, when the game was released (ofcourse there are many retexture mods that can improve the looks of the game). Combat is pretty sweet too, You can choose which class You want to play and You can combine them in the way You want it. This game with beautiful open-world, many quests, many adventures, and a lot of more great content can give You the best role-playing game experience..			"

												What can you say about Elder Scrolls series ? It's more popular than a picture of Jesus holding a pug with a bowtie, and rightfully so. Most of the series issues are countered by the fact that talented, sometimes downright disturbingly obsessive modding community probably modded them out and Skyrim is no exception. Even if you sink more than hundered hours in vanilla version, you can still find something you haven't done and want to do. Want to spend all your time force-pushing chickens around town ? Sure ! Wanna put buckets over NPCs faces while they're delivering important pieces of exposition ? You got it ! While I'm usually opposed to ""make your own fun"" kind of games, doing your own thing is bread and butter of Skyrim, and that's what makes it so popular. Yeah, it may be a bit more simplified (for the sake of accessibility) than older TES games and maybe enviroments and combat get a bit boring and repetitive after a while, but it all falls flat when you can summon 5000 wheels of cheese and roll them down the mountain on unsuspecting goats.

												The way I see Elder Scrolls series: it's not about beating the game, it's about travel. My first one was Morrowind. I've played Oblivion, but didn't really pay attention to it and I bough Skyrim pretty cheap. So far, eight hours in the game, this is the biggest, most complete, wonderful ES game for true adventurers. You don't play to win, you play to travel, you play to read books, you play to enjoy it through and through.A RPG game like no other, if you didn't play ES games before, get Skyrim and forget about this ugly world we live in...

												The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an Open-world RPG with an awesome story and it has one of the biggest world to explore in any games ever made! In this game, you play as the Dragonborn, the chosen one that is meant to protect Skyrim from dragons.Honestly, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is probably one of the best game on Steam. The ambiance and everything is just so great! It's still one of the best selling games on Steam even 3 years after it's release! If you haven't played it yet and are you not sure if you should buy it, you can check my personal score below.  Category Rating /10 Details   Gameplay 8.1 The game is very well designed. You can set hotkeys for multiple spells or weapons at once, you can do questlines and misc quests at any times as long as you have the requirements, there's tons of content to explore... The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim doesn't offer anything new to the genre, however, and it's not very well balanced. Some dragons are easier to kill than some types of undeads found in dungeons. Also the AI can be quite confusing: sometimes monsters stands still and let you kill them, sometimes enemies do not even notice you walking in front of them with a high stealth level. Everybody can play the game due to good difficulty settings, but keep in mind the controls are poor and there's some weird balance going on!   Graphics 8.0 The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim graphics are nice. Some things like Snow and NPCs are not very appealing, but during the time you play, you will find tons of amazing landscapes, skies, buildings and forests... That's for the base game of course, because you can make the game more beautiful with mods. As for the animations, most are fine, but rolling and ragdoll deaths are not so well done. The interface is simple and has just the right amount of information.   Atmosphere 8.5 The music is totally amazing. It really fits the game: fighting music is intense and while exploring, the music really sets the atmosphere. Sound effects are alright, though repetitive. My opinion on voice acting is a bit more complex though. Honestly, I am impressed by some characters voice acting, like Cicero, Astrid, Senera, Sheogorath... They have very unique and amazing voices. On the other hand, some NPCs shares the same voice; like, litterally not just the same voice actor, but the same actual voice in game on multiple NPCs.   Performance 4.8 Here's the weak point of the game, definately. The amount of bugs is just catastrophic. I could write a paragraph longer than this review to list all the bugs i've experienced while playing The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim for around 140 hours. Game breaking bugs where you cannot complete certain quest and hope that you can complete them with the console. Sometimes you need to restart the entire game from the start if you absolutely need to complete a certain quest. Your character can fall through the floor, monsters fall from the sky randomly, playing at higher than 60 fps will cause your game to act weird, some areas will just make your game crash upon loading... I know that the mod ""Skyrim unofficial patches"" can be downloaded to fix some of these issues, but with the game as is, you are going to be annoyed really quickly with the tons of bugs you will encounter during your playthrough of the game. As for the overall performance, the game runs quite smoothly at 60 fps at least.   Story 9.2 The story is another very strong point of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Some questlines in particular will get you so addicted to the game, that you will play it through until it's done. The fact that almost all of your choices affects the outcome and scenario of almost every single quests is just crazy. The amount of work put into this aspect of the game is huge! You can be a good guy, a bad guy or simply do just what you want. A certain character annoys you? Kill him! You recovered a powerful artifact that somebody asked you to get for him? If you want to keep it, you can! That's how much you can control your character's fate.   Singleplayer 8.5 Well, since The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim only offers Singleplayer, this is just a resume of my review. The game is fun to play by yourself, it doesn't get boring at all and it's totally worth trying out. Just keep in mind, that bugs and crashes will affect your experience by a large margin unless you mod your game heavily. Even there, you might still experience some annoying bugs with mods, but it's definately gonna be better.   Multiplayer -- This game features no co-op or multiplayer.   Playtime 10 The game is known for excelling in this aspect. It took me 140 hours just to go through essensial parts of the game to complete all achievements. I have only done a few questlines and there's tons and tons of misc. quests that I have not started. Just in 1 playthrough you can spend from 100 to upward of 1000 hours depending on many quests you wanna finish, you many things you want to personally accomplish and if you want to craft full sets of gear, get to a very high level, unlock all magics, find all books, etc... Replayability is definately a strong point too! You can create a new character to try out a different race, look, build or just to re-do some questlines you might want to approach differently, because your choices in some quests will completely affect what happens during and after the quest.   Prices 9.0 For the amount of content and playtime this game offers, US$19.99 (As of late 2014) is a steal. Sure the DLCs are quite expansive, but if you get the Legendary Edition for US$39.99 you will get much more content and a better price than individual DLCs by far. This game is totally worth buying at the listed price.   Steam Features 10 It's got all the features you would hope for! The achievements in this game are super fun to work towards with only a few missable ones that you can easily manage to do if you read-up well enough before starting your game. It's got trading cards and most important, steam workshop support! As of late 2014, there are over 23,000 gameplay mods, items, quests, creatures... The list goes on. The modding community is extremely active for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim! It's also got partial controller support and steam cloud.   Game Score 8.1   Information Hours Details   Time required to complete the game. ~30 hours. Main questline + few misc. quests and item farming.

												Valve's Paid 'Skyrim' Mods Are A Legal, Ethical And Creative DisasterBy Paul TassiValve and Bethesda’s announcement of a jointly run paid Skyrim mods store has been met by nothing but fury from fans over the past 24 hours. Even modders, whom the idea is supposed to benefit, are coming out against the idea, which they deem detrimental to the entire community.It should be good news. Now modders have an official way to get paid through a partnership program when before most were getting nothing and many were squeaking by on a few donations alone. But in practice, Valve/Bethesda’s Skyrim mod store is an absolutely terrible idea for reasons that are already becoming clear even in the first day after launch. Let’s go through the issues fans and modders themselves are bringing up.The Split is UnreasonableThe modders only take home 25% of the money made from the sale of their mods. The rest is split in some undisclosed way between Valve and Bethesda. As Erik Kain pointed out yesterday, this is well below something like the Apple store, which gives creators at least 70% of the cash. Just 25% seems abysmally low. Even if it’s “better than zero” as proponents will claim, it’s more than a little reminiscent of Nintendo's we-don’t-understand-the-market YouTube policies which forced a revenue share program that most content creators couldn’t be bothered with.Modders are Friends, Not FoodMods have kept a game like Skyrim alive for years after many would have otherwise stopped playing. Bethesda is choosing to look at this like “why are these players not giving us more money?” rather than “wow, this is amazing advertising and community building for our franchise!” Modders usually love the games they mod, which is why they spend so much time on their creations. Changing the equation and turning them into employees is going to dishearten many of them, and attract the wrong sort of crowd.The Wrong Sort of CrowdA mod store like this has the potential to turn a game like Skyrim from “fun, infinitely modifiable sandbox adventure” to “Guinness World Record holder for most microtransactions.” It will create a flood of modders who aren’t the type of passionate players doing it “for the love of the game,” but rather people trying to reskin a sword and sell it for $5. The game could be overloaded with this kind of crap, and even if it’s all “optional,” it puts a black mark on the entire modding community.The Legal QuestionsAlready, one of the paid Skyrim mods has been taken down after one user claimed another user was selling it using animations that he had originally created in his own mod. The mod store seller claimed that Valve actually forbade him from contacting the original animator about using his work because of an NDA about the existence the store. And this is somebody who is actually well-meaning. The “wrong crowd” mentioned above could easily slide in and just start stealing other people’s work left and right and selling it on the store. I’ve already heard of modders taking down their mods rather than let them potentially be stolen and used for paid store offerings. Even if Valve has some sort of report system in place, it’s going to be a headache to sort through justified and unjustified claims based on who iterated off whose work and who has the rights to the original mod and so on and so forth. It’s a nightmare waiting to happen.Potentially Broken ProductsMods, are by definition, experimental. Though Steam has a 24 hour return policy for mods, so you can send something back (so to speak) if you don’t like it, there doesn’t seem to be anything in place to prevent a modder from selling something to consumers, having it break down the road, and then simply never fixing it, leaving the buyer with a useless piece of software they paid good money for. Most gaming companies don’t do this because they’re large organizations with reputations to uphold. But some modders might not care and be perfectly comfortable with abandoning a mod they can’t be bothered to fix. They and Bethesda and Valve already made their money when they sold it, and the return policy prevents further recompensation, so who cares? Let the consumer rant into the void about it.Dividing a CommunityThe Skyrim community has always been a pretty tight group, but now through the introduction of the store, a lot of tension has been created overnight. Fans are looking at modders like this was their idea as an attempt to cash in. Free modders are looking at paid modders as sellouts. Legitimate paid modders are looking at newbie paid modders as opportunists. It’s awful, and only made possible through the introduction of the store. Bethesda had a creative, united community until yesterday, and now there’s tons of infighting, not to mention the rage directed at the company itself.“Oh Someone Will Just Mod That”Here’s some fun with theoretical extrapolations of this concept. Let’s say that Bethesda wants to make another Skyrim DLC expansion involving some new order of warriors. They want to make their signature weapon a flail, but the oddly behaving weapon is proving difficult to animate and operate effectively on PC. Under this new system do they A) work really hard to get past the issue and release the flail at launch or B) say “oh the modders have flails, let’s just promote their mod in the store.” Under the old system, Bethesda would have been motivated to make the flail themselves, but under the new one, someone is doing it for them, and they’re taking up to 75% of the revenue for each flail sold. I’m not saying this would for sure be their philosophy going forward, but when a company can charge handily for someone adding extra content into their game, you can bet that the opportunity for exploitation is there.Honestly, all of these issues were just off the top of my head after glancing through a few forum posts about the store where fans are expressing similar concerns. There are probably many, many more issues no one has even considered yet. The pros are technically “modders get paid, the game maker gets paid,” but past that, there are too many cons to count.This will prove to be a disaster, and may damage the PC the modding community irreparably if the practice spreads.NOTE: Original article written by Paul Tassi, contributor to Forbes.

												Skyrim (Base Game) - REVIEW What is there to say about this game? Where do I even begin to tackle this monstrosity that has taken me on my 1st playthrough 141 hours just to finish the Skyrim base-game? We're not enough counting the DLC's here...yet! The Elder Scrolls (TES) is 1 of those series that are loaded w/ tons + tons of content, offering up an insane amount of value + ""bang for your buck"". To experience all of it at once - IMHO, at least for me, that's probably not the wisest ideas. This game has so many different storylines, quests, areas to explore, factions, things to do (i.e. get married) - it's a game you play for numerous hours until you've hit that wall (i.e. ""I need a break for a while""); just go away from for a bit; & then it calls you back for more. Very few games do this to me - Test Drive Unlimited 2; Far Cry 3; + Skyrim all come to my mind here.Class systems are gone here in Skyrim. Just practice the attributes you want to want to improve (i.e. sneak around, improve that skilll; swing a 1-handed sworded and hit someone, that improves; cast a spell from a certain school, that improves, etc); + select new abilities from those attributes to learn at level-up time. Since you're constantly improving your attributes + leveling-up like there's no tomorrow, this can be addictive - think like that Diablo-like kind of addictive.Skyrim has improved in numerous ways over its predecessor. Graphically, on the technical side, the game is much better than Oblivion. Girls actually do look more so like girls (in the face, namely), this time around - thanks for finally getting this right, Bethesda; it took you long enough! While many of the game areas are nowhere as crazy + interesting as Oblivion's Shivering Isles expansion (my favorite area in any TES game since starting in the series w/ Morrowind). These lands have a Nordic influence on them + most of them truly do look fantastic. Likely, if you see an area way out in the distance, there's a great chance - you can go there + explore it completely, which is fantastic.Combat here has improved & is a bit more visceral than Oblivion - but, when compared to others, it certainly is still a little bit clunky (like most TES games) + does not rival the combat of other games like Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoning + Dark Souls (those games certainly do specialize in combat) - it's still pretty good here in Skyrim. One thing that's new -  you can now dual-wield weapons; can even wield magic in one hand, a weapon in another; dual-wield different magic spells in each hands; and/or even dual-wield the same magic spell (for double the power). Simply put - these are great additions to this game's combat system.NPC's in the game-world actually have taken a page right out of the Gothic play-book, as you will see NPC's doing things to immerse you into the world - i.e. blacksmith sharpening blades with equipment; NPC's acting on schedules + doing things together on their own; + things of that natures. As usual, there's even more books added to read, for those who want to dwelve into the ever-expanded + ridiculously-sized Lore of the series. The main story here is this - dragons have returned to Skyrim, you're to meet a certain group of people to fulfill your destiny as the Dragonborn (a human that can learn dragon skills), learn Dragon-style shouts, & take the Dragons out once + for all - which is typical fantasy stuff. While the main quest is decent enough + is solid, it really feels like it's just another quest in the game - like many of the main quests in Elder Scrolls base-games since Morrowind. While Bethesda is no BioWare + no Obsidian when it comes to generating fantastic narrative, prose + dialogue - where Bethesda succeeds over just about every other of the game companies is creating insanely huge playgrounds that have a good deal normally going on w/ tons to accomplish, if you like what you're doing. Trust me - this is another addictive sandbox from Bethesda, in which you won't know how to let go of for a while or after being away for a while, it will eventually get you coming back for more. While not everything here is a home-run, there are also many good-to-great plots + storyline strings here - such as the Thieves Guild's quest-line + especially Dark Brotherhood quest-lines, that I don't even know where to begin. Skyrim will generate some random quests on its own, which often do wind-up in the Misc section - which could keep you going for a long time. As if the base-game couldn't do that enough already, making this game such a time-sink - throw in also that the game ships w/ the Toolkit these days & the ridiculous amount of mods out there b/c this series has an extremely heavy modding community + fanbase - you could live for 100's of hours in Skyrim, even long well after it takes finishing the insane amount of content that Bethesda has already provided. If there's something about Skyrim you don't like - i.e. the UI isn't that great, again; even though it's improved immensely over Oblivion - trust me, there's a mod out there to fix your issue w/ the game. For example - SkyUI Mod vastly improves + fixes Bethesda's UI-system immesely. By offering up a huge sandbox & an insane amount of things to do (from questing to exploring) here, Skyrim succeeds in proving again why Bethesda + their Elder Scrolls is 1 of the best - if not, the best - at providing addictive time-sink RPG's. Bethesda yet again offers up the kitchen sink here; I'll certainly drink to that + from that. RPG fans looking to get lost for 100's of hours, it's almost impossible to rival what Bethesda does in their games - & that's especially true here in Skyrim. Simply put - another RPG masterpiece from Bethesda.Final Grade = A+			"

												Skyrim is the best Elder Scrolls game so far, with the expansions it has gotten even better. I felt that ESIII: Morrowind brought more to the table for its time than ESIV: Oblivion but believe this game has done even more. I have enjoyed it on console, on PC and gone through the DLC which is worth the extra cash. The only thing missing is co-op/multi player but Elder Scrolls Online is running now, although I wish they would have done things a little differently on that game..Even if your not an Elder Scrolls fan or follower the game is a nice play as it allows you to customize yourself and play in many styles to allow a change up.I did have a few technical issues following the main quest line but just shifted to side quests and other things until I found out how to fix my save. They could have done a litle better on updating to debug some of the common issues or allowed a form of abandoning quests to reset them.Overall I'd say 9.5/10 for what it is as I can't complain about missing features that just weren't supposed to be in the game although I think they coulda just put out a co-op patch/expansion to allow us to play with 1 friend or something which would have enhanced the gameplay alot and expanded the games popularity.

												I've been a fan of The Elder Scrolls series for a while, and I think Skyrim is definitely a worthy addition to that line of games. Skyrim is a huge, immersive, lore-filled, immense world full of character. You can explore, fight, collect, or just wander around like a tourist taking screenshots. Even after playing for a couple of years, I still constantly find new places to explore and new experiences to be had.Everything about this game is extremely detailed and well thought-out, from the crafting system to the player homes, from dungeon layouts, to the races of the different NPCs you encounter and the way they use their culture to express themselves in their clothing, armor, weapons, homes, and towns.If the hundreds of hours offered by the game itself isn't enough, there are literally thousands of mods for Skyrim, offering everything from texture enhancements to full cinematic lighting effects. There are hours and hours of additional fan-made quests and storylines, in addition to the three official DLC expansions offered by Bethesda. New NPCs, pets, followers, houses, towns, armor, weapons, food, ingredients -- you can probably find a mod to change or add to almost any aspect of Skyrim. In this way, you can keep the game fresh and new, even after hundreds of hours of play.If you break it down to dollars spent per hour played it's probably one of the best deals in gaming.			"

												Bueno, con casi 300 horas, y varias partidas que la gran mayoría nunca llegé a compeltarlas al 100%, pero esta última si, hago mi análisis personal, que no tengo intención para nada de hacerme el reviewer poniendo gráficos, sonido y todo eso porque no lo soy, sinó dar mi opinión y ya está.El juego en si me gustó, es LAAARGO, GRAAAANDE y JUGOSO (e.e) muchísimas horas si te dispones a explorar todo al 100%, y más aún en hacer las misiones secundarias también al 100%, contando las del Gremio de Ladrones, Hermandad Oscura, Los Compañeros, el Colegio de Hibernalia, cada una contando con su propia historia interesante interna (Mi favorita de todas son las de la Hermandad Oscura).El problema está, en que, aunque sea tan largo y grande el mapa con tantas misiones secundarias, a partir de cierto nivel se empieza a tornar muy repetitivo, al ya superar la ""etapa de reto"" que sería desde lvl 10-45, si es que no usaste una de las 1.000 maneras de conseguir armas daédricas rápidamente desde el comeinzo y ya tener el juego en tu bolsillo, al igual que los dragones, que los primeros son de verdad un reto e impresionan, pero ya cuando vas por el número 5 y ves que SIEMPRE hacen lo mismo, ese efecto se va rápido.Me gustaron más las misiones de las facciones que nombré antes, que la propia trama principal, y ni hablar de las de la guerra civil, que luego de acabarlas sientes que no cambió absolutamente nada en el juego, salvo algunas cosas que te repiten una y otra vez los NPC's al entrar en ciudades.En cuanto a los logros, saqué todos, no son difíciles para nada, sinó que lo ""complicado"" es que llevan tiempo y requieren atención A POSTA si se quieren conseguir algunos (El que más me costó fue el de matar a un Dragón Legendario, ya que salen solo a partir del nivel 78, y yo terminé el juego y todas sus misiones secundarias sienod lvl 60-65, pero con subir discreción, resetearla (se agradece que agregaran esa opción) y volverla a subir, bastó con media hora o 1 hora para logar subir esos niveles que faltaban. Al igual que el logro de hacer un objeto con el mineral del DLC Dragonborn, que si o si necesitabas Herrería a 80 y el perk de crear armaduras de ébano para poder hacerlo.Una de las cosas que tiene muy a favor el juego, es su grán comunidad de mods, tanto en Workshop como en Skyrim Nexus, una gama de mods gigante de distintos tipos y para todos los gustos (yo opté por los gráficos y poco más la verdad, no me gusta llenar de mods un juego hasta el punto que ya deja de ser Skyrim y se vuelve otra cosa, obviamente respeto al que lo haga, pero si tienes que llenar de mods un juego para que te guste.. Deh, para eso no lo jueges, no?.Un pequeño punto malo, que no es del juego sinó de los mods, es que pueden bugearte o cagarte misiones, como me pasó a mi con la Hermandad Oscura, que jamás apareció el ♥♥♥♥ mensajero que SI O SI tiene que darte una nota para comenzar la misión, hay formas de iniciarla igualmente con comandos en la consola, pero es inútil, ya que más adelante, al forzarla con la consola la misión, hay personajes que no aparece donde tendrían y bueno, pasa lo que pasa.Resumiendo todo el Corán que puse arriba, el juego me entretuvo porque son mi droga los juegos de exploración y con muchas misiones secundarias, pero en cuanto a historia principal tambalea y creo que mucho, siento que todas las cosas que hago durante el juego apenas influyen en Skyrim más que en diálogos forzados o situaciones que hsata me dan verguenza ajena como me tratan de restregar las cosas que hago para hacerte sentir ""Hey, salvaste el mundo!"" y todos cojiendo en las granjas sin siquiera saber que Alduiun casi se los viola, tiene demasiada fama el juego, y por lo único que lo disfruté es por la enormidad del mapa, el Lore de los dragones, los Dwemers y los Elfos de las Nieves (Falmers) Por eso es que disfruté más la trama de los DLC's que la del propio juego (Salvo la misión del ""Muro de Alduin"" la parte donde Esbern narra todo, es lo único que en serio me interesó profundamente de todas las misiones primarias, además del asunto de los Thalmor.Es un poco triste que me haya atrapado más esas historias internas que salen en libros o en misiones secundarias, que la propia trama principal en si misma. (Tengo que aclarar que los libros son CIENTOS y algunos son de verdad HERMOSOS porque te cuentan cosas que el juego creo que ni siquiera tendría las herramientas para hacerlo).Recomiendo comprarlo cuando esté en rebaja, el precio de los DLC's me parece exageradísimo para   lo que duran jajaja, aunque la historia para mi valiera la pena de los 2.

												The Elder Scrolls, Bethesda's flagship series, is a true gem in the RPG genre. I'm well-versed in other games, such as The Legend of Zelda, Dragon's Dogma, etc., but they really don't compare to The Elder Scrolls (TES). The five main games in The Elder Scrolls franchise are all really spectacular, although it's hard to go back and play the old ones after experiencing the new ones. I currently own the entire series in a box set, with all DLC, and maps for each area featured in each game, including a map of the continent, Tamriel, so you COULD say I'm kind of a geek.Okay, enough babbling. I'm going to focus on Skyrim in particular now, as it's the object of my review. I will not say I have gotten or ever will get the full Skyrim experience. The game is simply massive. While you can play the main storyline, the numerous side quests, and all of the DLC, but there are still hundreds of locations you'll never go to in the game. I first played the game on PlayStation, and probably had a few hundred hours in before my PlayStation 3 committed suicide. Rest in peace.I eventually re-purchased the Legendary Edition (aka, all-DLC-for-the-price-of-base-game edition) for Xbox 360. I wasn't really satisfied with my experience, but at least I had a cool map of Skyrim. Later, for my birthday (or perhaps Christmas), I received the Elder Scrolls Anthology, the aforementioned box set which completed my life. This allowed me to redeem a Steam code for Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim, with all addons included. This experience was satisfying for three main reasons: the graphics/performance, the gameplay, and finally the modding capability.GraphicsThose of us in the PC Master Race probably know the power of a PC well out-maneuvers that of a console, especially the last generation. Skyrim on BOTH PS3 and Xbox 360 was probably running at a ""cool"" 30 frames per second or so, and still looked like literal ♥♥♥♥. Naturally, my ultra-powerful gaming PC, with a super speedy Core2 Quad and high-powered GTX 660 outperformed the console by a million miles. What I'm getting at, if you didn't catch my sarcasm, is that Skyrim does not require a PC on steroids, and the game will still give you gorgeous visuals on any card you might have shoved into your motherboard. The game still holds up to today's visual standards despite being made in 2012, and if you have a mid-to-low range build like I do, then Skyrim is perfect for you.GameplaySkyrim is one of those games where you can easily become your character. Obviously, the world of Nirn doesn't exist, and humans can't launch fireballs at each other or shoot lightning out of their fingertips (except in a galaxy far, far away). But, being a nearly god-like character, you sometimes get too much into what you're actually doing. Okay, let's talk about gameplay factors that help with this immersive feeling. Leveling is important. If you've ever played Fallout 3, 4, or New Vegas, then you know that XP is earned by completing missions, killing enemies, and successfully hacking or lockpicking something. Upon leveling up, you are allocated a perk point to spend on a perk. Your character also has the ""SPECIAL"" attributes, which influence the numerous skills in the game. Skyrim, however, has a much simpler, and much more beautiful way of going about this. You level up your skills by using those skills. Realistic! I lockpick a door? Lockpicking XP for me! The skills level up as you use them, and part of this XP benefits your overall level. Higher skill levels unlock more perks, which are purchased upon leveling up. This is all done in a beautiful skill tree screen, in which the skill trees are, in fact, constellations. This system gives you complete control over your character, allowing you to define a certain class to fit into or even to pursue all skills equally.Combat and the inventory system are also pretty important for your gameplay experience. Combat is very fluid, and there are so many ways to approach it. You can fight up close with melee weapons, light or heavy, dual-wielded or held with a shield. You can go at it from range, with magic or bows and arrows, or avoid it altogether and sneak past your enemies, slitting their throats as you pass by. Or you can do a combination. This freedom to choose your approach to any situation makes Skyrim a fantastic and very personalized experience.The inventory is a great piece of work. TES IV:Oblivion had a messy, hard-to-navigate UI. There were tabs with pictures and it was just so hard to figure anything out. Skyrim, on its Character Menu, however, has easily identified areas for magic, your map, your inventory, and your skills, each with levels of organization within.ModdingThe kind old folks over at Bethesda are very generous to us gamers. Some time after they released Skyrim, they released the Skyrim Creation Kit, a full suite of tools very similar, if not identical to what was used to make the game in the first place. This power allows players like you and me, provided we have knowledge of the Creation Engine, to make our own content for Skyrim. This means Skyrim is automatically a million times larger than it was before. Do you want Skyrim's lighting to have an overhaul? Done. Do you want the harsh conditions of a cold, northern state to have a real and terrifying effect on your character? Done. Are you simpler, and just want more swords, axes, and armor? Done. Or maybe you think the top of that barrel looks too decagon-y? That can be fixed. Oh, or maybe you've got some fancy hardware and you want every texture in the game to be in 4k? Done. Mods open up thousands of new possibilities that the devs didn't have time for originally, and can also fix mistakes in the game through giant unofficial patches.Final WordSkyrim? More like SkyWOW. 9.7/10I apologize for that. That was just plain awful.By the way, if you like reading my walls of text and you actually laugh at some of my humor, consider reading more of my reviews of other games to see if my interpretation makes that one tough decision for you!

												The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a 2011 fantasy role-playing game that critics and players raved the game with great awe. Since the game was released, Skyrim still managed to be on the top most-played game on Steam. With a large area to explore, so many quests to do, or just do the heck you want, should you get the PC version of Skyrim?Skyrim is one of those games that you can “skim” through the main story and then play a different game, completed parts of the main story then you forget about it, do side and miscellaneous quests, or explore the world on your own with massive amounts of hours dumping in into this strangely addicting game. There’s a good chance that the player would have more than 100 hours on Skyrim and still have plenty things to do. You start off as a prisoner bound to be executed until a dragon shows up and the people of Skyrim went wild that the dragons have returned. As I’m writing down this review, I am not halfway through the main story and that might be the point. Skyrim is a game that you’ll probably not going to finish the main story since Skyrim has so many things to do. Like the previous Elder Scrolls titles beforehand, the game is immersive and sucks you in. The side quests are pretty solid like the Companions, the Dark Brotherhood, and among many others. What separates the PC version from the Xbox 360 and the PS3 are the mods. That’s right: M.O.D.S. Mods can extend the replay value to almost infinity and there’s a good chance that you find a mod (or mods) that you are looking for.1. Do you want to visually overhaul the graphics from the vanilla version to ultimate high definition graphics? There is. 2. Do you want mods that enhance your immersion up to the next level? There is. 3. Do you need community-made patches for Skyrim that Bethesda Games Studios forget about? There is. 4. Do you want to find mods that remodel the female body structures to something attractive, beautiful, and probably lusty? There is. 5. Do you want to find mods that remodel the female followers and companions like Serana, Aela the Huntress, Mjoll the Lioness (along with plenty others) to beautiful and s*xy, and you say to yourself: “Hot d*mn, I love Skyrim mods!”? H*ll yeah there is!There are two mod managers: the Steam Workshop and Nexus Mods. I strongly recommend to use Nexus Mods since Nexus has a lot more to offer than Steam Workshop (for obvious reasons). Once you mod Skyrim with visual overhauls or retexturing female followers, there’s no going back. Arguably, this is the best part for the PC version of Skyrim and I’m glad that Bethesda has giving modders the tools to create such imaginative mods.Is there some flaws or criticism for the game that is universally well-recognized, won multiple Game of the Year Awards in 2011, and still considered as one of the most played games on Steam? Every game has some flaws and it’s not perfect. The dialogue writing is decent in most cases, but it should have been better. Some quests in Skyrim feel “short” like the Companions side quests/plot as an example. I terribly missed the Fighter and Mages Guilds from the previous Elder Scroll titles. If you played the quests from the previous titles, the plot in each guild is pretty solid and gives you a good amount of hours to do. Miscellaneous quests in Skyrim are mostly fetch the required items and returned to the quest giver and there are a lot of those quests. Bethesda has a reputation for not fixing some of the major bugs and no longer supporting the game to fix these issues, allowing the community to nitpick and hunt every possible bug that Bethesda failed to address or didn’t bother to do so.  The criticisms for Skyrim are relatively minor and doesn’t affect the immersion very much. The only possible concern is how Bethesda deals with mods in future titles (like Fallout 4, which we will have to be cautious on Bethesda’s moves). Other than these entanglements, Skyrim is a great game and the mods definitely makes a difference. With Skyrim installed, you will end up having one of the greatest adventures in your lifetime. With mods installed, you are in virtual reality.			"

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim	Play as the Dovakiin and fufill your prophecy and do some side quest while you're at it, in the world of Skyrim. Disclaimer	I have played this game a lot on console, around an estimated 200hrs therefore please don't take my Steam hours into account. I will also be mentioning modifications a lot into this review, as even Bethesda accepts, mods have become a stable for their games and this game is no expection. I fully recommend you check out the Nexus[www.nexusmods.com] (hub for all mods) and some YouTube videos to fully show you how customizable this game truely is. The modding community in this game is insane and deserves as much credit as possible.Pros:- Fantastic modding community. Range of mods that you can find which have been made over the years down from graphics mods to armor mods. The amount of mods are insane, at this stage you can create your own game with the amount of mods available. If anything takes to your dislike in the game, you can easy just modify the game to your standards.- The graphics have aged extremely well. The scenery of the game is breathtaking at times.-  Intresting storyline and plenty of intriguing side quests you can follow with different factions. - Character customization. This feature allows you to create your own legacy and roleplay as your character (if you're into that thing) and along with mods, fully customize your characters looks. - Gameplay is fun. Exploring is a major gameplay element in this game. Combat can be a little clunky, however offers a great range of approaches on how you want to kill enemies, spells, swords, etc.- Immersive, the game allows you to bond with the world of Skyrim. On the single note of immersion, you should buy this game.- The game offers hours of content in the vanilla game itself. You surely get your money worth out of the time you play in the vanilla game. Mods also create hours of fun with custom quests, etc.- The DLC is quality in this game. The DLC is classic, just adds new quests and items with a small price.Cons:- Many characters share the same voice actors. This can be a shame at times, but acceptable and doesn't destory the game at any cost. Nothing that mods can't fix. - Difficulty in this game is a joke. Please download some challenging mods in this game to create a challenge for yourself.- The game is really slow to get into in the beginning. I recommend you finish the main quest or get halfway through before deciding if you like this game or not. The main quest itself isn't long, it's the side quests which make up the hours.Conclusion:Just buy this game, do yourself a ♥♥♥♥ing favor.			"

												Skyrim is easily one of the best games of this generation. It’s one of the games that you get as much out of as you put in. It’s also one of the games you play exactly how you want to play. You can choose to ignore the main story immediately after beginning or play through the quests like a linear action adventure game. Speaking of quests, there’s an awful lot of them.The main story is centred on the return of dragons to the world. Pretty soon, you find out you are the legendary Dragonborn, a man or woman with the ability to consume dragon souls. It’s your job to find out why the reptiles have returned and try and protect the world from this new menace. two thumbs from me! because the game deserves it.			"

												TL;DR at the end.I first played Skyrim at its initiall release in 2011, and after many years I feel I am finally ready to write this review. What I can conclude from my many hours of play is that Skyrim is much more than meets the eye. The game's main quest can be terminated or disregard at the libertine's choice after the first stage of the quest is finished. NPCs may allocate the player additional side-solicitation, and some side-expedition have parameters adjusted supported on nearby dungeons which the player has yet to explore. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing game, playable from either a first- or third-parson perspective. The plan is determine two hundred years after the events of Oblivion and takes office in the fictional province of Skyrim. Should the gambler be stopped by a guard, they may wipe their bounty with gold or jail time, or may resist detain which will trigger an aggressive pursuit. Stamina determines the gamester's effectiveness in combat and is depleted by sprinting, performing heavy ""power attacks"", and being struck by frost-based attacks. The player may choose to join factions, which are organic groups of NPCs—for example, the Dark Brotherhood, a band of assassins. Skyrim retain the open earth folklore of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any era, and to sink or procrastinate the main-hamper storyline indefinitely. Skyrim was acquit to critical shout, with reviewers particularly mentioning the independence development and setting, and is considered to be one of the top video games of all era. Each delay their character levels, the players may choose to select a expertness-specific address exhort a perk, or accumulation perk stage for latter use. The player may readily roam over the deposit of Skyrim, which is an open earth environment consisting of waste expanses, dungeons, cities, towns, fortresses and villages. Players may sail the Olympic world more rapidly by riding horses, or by utilizing a fast-travel system which assign them to warp to previously detect locations. The lame was developed using the Creation Engine, rebuilt specifically for the game. The brood opted for a unique and more diverse Pancratium world than Oblivion's Cyrodiil, which crooked director and executive maker Todd Howard considered less interesting by comparison. Non-player independence (NPCs) populate the world and can be engage with in a number of ways; the idler may bespeak them in conversation, match an eligible NPC, kill them, or retain in a nonlethal ""brawl"". As in previous The Elder Scrolls crooked, killing certain NPCs can make some quests or term unobtainable. Some NPCs cannot be quell. If witnessed, crimes like murder and theft accrue the player a bounty, which is vestige independently in each of Skyrim's nine holds. Skyrim's capital story roll around the player describe and their stimulate to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the circle. The game pay over seven million copies to retailers within the first neptad of its quit, and has sold over 30 million copies across all five platforms. Some NPCs who are favor or hired by the player may deed as coadjutor who will accompany the libertine and foresee aid in oppose. Each of the factions has an combined quest path to progress through. Each burg and town in the Pancratium world has jobs that the player can engage in, such as agriculture. Players have the option to uncover their character. At the prelude of the game, players create their character by selecting their sex and choosing between one of several family, terminate humans, orcs, elves and anthropomorphic cat or lizard-like creatures, and then taylor-make their character's manner. Over the course of the Olympic, players improve their character's reason, which are numerical representations of their address in certain areas. There are eighteen adroitness divided evenly among the three college of resent, magic, and stealth. When gambler have drag reason enough to meet the demand exercise, their handwriting horizontal up. Over the manner of the game, the libertine completes search and evolve the character by improving reason. Earlier entries in The Elder Scrolls series used a character set system to limit which reason would contribute to the resolution's leveling, but Skyrim allows players to tell preferred art as they play the project and rewards them with more share when a frequently used aptitude is leveled. A headdress-up expand (HUD) appears when any of the player's three might attributes (health, magicka, and strength) are being depleted. Attributes reproduced over season, although this process can be accelerated by second-hand potions or regenerative spells. Magicka is depleted by the use of spells, undoubting vitiate, and by being struck by lightning-based assault. Health is depleted primarily when the player takes impair, and the privation of all sanity terminate in gangrene. However, some quests found on the might storyline being at least partially completed. The idler's inventory can be accessed from the menu and items can be survey in 3D, which may prove essential in explanation puzzles found in dungeons.TL;DR: The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as “the greatest or most significant or most influential” rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art.

												I don't care what anyone says, Skyrim is one of the greatest games I have EVER played, I have dedicated SOOO much time into it, (Yes i know on my profile it says I haven't played it for all THAT long but I never really played it while connected to the internet so yeah) There was a time when I would play skyrim for close to 12 hours a day (yep sure did take my life away from me) It was actually my very first steam game. After dedicating even more time in TES IV Oblivion, I eventually got Skyrim in 2012 and I will admit that after creating all kinds of characters I did eventually get tired of it, that was until I discovered MMOxReview on Youtube (Great guy, check him out :)) I then started modding my skyrim game, and a once Great game turned into something legendary... Now to be honest I wasn't all THAT fond of the Main quest, BUT the thieves guild and Dark brotherhood in these games has always really inspired me, I just wish they could have made them both longer :( Unfortuantly I have never played the expansions for Skyrim seeing as though I can't afford it :( Yeah i know, sad isn't it, But that hasn't stopped me from playing Skyrim over and OVER again... TES Online... let's just say I probs will never play it because I just don't really like the looks of it. And I am VERY keen for TES VI (I think it is going to be set in Hammerfell) Please tell me if you would like me to write a guide for this game, I am quite happy to and I promise I won't use any of that noob language if i do. I highly recommend this game, I give it a score of 9.5/10 Have a nice day ;)			"

												There are many reasons why we play games. Some play games to experience a story, some play to compete with others and some play to have experiences they have never had otherwise in real life. Alot play games to escape into another world, and live completely different lives, and this is what drives Bethesda’s Elder Scrolls series, a series that has excelled in creating complete virtual worlds, inviting the player to live parallel lives. Skyrim is the latest world offered by Bethesda to live in, and it seems like its Bethesda’s finest accomplishment yet.Similarly to the two Elder Scrolls games before it, you start off as a prisoner, and this case you are on your way to be executed. Just before the axe greets your neck, a dragon appears and the entire army base you were in goes into disarray. You are set free after the incident, and it is up to you to find out why are the dragons appearing, and what is your role in the whole ordeal (hint: it rhymes with Shmagonborn).Bethesda displays such dedication to concept of open world that makes other open world games pale in comparison. Skyrim isn’t just a series of buildings, environments and NPCs, it is the closest there is to virtual living world in a game. The sense of freedom found in Elder Scrolls is unparalleled, and Skyrim is the best implementation of this yet. The main quest is a minimal part of the game, and most of the fun comes from exploring the world built for you. As you go exploring dungeons, assisting NPCs with their problems, joining factions and reading ingame books, you realize what a dense world Skyrim is. It is compelling to learn more about Skyrim, about its citizens and about its politics, and the more you learn about, the more you are invested in the well being of the world.Through all the running around and exploring, you come across a wide range of missions to complete. The main mission is, as usual, the most interesting one, but the rest of the missions can be worthy, and they are necessary to help you know more about the world. You can complete missions for The Companions (Skyrim’s equivalent of the Fighter’s Guild) to understand how ingrained the warrior culture is in Skyrim, or join the Mages College and be looked down upon by Nords who believe that magic is for sissies. Even miscellaneous missions, such as simply standing up for a Dark Elf against a bunch of racist Nords can be satisfying. Standard fetch quests are to be found here and there, but there are far from being the norm.The games graphics have been talked about endlessly. Now, Skyrim’s graphics are great, with detailed textures and wonderful environments. Yet it terms of detail, they don’t hold a candle to games like Rage and Battlefield 3. Yet Skyrim is nicer to look at than the aforementioned games, and that is because of Skyrim’s aesthetics. Bethesda knows that when it comes to graphics, art direction trumps fidelity, and in Skryim, the beauty of the world comes from its style. Part of the reason Morrowind is generally viewed as a much better game than Oblivion is because of its fantastical designs; while Oblivion came off as a standard European fantasy setting, Morrowind was a truly outlandish and exotic location that had its own unique identity. Skyrim returns with the art direction that made Morrowind so unique. While the location might not be as exotic as Morrowind, Skyrim it is exactly the blistering norse region that you would think is occupied by burly, war-faring people. The buidlings, the environments, the apparel, the weapons, the creatures, and even the music all give Skyrim its unique identity, an identity that is inspired by real-life Scandinavia, but is in no way identical to it.–~~~~~~~~~~~~– The combat, which is one of the weaker aspects in previous Elder Scrolls, is drastically improved here. While there is still the feeling that you are hacking away at empty spaces instead of making a real impact on your enemy, but it’s not as bad as it was in previous games. The biggest addition to the combat system is the double wielding, and it works great. You can go for a sword in each hand, a sword and spell, or two spells, one in each hand. I personally went sword and staff, Gandalf style. There is also a favorite menu for items, a feature that pauses makes it easier to equip items in game. This is designed to save you the hassle of going to the main item screen during the game, but it also gives a tactical quality to the combat, since the menu pauses the game and allows for quick equipment changes, which is helpful especially when fighting dragons.Dragons appear as random encounters throughout the game, and they are just as imposing as one would imagine dragons to be. You will die alot fighting them, and you would have to rely on myriad of tactics to fight them. A few hacks there, retreat to heal yourself, attack with destruction magic while the dragon is airborne, retreat again, and so on. Killing a dragon is immensely satisfying, and through killing dragons do you acquire new ‘shouts’. Shouts are another new combat feature; they are words in the dragon language which, when you say them, unleashes different attacks on your enemies, or gives you new powers. Shouts are a welcome addition to the game’s combat system, and further adds to the combat’s tactical quality.Now this is a Bethesda game, which means that bugs are abound. I have experienced a few unresponsive actions from NPCs, same crashes, and an axe suspended in midair. However, this is an area I can’t criticize Bethesda much about. In a game of this size and scope, it is virtually impossible to spot all the bugs before release. To their credit, Bethesda is quick to releases patches that fix whatever issues gamers may have. We can also count on the mod community to tweek all the inconveniences out of the game. Bugs are abundant in the game, and players will experience at least one in every playthrough, yet for the most part, these bugs are miniscule and far from game breaking.Skyrim is like a music album that has a few tracks that you aren’t particularly fond of, but rest of the music is pure aural blliss that you can’t help but think of the album as close to perfection as possible. I can’t point to a single part of the game and say “that is the best part”; the entire game is an experience. It stays firmly rooted in Elder Scrolls gameplay, yet with enough improvements and additions (and subtractions) to make Skyrim stand on its own. After experiencing the vast, dense and incredibly detailed world of Skyrim, you can’t help but snicker whenever another game is referred to as “open world”.   Good: Vast yet incredibly detailed world, Incredible Depth, Interesting Story, Improved Combat System, Gorgeous Graphics and wonderful styleBad: Buggy, some standard 'fetch' missionsPrice: AED 9.5/10			"

												TL;DR at the end.I first played Skyrim at its initiall release in 2011, and after many years I feel I am finally ready to write this review. What I can conclude from my many hours of play is that Skyrim is much more than meets the eye. The game's main quest can be terminated or disregard at the libertine's choice after the first stage of the quest is finished. NPCs may allocate the player additional side-solicitation, and some side-expedition have parameters adjusted supported on nearby dungeons which the player has yet to explore. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing game, playable from either a first- or third-parson perspective. The plan is determine two hundred years after the events of Oblivion and takes office in the fictional province of Skyrim. Should the gambler be stopped by a guard, they may wipe their bounty with gold or jail time, or may resist detain which will trigger an aggressive pursuit. Stamina determines the gamester's effectiveness in combat and is depleted by sprinting, performing heavy ""power attacks"", and being struck by frost-based attacks. The player may choose to join factions, which are organic groups of NPCs—for example, the Dark Brotherhood, a band of assassins. Skyrim retain the open earth folklore of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any era, and to sink or procrastinate the main-hamper storyline indefinitely. Skyrim was acquit to critical shout, with reviewers particularly mentioning the independence development and setting, and is considered to be one of the top video games of all era. Each delay their character levels, the players may choose to select a expertness-specific address exhort a perk, or accumulation perk stage for latter use. The player may readily roam over the deposit of Skyrim, which is an open earth environment consisting of waste expanses, dungeons, cities, towns, fortresses and villages. Players may sail the Olympic world more rapidly by riding horses, or by utilizing a fast-travel system which assign them to warp to previously detect locations. The lame was developed using the Creation Engine, rebuilt specifically for the game. The brood opted for a unique and more diverse Pancratium world than Oblivion's Cyrodiil, which crooked director and executive maker Todd Howard considered less interesting by comparison. Non-player independence (NPCs) populate the world and can be engage with in a number of ways; the idler may bespeak them in conversation, match an eligible NPC, kill them, or retain in a nonlethal ""brawl"". As in previous The Elder Scrolls crooked, killing certain NPCs can make some quests or term unobtainable. Some NPCs cannot be quell. If witnessed, crimes like murder and theft accrue the player a bounty, which is vestige independently in each of Skyrim's nine holds. Skyrim's capital story roll around the player describe and their stimulate to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the circle. The game pay over seven million copies to retailers within the first neptad of its quit, and has sold over 30 million copies across all five platforms. Some NPCs who are favor or hired by the player may deed as coadjutor who will accompany the libertine and foresee aid in oppose. Each of the factions has an combined quest path to progress through. Each burg and town in the Pancratium world has jobs that the player can engage in, such as agriculture. Players have the option to uncover their character. At the prelude of the game, players create their character by selecting their sex and choosing between one of several family, terminate humans, orcs, elves and anthropomorphic cat or lizard-like creatures, and then taylor-make their character's manner. Over the course of the Olympic, players improve their character's reason, which are numerical representations of their address in certain areas. There are eighteen adroitness divided evenly among the three college of resent, magic, and stealth. When gambler have drag reason enough to meet the demand exercise, their handwriting horizontal up. Over the manner of the game, the libertine completes search and evolve the character by improving reason. Earlier entries in The Elder Scrolls series used a character set system to limit which reason would contribute to the resolution's leveling, but Skyrim allows players to tell preferred art as they play the project and rewards them with more share when a frequently used aptitude is leveled. A headdress-up expand (HUD) appears when any of the player's three might attributes (health, magicka, and strength) are being depleted. Attributes reproduced over season, although this process can be accelerated by second-hand potions or regenerative spells. Magicka is depleted by the use of spells, undoubting vitiate, and by being struck by lightning-based assault. Health is depleted primarily when the player takes impair, and the privation of all sanity terminate in gangrene. However, some quests found on the might storyline being at least partially completed. The idler's inventory can be accessed from the menu and items can be survey in 3D, which may prove essential in explanation puzzles found in dungeons.TL;DR: The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as “the greatest or most significant or most influential” rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art.

												The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has got to be one of the most worked on games of 2011 and 2 years on, it still doesn't fail to impress. The amazing work put into the game has definitly paid off with hours upon hours of things to do. The game works amazing on every platform from PS3, Xbox and PC. As I have experienced from the console versions, the loading screens take quite a long time and there are many glitches that happen every time you play. This is 100% different with the PC version as the loading screens are very quick, even on the top graphics settings and the glitches are much less frequent.Pros:- Amazing graphics - Amazing stroyline- A high selection of weapons - Amazing character interface- Easy to use controls- Large amount of side questsCons:- A few glitchesI would give The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim a well earned 10/10!

												This game is the closest thing to my favourite game of all time. What i mean by that is, i find the quesiton itself unfair. It is like asking which is your favourite child. Answering it is missing the point. Having sed that, this game for me is a bit like falling in love, i am drawn to it and just makes me happy. The game is a roleplayign system at its hearth. Want to be a mage user with swords? Go for it. Archer with swords ? Go for it. Mage that conjures monsters to fight for him ? Go for it. ALL of that? GO FOR IT. Just play the game, and you will be who you want to be. The World, the lore , the quets are just amazing. Now to be fair, taken apart peace by peace Skyrim is not exceptional , the combat is just fine, the story is just fine, the visuals i think are amazing but some would say are just good, (the music is excellent though), But when all the peaces are put together in one game, it is a MASTERPICE of an experience. It is a classic that will stand up FOREVER. I rarely gush so openly about anything but this is my one exception. The Elder scrolls seres is near and dear to my hearth, and as much as i love the other games in their own way aswell, skyrim is by statiscits(times i played and options it gives)  the best Elder scrolls game. Maybe in the future the next one TES 6 will suppas it, it maybe will. But even then, some will say Skyrim was the best , same way some say Oblivion is, or Morrowind. In a way, everyone is right, these games are special, let us not fight over whos better, but enjoy that they exist, and the passion people have for them. Just play this game, it is one of my most trusted firends in games. I hope i will always come back to it . :)19.2.2017			"

												Skyrim is one of those breath taking video games that goes on to become a Legend. The open world gameplay will make the world come alive to you. While you are the main character, not everyone else revolves around you and your character. You will find npc hunting, working their day to day jobs, children running and playing tag, people praying to their gods and much more. But you still can interact with them. which can start new quest's, the option to have a follower and more. The main quest line alone is a piece of art and will keep you busy for a good bit of time. If you really enjoy your social life than this game is not for you. Because once you start; your not likely to stop anytime soon. Good luck on your new adventure hero and Don't forget to check out the mods for this game. There are quest mods to add even more gameplay hours, New weapons, Player homes, new worlds, and Even exploding chickens.			"

												This is my third review of this game, the second was prompted by the atrocity of locking mods behind a paywall, but as Valve and Bethesda realized the error of their ways, I will upload a new positive review.Core Skyrim, released 11-11-11, was a tremendous addition to the storied Elder Scrolls franchise that I had enjoyed since Daggerfall (which is still installed on my system and which I still play from time to time!). The DLCs were so-so, Hearthfire being my favorite of the three; but the mods and the modding community were what made this the premeir experience in PC gaming. I play Skyrim using 3D glasses and headphones and with the amazing mods like Frostfall, Wet and Cold, Immersive HUD, realistic needs and diseases, and Hunterborn it felt as if I was really there in Skyrim! With my role playing and dead-is-dead playstyle it was truly a magical experience, fulfilling the promise of video games that was only hinted at when I saw Dragon's Lair in the arcade as a child.This game was worth it at full price, and today is a ""must own"" when you can snag it on sale for 15 bucks or less! I have subscribed to Nexus in the past for mods, and will do so again, usually when I plan on playing Skyrim heavily for a month or more. I will now start to support modders ranging from a few cents to a few dollars depending on the amount I use it and the quality. What Valve, Bethesda and Nexus need to do is sit down and really hammer out a user friendly donation system. I want to be able to donate directly from my Steam Wallet or a Nexus Wallet with a minimal number of clicks. As it stands, it is a hassle to throw a few pennies at a mod and when I am trying to relax after a harrowing day at work, I don't want to fill out a bunch of forms! If Valve, Bethesda and Nexus need to take a tiny slice (5% max) of that donation to offset the cost of that system, I am OK with that.Finally, three and a half years into its lifespan, Bethesda is prepping to announce Fallout 4 and we are going to start the long march to Elder Scrolls 6! What should the future hold? Bethesda needs to think big: the Elder Scrolls Online was a failure not because of what it was, but because of what it wasn't. People want a co-op Skyrim experience not an MMO. Even now, Bethesda could and should realease a no more than 10$ co-op DLC for Skyrim, or at least get the ZeniMax lawyers to stop embargoing modders who have gotten to the prototype stage of development. Imagine traversing the vast lands (and seas!!) of all of Tamriel as the inevitable war between mankind and the Thalmor erupts across the continent and perhaps the entire world of Nirn and beyond!This is where Bethesda needs to get the modding scene right! Bring those who want to do this for a living and parcel out sections of Nirn to them so they can build it to completion as formal, supported and integrated DLC! Imagine a seemless world where you and you good friends can campaign in full virtual reality! We should work to rebuild the community and to fulfill the promise hinted at by Skyrim!- Thank you!			"

												This game has not aged well. Bethesda, as always has done a wonderful job on creating a huge world. Unfortunately, they removed all depth from their previous games to cater to a larger audience. It hardly has any replayability. You will spend more time installing mods to make the game fun, then actually playing it.			"

												[Review written in Bahsa Indonesia]Saya bermain TES Skyrim kurang lebih 2 Tahun, 1 Tahun bermain game bajakannya, dan setelah awal Januari saya mengenal ""Steam"" saya mulai bermain dengan game originalnya, memang tidak ada yang berbeda, tapi sistem achievment yang selalu memberitahukan progress story kita untuk pamer ataupun mencari point dalam memainkan suatu game membuat saya tertarik untuk membeli game ini.Bethseda merupakan salah satu developer game yang saya rasa hebat karena membiarkan para player dan modder untuk me-remake habis game ini tanpa ada batasan apapun, entah itu mod yang mengandung unsur sara ataupun membuka aurat.Saya merasa sangat enjoy dengan game ini karena tidak hanya dari story yang menarik, namun game ini juga menyediakan berbagai macam fitur unik yang selalu RPG lovers impikan, yaitu First-Person View, Open-World, dan juga karakter yang kita bisa dandani sendiri. Jujur saja saya tidak terlalu melakukan Main Objective di game ini, saya hanya berjalan jalan saja untuk membuka semua marker di map dan juga mencari pemandangan untuk dibuat foto, dan terkadang saya juga lebih sering untuk modding karakter ketimbang memburu Naga.2 tahun berlalu sejak modding menjadi suatu aktivitas yang mengasikan hingga datanglah hari ini dimana Valve atau Steam, membuat fitur baru untuk menjual mod, ya, Menjual Mod. Saya mengecek beberapa mod yang saya endorse dan download, beberapa diantaranya sudah di Hidden atau bahkan di Remove oleh para pembuatnya. Setelah berkeliling sebentar, mod mod tersebut nongol di Steam Workshop dengan harga yang sangat tidak masuk akal, atau bahkan bukan pembuatnya yang memasang harga, tetapi orang yang baru saja bermain Skyrim dan meng-upload mod orang lain, saya cukup prihatin akan hal ini, dengan sistem baru dari Steam ini saya menjadi enggan bermain game ini lagi, Sudah cukup mengeluarkan biaya untuk membeli base game dan juga DLC dari game ini, Mengapa mod lebih mahal dari pada Main Files-nya ?

												I love it, it gave me 2 years of fun, I played every playstyle, every race, every way, every DLC.I been from a straight up heavy armor warrior with a huge battleaxe that can turn into a werewolf, and could stand still taking every hit from a dragon without losing almost any health.To a master thief who isn't very strong but can sneak through a entire bandit camp without being seen once.. All the way to guy who never killed a soul, worked hard for his money chopping wood. Managing to build his own house and have a family.The main story with all the guilds you can join and areas to explore, you won't be bored for a long time. So don't just rush the main story and assume you seen it all.Out of the DLC's, the best would be Dragonborn. It offers a large new world, enemies, quests, armors and weapons. While the Dawnguard only offers a bit and a vampire lord form, and Hearthfire just lets you adopt kids and build homes. The worst thing about it, is there will be bugs, which can easily be fixed by console commands. But only use if needed, like after 5 retrys a quest won't finish or continue.8/10 Only because it can get far too easy, and the bugs. You get stronger than all the enemies too quickly. So I say when you learn the game better, go on Master or Legendary difficulty for a challenge.			"

												If I were to write a full review of this game, it would be nearly novel length. I would discuss all of the faults and failings of Skyrim, of how Bethesda took the generic route for more profit while selling out essentially everything that made Elder Scrolls worth playing, all while butchering the lore to cover their changes.Classes, a starting birth sign, the total nerf of all things magic, things like hand to hand being rolled into perks, the removal of stats, a whole class of armor being removed, reduction of armor pieces, the lies about spears, the broken marriage system, the dull civil war, the normalizing, and thus dulling effect on battling dragons, lore and plot hiccups and so much more could be covered.But instead, I can summarize it all with one message; I only bought this game because it could be modded. Really, the only reason why I even have well over 1000 hours in Skyrim is because of mods. On its own, even without ripping into every flaw, mistake, horrible design choice, the mountain of bugs and the aging engine that they still haven't bothered to work out flaws like the stuttering, Skyrim is not worth playing for more than a few hours. It holds no merit on its own, other than being open to modding.People can disagree, of course. There are a lot of people who still play it to this day on consoles, without the ability to mod. To them, I do not ask why, because it would solve nothing. I would still disagree with them. To me, this game is a flawed mockery of Elder Scrolls and the only thing that saved it is the modding community.I hold no hope for the future of Elder Scrolls, not after this game, and not after the way Bethesda so causally almost destroyed the community with their greed.

												This game is not a ""love it or hate it"", it's a ""love it AND hate it"". Sometimes while playing I think to myself: ""This is THE game, it's just a dream come true, is it real?"", but the next moment it might change to: ""This is the most stupid waste of time I've ever paid for"". First of all, it is HUGE. It is enormous. I've done 300 hours into it and I'm still in the middle of the main quest. It's got everything: fights, spells, potions, horses, dogs, children, marriages, dragons, clothes, bookcases, treasure maps, grocery stores, pagan worshipping, war, armageddon, waterbreething, dead naked sorceresses in bikinis, mysterious ancient civilisations, glowing mushrooms, mammoths, zombies and lots, lots, lots of bugs. It is very beautiful, especially at night, when you see the northern lights shining, but also very ugly when the low and high resolution textures are messing up in front of you.  It's got so many quests, tasks, characters and places, I think even developers don't know them all. It is a gem for those who like to explore and discover the territory for themselves. Each cave has something in it, each ruin might conceal a secret, each village might have a mystery to uncover. The freedom of choice given to the player is unnatural. You can be a werewolf, a vampire, a mage, a warrior, an archer, a thief, an assassin, a blacksmith, a miner, an alchemist, on top of the dragonslayer and The Chosen One, and most of that you can be at the same time. This schizophrenic development of the character results in a no less chaotic gameplay. You have swords, bows, daggers, maces, spells, magic staffs, magic scrolls, and dragon shouts, all of which you can use as weapons. You meet all sorts of enemies and you're free to deal with them by any means you prefer. There is no special weapon for a giant. You don't really have to use spells against a mage. Moral choices are also a blur. There is no ""proper"" or ""right"" way, really, you just do stuff and get stuff happen as a result. It's not a bad thing to use conjuration spells, necromancy is not punishable, poisons are as legal as healing potions, there is no white or black magic. Sometimes it's impossible to understand if you're doing good or bad. I think the only thing that stops freedom from being absolute is the quests. If developers would remove the quest lines as such, turning them into a mass of random tasks you can perform in any sequence, at any time (and preferably at any place with any character), it would make the game a triumph of freedom (and a complete mess). So, Skyrim is a beautiful, ugly, strict, messy, very stupid and very clever game, which everyone should play at least once. On the easy level it is almost casual, no effort is required to deal with the fights. It can be played on a Mac through Crossover.			"

												Skyrim, a game about adventure and saving the world from the evil dragons. Sounds pretty mediocre right? Well, no, the main storyline is surprisingly remarkable, since it ties well with the lore from the previous games to make you understand what makes it special. You can also shape what your character is, with a selection of unique races and playstyles. No wait, scratch that, YOU can make any playstyle that you want. Want to be a cat that destroys people with his fists? Go ahead! Wanna make an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ NPC get killed by all the guards in a hold? Why the hell not! What people really like in Skyrim though, is the gameplay and the mods that improve it. Let me put it this way, Skyrim is about the journey, not the destination. And having mods such as Frostfall and Duel Combat Realism makes playing the game all the more worthwhile. You can literally complete all the quests available and not be bored with the game. Proof? Look at the average of 10,000 people playing the game everyday, which, more than 50% of them, have been playing for years. So, in summary, this game is no doubt one of the best games of all time, and I definitely will continue playing it.			"

												Like most Bethesda games, Skyrim is only mediocre when played without mods. With mods, the games cool factor rises a million times over. Mods let you change almost every element of the game, adding immeasurable fun, and replay value.  With that said, this is going to be a negative review because Bethesda, and Valve, have enabled a system where modders can now sell their mods on Steam. This act has already led to some modders pulling their mods from free sites like Nexus. Why is it a bad thing for modders to be paid for their work? Because that's not what modding is all about. I also mod, but I would never charge someone for something that is essentially done for fun, and with the notion of sharing with others. Modding has always been something done by the fans of a game, for other fans of the game. For companies like Steam, and Bethesda, to try to monetize that, is nothing more than greed. And get this, the modders only recieve 25% of what they charge for their mods. Guess who gets the other 75%. This move sets a really bad precedent for things to come. You may not play Skyrim, but what if Valve started doing this to all their games? Modders for all games could potentially start charging people, and then the whole modding community would just turn into a huge market that nets big money for greedy corporations.  So, though I had fun with it in the past, I do not recommend Skyrim to anyone. It's your call to get it, but when the only thing that makes the game any good, is about to become paid DLC, that's when the game turns foul in my mind.			"

 The Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim Name - SkyrimGenre - RPGPersonal Opinion - Easily one of the best RPG's out there As before, the time stated on this review is not true, I must have at least 500 offline hours on Skyrim Review The Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim, a game where you can be almost anything you want, if want to be a thief, then join the Thieves Guild! If you have a penchant for magic or the dark arts, join the Mages College, or if you prefer assassinating people for fun money, The Dark Brotherhood beckons you!You can do so many things in Skyrim, you can become a Vampire, a Werewolf or just be the dragon slaying badass you were meant to be!Like any open world high fantasy RPG it's a great game but the flaws are mostly held to heart by console peasants gamers who demand shiny things to be flawless. However, it is not flawless as glitches are common as they were in the previous games. It's almost becoming a 'style' in the Elder Scrolls series to have games that are so full of bugs that ant eaters are circling Bethesda studios as we speak. But bugs aren't that bad some can be funny and some even make you laugh for hours on end!This game is more engaging than a lock on a public bathroom. Once started you have a rather generic high fantasy experience of running around figuring out what's worth stealing and what's not. After a while though you might tire of the combat and fetch'em'all missions and then you start another character.Who or what you start as in Skyrim matters little, who you’ll become means everything. So it doesn't matter if you’re a local Nord, an Argonian, or an Orc. It doesn't matter if you’re partial to axes, arrows, or great balls of fire. It doesn't matter  if you’re driven by your storyline destiny, or driven to explore, sooner or later you are going to find out that every path WILL lead you to distraction, sometimes a quick and easy looking quest will turn into a 2 hour long expedition into a huge underground cavern, or just give you a nice surprise in the form of treasure!

												The whole idea of selling mods in a game is.... beyond exorbitant. Especially a single player game like Skyrim. Valve, you crossed the line. Here are some clearly addressed counterarguments for ""why Valve should relinquish this pay-for-your-mods system""If a user creates a mod, they should make it not for the money, but for the whole gaming community and/or for experience. If money is the issue for the modder, then let's face it: they shouldn't be modding just for the sake of acquiring money. However, compensation for work shouldn't be disregarded: a donation system should be set up for the modders.A paid mod (like dlc) already establishes a new ground between players who can purchase the mod and players who can't. In game type (MMORPGs) this would be admissible, or (insert any multiplayer game within the given parameter). The mods would travel through some kind of quality control and then valve would sell it. However... Skyrim isn't even an MMORGP. It's a singleplayer game. For gods sake, you can't even play this game with other people, and a vast quantity of mods (in the payment section of the workshop) show that there really isn't a quality control.So far the aftermath of the implementation of this new system has caused modders in nexus to either: 1) take down their work on nexus and sell it here 2) take it down for the sake of preventing people from stealing it.  Shall I go onto nexus (or some other modding website), and sell it here as my own? Maybe use someone else's mod as a base for mine and sell it? This system really makes it easy to steal other people's work, re-brand it and sell it here for a profit. To steal a mod is very disrespectful to the original author(s) of the mod. This prevents new content from great modders being produced and released in fear of it being stolen. Also, Anyone who takes part of purchasing misappropriated mods will encourage and be apart of this larceny.Oh, what am I saying? Valve and Bethesda are going to take a 75% cut anyways.If you don't think this is a big deal, then think about this: In the near future, this whole system could spread to other games, not just Skyrim.

												After Valve and Behesda introduced payware mods which opened a can of worms, I can no longer recommend this game. Paywalling mods is not the way to go as it introduces too many complex issues into the modding community that brings no benefits to anyone other than the Valve and Bethesda's pocket filled with money. I support the idea of getting the modders paid for their hard work in enriching the games but putting a paywall is not the right way. I support donations for modders as it is fairer as everyone has different level of perceived value for something. The only scenario I support paid mods is when a mod had done exceptional work where it can be essentially a full game or an official expansion with fair amount of new content and reasonable price tag, such as Age of Empires 2's Forgotten Empires mod that became an offical expansion. I would gladly pay for exceptional mods such as C&C Generals Rise of the Reds, Dawn of War's Ultimate Apocalypse or Homeworld 2's Complex mod as these teams had outdone what the developers had done with the original game and also provided a fresh and vastly expanded experience to the game. A sword or a handful of quests in Skyrim does not provide the fresh experience like those mods mentioned above. Not to mention the absurd price that they are selling mods for which costs as much as the game itself.Valve and Bethesda, you ducked it all up. Valve really needs to get their crap together with progressively worse server connection, Greenlight flooding the market with garbage, Steam Store that acts like an annoying sales man shoving garbage at you everyday, client stability that is getting worse and non existent customer server. At the same time, Valve is becoming increasingly more and more greedy to the point they even outdo EA, Ubisoft, 2K and the lot of greedy publisher.

												New Review:While the practice of paid modding has been suspended (for now), my gripes with the many problems in this vanilla version of thing game as well as the overall lack of content remain a big factor.The game grows dull, boring, and redundant quick. Most of the game involves going from point A to point B to something and then fast travel back to Point A to go to Point C. If you want to know why I was crafting Dragonbone armor before completing my Fus Ro Dah shout, there you go.I find it very hard to pick back up after I stop playing, and that's a shame.------Old Review:While this supports paid mods and as a modder I strongly do not, it is a disgusting practice making its way onto the gaming scene that should remain on the mobile market and elsewhere.Until the practice stops, I cannot recommend this game for purchase at all. Hell, not even Oblivion or Morrowind. Spend your money elsewhere and for games that encourage free modding, the same goes for dropping support for any mod authors who has the gall to put their mod up on the Workshop and/or those removing/hiding their Nexus mods.Do not support mod authors who support monetizing something that is free, do not support Bethesda either.Aside from that, the game is plagued with bugs, game-breaking glitches, etc. Mods helped make all these problems go away, and now they intend to be gated behind a paywall.

												Skyrim is the perfect example of how a vast and addictive adventure game is done, without overloading the player with Witcher-like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ complexity.  You begin the game picking only your race and from then, what type of fighter you are is completely built off of how you play, making for endless possibilities of the fighter you can become.  It is a poor idea to just stick to the main story all throughout, because it will leave you at a disadvantage if you ignore the varying side quests and beautiful exploration, which allow you to uncover some of the best equipment as well as enhance your skills and levels.  This in turn, has given me a massive playtime of 37 hours so far and the main story still only feels like it's a quarter of the way through!  This is a fantastic watercooler game, allowing for you and your friends to share hours of stories about your unique adventures and play style in Skyrim.  If you have the system specs and you love exploration, DO NOT MISS THIS GAME!			"

 One of the greatest RPG's to date. To start of my review dont be fooled by the couple of hours that I have logged on steam because I actually own a physical copy of the game which doesn't require steam. I probably have over 400-500 hours on that version before I bought it again on steam for one reason: I was missing out on the steam workshop mods to mod my game into complete oblivion. Which I did.. several times.. crashing my pc.. BUT HEY I had a great time doing it!Now off to the game. Story You are the Dragonborn. you can kill dragons and use their voice and language. as a matter of fact. you can actually absorb their souls. As it goes around the land of skyrim is in danger because of the dragons returing after being dead for years and years. You are the only one that can kill them and stop Skyrim from bruning up into ashes.The story Mission are good enough but the story lacks a bit and falls short due to the rich world surrounding it. You will be sidetracked by pretty much everything you see on your way to the next story mission. I was around 200 hours in and I had not even finished the main story quests yet. I was just doing every single sidequest that I could find. The world of skyrim is so rich and full of things to do that you wont even notice the world around you is falling apart. The story itself is decent enough and so is the voiceacting in the game. But what the story lacks in content, the rest of the game makes up for that.And when your done with the main story there are plenty of things to do.  Write your own story.  Become the next legend. join the brotherhood of thieves etc etc The Gameplay The core combat system and being able to choose between 3th persona nd first person really makes the game more enjoyable. The combat is nothing special but the mods man.. The mods make everything more immersive and better. I think I spent more times in nexus mod manager than actually playing the game. The combat itself is a fluid enough and being able to fast travel around the world if you have discovered a location comes in handy. Every interaction with the world comes down to your own choices. Maybe you want to murder everybody. Or become a hero. its all up to you. The dialogue in the game is rich and intresting. I just said that you can fast travel anywhere in the world but the game is also great to just wander around in on foot or with a horse. The landscapes are great to look at and there is so much to discover. To keep it short. its pretty damn amazing. Graphics, performance Skyrim is pretty to look at. The game is full of good textures and enviroments to explore. BUT, some of the textures on the other hand are horrible. And thats where the mod community steps in! The community made tons and tons of texturepacks and complete overhauls for the game. They are amazing and make skyrim a enjoyable world to explore. It doesn't have the best graphics but it fits the world well in my opinion. The game runs well. I have nothing to complain about that. I still have a solid framerate even after I activated all my mods. As for the glitches and bugs: There are some bugs and glitches in the game like npc's who suddenly go completely mad and your horse... it can apparently climb 90 degrees mountains without breaking its legs. anyway, most of the bugs and glitches are more hilarious than annoying and it didnt take me away from having a great time. And speaking of the community. its still huge after  years. Its amazing what modders can come up with. There are so many mods for this game that add up to a even greater gameplay experience.Go check out the nexus site for mods and the steam workshop ofcourse. well to wrap this review up lets go to the PROS and CONS of the game before we move on to my verdict. PROS Enough content to ruin your social life.Amazing mod communityDLC's are worth buyingRich world to exploreA good progression systemIntresting sidequests Main story is decentVoiceacting is goodThe amount of weapons and enemies doesn't lackVariety in missionsto much in this game is good.. the list is goes on and on. CONS Occasional bugs and glitchesCorrupted save files. ( save often if you have mods insstalled and make a backup)The story falls short Don't have enough time in my life to finish all the content I have for this game. Conclusion & Final verdict To keep it short. where the story lacks the rich world makes up for it. enjoyable combat system and a rich full world to wander around in. You will not be able to lay this game down once you discover the mods after you finish the main story. Oh did I already tell you how great the MODS for this game are? Well im telling you again anyways. I loved every second of playing this game and I have never gotten bored while playing. I personally recommend this for anyone who likes a good RPG, or any game in general really. Now on to my final verdict.My final verdict for The elder scrolls V skyrim:  A 10/10 MASTERPIECE.

												I tend to be wordy in reviews, trying to outline my thoughts, be fair and also objective. This will be no exception. Bear with me.I come into RPG a total noob and what I decree here might, for some, prove my noobness. Most probably in fact. As a staunch strategy/sim gamer of many years, RPG never really interested me so my adventure into Skyrim came as quite a surprise. In my view, despite it's ""used by date"" having well and truly expired, Skyrim deserves some very serious accolades. At nearly 100 hours played, I'm still coming to grips that I can play this almost like a sandbox (with the Hearthfire DLC) and just be a simple ""villager"" who relies on hunting, gathering or even small levels of agriculture to sustain myself.Or I can be a hero. As I write, my level 16 char (it's my 3rd start OK!) slays dragons, gargoyles and vampires. He can shout an army of sword wielding skeletons into piles of bones. I can wander willy-nilly, all over the map, mixing it up with bears, wolves and sabre-tooth tigers.There is so, so much to do and see that without the ""fast-travel"" option or a good horse it would take hundreds of hours just to explore the map.I'm intrigued by the depth and detail of the world and I think this will get 300-400 or more hours because I have so much yet to do and see long before I get anywhere near ""endgame"". I often stop and setup my character - keeping on eye on the rule of thirds - with awesome backdrops and scenery for some holiday snaps. I often walk everywhere, instead of using the fast options, just to soak it all in! I even have some pretty amazing screenshots if I must say so. As an ""Enigma"" music genre fan of many years, the music in the background of this is sublime. It so often sets either a wonderous emotion or a sense of danger at just the right time, so much so, that immersion into this pixelated fantasy world is absolutely complete.As I write, I've finally married the lovely Ysolda, Lydia is my Steward and my poorly residence (mansion?) at Lakeview Manor is looking rather stately. It is disappointing that much of the furniture and fittings are nothing more than eye-candy. Even my long, 8 seater dining room table never gets used. Well. I don't have to eat do I? For that matter, even sleep appears totally optional.There are quite a few other peeves too.- Clipping and FOV can be atrocious at times. Trying to shoot a fast moving dragon with bow and arrow. Lordy lord. - Tight tunnels and corners where followers jam you up, you can't see or they just get in the way. I even killed my follower once in a fit of rage as she stood dumbly by while I was getting zapped by some dude with a cattle prod. ""GET OUT OF MY WAY LYDIA DAMMIT!!"" I yelled one day, much to the mirth of my wife (my real one).- Inventory items. I'd be the first to recognise penalty-reward for carrying too much stuff but given the tightness and limitations of the purses of (scoundrel) vendors, it took buying a damned house just so I could offload my junk somewhere! There is little indication of what's -important- early on and I'm carrying stuff that seems rare or difficult to acquire with ""unknown"" as it's value. But I'm hesitant to leave it behind because it's just so much work to get to where I found it - if I need it!- Books. Agghhhhh!!! Somebody liked writing loads and loads of fictional - and unneccessary- trivia, that's for sure. Unless I am sadly mistaken, and reaching ""endgame"" might prove this, the amount of information presented is totally overwhelming. I fail to see relevance in much of what is written and trying to piece it altogether into some kind of connected narrative is as good as impossible. Do I really need to know why Edna Fat-Girl from Farawayland abandoned her children for a mammoth or any other such trite historical reference? Yeah, value tells me it's important but nohing indicates what ISN'T important either. Somehow I'm supposed to read and remember it all? Some might say you don't need to read and remember, it's unimportant. I say to that, then why have it? Clutter is BAD... Mmm..k...- Potions. Spells. Magic. Scrolls. TOO MUCH. A ""Scroll of Reasonable"" was needed by devs here. I'd rather 2 or 3 gameplay critical potions and maybe 1 or 2 rarer ones but I seem to have more potions and spell options than I do weapon variations. I'm over them tbh. 20 or 30 potions of healing is all I carry. The rest I dump at the local villages as I travel. - Missions. Oh my. Do they HAVE to stay in the list? NO, I do NOT want to an Imperial or a Stormcloak. NO, I don't want to kill the crabby old orphanage ma'am and sure as eggs are eggs, I don't want to be a vampire killer either. Whatever possessed them to not include a ""fail mission"" button. I understand critical mission timelines etc. what I don't understand why I have to find 10 bear pelts for Temba WideArms - who I have NO interest in - just to clear it off the list. Even a choice to decline a mission AFTER I get told what it is would have been better than THIS. Ugghhhh....- Saving. NAMING. Dammit. ""I love Ysolda"" and ""I wanna kill Ysolda"" save games would have been a great inclusion.- My final gripe. The opening scene. Oh COME ON!! ""Esc"" out of movie. PLEASE!!  EVERYTIME!!!But. Hey look. THIS is going to keep my occupied for a long,long time. If all other RPG's out there are even close to the depth of this work of art, despite her many faults, I'm glad I ""converted"" genres. I swear allegience, despite trial and adversity, to herald RPG from this day forth. So help me Mara....9/10gg			"

												This game is a triumph of immersion, storytelling, gameplay and craftmanship. Just an exceptional example of a world made to feel real, with nooks and crannies aplenty to explore and discover.

												Great game, made amazing by a great modding community. Though take note the game is no longer supported by it's makers, bugs you find on it mostly have been fixed by the use of modder made patches. I definitly recommend it. If you like games like Fallout and want a Fantasy world version of that game this is the game for you with it's massive modding you can customize theworld to your liking. It has a community so strong it recently crushed greed that could have destroyed it.Get this Elder Scrolls game now and hope the next Elder Scrolls game follows in a similar path.

												Do you really think that payed mods is a smart idea? Mods have been the backbone of creativity with games, and it has always been known to be community based NOT CURRENCY BASEDI feel its almost a Taboo to make people pay for mods. I don't blame Bethesda, even though they may have been the people to go to valve and propose this idea, but I give the FULL blame to Valve, and Steam. They are the ones with the ending decision to pull this kinda of ♥♥♥♥. They have always been money grubbing and have practically created a PC gaming Hub Monopoly. Origin, Uplay, and the likes will never be what Steam is, and Valve knows this. That is why they are able to pull stupid ♥♥♥♥ like this.Ive spent thounsands of dollars on steam, so have the hundreds of thousands of people that would frown at this have, and we only are here becauase steam honestly is kind of a last stronghold for PC gaming. That is the ONLY reason why. Not because you are good, not because you are doing your job well, but ONLY because you are the only PC gaming hub worth anyones time. Fix your ♥♥♥♥ Vavle. Really. All you have been doing these past two years is do some of the most self centered things, and its only possible because Steam is a monopoly.

												Skyrim is an excellent game, it really is, and made all the better by an amazing modding community......Hence this negative review. Valve's decision to introduced paid-for mods threatens to decimate this community. Now, first and foremost: Do modders deserve money for their hard work?In many cases, yes, a thousand times yes.However, is this the right way of providing such a monitary incentive?No, a million times no.All this current system does is create a paywall that looks set to divide the community. Instead, Valve should have added a donate button. This way we could still reward those modders that we feel deserve a little something for their work, without creating this massive schism.I would urge anyone reading this to not support such a practice. Vote with your wallets and make this another 'Horse Armour' scandal. If there's a mod author whose work you really admire, instead of subscribing here, head over to the Nexus and contact the author about making a donation. And if the mod you like isn't on the Nexus any longer, find another mod. If you're a mod maker, please think twice about making a Steam-only release. The Steam Workshop is not a good mod manager for Skyrim. Anyone serious about Skyrim modding will need to use tools such as NMM or Mod Organizer, alongside other programs such as LOOT if they have any desire to have a stable experience. The Workshop only makes this process more difficult.It's as simple as that. This is an awful, and ill-advised move by Valve. I can only hope that this isn't the shape of things to come.Oh, and:

												Honestly, a month ago I would have recomended this game. Until I woke up and booted up, and noticed I had a message, to uninstall all of my mods. You know, mods, the things that make games you've beaten playable again, with new life? Well I had some downloaded, and I got a notice to ""uninstall them, and procure them via transaction"". Basically ""I know that was free but now I want money for it, so uninstall it and pay me"". Absolutely disgusting, as long as a game supports content that has been free for 20 years in games, as something locked behind a paywall, I can't reccomend it in good faith.			"

												vanilla game was ok, maybe a 7/10mods made it great and a truly legendary game 10/10...BUT...now some mod creators are taking down their free ""for the community and love of the game"" mods and putting them behind a pay wall, pure greed. if the mods were worth paying for then people would have donated if you let them.even worse is some mod creators are taking down their mods elsewhere because they don't want them to be stolen and sold on steam...this game needs 100's of mods to be added to it and maybe 100's more hours in trial and error testing of mod compatibility with other mods to make it worthy of the 90%+ rating it has and that could end up costing you £100's in mod microtransactions now if the creators sell out.and a lot of mods need other mods and software to work such as skse and enb etc, so there's going to be people wrongly profiting from other peoples work, if you support that then buy this game.

												I feel like this game is very overrated.  There's a ton of content for sure, and that gives me a lot of stuff to do, but what fun is it if I find the combat so damn boring?  Few of the attacks seem to carry any real weight, and magic feels underpowered to me.My favorite part of this game was the modding community, and how you could take a mediocre game like this and make it something different and beautiful.  Recently, however, Bethesda and Valve have gotten greedy and now the mod scene for this game is crumbing in on itself.For its current sale price it's a pretty good deal, and I would say everybody should probably play it at one point or another because it's generally considered a classic, but please don't buy any mods.  Buying mods tells these companies that we're okay with them making money off of every single aspect of gaming, even work they never did.  They shouldn't be making a dime off of these mods, and in fact they should be paying these modders for driving more people to their game.			"

												Paid mods, sounds scary I know. Supporting the people who made the mods that make skyrim an actually playable game, undoubtedly a good thing. Now here is the problem, the modders could have at anytime made their own sites, or a single collective site, where they get all the money people pay for their mods. They didn't need valve to do this. Until paid mods, at least via steam, are gone. Please do not buy this game, do not download this game on free weekend. Instead sign the online petition. This may be the first time some of you have noticed this, but gaming news sources, are liars. If the modders want money, they can do it themselves. Some mods I would pay for. But All of that money would be for the people who spent their time and effort making those mods.

												So I noticed the review page has become an avenue to show dismay of paywall mods. Rather than rag on about spears, horrible animations, retar ded AI, wonky gamebyro offshoot engine, or watered down game mechanics. I'll be talking about the recent addition of the paywall mods...which ultimately is connected to all these issues I mentioned since Bethesda is notorious for releasing games that are somewhat fixed by the modding community...So we come to this,20+ years of tradition being challeged by the least likely companies of all: Valve. 6-10 years ago, if you said Valve was going to create this type of scheme, you would have been seen as insane. Well here we are. Valve has finally stepped up its game on bolder steps of consolidating power after years of testing the surrounding water. What they didn't know is that they would finally be fought back against. By attacking one of the cornerstone foundations of PC Gaming (Modding) they have committed the most shocking displays of absolute treason. What makes it worse is all the little ♥♥♥♥♥ who defend these actions of paywalled mods. The type of people who firmly believe Valve can do no wrong and will defend their actions like North Koreans will defend Dear Reader despite being ♥♥♥♥ on all the time. Their largest argument defending this change tends to be ""Well now you have to pay for the hard work of the modders!""Let's be clear on something, modding is a hobby at its core, not a business. It's a hobby of people who have an utmost love for the games they play hence why they mod it and share with their fellow fanbase. If you feel entitled to something or came into modding for the sole purpose of benefitting off of it in terms of money or popularity, then this hobby is not for you. Now with pay mods, it encourages this behavior even more to a sickening level. Monetisation brings out the worst in people. It draws in the wrong crowd and floods the market with dubious and potentially broken products which some will find themselves gypped on as mods are known to become incompatible with game updates.If you truly want to make money off your work, then hell try and get a job in the gaming industry whether it be indie or professional level. Don't muddy up our drinking water.			"

												So I noticed the review page has become an avenue to show dismay of paywall mods. Rather than rag on about spears, horrible animations, retar ded AI, wonky gamebyro offshoot engine, or watered down game mechanics. I'll be talking about the recent addition of the paywall mods...which ultimately is connected to all these issues I mentioned since Bethesda is notorious for releasing games that are somewhat fixed by the modding community...So we come to this,20+ years of tradition being challeged by the least likely companies of all: Valve. 6-10 years ago, if you said Valve was going to create this type of scheme, you would have been seen as insane. Well here we are. Valve has finally stepped up its game on bolder steps of consolidating power after years of testing the surrounding water. What they didn't know is that they would finally be fought back against. By attacking one of the cornerstone foundations of PC Gaming (Modding) they have committed the most shocking displays of absolute treason. What makes it worse is all the little ♥♥♥♥♥ who defend these actions of paywalled mods. The type of people who firmly believe Valve can do no wrong and will defend their actions like North Koreans will defend Dear Reader despite being ♥♥♥♥ on all the time. Their largest argument defending this change tends to be ""Well now you have to pay for the hard work of the modders!""Let's be clear on something, modding is a hobby at its core, not a business. It's a hobby of people who have an utmost love for the games they play hence why they mod it and share with their fellow fanbase. If you feel entitled to something or came into modding for the sole purpose of benefitting off of it in terms of money or popularity, then this hobby is not for you. Now with pay mods, it encourages this behavior even more to a sickening level. Monetisation brings out the worst in people. It draws in the wrong crowd and floods the market with dubious and potentially broken products which some will find themselves gypped on as mods are known to become incompatible with game updates.If you truly want to make money off your work, then hell try and get a job in the gaming industry whether it be indie or professional level. Don't muddy up our drinking water.			"

												Greedy pathetic Valve scum. The only fair split is 75% content creator for creating new intellectual property, 20% to Bethesda for the intellectual property that is the base game, 5% to Valve for doing nothing more than sitting on their fat asses manipulating their monopoly. If you want mods, go to Skyrim Nexus, if you love a mod, please donate directly to the content creator via paypal. If you want to buy Skyrim, I'm sorry but you have to register the game through Steam, but do not have to buy from Steam. This is a great game, but do not buy it through Steam, same goes for any game where possible, GTA V is a great example, buy direct from Rockstar.

												Skyrim has made significant improvements from the previous games, but lack that certain charm from the previous games like Morrowind or Oblivion. For instance, the leveling up system has been improved but it makes leveling up not as fun as the class based system you see in the previous Elder Scroll games, the combat hasn't really all that improved just the standard block, and hit with a possible 50/50 critical depending upon how well you leveled up. If you use magic make sure you buff yourself and use strong magicka spells.The world itself is pleasing enough, with the right ENB mods and mods in general you can make those screenshots look beautiful and epic. You will lose hours on end not just by doing quests here and there but just by exploring the vast lands of Skyrim and seeing the world change and react to things that you do or nature or even the NPC's.The NPC's in this game is far better than the ones seen in Oblivion. Not only do they interact with you but they interact in a way which feels almost life like. They will still do their tasks while at the sametime talk to you. And thank god the voiceovers are vary rather than the same like the ones seen in Oblivion. Plus each one has their own 'background' or particular quest which makes them even more interesting to chat with and of course help them in the time of need if they require it.The DLC's themselves just adds more layers to Skyrim. Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn gives new powers, abilites, lore, shouts, armor and weapons, plus locations, quests and NPCs. The standard DLC for an RPG. Except for Hearthfire, which is an add-on not DLC. Hearthfire is basically (almost) like the Sims. This add-on just adds adoptions, homesteads, and new NPCs and a few raident quests.Skyrim without mods is still great, but just a bit buggy and glitchy. The modding community has helped making the game great. And then some! I mean not only do you got a ton of Mod reviewers out there (Bordual, and Gopher, MMOxReview and Top 5 Skyrim mods of the week from Gamespot) plus many more. But also talented artists (painters, and drawers for example), music composers, fan fiction writers, short videos, parodies, playthroughs. I mean so much more!Skyrim is a great game to play.

												While this is one of the most entertaining games in the market, and currently makes huge sales even to this very day, part of it is due to its ability to be modded and the variety of the mods themselves. In its current state, while playable and fully functional, It pales in comparision with newer tittles. Part of the reason Skyrim sells so well is because of the modding community that constantly creates new content for the game. This content, atracts a wide variety of customers that, while not looking forward to play the game itself, buy the game because of the content they can download and play.Some of these customers do not have a very high income, and choose to only buy the game whenever its on sale, and can only afford moddifications instead of DLC.Restricting DLC not only gives the game itself a bad reputation, but takes away customers. Not only because of the low income some might possess, but also because some even have their own sense of morale that prevents them from buying Unofficial Fan Made DLC. People will download mods less and less as time goes by because of these reasons, and demand will eventually halt to a very slow number. Less people interested in paying, less effort from part of the developers. Why would developers stop making mods eventually? Simple. Developers, eager to make easy money, burn themselves by going agains most of the modding community,  which has a sense of morale that prevents them from buying mods.Now that they earn even less recognition from their own community (Recognition in the modding community itself played a big part in the development of mods) , and no one demands mods because of the previously stated reasons, (Combined with the fact that Valve/Bethesda earn 75% of the revenue) will eventually get discouraged from creating new mods, and will move to greener more profitable pastures. (Getting a job at some developer company, or even Indie gaming)While ""gaming backslash"" might not be a big issue for current big profitable developer companies, it does indeed hurts small developers who are just starting to make a living.

												Numerous bugs plague the game as physics engine going haywire on 60+ FPS. Nevertheless, Bethesda is refusing to fix it itself and instead rely heavily on unofficial patches and mods. But despite that fact it, alongside with Valve, attempted to introduce an outrageous paid mods concept which for them essentially would be nothing more than a DLC they never created but for some reason decided to get paid for it anyway.The game is a great free roaming RPG. A lot of dungeons to explore and adversaries to defeat.However, it is only truly playable tweaked and with mods installed.			"

												I have sunk quite the fantastic amount of time in this game, most of it outside the realms of what Steam can log. I have in fact beaten it, and since then played around with hundreds of different mods.The base game fits the analogy of a lake of ♥♥♥♥ quite well: A vast world full of mostly nothing, featuring what feel like dated graphics and a fighting system that varies from broken (sneaky archery bonus stacks? completely broken pathfinding?! my favorite) to very broken (killing the final boss with 4 shots and giants ignoring physics? Sure). All in all, once the game was layed out before me, it was plain to see that it had many, many flaws and not a huge lot going for it.But then I found the modding scene. And by Thor all mighty, it was glorious. Ranging from the essential to the nonsensical, passing by the immoral and the insane, it was quite simply a whole different level. Graphical mods that made the triple A market blush, gameplay mods that created actual ♥♥♥♥ing battles and not glorified pub brawls, as well as expanded all systems far beyond their initial capabilities, entire new quest lines complete with voice acting and new items / resources - the game simply had no limit. It was so insanely good that I actually dabbled in mod creation, successfully accomplishing a few scripts of my own even with no initial knowledge on the matter.And now Bethesda and Steam have the gal of showing up and trying to monetize mods. Mind you, I am not against the concept of monetizing mods - however, the way Steam and Bethesda are going about it is borderline criminal.Firstly, they take most of the profits, leaving the modder with only 25% of the revenue. Since these are profits and not donations, the modder should be legally obligated to declare this source of revenue, lest s/he may incur a fine, which means an additional 24% (depending on the modder's country) will be taken away by taxes. That means that a modder will make about 18 cents off of each dollar they sell. That's insanely low.Secondly, not all mods should be monetized. This is a simple fact. You can't sell a script that sells a fixed amount of in-game gold. You can't sell a script that adds genitalia to horses. You can't sell a script that retextures a few pixels worth of an item's model. Can you trust that Steam will moderate this? Of course not. Steam can't even moderate the quality of the games it sells, let's not even start pretending that it'll moderate the quality of the mods to any extent beyond what they're legally bound to.Thirdly, mod monetization should be based on donations or post-facto experiences. How do I know your mod works the way you say it does, on the latest patch of skyrim, and isn't incompatible with the other mods I'm running and doesn't render the game unplayble because my laptop is a glorified potato? I don't. Fact is, when buying mods, there's no way of telling whether you're buying a complete piece of garbage that is lying to you or if you're buying an amazing epic adventure that lasts 8 hours and is completely fresh and worth the money.I could keep going, but it's not hard to see all the innumerable flaws with this system.Ultimately this will just create complete and utter chaos in the modding scene, as vague rule sets allow people to use other people's mods as a base for their own, and as people try to steal other people's works to put it up for sale on the workshop.´And since this has had a huge negative impact on the game, the community, and ultimately drastically reduced the amount of available mods by way of either putting up a paywall or having legitimate concerns from the authors on the nexus website that cause them to remove their works so they're not posted on Steam to be put up for sale, I am left with judging the base game as it is, with no additional content. And that game is a bit ♥♥♥♥. So I guess that sums it up.			"

												I played this game for about a month when I first got it, then I stopped for a while after wining it. Then Steam released the Steamworkshop for this game and I downloaded a ton of mods that kept me playing on and off for over 3 years. Never in those 3 years would I have considered not recommending this game until a few days ago when Valve and Bethesda decided to jump in bed together and announced PAID mods. This opened the floodgates to a host of egregious behavior including using assets from FREE mods from Steamworkshop and other sites (Nexusmods) and using them in PAID mods in the  Steamworkshop (a fishing PAID mod that used idle animations from Fore's idle animations FREE mod), low quality PAID mods ( $5 for 250,000 septims, which you can get by just running a console command ), ethical concerns (Steam gets 30% of every mod sold and Bethesda gets a whopping 45%, leaving only 25% for the modder that he/she can only redeem if he/she generates a certain amount of money from sales), moral ramifications (a Valve lawyer actually said that it doesn't matter if your FREE or PAID mod depends on other FREE or PAID mods) and even legal ramifications (people making money using assets from FREE mods in their PAID mods, or even assets from PAID mods in their FREE mods).There's nothing more to say about this, and anyone who cares for the modders and says that they deserve money are really proving that Valve only cares 25% for modders, 45% for Bethesda and 100% for themselves by allowing all of this to happen amid a torrent of hateful backlash and other logical alternative from the community (A ""Donate"" button is too much since Valve won't get any money from that).

												While this is one of the most entertaining games in the market, and currently makes huge sales even to this very day, part of it is due to its ability to be modded and the variety of the mods themselves. In its current state, while playable and fully functional, It pales in comparision with newer tittles. Part of the reason Skyrim sells so well is because of the modding community that constantly creates new content for the game. This content, atracts a wide variety of customers that, while not looking forward to play the game itself, buy the game because of the content they can download and play.Some of these customers do not have a very high income, and choose to only buy the game whenever its on sale, and can only afford moddifications instead of DLC.Restricting DLC not only gives the game itself a bad reputation, but takes away customers. Not only because of the low income some might possess, but also because some even have their own sense of morale that prevents them from buying Unofficial Fan Made DLC. People will download mods less and less as time goes by because of these reasons, and demand will eventually halt to a very slow number. Less people interested in paying, less effort from part of the developers. Why would developers stop making mods eventually? Simple. Developers, eager to make easy money, burn themselves by going agains most of the modding community,  which has a sense of morale that prevents them from buying mods.Now that they earn even less recognition from their own community (Recognition in the modding community itself played a big part in the development of mods) , and no one demands mods because of the previously stated reasons, (Combined with the fact that Valve/Bethesda earn 75% of the revenue) will eventually get discouraged from creating new mods, and will move to greener more profitable pastures. (Getting a job at some developer company, or even Indie gaming)While ""gaming backslash"" might not be a big issue for current big profitable developer companies, it does indeed hurts small developers who are just starting to make a living. This has been proven already with several green light games that have failed to appeal to customers in some way or another, and end up ""branding"" the developer.Slowly but surely, this marks the beggining of the end for the modding community, and maybe modding for certain games altogether. DRM policies are soon to be expected, and we can safely predict that the modding ""Market"" will be managed in such a way, that few mods will be able to remain either free, or on sale, thus decreasing demand.

												Possibly one of the best games I have ever experienced in a while.While its story is rather linear, some quests may seem repetitive, and its beautiful world filled with various bugs (such as the magical flying mammoths we all know and love), it is an extremely immersive and fun game to play. There are so many quests and RPG elements to make your character truly yours. Whether you want to be a cold blooded assassin, or a heoric paladin poised to rid Tamriel of evils, or even a sweetroll stealer, the possibilities are endless. With hours upon hours of questsing you may complete, alongside two great content filled DLC's, the time you will put into this game will be immense. Combat has been greatly improved compared to the previous Elder Scrolls games. Not only this, but the graphics still represent the beauty Skyrim has to offer. All of this plus the potential of adding modifications makes this game truly addictive, and a great experience overall. I recommened this game to an Elder Scrolls fan, RPG fan, or anyone seeking to pour hundreds of hours into a game that will not fail to entertain. The opportunities and entertainment in this game seem to be endless, There is a reason as to why this 2011 game still ranks one of Steam's most played games today in 2016. All of this for a cheap price seems like a great to me, honestly. Buy this game already as you will not regret it.			"

-Quick Review-Skyrim is one of the most praised, popular, modded, Open World RPG's ever. Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, was developed by Bethesda Game Studios, and released 2011, most people get pulled into the world and easily pump over 50 hours into the game.Before I first purchased Skyrim, I apologized to all my friends and said “I won't see any of you this month”. And I was completely correct, I went on a binge that made MMORPG-expansion days sad.

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: If you have ever played any of the other Elder Scrolls games, you will hear of the “Nords” from “Skyrim”, as name of this game implies Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, takes place within Skyrim and the most common race you see are Nords.Tension has been rising between the Empire and the Nords of Skyrim, civil ware is imminent. It has been roughly 200 years since the events that took place in Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion) You start the game riding on a cart with a petty thief and some rebels known as “storm cloaks”. After selecting the race and adjusting your character to your liking you are saved by the most unlikely of circumstances.I won't say more to spoil anything else in the story, but once you start playing skyrim you are immediately cast into a world rich with lore, magic, and wild creatures.

Gameplay: There is way too much I can say about the gameplay and not nearly enough to do it justice. The game lets you mix and match between magic, armor, weapons, and items (torches, or other equipables).Depending on the: race + class + stellar sign + gear stats + skill points spent... you will have your own unique-brew-character. For example, since I tend to kite, run, sneak, and shoot, my characters tend to have high acrobatics, stealth, and archery skills.

Achievements: There are a total of 75 achievements on Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, 10 of these achievements are from the Dawnguard DLC, 5 achievements from the Hearthfire DLC, and 10 from the Dragonborn DLC.I personally enjoyed working towards all of the achievements in Skyrim. It's not a hard 100% completion game, however it is highly time consuming. Expect to put in at LEAST 50 hours maybe less if you're extremely productive.Price: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, is priced at $19.99. If you're just planning to play the core game and don't care about extra's, this is for you. There's plenty of player made content out there to keep you busy.The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Legendary Edition is priced at $39.99. For the achievers and avid Elder Scrolls fans; it is definitely more cost effective then buying the DLC and the game separate. I personally recommend the Legendary Edition over the stand alone game.Conclusion: Story: Outstanding, I have always loved the rich lore within the Elder Scrolls series. Gameplay: Excellent, you have a lot of flexibility with how you set up your character. Achievements: Enjoyable, it does take a lot of time to get the achievements, but well worth it. Price: Considering most people put over 50 hours into the game, the price is completely fair in my opinion; again I recommend the Legendary Edition, and you certainly can wait for a sale for an even better deal.DLC ReviewsHere's the URL to see my review for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - DawnguardHere's the URL to see my review for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim -  HearthfireHere's the URL to see my review for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Dragonborn------Edits and updates------Edit/Update August 29, 2015:Spelling and grammar correction, thanks Angfucious!Here's the URL to see my review for  Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion "

												Could Valve sink any lower? I do not think so. They already take a % for themselves from pretty much everything on Steam, but it does not seem to be enought for them, it never is. Charging for mods is something I would never think of, never. It is obviously always about money, how else to explain the fact that modders get only 25% from the mod price?Paying for mods is not an option, but donating should be considered instead.I do not recommend.

												Paying modders' hard work is good and I support that, every content creator should be able to live well and pay their bills. But I think it is ridiculous that valve and bethesda are taking 75% of the revenue, plus not all modders are honest, this is going to ruin modding for everyone involved.			"

												The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim development team (Bethesda) and Valve have recently reached a deal where mods can be sold on its Steam Workshop. While already a dubious concept, it has been executed horribly.For example:*Valve receives a 30% cut on mods. The publisher determines their cut, in this case 45% goes to Bethesda, leaving modders with 25%. Money IS paid not in store credit but instead in real cash, but only after the modder accumulates a $100 cut, which will not happen for most mods.*Due to a lack of copyright on mods, there are mods which are being stolen and being resold as a paid mod. There is also no protection against any mod being stolen, in a legal or DRM sense.*There is no quality control on mods in the Steam Workshop, and modders have no obligation to provide a working product or to update their mods, which will lead to refund concerns.*Due to many free mods' dependencies on what was other free mods that are now becoming paid mods, end users will have to pay for those mods in other to use other mods which depend on them. This will be happening with the SkyUI mod.*Mods such as ""Midas Magic"" are having their free versions removed by the modder after he attempted to integrate pesterware for the paid version into them.*P2W and cosmetic mods will likely dominate the market over expansions, as less work needs to go into those and that is where ""the money"" is.The entire thing reeks of bad business practice, and is a mess. A better way to execute donating to modders is to set up a tip jar system, where users can pick up and thoroughly test and play with a mod and then go back to the modders' workshop page where they can give modders a tip out of their Steam Wallet. This system as it stands shafts users, and it shafts modders as modders have to sell $400 out of a single mod to see any sort of money.I cannot endorse a company which is endorsing this practice. "

												You know I used to like this game. I used to have a postive review on this game and was planning to get back into this game.  But Bethesda and Valve decided to do something that not even EA would do and that is force paying for user created Mods. Yes I understand that no work should be done for free and yes I do agree hat modders should get rewarded for their work and dedication. BUT i don't agree that I should be forced to pay for Mods, that is why donations exist. Since the dawn of PC gaming Mods has always been free and this should never change.  The reason Mods exist is because gamers want to show their passion for a game they love and extend the life of the game and share their dedication to other people. As a result people would donate to show their appreciation to the modders dedication. But now that time is gone apparently because  now apparently people are as greedy as ever. What happens to the people like myself who already donated money to modders but now have this pay wall to force pay a particular mod? This is shady business practice and if this doesn't change soon then pirating will become a bigger issue and everyone will lose. Till then I don't recomend the steam version and the pirated version seems the better choice to show that this new business practice is huge mistake.			"

												This game came out in 2011 and now shows its age.  The only reason to keep playing Skyrim is the mods and modding community.  If you are thinking about buying Skyrim, you may want to hold off until the modding community sorts out the recent changes.If you want to purchase Skyrim for the story, then go for it.  There is about 30 hours of decent gameplay, quests etc in the game that are worth $15.  I got bored once I made it through the main quest line, once with a pure magic user and once as a dual wielding barbarian.  The Civil War storyline is interesting but does not change the world as I had hoped. There are a few of the main quests that break if you complete the Civil War Story before the Main Questline as well; it is my opinion that you should pick a side, then finish the main quests, then come back and finish the Civil War events.As an open world game Skyrim and Grand Theft Auto are the two best examples I have played. Get the Legendary version for $15 or less and enjoy the 30-40 hours of decent gameplay.  If you get the chance to play Morrowind and Oblivion please do.  They show their age as well but the game is wonderful and the modding community is fantastic. And you can flesh out the lore of the Elder Scrolls games for not a lot of money.			"

Not only that, 75% of the money goes to valve and bethesda, with a paltry 25% going to the modder IF his mod makes more than a total of $400.Valve is basically making free money with the work of gullible people that thought they could make a quick cash grab.Oh and, valve is also removing links to donation sites on free mods.

There is an addon which allows you to reassign them to movement ones but this shouldn't be necessary. There should be NO hard coded keys in ANY game in this day and age.Also paid mods?

												Bethesda once took pride in a robust modding community that helped them to lenthen game play, iron out kinks, and increase sales by way of people getting more content for their dollar from fellow fans. Fans that love the game for the game and not for a $ amount associate with the idea. This new course will sour the community and eat away at it's core concept of free sharing. Threatening the incredible collabrative efforts of the past based on trust, it will be a mired cess pool of people putting out con mods (stolen code, artwork, false promises, no follow up support, etc). Nobody will share and the focus will move from love of the game to a toxic environment. Why? Why do this for a system that has kept your sales up. Your dlc did not drive that trend, it was the free community of modders making your incredible game even better and you reaped the beneifits of that via furthered sales.This is an horrible way to turn something that has absolutely made you a lot of money into the abomination that it is already growing in to. Thew first day you have reports of stolen assets, people issuing mods that are not even half finished, etc. If you stay the course I will personally boycott you as a developer and stick solid at the sides of developers that do not follow this path. To Steam I say shame on you and you can forget me ever buying one piece of hardwared or software that you develop yourself. It is obvious you could care less about customers beyond how much you can milk them for.			"

												It may seem odd to review a game I have not finished, so take that into account as you read this.I first played the Elder Scrolls series with Morrowind.  Back then I thought it was the coolest thing ever.  Huge world, tons of monsters and weapons.  At the time though I was big into MMOs so I felt very disconnected from the game.  Alone.  So my time with the game was short, and I never finished the main campaign.When Oblivion came out, I gave it a try, and instantly was reminded of Morrowind and why I lost interest in the game.  So I probably played it for only a few hours my first time in.Elder Scrolls games are a fickle thing though... you see screenshots, hear about other people having fun, see Mod updates, and before you know it.  BOOM.  Right back in you go and you forget why you ever left.My right back in was Skyrim.  So much hype, so much graphical goodness.  I resisted for a LONG time, then came a Steam Sale and I was in.The game...Wow, so much better.  Is it the dragons?  Hell yes it is the dragons!I have about 50+ hours on record as I type this, and I go off and on playing the game so as not to get burned out on it.  I modded it up as best I could and I think it makes it that much better.Graphics - Just amazing!  Even unmodded this game looks stunning.  Character models less so than the world itself, but still a great show for the eyes.Sound - I'm no audiophile, but I tend to get drawn in more if the sound is good.  This game does not disappoint.  Music, voice acting, sound effects, all perfect.The first time I fought a dragon, and it came swooping in and bathed the ground around me in fire, I was amazed at how awesome it sounded (surround sound headset of course!).  Do yourself a favor and really crank the volume.Again, I am not finished the game.  Will I ever?  Who knows, and who cares.  I am having fun so that is all that matters.If you are holding off for similar reasons that I was, wait for a sale like I did.  But don't deny yourself the experience if you can.  It is totally worth it.			"

												EDIT: Paid mod workshop has been disabled, but I won't change my recommendation to positive. This is a reminder to any developer that tries to implement paywalls on something that should remain free.Was an awesome game, and it still is, BUT 80% of the awesomeness was due to the dedicated modding community, which at the moment is very disunited (due to the mod selling update). Some modders call others sell-outs for selling their mods, the sellers defend this by saying that all the hard work needs to be compensated for. THIS WAS A BAD IDEA! Mods are not DLC, and shouldn't be treated as official content. A mod may work today, but it may not work 2 weeks in the future, due to a game update or me installing another mod. Either way, the mod seller has no responsibility to fix it.			"

Those reasons being quite obvious, and many people already pointing out those reasons.By allowing the whole pay for mods instead of donating, they have essentially killed any kind of longevity that Skyrim had. By doing this, they have caused popular mods, one that fix problems with the game, and many, many more things that improve the game immensely, and keep them behind a paywall.The only way I'd recommend this game now, is if this all becomes an optional donation, or purely free instead.

												While this game is very good, the greatest reason to buy this game is because of the amazing mods created and released by the community for free, with the option to donate money available. With the addition of Pay-to-Play mods, I can only see darkness ahead of this game's future. Consider another game.			"

												EDIT: Paid mod workshop has been disabled, but I won't change my recommendation to positive. This is a reminder to any developer that tries to implement paywalls on something that should remain free.Was an awesome game, and it still is, BUT 80% of the awesomeness was due to the dedicated modding community, which at the moment is very disunited (due to the mod selling update). Some modders call others sell-outs for selling their mods, the sellers defend this by saying that all the hard work needs to be compensated for. THIS WAS A BAD IDEA! Mods are not DLC, and shouldn't be treated as official content. A mod may work today, but it may not work 2 weeks in the future, due to a game update or me installing another mod. Either way, the mod seller has no responsibility to fix it.			"

												[THIS IS AN EXTREMELY LONG ANALYSIS OF SKYRIM SEVERAL YEARS AFTER IT'S BEEN RELEASED. FEEL FREE TO SKIP TO THE BOTTOM IF YOU CAN'T / DON'T WANT TO READ IT ALL. LONG STORY SHORT, MODS MAKE THIS GAME WORTH PLAYING. PAID MODS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO RECOMMEND]So, I've been a fan of the elder scrolls since I was very little, starting with Oblivion, moving on to skyrim, and ironically falling in love with Morrowind and playing the modded version more than any other non-mmo I've ever played. I love the incredibly rich, metaphysical, surreal backstory, as well as the roleplaying / simulator aspects in Morrowind.I just uninstalled skyrim today after realizing it just wasn't worth it anymore to keep trying to make it work. It's a buggy mess, and when I try to pad the game with mods that make it less shallow and more fun I just have to deal with all the bugs and issues involved with the mods as well. It's just not worth it anymore.For me, the novelty of skyrim wore off very quickly. As many people say, it's an ocean wide and a puddle deep. It leads you to believe there's more to it than there is.Unlike previous games, every character I made felt pretty much the same: an oafish, clumsy nord. This was in part due to design decisions, and also due to developer overlooks. The removal of athletics and acrobatics removed an entire playstyle that allowed your character to be agile, jumpy, and nimble, which killed bosmer / khajiit for me. The fact that I couldn't do a sprinting jump, and instead have to sprint, wait a full second (And bump into the object I'm trying to avoid) THEN jump, left me feeling like a clumsy stupid nord every playthrough. The fact that staves dissapear when you sheathe them, everyone is the same height in first person, and your off-hand weapon just randomly appears in your hand makes the game seem lazy and breaks my immersion.Unlike in morrowind, guilds are less about simulating a role / job for your character, and more about following a preset storyline. That would be fine if the storylines were actually GOOD. My god the narrative mess that is the College of Winterhold still haunts me to this day. And don't get me started on the Bard's College. The thing that really irks me about these questlines is that they all just devolve into random dungeon crawls. I counted: you only need to use magic thrice in the mages guild. Advancing through the guild has nothing to do with actually using magic or being skilled. You're just watching a poorly developed story unfold, not rising through the ranks of an esteemed guild of scholars.There's no way to distinguish your character or give him a personality through dialogue or your race / class. This was a stark difference from fallout 3 and New Vegas, where your perks gave you extra dialogue options and could change entire questlines, and you could choose dialogue options that really gave your character an interesting personality. Skyrim game seems afraid to give you any consequences. Argonians aren't allowed in Windhelm? Except for you! Khajiit aren't typically trusted in the cities? Funny, no one even seems to realize I'm a khajiit in the first place. Not even a unique quest for argonian players to gain entrance into the city. You may say ""This would've been too hard for the devs to implement"" but it makes me wonder why they present these plot-points into the game if they're not willing to actually follow through with them. There's not even a single mention of your race throughout the entire game other than the occassional quip from a bandit. My altmer was walking by some dominion soldiers, and I was surprised they didn't even have any unique dialogue. They just treated me like I was a nord and shooed me off, not even scolding me for being a ""traitor"" to my kind. Entire quests could have been more unique by acknowledging the unique aspects of my player instead of pretending they don't exist.The quests give you the illusion that you'll be able to influence the world or change things, then snatch away the opportunity at the last minute. The Civil War for example: no matter who you side with, no high king will ever be crowned, and no one in the world will ever acknowledge the war is over.In the Markarth quest you can side with the forsworn but there are no consequences. The forsworn will still be hostile to you and nothing ever comes of your allegiance. You can come up with any excuse you want to explain these things, but the fact remains that Bethesda CHOSE not to take these choices further.So what you're left with is a shallow dungeon crawler with a lackluster combat system, removal of many rp aspects, a weak narrative, and....well that's it. I know the other games had issues too, but I expect a developer's work to improve over time. Not to mention the massive amount of game-breaking bugs that exist. Am I the only one that thinks it's ridiculous that MODDERS ar ethe ones that have to make ""unofficial"" patches to fix the bugs in this game? Isn't that embarrassing? If this was any other game company that would be unacceptable. How much longer can bethesda get away with these oversights and bugs until fans get sick of it? I know we like to explain it away by saying ""They made an ambitious open world game! It's hard to get rid of the bugs!"" Well if you're going to be ambitious, don't you think your work and polish should reflect that? Ambition is worthless without execution.I guess the main thing that I personally didn't like about skyrim was that it never felt like a roleplaying game or at least not the type of rpg I like. Morrowind felt like a roleplaying simulator, where you were dorpped off in a world and left to your own devices, free to simulate any role you wanted to. In the mages guild you actually did research and find magic artifacts and learned about history, in the imperial legion you actually felt like a gallant knight who used his brawn and his wit to keep the people of vvardenfell under control. Morrowind had a LOT of issues, and is incredibly outdated, but for what it was I think that it did a better job of this than Skyrim. In Skyrim, I just feel like I'm on soft-rails in an open world, watching the pretty killcams and interacting with the world, but I never felt like a living person in a living world.TL;DR The only saving grace for Skyrim are the mods, but they often become too much of a hassle to make it worth it. With steam's new introduction of PAID MODS, Skyrim has officially crossed the line into ""not worth it"" territory. Unless you want to pay for a full game AND the dozens of mods you need to make it a great game, then just go back to Oblivion or Morrowind, or hell, download Morroblivion, the mod that combines oblivion amd Morrowind into one game. It's great.			"

Loved it and spent hours doing everything and anything, all that thanks to a huge modding community which allowed me to tweak the experience.Had I started the game today, I would have stopped playing after 3 hours instead. Why? Because the vanilla user interface for PC is complete garbage and had there not been the wonderful SkyUI mod, I would have stopped playing. And now Steam graces us with their ""reward the modders"" talk where they only take a 75% cut. How noble of them.This is a line which should never have been crossed as it is really obvious it was just a new way for Steam to make easy money off the modders back. What wil really happen is that they will effectively destroy the modding community and only thieves and shoddy contents will pop up instead. "

												EDIT: Valve has removed the paid mods feature due to the backlash, thankfully. I'm still keeping this up because I remain VERY skeptical of them, their 'announcement' felt as if they'd be willing to try paid mods again on a game without an already established gaming community. Considering their very terrible customer support and cashgrab 'innovations' I don't think they deserve to have the consequences of this final straw undone until they improve. Let this be a reminder of the pinnacle of corporate greed.-Hop off the greed wagon, Valve. Way to destroy the gaming industry as we know it with your ♥♥♥♥, paid mods was the final straw. You've officially become worse than EA with your horrible, greed-driven decisions. And I suppose TESO didn't quite give you the bucks you liked so you decided to cash off your own modding community, Bethesda? Good job.Nexus Master Race.			"

												This negative review is being written in response to Valve's recent practice, spearheaded by Bethesda, to start charging money for mods made by the community.I have been a long time fan of The Elder Scrolls, I've purchased every one of the games multiple times and as the huge fan I am I freely admit that Elder Scrolls relies on it's modding community to flesh out and fix what are otherwise often broken, buggy, unfinished, messes of games.  To see Bethesda flat out extorting, not supporting, EXTORTING, the modders that have helped make their franchise into what it is today is despicable and downright disgusting.This will be the last product from Bethesda I will purchase until this practice is altered into something that is more community friendly.Shame on you Bethesda, and shame on you Valve.  This anti consumer policy must be changed.			"

I wonder how they're going to deal with all of the breaches in Fair Use for when these go commercial.Once you add money into the modding world, you open the door for both free and paid mods to get a DMCA-like takedown for potential loss of revenue from copyright holders. The copyright holders probably wont even need to show an interest in developing something, but their due diligence lawyers will make it up.

												After Oblivion, Bethesda strikes again with a half-cooked open world RPG. The real strength of Skyrim and the such always remained about  fans and modders who were able to polish the base game, fix bugs, doing most of the time a better job than people paid to build the game.Now, with paid mods, and Bethesda getting a cut on sale (and a heavy one), they can simply do even less, release a poor game that will be fixed by players. For free.Cherry on top? Bethesda will be paid for others to fix their crap.You lost yourself a customer, and a long time supporter, idiots!

What little respect I had for Bethesda is now gone, and the tremendous respect I had for Valve is severely diminished. Granted, neither of these companies really give a ♥♥♥♥ about what we think, so I guess that's irrelevant. Still, there is no more reason to play Skyrim.

												Charging money for mods that should be free for everyone is a total no-go! I can only advise everyone not to support this capitalist nonsense and only use mods from the Steam Workshop that are free and rather donate money directly to the creators if you find them good, simply because they'd only get 25% of the earnings if they would sell them, which is simply a huge impudence against the creators and should not be tolerated.But the game itself is of course awesome, I've spent hundreds of hours on the console version. Haven't had the pleasure yet to spent enough time with the PC version though.#SaveTheModdingCommunity			"

												This game is mediocre at best but there are people that enjoy it and that is fine and all, but the reason I'm even bothering reviewing this game though is because of the recent show of poor business sense from Steam and Valve in general. The fact that this game was only enjoyable with extensive mods was already a bad sign, but now the fact that everyone needs to pay for said mods is not only going to kill this game, but put Bethesda and Valve in a bad light. This is also a threat to future or current games in general if other companies decide to follow with this malpractice.Would you ever pay for a bug fix? Or a mod that adds more trees? Or different menu skins? The list of fallacies from this new system is lengthy and this whole fiasco is simply ludicrous. Please do not support this game or any other games/companies that try to implement pay-to-play mods into the community!			"

												With almost two hundred hours of game play on record I use to be able to recommend this game. With Valve's new 'Pay for Mods' system, I can no longer support or recommend Skyrim. I understand mods can be compared to DLC, but the fact Valve takes 75% of the cut for a mod created by a user for a third party game using a free Tool Kit produced by the game's developer is just wrong.Sad day for Skyrim.

												Skyrim's only genuine merit was it's ability to be modded into a playable, decent game. Now, this has been totally invalidated by Valve's most recent monetization effort. What little respect I had for Bethesda is now gone, and the tremendous respect I had for Valve is severely diminished. Granted, neither of these companies really give a ♥♥♥♥ about what we think, so I guess that's irrelevant. Still, there is no more reason to play Skyrim. If at all possible, I may be getting a refund for it now that they have changed one of the fundamental elements of the game, changing the product entirely.			"

												Valve introduced paid mods for skyrim which has ruined the game for myself and many other people. A lot of the mods I used from the nexus are now pulled because of people taking the original mod and uploading it on steam as their own.			"

												Once upon a time there was game company that had all the goodwill that a game company could get.  Then one day this game company decided that they had so much goodwill they had more than they needed. So the Game company decided to team up with there PC distributor. They talked and they talked tell they final came up with grand idea they'ed take all the goodwill and hard work from the modders and exploit them tell they fell over like fodder....the end.......This was once upon a time one of if not the greatest games for modding, now its a land devided with brother against brother, friend against friend. hope you all like 5$ armour packs in fallout 4 and mod load orders that can run upwards of 400$+ that is the future paying 400$+ for a game!  Also the age of the big teams of modders for awesome projects very well might be ending as well we well see tons of quickly made 5$ armours and weapons as modders struggle to make modding there living with only 25% of the income from these new practises and thats only once theyve reached the 400$ amount were they start to get money.... its the end of an era..... always remember the 23 of april 2015 as it might just very well be a day that you might want to remember.

												This was a fantastic game mostly for the strength of its modding community, Bethesdas bugs where patched, content enriched and interfaces improved. Mods kept the game relevant years after its release, Bethesda and Valve chose to thank the modding community for there work by splitting us in the interest of promoting their own micro transaction fueled cash cow.
