												!-=WARNING=-!THIS GAME HAS BEEN ABANDONED BY ITS DEV TEAM! DO NOT BUY!!-=WARNING=-!=EDIT=OK so I have to eat my words. The game was not completely abandoned by the dev team... They decided to slap some janky features like parrots that tumble thru the sky and dogs that run sideways up hills to the game. They also added some funky sound effects and downgraded the graphics it seems. Well done sirs! It is now officially FINISHED! Yay! Seriously, it's still not done and in this day and age no game should look like this. Are you kidding me? The dev team must have gotten bored and decided to just push out a release as-is. Don't waste your money.			"

Early Access Review
								The developer is yet another POS coward who ran away rather than either completing the game he made a decision to sell prior to completion, or at least publicly admit he was incapable of completing the game.  So because he is either afraid of conflict, or an outright scammer, he contributes to the trouble legitimate independent developers are having with early access.Valve needs to hold enough of the early access funds in escrow to make it worthwhile for developers to finish their game rather than crapping out yet another set of promises stacked on top of a glorified set of legos and raking in the $$$.

												It annoys me that this game has basically been abandoned and left unfinished, It could have been quite good, but the developer has obviously bitten off more than they can chew. I have brought a couple of early access games and with one or two have been very impressed - but then there are the people who don't complete thier games, cut, take the money and run, steam does need an escrow system and some minimum standards for what is considered complete.Personally I have been burnt twice now - if I get burnt again I will stop supporting early access full stop which is a shame because then the legit developers will suffer. Sit up and take notice Valve you need to do something to rescue early access or everyone will suffer.2/10 - Massively incomplete.			"

The dev had a grand vision, but not the talent to build what he hoped, and ""releasing"" it is just a way of saying ""Yeah, I'm not working on this anymore."" Which has really been the case for over a year.The game is ugly, broken, and most of the claimed features just plain never made it in.The dev has cut his losses, and so should you, by spending your money elsewhere.

UPDATE (temporary one untill i get more free time):The game has been abandoned unfortunately (afaik if you have a bug the Dev still provides support though).As it stands now, it is a nice voxel sandbox building game but there is really not much to do besides mining resources, building things and flying to other planets to.... build some more.IMHO this is still better than some other abandoned EA games like Starforge unfortunately despite some nice ideas (like unusuall skill point system) it is clear that the game is missing the endgame.In summary - i would still recommend this but only during sales (<5€)EA review______________________________________A really nice game, recommended if you have a powerful PC (and no mainboard integrated graphic card).- One of the better feeling game in the recent voxel dig/craft/build genre attack+ feels more complete in comparison to games like Blockscape, StarForge, Xenominer, Vox, Realm ExplorerThe good:- as usuall -> lots of digging, searching for resources, building and crafting- a well thought building system- nice skill points system - the more you build the more points you get (to unlock skills/perks/cratfables)- not bad graphic (compared to pixel voxel games)- perks/skills to swim/build faster, etc. Also to unlock new crafting items.- cool game modes in development- build a spaceship and fly do another planet!- cool water system /pipes, pumpsThe bad:- very demanding on pc (poorly optimised, memory leaks/etc)- crashes are often, some people cannot get the game to start- still in development -> patches are not very often, can break things. The Dev is deploying hotfixes though.- not much to do yet once you unlock all craftables and fly to planets- small planetsIn overall, a recommendation from me.			"

												This is the start to a really interesting game.   Now that it's ""released"", it will probably never become a really interesting game.First, it's glitchy.  Getting stuck on the landscape still happens.  If you step in a tiny hole, you might die, because the engine can't decide where you are, and beat you to death.  You can't just walk up and down the stairs in the prefab towers, because you are too tall, and the engine stops your motion if you get close to a block or vertical terrain.  This makes movement feel really difficult and pulls me out of the immersion.  It crashes too frequently, though not so much that it can't be played.  Rain still occurs indoors, and under terrain.  Why build a house or anything if it's just going to rain inside anyway?  Seriously breaks the immersion for me.Second, why am I doing any of this?  There's no direction in this game.  Not even a survival motive like that really popular game with blocks.  The machines and technical progression are neat, but I just don't feel like there's a good reason to do anything.  There is a rare material that's only on the asteroids, but it was kind of a let down when I got some.  So, less reason to explore.Third, it's not even close to finished in any way.  I haven't played much since 4.0 came out, but there doesn't appear to be a working door.  So even if keeping wildlife out was a reason to build a structure, there isn't a way to do access control.  A short wall will stop any wildlife I encountered, except birds, but they are pretty harmless.  So why build more?  Just a pile of blocks will build the ""culture"" score, and then what?  Storage and containers seem like they are always disorganized, with no way to line them up.  The textures make it really  hard to see if you are looking at a flat wall of rock, or if there are holes and projections and the like.  If you build on a spherical planet, it's hard to get anything level on the terrain, because the curvature is pretty extreme.  I realize that's hard to get away from, but the machines in my cave-house were alway all♥♥♥♥♥♥eyed, because the floor can't be made level without bricking it all up.  It takes too long to build anything, too.  I'm bored of building before I even have walls.This game has tremendous potential that will now, sadly, never be realized.  The way the game is right now just isn't that much fun.Also, I hate the musical score, every single piece.  It's well done, someone put a lot of effort into it.  I just don't like it.  At all.			"

Early Access Review
								13/6/15 Full retail review not Early Access. Based on a single player game.Well It's not exactly a scam Like Linden Labs pulled with Patterns, but this title has suddenly announced after a long time away that it has moved from Early Access to final release, and in my opinion it still feels like Early Access.But let's start with positives. Although I give a thumbs down, there is still gaming to be had here.Open world/galaxy generated worlds with crafting of simple objects with of course much mining for resources. Simple rewards screen to upgrade your skills and unlock objects with the objective of building a ship to get you off the rock your on and onto another rock.And the negative is centred around the word I keep using, ""simple"". It's why it still feels like a development version. Gameplay is very simplistic and unchallenging, features are a bit half baked and it feels like a demo. As a single player game it is over very quickly and your left wanting much much more which is a shame as the core concept is still exciting.As an Early Access review I would be giving this a thumbs up as good work in progress, but as V4 is the release version then I cannot recommend it.Maybe development will continue and my view will change.

												Every time you buy an early access game, it's a bet. Will the game grow to become another good game on steam? Will the devs carry it to the end? Or will it crash and burn? In this case, I lost the bet, which is surprisingly rare. This early access title was dumped into the 'finished' catagory in the middle of development (maybe a little earlier). It had no reason to be finished, everything is buggy, moreso than your average beta, lots of things unfinished, ect... And that really upsets me. I saw a lot of potential in this, it had some interesting ideas.			"

												Awesome game concept/potential. It had lots of interesting mechanics/dynamics, and a beautiful soundtrack etc. But then the developer disappeared for over a year, then returned with a single patch and released the (unfinished) game. Very disappointing, as this game could have, in my opinion reached impressive heights. It's games like this that have made me quite hesitant of placing my faith in indepentant developers and purchasing their alpha games. I've seen several other games (like this one) grab the money, release an undeveloped/premature game, and take a hike. Shameful.			"

								I can't recommend this game. It sounds neat but aside from the planets feature, there is nothing worthwhile about this game. Crafting is boring, harvesting is worse, and the planets are tiny. If you want to wander around a game that looks like it was made in 1999, collecting x*hundred units of this and y*hundred units of that, this may appeal to you. Voxel games like minecraft tend to work because of a cohesive aesthetic but in this instance the developers removed the blocky feel to the world and replaced it with hideous textures and low poly count models, while leaving the world fairly smooth. Combine this with an utterly dull and lifeless universe and you have a flop in the making.			"

Early Access Review
								I will have to change my review. I had many hours of fun in the game, but it is simply not finished. You can go through the build-trees and as soon as you've built your space ship to go to another planet, it starts to get really boring. There isn't really anything other to do than to gather and with the limited building height, you can't really make a nice castle, like you can in Minecraft for instance. The most fun in Minecraft, which makes it still cool to play is the redstone. Once you've built all there is in Masterspace, you're basically done and you can uninstall the game.Another thing that really is bad, is the monster AI. Cows, sheep and pigs all seem to gather in lakes. They don't even drown. Also what's with the dogs/wolves. Even the baddies are merely running around like chickens without a head and are too easy to kill. By the end of the building tree you can create teleporters, but they are very buggy and often you end up in the middle of space. It would also have been nice that when you die on one planet, that you actually revive there as well, so your only space ship is not on a far away planet upon revival. So even though it is fun from the start, this game is far from a finished product.			"

The characters feel like they are one of those buff space ranger characters from a toddlers show. The music reminds me of ant-bully with a little bit of a space-ish sound to it. (Don't know why.) I don't even know why I bought this...If your thinking of buying it, its not worth it. Buy Space Engineers instead! Much better quality.			"

												OK... If anyone reads a few of the other revews it says the game sucks, in wich i would agree. But i dont like it for a different reason. The reaon being, i 100% CANT run the game because the graphics card on my computer Just happens to not support some of the textures...or a lot... i dont know the details. Ive seen a few responses to some other reveiws saying that as well, so if u dont believe me, i have proof. And thats about it, (PS im looking for a terraria server anyone can play on, so if u have one can i play it pls) PPS i dont know how to change or install or whatever or do anyhting with my graphics card, so if you say to change it or do something else... well... i cant.

												I'm not going to tell you that this game is in any way complete or professional. I won't say it's not bugged out with many design flaws and a tutorial that always bugs out before you can complete it, leaving you to figure things out on your own.But I'm also not going to say that it's a game that anyone could only enjoy because it's-so-bad-it's-good. I bugged out in the tutorial and then joined some friends on a planar world with almost no idea what to do. Between us, we figured out the culture points system, obtained uranium for a quality pickaxe despite the fact that uranium drops are bugged and you can ONLY mine it with a quality pick or better. I think we beat the bugs.It's unnecessarily difficult due to bad design, but not impossible to play and enjoy, like we did.Just don't have too high standards or expectations.........Aaaaaaand it's 6 hours later and i'm bored of it....

								So...mixed bag.Masterspace is much like Space Engineers, minus the overly-complicated retardation and lack of anything to do. You start on a planet and work your way up to ships. There's a skill tree, several interrelated build lines, and all of that. The game is interesting, there's some workshop mods already out there, and it looks good graphically.Problem: BUGS. Showstopping CTD bugs. I don't mind supporting games in alpha, but this is ... well, I ran the tutorial and it kicked me off the planet into deep space with no way to get back. Stuck in the ground several times, random crashes.I recommend it but with caveats.			"

								In 3 hours of attempted gameplay I can find nothing positive about this game. The graphics are sub standard. I've tried several settings and the game locks up every time. I start a new game and suddenly I find myself dead in space. Steam sells you a bill of goods with this game that it DOES NOT DELIVER. I spent more time mashing Alt+Ctrl+Delete then I did actually playing. When I did get to ""play"" I found a game with completely broken physics and twitchy, completely sub-par controls. Save yourself the time and the headache and grab yourself something else. I feel cheated having payed for this ""game"".Updated 10/7 - Made an honest attempt to try playing this game today. Seeing as I reviewed this in May some improvements to the game stability. No improvement. All comments still stand.			"

								Well I have only played about 2 hours and after you get over the first few quirks it becomes quite an enjoyable game. The quirks mentioned being mostly that you only have 8 inventory slots and when you start a new game 4 are already taken up, looking through the building menu you can see that you need dirt to make the first tier storage device which has 3 slots *Though the description is out of date and says 2* however I started a game in a spherical system which I think has 4 or 5 planets and on my planet dirt is very sparce. I have to run around the entire planet digging on piece or dirt here or there. However the interface is quite intuitive as is the building and it is all quite easy to understand once you have figured out the basics, though documentation for the game is very lacking. Another disconcerting point is that the official forums for the game are VERY quiet. The game appears to have been in development since back in 2012 and yet they still only have a very tiny active community and information from the developer seems sparce and spread out over a long time.I think in summary this game has a LOT of potential but there are a few things the developer needs to think about if they wish to bring success to their game. *Advertising, Communication, Documentation""			"

								Masterspace would be a great game if it was applicable with Intel Drivers because I just spent $22 on this game, bought one copy for me, and another for my brother as a gift. I was very upset to see that the textures where all white, including the stone, dirt, and all other resources. There was no way to tell the difference between one thing from another, I hope this will be implemented in a nearing update. We both have laptops with Intel Drivers and I'm sure many other people would like to be warned before paying money for a game that doesn't have a texture able to be viewed by everyone. I think the developer should be told this so they can fix this as soon as possible so they make more money and don't have any issues with people reporting it to Steam. I recommend this game to anyone with a compatible driver. I want to help the developer as much as I can, I could be a ""Tester"" and try the versions if needed. Lastly, if this update will not be coming soon I want a refund of $22.38.			"

								so far i've built a little house, built a lot of the workbench's and believe i am on my way to leaving this planet! I would say this game is very promising. work on the UI a bit and some of the annoying bugs and it'll be good! Note if you use Nvidia optimus you will have to manually set it to use the discrete graphics card(many steam games have this issue). This is a taxing game, especially on the ram as every planet is loaded into the memory. I have a 3rd gen i-5, 660m, and 8 gb's of ram and managed to max the base settings, however when starting a new game my ram limited the amount of spherical planets I could have. Still built 10 planar planets of ranging sizes and manage to maintain 35 fps.  The crafting is fairly simple and intuitive, and the default controls work pretty well. I have experienced a few freezes, one total lockup. overall though as long as you can deal with the occasional freeze(i've read people have lost saves), I'd recommend this game. One thing besides optimization I would recommend is to polish the UI!			"

								This game caught my eye after learning of Empyrion Galactic survival. They seem like they are realitivly similar but this one is smaller scale from what ive seen so far.Id  recommened this game simply because of its style. Sandbox space games are a thing that will surly pop up a lot more.This one in particular has a bit of a rough start up if you dont choose the right perk at the start. For example, dont put your first five points into a plasma cannon. You wont get anywhere.  This game is pretty fun with friends. A good time killer for solo play. The ship and building limits cause some interesting designs. This game has its strong points and weak points like any other. Id say some strong points would be voxle terriforming, multiplanets, a fair crafting/perk system that requires a bit of reading to use correctly, and the visuals arent half bad. Just not the best. Some weak points would be FLOATING TREES (dont mine them, it looks bad), really bare to the bones basic AI that can get a tad annoying when they get in your way randomly, weird gravity on spherical planets that has potential of causing headaches, and audio... I personally cannot play this game with audio. Overall, id say this is a game to try with some friends.			"

								Masterpace is already an excelent little game and hopefully the developers will see fit to carry it forward.While there are several modes, my favorite is the spherical planet with 3 other planets. You begin on a spherical planet, you can run round the enitre planet in 5-6 mins. As the sun goes round you can keep moving and stay in daylight all the time.Currently the basic drive is to get culture points which are then spent on perks. Perks unlock additional resources and equipment ultimatly allowing you to build a spaceship and fly away to the other planets.There is enough motivation here to make the game playable, and as Culture points are gained only by constructing buildings (which can be saved separatly and shared) it makes this more of an architectural/building game rather than a mining game. Thus the amount of game play you get is somewhat dependant on you liking building.The building tools are adequate, they could be improved, but are very usable already.There are a few hostile mobs on the planet, these are easily dispatched with the pickaxe and do not currently re-spawn, so you can continue building unhindered.Terain forming spherical planets creates some interesting effects, both mining and re-depositing material. Even manufatured materials like steel can be used to teraform.Be aware this is an alpha game so be prepaired to make a consierable amount of the fun up yourself.			"

								First Impression - 80to88The game is in early acces and for the price it is worth it. Especially if you and your friends pick it up. 4 teams of 4 could be a ton of fun. Exploring space and fighting each other. Colonizing planets.The downsider are no weapon or tool models for the player, and no doors... Small inventory, and the game seems shallow. Again that might be because of the early access bit. However I streamed for 6 hours straight and would enjoy playing it more with friends. I will do a fully written review that will take the place of this at a later time .

								There's, frankly, not a lot to like in this yet. I mean there's some good ideas, but it's hard to -get- anywhere when you can't actually fight off the hostile creatures they throw at you until very lategame when you accquire a weapon. (After having spent nearly an hour dying, respawning, and dying again because of one damn snake, this is sort of a big issue.)Still I realise this is an alpha and there's going to be some serious work done, so I'm not TOO torqued out.

								A cut down version of this game appears to be available free from its home web site. You should try that before you buy it from Steam.This game should be clearly marked as beta or pre-release content. In that context I would not have felt cheated at paying for it.In fairness, you can see its potential but that is largely undeveloped as yet. The game lacks polish in many obvious ways, though it is pretty good in just as many others. That's about a 50:50 ratio of bad to good.It actually comes across as being a pre-concept of, or offshoot from, Space Engineers which is much more fully developed.Masterspace is not a game to spend money on unless you like to promote new developments like Green Lighted games.I'd rate it 6/10 for visisble potential, 3/10 for actual development and 1/10 for current value for money.

												Stay away from this one.  It is so bad it averages less than one person playing it per day according to steamcharts.  It is so bad its peak player count on its busiest month was 10 whole people back in June of 2015.  The peak player count for every month in 2016 is 4 or less.  Think about that, only 4 people were ever playing this game at the same time in 2016.  That is the mark of a truly terrible game.  See for yourself on steamchartshttp://steamcharts.com/app/282860Little inventory space, terrible looking assets and within an hour you have done everything in the game except build a ship to fly to another disk planet and start the whole thing over again.  One of the few games I wish I could get a refund for.			"

								Unfortunately, as wonderful as this game is, I just have to be honest anyways. Do I play it? Yes, I do, but would I want other people to play it?... Not so much.     First off, the loading times. Sure, that's to be expected in a game like this, but if you have one of the best systems on the gaming market and it takes you 45 minutes to load a game because you added a few extra asteroids, it gets kind of rediculous. If you're like me, and decided to watch Game Grumps while waiting for it to load and finally get in after lord knows how longs, only to discover that the game can't even handle it and you can't move at all, no matter how long you wait, once again, it gets kind of rediculous.     There's no updates... Like, none. at.... all.... It had one update since I bought it 4-6 months ago, and since then it's been dead. Unfortunately, this is undoubtedly a dead game, unless they decide to pivk it up again. The idea is wonderful, SOOOOO much potential is just waiting there, to build upon the system they created. Yet they're too lazy to even considider the community. If you want this game anyways, feel free to grab it, but don't use the generator. Just use the presets, trust me, even when turning the preloading of resources off, it'll still take five hours to load up a world with two standard planets, five random planets, and eight asteroids...     The verdict? About 2/5, that's all I can give it, and until it's proven otherwise by the creators, it's a dead game.EDIT:The developer has told us that he hasn't been able to update Masterspace because he's recovering from illness. Given the extensive timeframe, I can only assume it wasn't your average cold or flu. The point being, when this game begins getting updated again, I'll make sure to change the review. Good luck Masterspace developer, and I say this because it's one guy working on an entire game. Give him some love guys ^.^Edit 2:This guy has come back and successfully updated the game and made some dramatic changes. This game is now worth the play, and I recommend to people who are especially fond of Starmade. Seeing as there is only one person making this entire game, I have to put into prospect the difficulty of sating the hungry community. This game WILL be successful, but only if it is constantly updated and people are willing to give it a shot. This is to you, developer. Update this game often, and pay atention to what the community wants. If you do this, I gurantee you'll be even more successful than you are now. Good work buddy :)			"

												Have you ever wanted to develop 10 different cancers at once?Well your in luck because MasterSpace is now out of beta and is worse than it was before!!Risks: If you play this game for to long, you may die of the amount of cancers this game will give you.Rewards: If you die, you're in luck because you wouldnt have to play this tumor of a game any more.All proceeds go towards curing all the cancer from the developer after he tested this game.(hence the reason he was taking a break because of a sickness.)

								No warning that this game does not work at all with integrated graphics cards. This should be listed clearly. :( ""Not officially supported"" and ""does not show textures, game crashes immediately"" are different.Hoping this changes, until then - I cannot suggest purchasing it.			"

												I stick it in recommended with the caveat to buy cheap if possible unless someone actually mods this to be more fun and add a wider variety of creatures, things to do, etc.  To be clear, when I say cheap I mean really cheap.While this game has a few interesting ideas, there is not enough actual game to justify buying unless you really just want to own every survival voxel variant out.  I will say if a really good mod or total conversion of this were to come out, it could drastically alter this entire review.  Some bad points: The game is final now so nothing will change, not even bug fixes it seems.The game has some really glaring bugs, extreme memory requirements, occasional crashes, wonky animal interactions with spherical planets, etc.Things seem like a long grind.  I am talking MMO levels of grinding on mining anything just to do the first basic tasks, and then it gets exponentially worse from there.  Yes this can be adjusted.Everything sort of feels the same.  You encounter the same few life forms distributed randomly through your solar system, and then apparently the rest of the universe.AI is not great.Some good points:The water flowing is actually done pretty well.Sphererical worlds.Worlds and asteroids that can be visited and seen on the screen from your current planet (assumes powerful enough hardware) for the current solar system.Ability to go to another solar system.Nearly all the assets are exposed for the game, the system is mostly LUA and XML driven.  It could really be modded into something if there was someone with such an inclination.Supports modding and supports workshop.			"

								First impressions: I had a few problems getting the game to start: once the game asked for more opengl memory than was available, another time there was a firewall dialogue from Windows I couldn't see in full screen.The building and mining in the game is done well and the perks make things interesting, but the game feels really un-optimized. I did put all the graphics on the top setting though, because normally my PC can handle that kind of setting. I can dial them down a bit to see if that helps.There are some bugs too it seems like I walked through a doorway of a house to get in but then it wouldn't let me walk out- I kept getting stuck. I had to demolish the door partly to get out!Game will likely not proceed from this point much so it's a mixed bag.  "

								10/10 would masterspace again. But seriously, this game is amazing! The bugs are really annoying sometimes though, like getting stuck in the planets surface/platform of blocks randomly, i would also love it if the auto save time didnt take around 1 min :/. All that i can get over though cause of how fun it is to make a huge galaxy and go to different planets and explore the depths of space on your ship you designed. i would seriously give it an 8/10 cause of the bugs :( One thing id like to see are tanks that you can fill with liquid to transport to other planets.

												Entered Early Access with all the listed features. Left EA with same features, and a handful of new animals that have AI as braindead as the original ones. None of the promised features were added. Still has bugs present in the original EA release.Excuse after excuse from the sole dev, who developed a ""life threatening"" illness and sucked some guy into being his Community Manager. Let said CM fend off the hate until pushing Masterspace into a quiet full release and finally vanishing.Oh right, it has achievements now. Yay.			"

								This game should not even be at ALPHA level as it has so many bugs that it is unplayable. I support many Alpha games and take each game based on its own merits. This game has an interesting ideal behind it but is poorly executed at this time. I rarely feel like i have wasted money on games but this many be an exception. This game is not worth the money until the developer solves basic issues. The game crashes constantly and loads only half of the enviornment. This is not an issue with my system as i am running a very high end gaming system. Memory leaks and loading issues are common. I want to like this game but i cannot currently reccomend it.			"

								Well I tried this game out, and I'm not enjoying my time. The graphics are sub-par. the buildings look terrible. This is clearly a poor attempt at making a build/survival/space game.A large thing I would have to point out is their is a huge lack of knowledge from just opening the game, it's confusing, you just don't know what you should be doing. Put a tutorial in at the very least.When you hit f2 to respawn, you're old stuff doesn't drop. Just avoid spending the money like I did, it will make you angry, and then very depressed at the fact that you spent money.			"

												The new gravity mechanics are awful, and basically just add a requirement when building spaceships. Without gravity, a spaceship is completely unflyable because you can't stay on the floor, which means that if you get into a spaceship without one and fly up, you'll lose control of it and not be able to land it. Because of this, my main game, which had been saved while in space, couldn't be played any longer. As soon as I loaded it, my character floated off the floor and couldn't take control of the ship. I lost a ton of progress. Also if you saved on an asteroid, you're similarly out of luck, because one jump sends you off into space.In the end, all this update did was add a requirement and break some people's saved games. Before this last 'patch', I could find some amusement in this game from time to time, but now it's completely unplayable. To the programmer: Did you even playtest this at all?On top of that, world generation takes a ridiculously long time even though the whole star system is smaller than a small fraction of other voxel based games that load lightning fast. Having too many planets makes the system impossible to play, though I'm not sure why that would make a difference since any competent code would only be loading the planet that you are currently on. It's pretty obvious that the programmer does not know what he's doing.Additionally, the game freezes for about 10 seconds seemingly at random about every 5-10 minutes.Also turrets are completely useless since if an enemy gets behind something of yours, including the house or ship that the turret is attached to, it will shoot right through it. I had a turret destroy my spaceship while trying to kill a snake on the surface of the planet beneath me.			"

												This is like an intentionally bad version of Empyrion Galactical Survival. It's pretty much the same. You got your starting planet and need to build a ship and survive and fly to other planets and stuff but while Empyrion feels modern and is very fun, this feels like it's from 1998. Look at the screenshots. The game is riddled with bugs as well. I would recommend this game to anyone who want to see a really bad game.			"
