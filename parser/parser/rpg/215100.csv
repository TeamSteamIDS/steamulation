												Playing RO for around 10 years. Ragnarok Online is a good time killer with very friendly community. Some people call it ""anime runescape"" even though it's quite different from the RS.(The game is ""anime-ish"" however there are not so many weebs as you could think)Ragnarok Online 2 is a terrible sequel, don't even bother trying it since you will regret doing it.Ragnarok Online on Steam (which is called iRO), is bad in my personal opinion. It might be good if you're playing for the first time and can't figure out what to do, but the amount of bots, donate items, premium features and lag make recommend you to also try other servers.tl;dr - Great game, bad server.

												After 2 weeks of coming back, it is obvious that this game is cashing out on its old legacy. It used to be an amazing game I admitted. But if you're looking to come back for the good old days, there's not much iRO can offer here. 1) Pay2Win system: It is against term of service to purchase in-game gold (zeny) using real cash. Yet it is ok to sell your warp portal energies into zeny ( which is obtained by cash). So the only way to cheat is to give money to WarpPortal. Cash shop items also rendered many other in-game gear useless. And the only way to upgrade safely to +9 is to choke up $20-$50 in game cash for it.2) CheatersThere are so many bots in this game. Honestly I only see around 100-300 active players in game, and the rest are either bots, vend bots, or afkers. Worst part is some bots are actually ok, I see them roaming around cities buffing people, and somehow that makes everything ok? Also there's this thing called ragial which is obviously run by third party bot systems. 3) Lag issues and DDOS:It's 2015 and this game is still constantly lagging and I am using 75mbps fiber optics internet.  Also their servers keep crashing very often,  and usually at the worst time of the day.4) Immature game design decision:For those who paid for VIP for leveling, the GM sometimes decide to change the turn in quests so impossibly difficult that only godly geared veterans can do them. So you're likely wasting 1 week of VIP time afking or slow grinding your level. Also good luck finding public parties to play with outside of the turn ins.5) Slow customer support:It literally takes them days weeks or months to answer ticket issues. Worst part is they will just ban you and give you no reason sometimes. So you have to open them a ticket just to find out that some of the items you bought may came from a cheater, causing you to have weeks of downtime.6) Good luck finding players to play with.Finally, good luck finding enough players to play with. It's a dying game, and most of the time you'll be spending time waiting for a party to setup (30min - 3 hours recruiting time just to setup 15 minute leveling session)I'd say save your money folks. The old days of Ragnarok is loong gone.			"

												One of the first MMORPGs to grace the Internet. It still has the same look and feel from 2004. Despite it's outdated graphics, the sprites and music make this game cute and nostalgic enough to re-try again. The game is still active after all these years and has a very familiar feel to it. It might be hard for newer players to just pick it up without any outside research but still worth it.			"

												Ragnarok Online was for me the best MMORPG out there, but its official servers confront some issues among them:I. Economy. The cash shop of Ragnarok Online offers a lot of powerful hats and items, that aren't available normally inside the game, of course, you can purchase some of those items with IGC if someone else is selling them at the market, but this has two issues: 1. A player can become rich in a short amount of time by purchasing items from the Cash Shop and then selling them for IGC. Making it completely unbalanced for F2P users. 2. The price of those items is so high, it demands a ridiculous amount of effort to acquire only one item.II. Bots. The game is plagued with them. There are many solutions to deal with bots, but, either, Gravity got tired of trying or just didn't try hard enough.III. Lag. The server has lag peaks, not only on WoE time, but at any other time as well, it makes it horrible to play, even when alone. The problem must be either, the way the servers are distributed or their capacity, which is strange, considering there aren't that many active players nowadays.IV. Rates. People grow and time decreases, the rates of experience and drop of the game are so demanding, that you either, have a lot of time in your hands or you can forget about getting anywhere inside the game, it doesn't particularly appeal to new players and it didn't adapt it to its actual player base, causing a constant drop of users.As you see, those problems could be easily fixed, but Gravity never seemed to care about them, that's why, if you still want to play Ragnarok Online, I'd highly suggest you a private server instead.★★☆☆☆ | Loved it, but disliked iRO servers "

												As someone who has played this game for almost 11 years and for whatever reason is still playing it I would whole heartedly recommend you avoid this game. Many of the detracting factors are the people both playing and managing the game, not the game itself. The main PVP attraction of the game WoE (War of Empurium) is dominated by hypocritical guilds who proclaim on the official RO forums to be strictly against cheating while there is video documentation of their members cheating. Many of whom avoid bans simply by being friends with the GMs and CMs (Game Masters and Comunity Managers).These cheats include things like NDL (No delay, allows you to spam skills faster then you should ever be able to normally), auto pot (automatically spams potions in your inventroy faster then any human could do whenever you recieve damage to instantly heal any damage received), Maya Purple hack (within the game there are cards that drop from monsters that one can use to enchant items and one of the is a somewhat rare card called maya purple that lets you see invisible players) the list goes on.The GMs themselves have also assisted in the theft of high end items from various guild leaders by other guild leaders, screwed over large portions of the player base and economy to cater to single high profile players desires and even assisted in the creation of various cheating programs.Unlike most other ragnarok servers iRo has a feature that removes all incentive to explore the world called gramps. An NPC who resides within the eden group who gives you a daily quest to hunt 400 of two different monsters and gives you (if I'm not mistaken) 1.5x the combined exp of the 400 monsters as quest exp and sends you to a special map where these monster are. The monsters change each week and what they change to is somewhat dependant on what the community wants (or what one high profile player wants). usually the quest is very straight forward, other times it throws monsters that the general populace is untrained to handle as most of the time the monsters are usually ones that can be one shot by the primary AoE damage dealer Rangers, and there are a decent number of monsters that will end up in these maps that can not be one shot by a ranger and can easily wipe untrained parties.To say gearing in the game is reliant on the cash shop would be a profound understatement. Most of the important gear either comes from the cash shop, needs to be upgraded with items from the cash shop to be worthwile or both. Many items require being upgraded to +7 or +9 to see any useful bonuses, but the safe limit for most gears is +4 and failing an upgrade past that limit destroys that item permanently. However in the cash shop there is usually a box that may or may not give you safe 7 certs, which allow you to safely ""attempt"" to upgrade past the safe upgrade level once per certificate (these certificates can be obtained in game but only through the exchange of high end boss drops or lengthy quests). To upgrade past +7 you must either buy special ores from the cash shop that will cause your gear to downgrade if you fail an upgrade or wait for an event to be put in that has increased rates of upgrading your gear past +7 but can also downgrade your gear using a seperate cash shop ore.In closing if you really want to try this game, I strongly recommend you either find a private server that suits you or find a way to play on one of the other countries servers.TL;DR: playerbase consists of stupid entitled brats, GMs encourage them to be stupid entitled brats, ALL the big guilds cheat, almost all of your leveling through 56 to 175 can be done without ever stepping foot outside of any town (can even do 1-175 without stepping foot oustide of a town if you have connections) and cash shop items are mandatory to achieve anything. Go find a good private server of this game, you probably won't regret it.			"

												This is for the Classic Loki server. I have not played on the Renewal server.In terms of a decade old MMORPG, Ragnarok really hits home for the nostalgia factor. Gameplay is still smooth and fun. I quite enjoy playing.That said....The botting is rampant, don't bother trying to sell anything through vending. Someone has more on sale for less because bots.War of Emperium is a cycle of 3-4 guilds exchanging castles on a weekly basis. If you want to try and bring a new guild in, be prepared to be squashed by maxed out veterans wearing god-items.The market is beyond skewed. The botters have so much on the market that you are LUCKY if you keep a vigilant eye on sites like ragial.com for good deals, as some poor sap tries to undercut the botters of their excessive amounts of loot.To counter the botters, folks will often crack ""dead branches"" (spawns high-level mobs) where bots frequent in an attempt to grief kill them. Chances are you will die a few dozen times to these things walking from Prontera to Izlude or just trying to get to your hunting grounds.Logging on, the server is usually at 500+ players. Of that, I suspect 150-200 are vending and about 100 are actual human players. The rest are botting.With the population so low, it does make the game a bit more fun, in terms of not having to fight over mob spawns (unless it is a profitable area with decent returns, in which case you'll be fighting with botters for mobs) and Prontera is, pretty much, the only place one will find Vendors. There are some in Payon, sometimes. Ragial.com's bot only survery's Prontera/Payon, so why vend elsewhere?There are constant ""jump"" events. Events where people can take their character from lvl 1 to 70 in a day with a few simple quests.Falling outside of the 15 level limit for shared exp in parties will leave you lonely and bored as the rest of your guild refuses to help you catch up because there is no profit for them in it, despite having helped them along...TL;DR, plan to play a solo game and you'll have fun. If you played this back in the day, Classic Loki is, pretty much, exactly the same game you played 10 years ago.Despite all the annoying and frustrating things I listed above, I still like the game. I just wish there were fewer botters. :(			"

												Hi steamers. I played Ragnarok Online religiously before it was released on steam and while it was on steam. Although it seems my hours are not logged, They are there. I have had the best times in this game. It really breaks my heart to not recommend this game.Best friends of mine who played this for decades, girl friends who hated my soul for WoE timed events, craziest card drops that changed the whole tide of war, awesome battles in WoE, and PvP. Please beleive me. I am trying to warn you of your current time.Year 2000. Alpha and Beta stages all alike. This game was the best MMORPG you would ever of played, even surfacing vanilla WoW Imo if u had a chance to play it. PVP and Guild WoE slaughtered the idea of capture a flag. Since around 2005 till now its cash shop has screwed and spread like a virus crossing the korean world and globably to not just this game but many others. It has ruined this game. This game is also ran on a bot fest economy, if it isn't then problems start showing up. This is another hatred of many. But the problem is that its needed, yet not allowed, supposedly lol.This game has turned into a phantasmal ghost yet people still feed into it and I can't blame them, It's beautiful. Not alot of games come close to the joyous, no holding of the hand feel of entering a world such as midgard. There is always something to do unless you have it all. Venturing map to map as your cool class, seeing and slaying awesome pixel monsters, hopefully with friends. Hearing some classic music that makes your nostalgic sense kick in always, and collecting items such as cool hats, accesories, and of course those cards. Gosh, next to increasing your skills and stats through an allocation system. You will never wanna leave.But heres the hard truth. This free game still lives because of the real life dirty money still being pulled through botting and idiocracy. You either need to be in this game to be slaving someone, becoming a botter, or selling into the cash shop. But why not do it all? Lol. Zero game experienceIt will never shine like it used to and as a retired vet take my word of advice. You are better playing on a private server or just a different game. The people playing this game are mainly young millennials experiencing a zombie game full of bright colors and cool effects being mislead, or adults still milking this game dry. Do not be mislead by my words.R.I.P. RO "

												Can't help but recommend this game. Yes it's old like other people have said but it's graphics were setup in  way so they don't age. Wonderfull 2D sprites in a amazing easy on the eyes 3D world. I've actual played this game since late Alpha, early Beta, about the 1999-2000 time frame. And I still play to this day, though mainly on the classic server.Beside the easy on the eye graphics another amazing feature is the customization you can do with your character's stats and skills. Unlike nearly every other game on the market you stats matter. Your character's ablity will change massively based on what stats you take.Want a Swordsman that dodges attacks and hits faster instead of just taking hits and having high hit points ? Put points in to Agility instead of Vitality. This means you trade High Hitpoints and high defense for High Flee (dodge) and high Attack speed. You then could go on to make a Agility based knight or Crusader with your swordsman. Or go the middle of the ground and do a hybrid of Agility and Vitality, You might not dodge as well as pure agility or have as much hitpoints as pure Vitality but you can take less damage per hits then agility based characters, and dodge more then pure vitality. And this is just the start of it, You can go pure support acolyte forgoing increased melee damage for the ability to heal massive amounts of damage, or for a true acolyte and have a mix of Melee damage and Healing ability. Want a Mage that beats things as well as toss magic at them? Put points into Strength, Vitality, and Agility, instead of going pure intelligence. You lose magic damage but can dodge, take hits, and do better melee damage then a pure magic caster. Go the sage route and get the skills that let you move while casting and add the chance to auto cast a low level bolt spell while your hitting monsters.  Like making money, while beating on things with axes, swords or maces? Go a Merchant class character. They don't have the Melee skills of other classes but you can carry more loot or healing potions items then any other class, can buy cheaper and sell for more then any other classes, have access to a cart to carry even more loot/potions, and use your fortune to pay the god of the merchants to attack your enemies (Mammonite skill). Want to craft potions or weapons, take your Merchant to ether Alchemist or Blacksmith. And even Blacksmith and Alchemist have the ability to go Pure Battle, pure Crafting, or a Middle ground, not building items as well as their pure counter parts but still being able to fight for themselves.And there are many other classes to chose from like Archers, thief, TaeKwon Kid, Ninja, Gunslinger ans Super Novice. On top of all that it's free to play, with subscription players (only 7 bucks a month) only get 50% more experience and loot drops, larger storage and other minor abilities. I've spent most of my time since it's gone free to play not using a subscription (they call it VIP) and had no problems with it. So give it a try, nothing to lose but a lot of your free time, and a lot of fun to be had.edit: fixed some spelling issues			"

												First MMO I've ever played.. This game brings back sooo many good memories. The music in this game never gets old and brought a tear to my eye when I came back to playing it after many years. I still remember that excitement I felt when I created my very first character all those years ago and all I wanted to do was explore the world of Rune Midgard. Sure the graphics can't compete with today's more modern games, but then again today's more modern games don't have the sentimental value this one will always have for people like me who remember talking about this game in school and then rushing home to continue an adventure with friends. I can only hope that they will make a (third) remake of the game that only involves making the graphics better while maintaining virtually everything else to preserve the ""feel"" of the original.

												Lets be clear: I love RO.  My username is a result of my love of RO.  I played on iRO all those years ago, and broke into tears when I hear the Prontera Theme for the first time in years.Thing is, all that love is nothing more than rose tinted glasses now.  This game is old.  REALLY old.Old time Thief players (like me!) will easily understand that much of the combat is literally just ""Right Click, AFK""  Sure it gets more involved once you go up against MVPs and play in PvP/WoE, but fact of the matter is that you still have to chew through the leveling to get there.  Fast travel is still ""Blow entire newbie fortune on Kafra, or blow entire newbie fortune on FWing spam"".  Unless you're a Priest.  There are also really archaic mechanics like how spell channeling is completely cancelled when you take damage; dumb fact, but that's the whole reason why I hate Mages to this day.Thankfully, at least the graphics aged well.  The styalized look somehow managed to hold up for more than a decade, and the game itself could literally run on a toaster.  Also, you don't have to deal with ye olde iRO ""Server Connection Failed"" shenanigans as often as we used to, nor do you need to deal with a steep grind (by today's standards) due to the questing system...although said system is rather haphazardly cobbled together.If you're an oldie, at least Warp Portal set up a Classic server because you'll be completely lost on the Renewal ones.  Quests are nice, but mob spawn locations and even spawn power were COMPLETELY overhauled.  Simple example: Zombies are now less dangerous than Skeletons.  The level of a Kobold is roughly 3x higher than it used to be.  At least Porings are still Porings...			"

												This game... Oh boy this game. Where do i even start,  For starters i am what you would call an old time veteran when it comes to Ro1. This game and me go way back, I couldn't even tell you how many years/months/days i have spent running around in this game. This is one of those classics situations where i have a sudden wave of nostalgia and emotion run through my head just thinking about it.Now, here's the nitty. I have of course played this game, i was an avid hard core player of Ragnarok, But i moved on to other things and basically rarely ever turned back unless i was just casually hopping on to see what changed or for nostalgia purposes. And let me tell you this game is not the game it was back in 2002-2007. Oh no, The new IRO is just a mess of Trolls/Bots a very strange slapped on questing system as well as many other band-aided systems trying to keep this game afloat or up to par with what i would call mmorpg standardization. Many server merges causing lots of strange naming conflicts and renaming issues. Some people given free character name changes, While others somehow being skipped over.The game at its core is still the same old Ragnarok, But the magic that is Rune Midgard has just somehow been lost somewhere down the road these past years. Partially the community, and just the way the game is ran, The game even seems to somehow run worse now than it did years ago, as if the Server technology has been downgraded even tho computers have gotten better.So what is my final verdict? I would say give the game a shot, But don't go into the game expecting a lot, It's pretty laggy and seems very quiet at times. gravity definitely seems to be letting the game run its course, But on the bright side at least it seems to be alive and probably kicking for many years to come.

												New player experience:Downloaded the game only because I play Ragnarok Online 2 and wanted to see the original game that started it all.  I was amazed to see an old game filled with tons of players!  High levels as well as new ones. 11 hours into the game recieved a whisper from a lvl 99 who gifted me a large sum of zeny (in-game money)  and a sword and warmly welcomed me to the game.  Now this is what community is all about!  Here is my review...PROS:Very little to no lag despite a very high online population.Relaxing music that changes with each area, never boring, enjoyable+Amazing community! General chat is quiet with people mostly opting for private chat options.Old style graphics but very well done with cute sprites.F2P or VIP (F2P gets 9 character slots by default) Yay!Cash shop is available but never felt like it was in my face prompting me to buy every second like some games.Progressive class system with indepth character customization.Starter area tutorial. Don't skip reading this!CONS:City streets clogged with player vendor stalls. NEUTRAL: ( could be good or bad )Learning curve. Online research sort of required to fully understand Class progression.New players may not always know where to go but there are NPC city guides that help.Mostly a go kill X number of monsters game.Top down view though you can rotate view and zoom in a little.I highly recommend you give this one a try.

												This review is on certain parts of the community and usefulness to new or interested players. (For the record, I have invested several weeks into the game by now. I just use the exe from the installation folder to bypass Steam's account creation requirement)On to business: Ragnarok's main server Chaos, the most popolar Renewal server, isn't very accomodating to new players or returning players. The entire time I played I saw folks chatting to each other a grand total of twice. Oweing to the fact that half of the players are dual client shops, this still gives about 1500 active players who must already have their cliques or guilds and chat privately only. So, if you planned on asking questions to find out where to go in the very open world that is Ragnarok, plan to feel rather isolated.If you plan on visiting the forums, you will find that there seems to be an internal war of sorts between newcomers and veteran players, where new players don't truly feel welcome. This is very unfortunate, as I too am a returning player and I wanted to reinvest myself into the game, but have decided it is not worth my time.Don't expect timely updates in game, as it seems that the folks in charge of placing updates have to follow a specific schedule that is several months behind their Asian counterparts, which leaves players exposed to bugs and poor update planning.Based on these observations, I thus cannot recommend this game to new players, which is very sad for me as I wear thick nostalgia goggles from playing as a child. only play this if you have plyaed iRO in the past and are widely experienced with it.

												Where to start...This is one of those games that if you played it when it first came out, years would pass, you would try multiple other MMOs and realize that you keep coming back to Ragnarok. There's just a certain charm to it.  On the surface this might seem like a usual simple grind-fest, however the game is very complex. Mainly because it gives you complete freedom to build your characters the way you want (and make many, many mistakes in the process). Want to build a battle-priest because you do not like monks? - go for it.  Want to make a full-crit assassin with the sole purpose of hunting high-def monsters? - go right ahead. The beauty is that with enough research and equipment planning you could make even the most bizzare character builds work.  Or you will fail miserably and realize that you want to try again, with a different skill-set, different stats, different cards and equipment..possibilities are limited only by your imagination.Even though the game is quite old, it definitely held up very nicely and is worth a try.

												You're better off with private servers.I was excited with Steam first came out with this. I mean, I used to play this game from the beginning of middle school to my high school years. And now I've graduated. But when I started to play Steam's server for RO, I realised it wasn't helpful at all. You're out of luck if you're alone, if you're poor, and/or if you don't know the basics of RO. So either you study outside of RO, or you play with friends. Otherwise, Steam's server was a huge let down.			"

Don't run it in full screen, you have been warned.) However, it retains the charm quite nicely and the new renewal patch makes grinding more fun with kill quests.

												I've played RO since 2000, but only discovered that it was in steam a few months ago. The steam version itself is ok... Not the best definately not, but not the worst either. It is a pixel-ish game. So if graphics are a big thing for you, RO is not for you. RO is possibly one of my favorite RPGs of all time. Not just from nostalgia alone, but there are certain decisions Gravity made that was just amazing. Here are some of them:-You don't have to chose your class immediately.  -- it's a small design factor since you do go to a class system, but having the player wait till lvl 10 to get a class makes all     that grinding a bit better. You grind in every RPG, but knowing that that grind can really change your character progression in a more significant way than just a few skills and attributes for your already established class. -Player to player trade is encouraged with the merchant class  -- This is a big factor to me since it gives all that dead space worth something. Most MMORPGs have this grand city, with only 30-40% actually relevant. Having a AH does make trading simpler, but less exciting in my opinion. Since selling your stuff to another player is best with the merchant class, most guilds have at least one, and most players have at least one character that is a merchant, and you kinda do it with a stall in the city street, and since you dont want to be an a$$ the city streets have more purpose than simple pathways. RO is beyond its peak. I can say that out loud, but theres no doubt it is a great MMORPG. I wish  there are more games like RO.			"

Cause this game has been Put to the side There is TREMENDOUS LAG Which Results in miss clicks, Getting killed, Miss casts, Aswell as terrible walking. I dont know what happened but i used to play this game on my OLD BAGE Desktop that was slower then molasis AND i was on dial up at the time an i never experinced this Much lag in the game.... So obviously the developers REFUSE to update servers for the huge surge of players... or for any reason from what my knowledge And I hear people Say ""oooo customize this, Download lag reducer that, And ping cleaner crap"" NO this game should work right out of install i shouldnt have to download 18 programs (PAID and FREE ALIKE) just to get to a BARELY playable stateAnd for those of you thinking he Dosent know what hes talking about, Well i have played This game Alot in the past And present....

												Ragnarok Online is a 13 year old MMORPG that has charmed its way into the hearts of millions and continues to this day. Collect hats, PvP, PvE, run insances, make friends, and many many more activities can be done in this grandfather MMO.iRO is a F2P server, but you can purchase what is called VIP to speed up your leveling experience. I would reccomend this if you are serious about the game. I will not lie, the cash shop makes this game somewhat P2W but it is not impossible to play without spending a dime. Overall I love this game and it has been a part of my life for the past 8 years and I would change any of the time that I have spent on this server. Long live Ragnarok Online.			"

												Overall: 6.5/10Art: 8/10Design: 5/10Graphics: 4/10Sound: 9/10With more than 10 years of history, Ragnarok Online is an old MMORPG game to many. At a quick glance - it may seem fun to you but however, the community of this game really makes up a lot of your in-game experience. Talking about community, this game has real players who gave you the cold shoulders because of the vast amount of bots in the game. Lot's of Philipino and Asian players, you know you could reach out to them and make some friends if you are one of them - and assuming they don't ignore you. They are generally cocky and arrogant, but few handful would still help you out if you are lucky enough to meet them. Noobs start out weak (of course) and without a proper guild, party and friends, its almost impossible to get powerful unless you spend on the game. Well, duh. That's the main purpose.This game has a rich art base and many fans would draw them for fun, laughter, peace and joy. It's a 3D game, and a very successful one during its time - one would not simply ignore the art and just play the game. The art is great in my point of view and I do admit that their art makes me get hooked to the game. You will rave about the awesome sprite of your character, no matter the class you are in.The core design of the game offers you guild wars, Player VS Player, vending, and turn-ins. (for exp) It's a wonderful world out there to explore as well, though you might just go for the shortcut and teleport around the world if you purchase their premium services. With that said, the design is very multiplayer heavy - and you will only gain from it if you play with someone else. There will be events held often in the game, be sure to take advantage of it and not miss it ! Wide diversity of classes, you will always find a class that suits you most. However, some special classes do not offer you rebirths - so you lack some extra stat and skill points which makes you weaker than most players.Graphics is cool. The skills animation are awesome in my opinion and they are truly worth raving about as you scale later on in to the game where you do job advancement for your character. There are items in the game that needs to be purchased in real cash to exchange for better graphical aesthetics. Other than that, the animation might be a little choppy due to the latency of the game - it depends on where you are from and all.Sound. The reason why I gave sound a 9/10 is because they are really awesome. You can grab them in your directory for free as well, and I have used the BGMs of this game before in my school projects as well. They have a wide range from classical to metal, and different maps invoke your feelings and really puts you into the world of Ragnarok with their music.Summary: Do NOT try to play this game alone, because you will probably ragequit due to all these bots who would KS you and helpdesk takes a super long time in looking and solving your queries. It can be a very fun game despite my critics, you should try this timeless game out before giving judgement of your own. Support the game if you like it, but I would highly doubt it because of poor customer service. Lastly, great way to kill time with your friends! I have hundreds of playing hours in this game and and made awesome lifelong friends - talking about a gamer for 4 good years in here.			"

												Rangarok Online (RO) was one of my very first MMORPG games, and quite an amazing experience it was. The graphical art style and blend of 2D/3D looks very good and pleasing to the eyes, especially for a 2003 video game. But what really gives me the most nostalgic value was the soundtrack, RO has one of the greatest soundtracks to ever exist and has always been very memorable for me and thousands of other players around the world. Don't mistake RO for being a downgrade from its 'sequel' Ragnarok Online 2 - as both games are almost nothing alike and RO2 is a very disappointing 'sequel' for any old RO fan out there. Play this if you haven't already, and ignore RO2's existence. You can thank me later.			"

From the begging for money and parties to lvl up, to the huge raids onto super hard dungeons, to the pvp, and the general chatting with your party after a large quest to kill a boss at 5 a.m. this game is really fun. BUT i wouldnt recommend you dedicate your life to lvl a character in this version (vanilla) cuz the exp rates are insanely low.I recommend you to download a server with increased exp and item rates, they come in x5 for the hardcore MMO fans to the x100 for the more casual players, and most of them are free and in any languague you look for them.

												Great game. I'm a big fan of classic but unfortunately the server has a small population. The main server is pretty good, but a little too rewarding. In classic, we had to decide on a class and then travel to the specific city. Now you get everything handed to you. Come find me on classic. I luv you			"

												Ragnarok Online is a game where you star as a ruthless warlord who murders tons of small, fluffy, blobby creatures. Revel in victory when your murder entire villages of fuffly animals (including the younglings) Collect and build your character until you level up to the ulitment warlord. Start a guild and go on a murder spree with your fellow maurders Never go to prontera, we dont goto prontera			"

												Ragnarok online is a great game but no with this server. I keep getting the disconnect in the middle of the fight and when travel around the server map when suddenly you keep getting the disconnect. The server is also lag as hell sometime. Their supporting costumer is also ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as hell like you can wait really long time before their team get to you. Compare with the quality high end graphic game that I use steam to play with hardly lag or delay.This server don't deverse to stay on steam.			"

												Ragnarok Online is a free to play JRPG from a Korean developer.  It worked, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok, was understandable.  It is a old grind centered game, and level cap is 150.  I had problems with game not reponding on map transfers, maybe because game servers might be in Asia.  Try it, if you like old JRPGs. For more info:

												I'm not far into the game yet, but it seems good so far. I played Ragnarok 2 a bit, and this one definitely has a difference. So it was kinda nice to see a similar game in a different style. The only problem I have with this game would be that I have the hardest time getting my character to actually walk where I tell them to. My mouse will probably be broken before I finish this game, due to how many times I have to click before my character walks.			"

												AWESOME Massive Online Multiplayer Role Playing GameRagnarok has been my third RPG game that I have probably ever played. The first two, League of Legends and Dofus, really weren't the greatest thing- hence role playing games aren't my selectable game genre. But Ragnarok is quite pleasurable for casual gamers.The game features the usual Role Playing tactic in which you build your character in your first few levels, then take a pernmament ""job"" that determines the type of player you play forever. Of course, some people might get bored of their class eventually, but Ragnarok makes up for this lack. Ragnarok allows you to have three character profiles at a time. So if you are willing to start fresh or try another character class, you can! No more having to stick to one destiny for the rest of E T E R N I T Y .Ragnarok can be confusing to new players, the game is open freely and vast, and easy to get lost in. you will spawn at first near the heart of the entire game map, from there you can build up your job skill, then be let go into the depths of Ragnarok's world. All areas have different mobs that can be passive or hostile, they also vary by Level everywhere. You can find a relaxing spot here and there with easy passive mobs, or you can run into a mob that is 40 levels HIGHER than you, and it WILL ATTACK you at it's will. This leaves gamers to be adventureous, alert, and competitive. This concept is what probably brings in my attention.Ragnarok is also fun to play with friends. Beacause it is Free to Play, you can ask your friend to join without any worries. The probable downside is you have to create an account on their website, which shouldn't be too hard if you have spare emails for probable spam.I highly recommend this game to great RPG players who are looking for challenge, Ragnarok, despite the other RPGs I have played, really adds up to have many differences that give players more freedom. Role Playing Gamers would not be disappointed.I somewhat recommend this game to those who casually play RPGs, Ragnarok Online is a great game to play on your spare time, but sometimes you can get really lost like me - if that happens.... pray that you'll make it back without dying, or just die and respawn at the heart of the map, you get to keep your stuff, but you loose some of your experience. Oops.			"

												Seems they allow you to play three different versions of Ragnarok I on Steam. Classic, RePlay, and their newest edition. I've been a constant fan ever since they first started; I still remember when they had issues properly coding the 'Bash' move for swordsmen. I started playing their newest server, and though it stays reminiscent of what I'm used to, it seems to have molded for the future that MMOs in general have carved out for themselves. Instead of monthly fees, they have a cash shop. They make items for new interesting events thta I wish I could take place in, for say, the hat quests, but even though I am a high enough level to collect the items, I am not a high enough level to initiate the holiday event. I find that fairly irritating, personally. Holiday events should be available to all, and accomplished by those whom can, but it shouldn't be limited to those that spend hours and hours, if not possibly days in front of their computer trying to speed level in order to catch the event in time.But, that's just an event. The market has certainly changed. I remember when a 4-leaf clover costed millions because of what you had to go through in order to afford it. You would have to painstakingly kill hundreds or thousands of vine whipping stationary, but pretty mean monsters, pretty much giving up the hours you normally would use to level in order to find that one item. Now, they're being sold on market for 50k. Advanced drop rate? Or is it because they're so easily accessible now as a chance item in Giftboxes?I have more virtues than vices for this game still. There are things that have changed, things that I wish was still what I am used to, but I can always play the 'classic' server. I still love the community, and it's pretty social! It's still worth hours of fun, and some time I want to see them have cool achievements for Steam for me to accomplish. I highly recomend this game as a simple MMO that has been striving with a several thousand person community for about ten years. It was my first MMO, and it will probably be my last, at that. Why? Because every time I step away from it, one month later I get another random craving for it and end up running right back to this amazing community.			"

												I loved this game back before renewal came in. The music and playstyle are addictive. I just wish more MMOs were like this one. I haven't found anything that replaces this game for me.If you want to get a really enjoyable game play out of this one, start with some friends on the classic server. Classis is far kinder to new players then renewal.			"

												(I downloaded it and let it run for 5 mins just so I could review this game)I played Ragnarok Online when I was 15, 16, 16, 18, 19 and early 20s. I am now 23, and although I don't play it anymore; I can safely say that it is THE game of my childhood. Its an emotional, beautiful, breathtakingly HUGE, diverse, complicated and a time-consuming adventure. I am confident that over 15 months of my life were spent on this game, (or atleast with the game open overnight so that I could set up a market, or so that I could idle in a town and fall asleep to the gorgeous soundtrack.)Obviously this game is old, but it has soul. Mmorpgs do not have soul these days. WoW has no soul, Ragnarok 2 most likely has no soul, but RO1 is the epitome of beauty in the gaming world.If this isn't your thing, (grinding, patience, socialising) then maybe a private server would suit you more, but if you want a true experience then download this game now and don't waste a second. The graphics have aged very well, and the gameplay is second to none!10/10!			"

												I grew up on this game.  Most of high school, me and my friends played this.  It was beautiful, and still is.  One of my favourite games of all timeI personally don't like the Steam version.  The original client is vastly superior.Music is still as beautiful as ever, probably one of the best soundtracks i've ever hear.  To this day I can still remember some of the songs.  Sound effects were also great.Not many people play this anymore, which is a shame, but expected.  If you can find a populated server with the orginal client, then definitely get it.			"

The game has changed a little, I remember having to used to grind in the Payon dungeon in the early levels, but nowadays its a bit different. Overall it seems to be easier to reach the higher levels than before so that's either good or bad to some people.

												I'll admit I am a bit naive expecting to play a MMORPG that is older than me, expecting there will be the same amount of players as it did when it was first released.Don't get me wrong, Ragnarok Online is an awesome game, and is certainly still much better than it's successor Ragnarok Online 2. However, a MMORPG cannot be a good MMORPG without a playerbase, because without one, that would make it a single-player game. The single-player experience and MMO experience of the same game is totally different.That said, the ""playerbase"" of the current RO is just what all MMORPG suffers from; AFKers as well as bots, automated third-party programs that does the grinding for you. I can't recommend RO on Steam. I would recommend RO private servers instead.3 out of 10.			"

												I'd only recommend this game to people who loved it back then more than 10 years ago; as comparing this game to current MMORPG standards - it just fails in many aspects.Pros:~Great music~Nice community~Deep and plenty of customizations on how you build your characters~Tons of content to explore, unlock, and enjoy~Well done sprites that still looks awesome even after 10 yearsCons:~Outdated gameplay - compared to today's standards, RO is grindy, repetitive, and stale~Unforgiving character customization - it's easy to screw up your character if you do not understand how to build your skills and stats~Still tons of botters - 10 years and maps and dungeons are still infested with gold farming bots~Laggy servers - it says ""International"" but if you're playing anywhere outside the US, it's gonna be a laggy messOVERALL: 5/10~If you loved it back then and don't mind the current problems it has then go try it out - even if just for the sake of nostalgia.~If you haven't played RO before, and are looking for an F2P MMORPG, then skip this one and try one of the many, modern (and much better) MMORPGs out there.

												It's an open world MMORPG with fast combat (even insane at later levels) and a TON of class variation. 9 Character slots arent enough to explore even half of what it offers, and those classes change even more when you max out. Hitting 99 lets you become an improved class with new skills and higher stats, and hitting 99 again lets you break the cap as an entire new class and go for 150 with another whole skill tree. There is no specific path to take in the game, you can go anywhere at any time assuming you can survive. The farther you get from a town, the stronger the enemies become, and it's not uncommon to get into dangerous or challenging situations facing a horde of enemies. The game is best played with friends or a guild IMO, but out of 10 years of online gaming, i haven't played an overall better MMO, especially from KR.			"

												Based vaguely on norse mythology, you follow the story of our hero as he wades through great cities filled with hundreds of zeny chat bots. Your character struggles as he is pushed into the centre of a war wherein he spends half his time lying on his back with the title 'Return to last save point' above his aggrivated corpse, the words 'skill has failed' echoing through his mind.Your hero will meet many others on his journey whom he talks to and will immediately vanish upon mention of the word 'bot', 'report' or 'god-poing.' The many NPC's you meet will likely ask you to fetch several hundred incredibly rare items for incredible equipment that will offer a massive increase of 1 to your agility (wow!) or maybe even 2! (but not without minusing 20 off your vitality).The many incredible monsters and foes will fall before our hero's hundreds of many carefully-saved potions from his alt merchant whom has the 'discount' skill and is actually able to afford basic necessities for stepping more than two meters outside of town! Provided that he saves up for a few days..Our great hero will be rewarded from these great enemies with clovers, feathers and an incredible 0.05% increase to his next level! That means he only has to kill one thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine more monsters to advance to level 2!You'll say ""Wow!"" you'll say ""Oh!"" you'll say ""Please end the maddening terror that is my life!""

												I love this game. Would I recommend it to newbies? Thats always the hard question because of the learning curve. I always tell my friends when they try to play that either you suck or you rock those are the only ways to play RO and it takes some dedication to reach the good end. Aside from that it has great class selection, wonderful skill animations, and an overall art style that really enjoy aside from the low-rez 3d terrain. One of the things that I enjoy with this game is that it doesn't hold your hand like the new MMORPGs. Sure the new tutorial is designed for weiners but they made it so hard to find most of the instructors for the tutorial quests it balanced out anyways.10/10 no wieners allowed so b gud			"

The game is still good even much more enjoyable than the 2nd Ragnarok game but the lag is killing the fun, so if you hate lag so much then you should avoid playing this game until they are fixed (Which I doubt they will).

												Nostalgia vs Reality - not a review~ Nostalgia got the better of me and seeing this available on Steam, I just had to install it. This was afterall, the first MMO I ever played back in 2000-2003 and also the first MMO community (twRO) with whom I had the good fortune to go adventuring with. Only five minutes into RO, I was entranced by the comfortable familiarity of it all. -/lazy insert everything I love about RO-Soon though, the nostalgic glow started to wear off...I missed the feeling of being a wide-eyed newbie, falling down and picking myself up again, bravely exploring a whole new world. I missed the community of twRO, I missed...I missed...Reality was, the RO of today is somewhat the same but different. Without going into details, some game mechanics are different, simply put. Anyways, my time on RO again after a decade (half of which was subsconsciously spent wishing that I was somehow still playing RO!) was deeply conflicting instead. Also, the awesome fun I had back then in RO also seemed to pale a little in comparison to the 'newer' fun I had in more recent MMOs; what a fickle mistress the human mind is when it comes to comparisons? The best of nostalgia can only happen when we look back at something and remember only the good but none of the bad and do no comparisons! My dear RO, I'll stick to remembering that lovely and familiar smile of yours, marvelling at the chemistry we had with each other and the good old times together with that community of twRO. :)I am not allowing myself to be stuck in the worse, for moving forward is as simple as trying something new: a relationship, creative projects, a new television show or game while holding fast to the firm knowledge that I was fortunate enough to have these fond memories of Ragnarok Online in my lifetime. tl;dr***Try it casually if you are new to RO (and to most modern 'action' MMOs) - but don't compare amongst them for RO can come across as antiquated; that won't bode well for the game nor for ya. I also had lag issues with this now and annoying chunky rubberbanding. ***Don't even try RO again, if you had played it before and especially if you had loved it to bits previously. There's no need to make new memories, your old ones of RO are precious enough and good enough forever.			"

												Основа игрового процесса это конечно же выбор класса персонажа. Раскачав персонажа-новичка до десятого уровня вы можете выбрать ему начальную профессию. От выбора первой профессии будет зависеть кем персонаж будет на более высоких уровнях, т.к. в игре присутствует разветвление классовых навыков: к примеру если вначале вы избрали себе мечника, то впоследствии перед вами встанет выбор - Рыцарем он будет в дальнейшем или Крестоносцем. Также достигнув максимального уровня в игре у вас будет возможность взять и продвинутую профессию - он сделает  персонажа еще сильнее одарив его всевозможными бонусами. В Рагнарёке достаточно развитая и продуманная система PvP, что делает возможным проведение чемпионатов, самый популярный из которых мировой, определяющий сильнейшие комманды среди стран - Ragnarok World.

												Ragnarok Online is one of the few MMORPG i have ever played. Back then Ragnarok Online was entirely pay to play so in order to play, private servers were made. Until gravity made it free-to-play which made people play the original servers rather than private servers.So, Ragnarok Online is a animated 3D fantasy MMORPG. Players can move around and explore the world through a simple yet polish point and click controls. Ragnarok Online has an interesting system where players have two levels, a base level and a job level, How you raise those levels is by gaining experience either by clearing quests or killing monsters, but the job level tends to level up slower. Each base level earns you status points that can be allocated into different attribute and each job level earns you job points which you can allocate into skills which the player can use.What makes Ragnarok Online feel like a complete game is the large selection of job advancements.

												Haven't played the Steam version but this is basically the very first MMORPG game I've played :) Brings back memories! I would love to try this out again one day. I rate this game as one of the best MMORPG games around! There are so many job classes, including 2nd and 3rd jobs and a lot of maps to grind from. Quests isn't the main focus for this game but you will have to grind a lot in order to become useful in its best feature, the WOE (guild war). The WOE or War of Emperium is basically a guild vs guild taking over castles when its WOE time and it is the most enjoying part of the game! I also think this game has the BEST soundtrack of ALL MMORPGs around. I would sometimes login just to hear the music. Each city/map has their own theme song! My favorites are Prontera city, Gonyryun, Alberta, and even the WOE music!The game does look childish because of its graphics but what do you expect from a very very old game? Try it out and meet people to guild with and get stronger and get better in WOE and you won't be disappointed. This game is a MASTERPIECE!11/10			"

												Don't get me wrong I was a huge RO fan back in the day. I even went to the trouble of digging up my old account and playing my lv 96 hunter. Or I should say I would have however there was one problem. The game is unbearably laggy, unplayable as it is now. Which is really sad because I would have liked to start playing again however it is impossible.I used to play this game on 56k dial up with less lag than this so obviously the devs have it running on some crap hardware with crap connection. Oh well it was nice to see my old characters again but there is no point trying since you will die over and over due to massive lag.I cannot recommend this game even though I put a stupid amount of time into it in the past. It is nothing but nostalgia value now. How people actually manage to play this game now I do not know.			"

												Old classic. It used to be a great game full of teamwork, endless monster mashing and fun hat collecting. With the arrival of new systems, the game balance shattered, the direction of the mechanics felt a bit unsure. There is still a server with ""Classic"" settings, but the development on it is nothing new. The gameplay still feels satisfying, it is a really charming game, but a hard game to get into and requires a lot of patience.It's still a good game to boot up, but i wouldn't recommend it for newcomers.

												I admit, this game is a guilty pleasure of mine. I found it randomly on the internet when looking for games to play on my decade-old piece of scrap metal that was my last computer and, to my amazement, was pretty hooked. Back in the iRO days when I didn't have the money for a subscription I used to make multiple accounts just to play the 72-hour trial until I was told about private servers. Played those for a bit, found a few fun ones with a healthy population and then found out that WarpPortal had come out with RO for North America, free to play.Bursting with excitement I left my friends from the private servers to play this new completely legit, completely free server and...bots. Bots everywhere. Not once would I ever be around levelling and come across someone who isn't botting in one way or another, which had me feeling really down. Even when I played iRO my most favorite thing to do was explore the scenic places with my friends (the floating islands near Geffen, ruins in Morroc, Prontera's west gate garden) and hang out. So now that I had upgraded my computer I have long since left Ragnarok behind...Every now and then I get a rush of nostalgia that makes me want to play the game again and lo and behold I'm currently downloading it to play it again. Do I recommend this game to others? Absolutely. Botters aside, this game has an amazing soundtrack, neat places to explore and if you happen to come across a genuine player and you like each other, BE FRIENDS. Because you'll never know when another one like them will show up the next time you play.			"

												While I have fond memories of old school RO, I'd like to say that in the past 10 years we've advanced tech wise. Not so.This game does not even allow you to load it up to enter a simple log in screen. I already have an account and I'm asked again and again to sign up. I can't bypass this step, there's no ""I already have an account, skip me past this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"". Selecting cancel just throws you out of the client.From the numerous threads I've read, warp portal is having a number of issues, I do not recommend their track record to solve it.At this time, I do not recomend you play this game, with the plethora of MMO's out there, please do not waste your time, and/or money on Warp Portal, relying on the hope that they'll fix their busted ♥♥♥ launcher software.

												I've died a countless amount of times (meaning you lose a lot of experience) thanks to the lag and movement delay which I highly doubt they'll ever fix it or even look into. I could try attacking an aggro enemy and my character will move until he's two feet away from it and instead take the monster's abuse. The lag makes it so melee npcs can attack you from like 6 feet away.All in all, it might be better to simply move to a server with better latency...			"

												Ragnarok Online is one of my favorite MMORPGs out there. Maybe I've got my nostalgia goggles on or something, but I've always loved the art, pixel work, music and just overall feel to the game. (Although I will say the story itself and the dialogue is still -- since I started playing in 2004 -- some of the worst Engrish I've ever read. I can't understand a thing!)I've been playing the game since its launch in 2004 when it could barely run on my clunky, poorly-made computer and have been playing on and off since then. It's been over 10 years but I saw it on Steam and had to REALLY get back into it again. It's been a long time, but I think I can see what makes this game so addictive and yet so frustrating at the same time. At age 14 I was't exactly sure how to pinpoint the amazing things in this game, nor did I know how to word exactly what was wrong with the game, and how it got worse over the years.Basically there's about 394304034 bots, a Cash Shop which throws things off and the Engrish is so bad you can't understand the storyline if you tried. Also there's constant crashing and Gravity will ignore your emails for weeks until they feel bored and answer your question.10/10 would continue to play constantly and be treated like garbage			"

												I have been an avid iRO fan since 2004, and the game has seen its ups and downs. There has always been a pretty decent community and the Dev's are pretty good at keeping the game updated and working on issues - which is why the game has lasted so long and has a pretty positive player base. Since coming to Steam its definitely seen an increase in players, with even a new server added recently - so if youre a veteran player or new this is a great time to start! I'd like to mention also that there has almost always been an issue with botting, however they're taking an active role in supressing it and they keep at it regularly as well. All in all, a great MMO to play if you enjoy the Korean Anime styled type and you want to give a good piece of gaming history a try. There is more than enough to keep you interested with its huge arsenal of classes, builds, items, skills and gameplay. As a personal word of advice for in game longevity - no matter what class you choose to play, make a merchant and learn to sell items to help make some zenny. Anything from selling items to NPC's for even more, or selling valuable equipment and cards. You can check on Ragial.com for a good look at how things are selling too - money is a big factor in your ability to do end game so hopefully this well help some of you out!			"

												One word: YUSSS!!! This is quite possibly the only game on my pc that works and is anime, its adorable the graphics are a pleasure to the eyes and the speed is extroadinary especially comparing to the other games ive attempted on my pc. Other than the fact it is free it is also fun just moving around in the game, the only possible complaint i would have so  far is the small letters, viewable but not the easiest to read. That and the loading time is a few minuates long versus instant entry. but personally i believe it is worth the wait. Im so happy this game works i was going to be so dissapointed if i had to delete yet another game from my computer. ANIME + FREE + ACTUALLY WORKS = MUST HAVE!			"

												Used to be fun. I'd reccomend private servers now honestly though. NovaRo is a good one. Unfortunately the bots control the marketplace. Almost impossible to make reasonable zeny unless you buy cash shop items or have 100 bots running. The majority of people online are either vendors or bots. While many other players are doing gramps quests.If you want to get to max level buying exp manuals is almost mandatory. This adds up to a lot. I love this game but honestly feel it is best to play a private server. Some of them like NovaRO have zero bots. The main server is a little too cash shop reliant. And if you want to get the best stuff you may be very outclassed by people with a ton of bots or people who drop $100's on cash shop. "

												2002... i was a teenager discovering mmo's for the first time... boi let me tell you.. it was GLORIOUS... spending the end of primary and almost all high-school playing this game.. we're talking about farming.. like no kidding 1% exp in a day was an achievement and then we had.. delays... lag.. loading time.. you know the drill, but we were enjoying this game because HELL it was fun.. But i must say this, we are... 14 years later.... FOURTEEN years.. and... it didn't change.. same lag, same delay.. oh hey more job classes..and content/dungeons/etc.. Yet when you play a game that lags/delays on every single commands you do you might say..: "" Eh... can't be THAT bad right?"" Well honestly.. it's THAT bad.. it really is.. I'd give this game a 11/10 but since nothing improved for the lag/delay over so many years... all i can give it is a 4/10 because it's a great game but performance impact will give you a hard time enjoying it..I do recommend this game if you're RPG lover and like the old stylish format in 2D top-down view.. Give it a shot but try to find stable ""cough"" private ""cough"" servers  both pre-renewal and renewal once you got the basics in.. they are both different game type.Only reason i don't recommend it here is because of the server have huge lag/delay making it less than enjoyable compared to other one around.Hope you guys like this game as much as i did.

												A game with good music, a variety of zones and classes, buttloads of interesting monsters and cultural references. Aside from that, it's an insufferable grindfest. This isn't a path you should embark upon. Other games will give you much more joy and satisfaction for your time and effort. This will give very little, and you will work so very hard.

												I've played Ragnarok for over 10 years now, wow I feel old! It's a great game, and despite the complaints about the official, it's no worse than any other game with a ""cash shop"" or ""bot problem"". Honestly, they've improved a ton of stuff. I'm mostly just excited for the new hats. I'm not upset a free game has a cash shop, especially one this old... how else do you expect them to make money and keep it running?I'll admit, it's grindy and slow at times but it's nostalgic and fun for me. Glad to see it on Steam, makes it much easier to play!			"

												                      Its like runescape and maplestory jacked off all over my anime collection.Pros: people actually play it, im walking around and it doesnt feel like im walking around a dead mmo.         unforgiving and monsters that are your level actually can kill you.         comunity is allright, and i harldy see any bots spamming the chat about a website to buy gold.         theres a bit of classes: warrior, mage ,gunman, archer, merchant, monk ,healer , and a thief. Cons: you have 3 character slots unless you pay        you need to assign stat points correctly without knowing the stats  of the classes you want to be,wiki recommended                the only costomization for your character is in hats thats right hats, so its a tf2 rippoff.      All and all I think its a pretty cool game unforgiving, but I like my games, that way bretty fun. 7/10.			"

												I was pretty excited to see this game come onto steam after dumping many hours into it at the expense of my education (high school at the time).However, after losing all value in my account when they deleted all of my items and in-game money (apparently due to trading with bots, and the second time when I attempted to sell of what was left after the first delete)... I just can't get into it anymore.Any one that knows me, knows that I am happy enough to dump money into games for hats (and Ragnarok was no exception at the time)... however their over zealous mod team killed any further interest in the game.Add to this:- There really hasn't been any further innovation in the game- Warportal to Steam integration is as broken as in all of their previous games (if you already have an account, you can't launch via steam and making a new account that is tied to your steam always fails)- Horrible lag- Filled with bots and not many people- Insane grinding if you are starting from scratch (exponential levelling and drop chances less than 0.01% for all of the ""good"" equipment)- No facilitation of a ""Steam"" economy			"

												It's a classic with STELLAR music and great Artwork....but the new stuff they added has the absolute worst English Translation I have ever laid my eyes on, and I can't possibly recommend something with so little effort put into it. They've done some interesting new things with Quests and Navigation but the dialogue is just so ridiculous that it doesnt even matter.If they consistantly keep the Quest Flow going throughout the game, that could be interesting (assuming the Translation wasn't God Awful) but I have a feeling it's just the same grindfest it's always been, with the same stuck up wierd-♥♥♥ community it's always had.

												Only delusional vets who have invested more than 1000$ minimum, nostalgia fuccbois and girly girls pretending to be boy boys play this game. It's all about the pay2win kafra shop, refine gambling simulator and kawaii hats. Lots of bots that populate AT LEAST 50% of Chaos server. After pRO closed down, all the pinoys have been segregated into Thor server where no one knows how to speak english and is 1/4 that many players than Chaos server. Everyone likes to RMT although most never admit it in forums and there is a dedicated facebook group for each server. Some get caught some don't. All MvP cards are account bound and you 'd have to trust a GM to verify if it is legittimate or not. Some GMs are so incompetent that A.) they dupe your card and consider it legit B.) they take it out because it is NOT legit C.) They ban you without giving an explanation. D.) They don't respond to you after 1 month. The community is so small you will the same people in-game over and over and over again. There is also this one outvoiced vet who plays sinx that is the reason why classic server gets DDOSed everytime and have had guilds perma banned. Now you know why classic server is ♥♥♥♥ and will always be ♥♥♥♥. Better off playing private servers or yet play an AAA mmo like guilds wars 2 or WOW or FF14 "

												Well I should tell you that i have played many servers for this game. The servers are animaRO, AnthemRO, CakeRO, HiddenRo, RareRo, mysticRO. I'm a huge fan of this game and well this server is the worst server i have ever played. I believe the conpany running the server is in it for the money but the thats not the only problem. So lets start with the money problem. I dont have a problem with dontations until the items are break the game or you get more exp for paying. This server does the ladder and that means there is a gap among the players. Next the server basically lets you bot. This kills the community aspect of this game. This leads to the guilds being unbalanced because people who pay have extra exp and bots that follow the person usually healing them. So this means the economy is unbalanced too. I estimate their to be about 300 actually people to be playing this server. Even the most experinced players would have a hard time in this enviroment. In the end, i wouldnt even bother with this server and i would go to ratemyserver and find a good server to play. Im sorry for any spelling or grammatical errors i made.			"

												RO now is just like any other MMO's that have less cloth for tanking, and heavy armor suits for supportive class..Im not blamming on the cloths, im fine with it.. But, for some reason, the developers nowadays are sucks.. I really damn missed the old RO, where knights and crussaders holds the role of tank.. I really not recomended this game for a long term and serious game to play.. Since there's a lot of changes to it. Some classes are OP, and some classes are useless..Point form for all review :-Gameplay : for the sake of old memmoriesCurrency : uses a lot of cash item to survive in 3rd class (especially for 150 to 175)Variety of class usefull : less, only 5 classes that are really2 usefull (sura/tank, priest/healer, genetict/DPS, ranger/AOE, and maestro/strings) other than that are supportive classesResidence : almost 30% (or more) of the players boting on few mapsGuild system : are not developted as a proper guild system should be. Example (guild bank, storage, etc)Other reviews :           1. The game now kinda PAY TO WIN, since who have the good equips, wins.           2. There's a bias on some class (on stats, and bonuses), classes are cosly are less.           3. Party booking system are useless, and never used by anyone. (Plus it is not a proper system to called party booking system)           4. Common server lag issues from the iro servers. (while stream any vids are fine, RO still lags)           5. The Homunculus and Mercenaries AI didnt include in the RO package folder. (so u have to download it manually from 3rd party)As a player who played since the beta, this game really2 changed from awesome to sucks. RO1 and RO2 have its own gameplay, but for players who likes to TANK, RO1 is the game that tankers can't use heavy ♥♥♥ armor and they wear robes. While in RO2 tankers works fine, but the gameplay are suckier than RO1.So, thats my review for this game after few years playing it and review the system of the game. Hope this review helps some of u guys.. Thanks.			"

												I didn't play this game during its original release as I was a poorfag and couldn't afford the subscription fee.As a brand new player I understand MMOS change over the years, to appeal to people such as myself.With those two things in mind, this game is fun.I am playing an Acolyte, more or less solo, and even though it's challenging, I am having a lot of fun. Even though I am killing 150 monsters then turning in, somehow I'm still having fun.Even though I die a lot, I'm an Acolyte, so I can save the point and just warp back, so even though I'm handicapped, I'm still overpowered.I hear a lot of complaints from previous players, so if you played back in the day, apparently the game is ruined or some ♥♥♥♥, butIF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THIS AND LIKE OLD SCHOOL MMOS LIKE MAPLESTORY, RUNESCAPE, FIESTA, ETC, THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE REALLY GOOD ONES TRY IT!

												Do you like anime sprites? ha ha so do I.How about a game that offers no direction or story?A game that makes you ask questions like ""WTF do i do?""Pointless cute and fluffy creatures that kill you and remind you of your weakness?Slow leveling and grinding?Pointless chat rooms with randoms and overpriced market place?Massive congregations of players blocking your screen from being immersed in the game?If you like all of the above, then this is the game for you. Btw the artwork on the splash screens is low res and looks like ♥♥♥♥♥ which doesn't make sense considering how nice the sprites look. Did they pay someone to draw those?			"

												There was an update along time ago that unblanced the game and it still hasnt been reslovedMonk class was absolutly destoryedExample.Hunter can dubble strafe for 15 mp and deal 2000 damage.Monk can cast Summon Spirit Sphere 8mp 5 times (40mp) then casts Throw Spirit Sphere 10mp and deals 800 damage.The hunter needs only dex where the monk needs str, dex and intThe theifs skill dubble attack works on empirum but the tripple attack from a monk doesn't. Yes its one more attack but the theifs bonuses are applyed to each hit, where the monk only gets bonuses added once for the 3 attacks.Because monks at level 99 with a very specific gear could do insane damage using Asura Strike, they then desided to nuke to death the monk class by halfing their base HP and almost 1/3 their MP.

												Yeah no. Here is the deal. So registration is 3rd party but it is linked to steam.Whatever account you registered with Steam will stay as that account. Accounts are Gender based, which means whatever gender you identify as during account registration will be fixed for that gender in the game. Even though the game gives you 9 character slots per server and some classes are gender locked.Here is the rundown of the game. At first it is simple, but there are technical problems. First is there is no screen resolution adjustment in game. There is no adjustments in the client launcher. You would have to find the Setup.exe in the Steam folder where the game is located to modify graphic settings. Without the convenience of how to or FAQ I would say I spent more time trying to find out how to get the game to not play in 640x480 windowed.GameplayThe worst part is finding out what to do with a character that cannot defeat the first monster at lvl 1. So errand quests are the only reliable way for building enough Exp to survive. The combat for whatever server or performance is not up to latency performance. The short end, I ended up getting killed to a 0 Hp enemy before it actually died and dropped an item during the respawn menu. This is what I cannot handle in any game, this is no longer 2008. At a 1/4 chance of entering a new instance, control becomes completely unresponsive. In that case just Alt+Tab close the game and uninstall because it seems that game also does not want you to play it. "

												Hm. Im not entirely sure. In my time when RO was in my country, the GMs dont give a sheet if you bot. If everyone bots, why not just allow it? Most people who bot are usually the ones paying money to play. Instead, based on my current playing time, I get banned twice in a row, because the GM's are so called on a patrol. Hm. At first I believed. But then maybe now not. I think I may stop playing iRO entirely. I hope you guys get a grip and just let us bots. 2k players and mostly 1.5k is bots. And the bots usually dont get banned. Why? As a user here stated that is what makes me think twice. What he said could be true and also a confirmation to what I have in mind, the GMs are so called doing their jobs because those who are not friends with them will get the most damage. Ive spent quite a lot. But maybe I may spend more on my PC hardware now. Thank you RO for the years of fun. Maybe, just maybe someday I will get a server for my country and allow bots. :) Just. Maybe though.. Lol. So yea. I'll still log in, once in awhile. So have fun with the 2k bots.			"

   My Playthrough     The Review I can't believe that I use to play this game a lot back in the day. I have no idea what I used to like about the game?This game is one of the most boring and repetitive games that I have ever played and it is made worse by the ridiculous amount of exp you need in order to level up. The drop rate is also way lower than it should be. No wonder I went to so many private servers back in the day as they fixed most of the grinding issues but even with that the game becomes basically a glorified chat room.  "

												I'd recommend this to anyone who has played this game and enjoyed it. Getting good at this game requires study and effort, which goes without saying for any mmorpg. Don't complain about this when you've clock a major number of your years in WoW or DoTA. The only horrendous downside is when you got hampered by a bug, expect intense aggravation as the support staff is highly incompetent on both the game and Steam's side.			"

												Ive played this long time ago with my friends and we were quite fanatic about it. Nothing much to say about it if im about to compare it with tons of latest mmorpgs that have better graphis,features and so on;cause this game is soooo old..but what they say: Originalities is always good!Well,of course ive played RO2,in fact, i cant stop drooling (:P) for a few months waiting for the release of the closed beta , but like other RO fans im quite disappointed to discover a fail clone of WoW instead.Soon after, the community of RO2 gradually decreasing,and some of them decide to return to RO1.Most of the community nowadays mostly consist of old hardcore player,returnees, and few little of them is new player(probably because they have low-spec computer). Well,you always can kill time with this game and its a lot less boring if you playing with your old friends(probably reminded to the poop hat in this game while taking dump,and suddenly decided to play RO1 again!).

												This's a pretty good MMO but this kind of MMO is pretty common, the kind that when they have problems they will try to solve it by adding new function rather than trying to figure out how/why it happen and how to prevent it from happening again, this kind of MMO is fun, but easy to get bored, after a couple of weeks/months the player will get bored, and to avoid this problem they come up with a solution like adding a new job class/skill/item/monster/pet/city/map. They don't really have much staff to handle the game, I'm not even sure if there's any in game moderator, because if there's one, he/she is either not doing their job or just plain lazy.Well this's pretty common MMO so yeah..whatever, I'll still play it. But the thing that get in my nerve is this game is filled with TOO MANY DAMN BOTS and Spammer, what was it? Why don't we try helping by sending a ticket? Ohh sure, WHY NOT YOU MAKE THE DAMN TICKET EASIER TO DO LIKE PLACING IN GAME MODERATOR OR SCREENSHOT PLACE WHERE WE CAN POST A SCREENSHOT WITH THE BOT AND YOU CAN TELEPORT THERE AND JAIL EM??!!! Sigh...sorry bout that...So yeah...this's a pretty decent game, but filled with bots and spammer, play at your own risk.			"

												Raggy is pretty fun : 3The typical RPG that requires some strategy, team-work, and it has a cool world and storyline.A couple of downsides are it's a little hard to walk around, but that might be because of my inexperience, and also for a widely-known game that has been out around the globe for years, it has a LOT of grammatical errors. Like, everywhere.So I assume players focus more on the action, guilds, and such.But it's still really fun, and the 2D graphics are displayed in a cute, interesting way.This is a game like no other, and everyone should try it at least once.

												I've played Ragnarok Online for years, While people were waisting away with World of WarCraft I was here, playing Ragnarok Online. Its an anazing game but dated. So dated its almost unplayable. The only way I could ever see my self playing againis if I got the gold crew back together to kick some butt. A word from the wise, Don't play the offical server. I hate saying this seeing as I would very much like to see this game get support all these years later but Privet servers are where you need to be to fully enjoy the emersion of Ragnarok. I've spent countless hours in heRO, TalonRO, as well as dozens of higher rate servers such as GarmRO, ScytheRO, FrosakenRO, DreamerRO, and so on. Ive even been a GM and Event GM in privent servers, ive seen it all. In my mind no game will ever come close to being as indepth and fun as Ragnarok, but sadly new players will never feel the same way. If you guys really want to get into RO, go with TalonRO privet server. They have a great community and the server is far more populated than the offical one.			"

												Father of all modern MMORPG's. Even though the game is not as good as its glory days, it still has alot of potential. Been playing this for 10 years.If any of the new players has any queries, you can always visit the game forums and post your queries.That's an absolute way to get your answer. Not the quickest, but probably the best.If you guys have some quick queries ingame, visit Prontera (middle left, middle right, one map south of Prontera) or Payon (Bottom Kafra). That's where alot of veterans camp. You can find them and have a word.If GM's can get rid of the Zeny bots (dedicate a Bot Hunter in your staff (hire more people if necessary) and put a jailing system(like many other servers)), balance WOE by restricting some items and get rid of lag issues then the game is as good as any other MMO.

												I'd recommend this to anyone who has played this game and enjoyed it. Getting good at this game requires study and effort, which goes without saying for any mmorpg. Don't complain about this when you've clock a major number of your years in WoW or DoTA. The only horrendous downside is when you got hampered by a bug, expect intense aggravation as the support staff is highly incompetent on both the game and Steam's side.			"

												It's an old game, a severly flawed game, with lots of bugs and some game design that leaves you scratching your head, but regardless, it's still a classic that paved way for an era of MMORPG's. It's kinda fun to re-visit every now and then, but the Renewal server is just so far behind in new content, while the Classic server I think is worth playing more, but it has a lower population, and it's alot harder starting out on classic as well.I'd only recommend playing this game if you have friends to play with, because playing it solo sucks really hard.

												It's been forever since I've played RO or any of its private server counterparts. To be completely honest, I, taken by nostalgia, wanted to try out RO again solely because I wanted to relive the past. This may sound hypocritical because I'm trying to brag about how great this game is, but RO isn't very exciting compared to all of today's great games. It was the greatest thing in the world 10 years ago, but not the greatest anymore. However, it's not terrible and for veterans it brings a tear to one's eye to hear the old theme song of the capital city playing in the background. I tried out RO 2 first because I wanted to see what changes were made. To my disappointment some of the game mechanics in RO 2, which worked well for RO, didn't really transition well. So I thought ""oh well"" and moved onto to RO. It took a little grinding to get started, but I fairly enjoyed it. Some people might find grinding miserable, but after playing years of fast paced games it was suprisingly enjoyable to slow down a bit. The graphics are 2D/3D...and of course it's crap since it was made 10 years ago. (but it was some really great crap back then) The controls consist of the function keys, alt+(letter keys) and just clicking. Moving and attacking are clicking/clicking+holding. Hotkeys are function keys. Very simple~ but it worked fabulously. The training grounds gave me a bit of a refresher on all the little details and it's a good place to start out as a beginner if you don't know anything at all. This is great because RO can be a bit complicated even for veterans. There are a bunch of requirements you have to meet for certain things and stats you have build on for certain jobs. You might hate tutorials, but trust me... you'll need all the free items, easy levels, and explanations as possible or the beginner stages will be slow and painful. I can't critique on the rest of the game since I haven't gotten too much into it myself, but if memory serves me right this game was well worth my time. Once you make some friends or get into a guild the game will be a little easier to understand and you'll start to play strategically (or not...I prefer strategy). It's a lot more fun to play in parties (especially with experienced players that don't do all the work, but assist the little guys) vs clicking on a bunch of monsters...alone... for hours. Since your characters don't ""dodge"" (they stand still and exchange blows with the monster you're locked on) the most you can get out of solo playing is really just standing still and hitting monsters. The beauty of rpg's is to figure out (for example) who's going to tank, who's going to heal, who's going to range, etc. And seriously it's going to suck if you solo...A little tangent here- I loved how the game gave the option of playing the classic RO vs the updated one. When I played in the newer one I couldn't help feel like a total noob because maps were different and monsters had changed levels/locations. The classic RO option let me get used to the game and relive those younger days :DIf you're looking for high end graphics and fast paced gaming... this is not for you. If you're looking to get into an old mmorpg because you want a change of pace, go ahead. If you're a veteran of the game and you haven't played in a while just try it out for a bit. I'm not asking you to commit. It's really hard to start from square one, but playing it once in a while still feels great and you might be able to get serious about it later.			"

												There customer support is terrible, I submit a ticket i have no idea what happened to the ticket after i finally find the ticket after like 4 or 5 hours with their poor navigation on their website through warpportal still to no avail no one replied to help recover my old account. Warpportal requires its own registration account the game requires another account and if you go to the website on warp portal it tells you to login with your email address so is that a 3rd?! 3 accounts just to play 1 game. The wait time on a issue is so BAD i gave up trying Gravity did better independantly on its navigation and helpful services. if its so bad on volume of customers how about you throw some GMS on the job? This is the reason why private servers dominate better then IRO its sad but true. If they want customers to stay they need to fix that especially considering i didnt even LOGIN to play the game and I'm ready to uninstall it. Also there new mechanics are tougher in my opinion it seems like the game got more tidious to the old veterans of this game it use to be grind and exp now its more like quest by yourself and figure out how to level even though the adventures guide is helpful its still easy to lose track of what your doing. All in all the game is fine the customer support is bad to the point that they might as well hold a sign up on their webpage saying *Gone out to lunch wont come back till your not here"".			"

												One of the best Old School MMORPG ever!I've been playing this game for a very long time on and off, ever since 10 years ago or something. Even until this point, new content still comes out every few months or so and makes the game pretty fun with different things to do.It's also not too hard for beginners to catch up to just enjoy some of the features in game due to many new quests and equipments catered to help beginners start (Eden quests). The best part, is of course, the very developed class system in Ragnarok, being an over 10 years old game, with many many classes to play and enjoy.			"

Product received for free
												Found this Gem on steam,It is the Real deal, the original game.Pros: Weekly UpdatedGood story,Good Quests, Good PVP system, Good Group PVP event. Runs Great on almost any PC.Little to no Lag (Thor Server)Cons: Not enough players (thor Server) needs more. (Very Low Bot (read almost none) Count)Seems to have been forgotten in the mists of Time.I use to play this when it was a subscription game and fell on times that prevented me continueing it. It is now Free to Play with a VIP / Cash Shop option.  Big hint The Cash shop stuff does not Really break the game if you know how to Hunt for Gears.  The market on thor is not insane there are good equips for vend.  The people mostly come from the phillipines so US time zones there is a low Population and almost no Lag unlike the Chaos server which has a higher US population.  The Player base is very nice and welcoming to new players.  Aperently the Game has been getting updates every week, has an active GM staff.A worthy MMO that will not tax your system.While the above still stands, I am changing this to a NO and here is why...


Anniversary quest, BIG FOUL, EXCLUSIVE TO LV 100+ Players, Three attempts to participate, Three Failed Starts to QUEST.  +no JUNE BOX!!!! 
A Screenshot of Ragnarok
By: khelbenvasq




This was the Annaversary Quest something for ""Everyone"" to do... It is Exclusive to those over a level, so if you are new or still grinding though you DO NOT GET TO DO IT.   To top that off the Wonderful Elite Vetern Player base Threatened to Quit over the Proposed items in the JUNE BOX.  Items that would have been a BOON to new Players and would have helped Generate Revinue for the Game.  But the Pressure from those players got the GMs to Trash the box and put in an item upgrader.  If you play play for the rememberance of old times, then find a game worth playing.  I do try to give any online game 1 year before I give up on them, but so far, THIS is disapointing.  I know I should not feel that way after 1.5 months but there it is.  1.5/12 Til Deletion.  I will keep editing this as I go along so check this review out one in a while to see if things have changed.			"

												1st review:First of all, its a very good mmo game for its time, I was only 6 when i began playing this. Since then I played it agian, lots of fun, lots of sociable people around to talk to. The only downfall is that there is alot of bugs to be patch and alot of bots roaming around. If they could just fixed the server then this game would be the best!. Its a really fun game if your willing to play it 7/10. After a year:This regard everything i said before, IRO has started for more than 5 years, and still no progress with anything that i wanted them to change. Im not sure whetever the problems is on not improving the lags and bots. But if they can't fix it, why even bother giving this a good review? They probably wont fix any of that problem so im change my review into bad review and a rating out of 4/10. In the past 2 years i have been playing in this game, i have realise that there is no improvement on whatsover that can make this game better. Its a good idea on reviving this amazing game, wish they could have done better.			"

												I played this game in 2006 and I loved it. The game was a masterpiece, the classes are amazing and fun to play as. I play with a Lord Knight as my main, and a ninja as my alt. The games population is still surprisingly high reason why I say this is because the games old and its been out since 2002. So much like really good and old mmorpgs(Ever quest) they slowly died off. I enjoy this game and I would gladly keep coming back to it. Pros-amazing class system, huge world to explore, fun culinary system, a nice pet taming system, and a loyale and dedicated fan base.Cons-Bots i think(ive talked to people who say there arent any), and some server lag but i havent experienced any.

												This game had it's golden day back in early 2000's.  It was an awesome game that had anime style emoticons and the music from soundTEMP was dope as hell.  I lost 3-4 years playing this game and met a bunch of acquaintance online.Just like any MMORPG, this game is generally more fun if you have some friends playing with you, not unless you have friends that lives in different timezone that will play with you.I feel like this game is pretty close to a dead community.If you're looking to play a new game that's SUPPOSEDLY have the same feel as RO, you should check out Tree of Saviors.  Rumor goes that game will be the next Ragnarok Online.Even if you don't play this game, I suggest you check out the OST for it.  It's quite beautiful.			"

												This game had it's golden day back in early 2000's.  It was an awesome game that had anime style emoticons and the music from soundTEMP was dope as hell.  I lost 3-4 years playing this game and met a bunch of acquaintance online.Just like any MMORPG, this game is generally more fun if you have some friends playing with you, not unless you have friends that lives in different timezone that will play with you.I feel like this game is pretty close to a dead community.If you're looking to play a new game that's SUPPOSEDLY have the same feel as RO, you should check out Tree of Saviors.  Rumor goes that game will be the next Ragnarok Online.Even if you don't play this game, I suggest you check out the OST for it.  It's quite beautiful.			"

												First time I played Ragnarok Online was on 2005, and since then its been my fav MMO. I dont know why but every year I download a new version/server and play for few weeks or a month, then unistall. But I keep doing it cause I know it brings back good memories. I totally recommend this game. I had a lot of fun and people are generally nice.10000/10 would download.			"

												Raggy is pretty fun : 3The typical RPG that requires some strategy, team-work, and it has a cool world and storyline.A couple of downsides are it's a little hard to walk around, but that might be because of my inexperience, and also for a widely-known game that has been out around the globe for years, it has a LOT of grammatical errors. Like, everywhere.So I assume players focus more on the action, guilds, and such.But it's still really fun, and the 2D graphics are displayed in a cute, interesting way.This is a game like no other, and everyone should try it at least once.

												This's a pretty good MMO but this kind of MMO is pretty common, the kind that when they have problems they will try to solve it by adding new function rather than trying to figure out how/why it happen and how to prevent it from happening again, this kind of MMO is fun, but easy to get bored, after a couple of weeks/months the player will get bored, and to avoid this problem they come up with a solution like adding a new job class/skill/item/monster/pet/city/map. They don't really have much staff to handle the game, I'm not even sure if there's any in game moderator, because if there's one, he/she is either not doing their job or just plain lazy.Well this's pretty common MMO so yeah..whatever, I'll still play it. But the thing that get in my nerve is this game is filled with TOO MANY DAMN BOTS and Spammer, what was it? Why don't we try helping by sending a ticket? Ohh sure, WHY NOT YOU MAKE THE DAMN TICKET EASIER TO DO LIKE PLACING IN GAME MODERATOR OR SCREENSHOT PLACE WHERE WE CAN POST A SCREENSHOT WITH THE BOT AND YOU CAN TELEPORT THERE AND JAIL EM??!!! Sigh...sorry bout that...So yeah...this's a pretty decent game, but filled with bots and spammer, play at your own risk.			"

												Ive played this long time ago with my friends and we were quite fanatic about it. Nothing much to say about it if im about to compare it with tons of latest mmorpgs that have better graphis,features and so on;cause this game is soooo old..but what they say: Originalities is always good!Well,of course ive played RO2,in fact, i cant stop drooling (:P) for a few months waiting for the release of the closed beta , but like other RO fans im quite disappointed to discover a fail clone of WoW instead.Soon after, the community of RO2 gradually decreasing,and some of them decide to return to RO1.Most of the community nowadays mostly consist of old hardcore player,returnees, and few little of them is new player(probably because they have low-spec computer). Well,you always can kill time with this game and its a lot less boring if you playing with your old friends(probably reminded to the poop hat in this game while taking dump,and suddenly decided to play RO1 again!).

												Great for a nostalgia trip down what was many people's first MMO. Just be prepared for some input lag alongside kill stealers, that said, it still retains the charm, and it was a blast doing the Wizard test again! With the Transcedent Job classes there will be plenty to do in those times you can't quite decide what to play and need something a bit mindless.New and returning players would probably find looking up the changes to game after Renewal handy as well			"

												I've played Ragnarok Online for years, While people were waisting away with World of WarCraft I was here, playing Ragnarok Online. Its an anazing game but dated. So dated its almost unplayable. The only way I could ever see my self playing againis if I got the gold crew back together to kick some butt. A word from the wise, Don't play the offical server. I hate saying this seeing as I would very much like to see this game get support all these years later but Privet servers are where you need to be to fully enjoy the emersion of Ragnarok. I've spent countless hours in heRO, TalonRO, as well as dozens of higher rate servers such as GarmRO, ScytheRO, FrosakenRO, DreamerRO, and so on. Ive even been a GM and Event GM in privent servers, ive seen it all. In my mind no game will ever come close to being as indepth and fun as Ragnarok, but sadly new players will never feel the same way. If you guys really want to get into RO, go with TalonRO privet server. They have a great community and the server is far more populated than the offical one.			"

												Father of all modern MMORPG's. Even though the game is not as good as its glory days, it still has alot of potential. Been playing this for 10 years.If any of the new players has any queries, you can always visit the game forums and post your queries.That's an absolute way to get your answer. Not the quickest, but probably the best.If you guys have some quick queries ingame, visit Prontera (middle left, middle right, one map south of Prontera) or Payon (Bottom Kafra). That's where alot of veterans camp. You can find them and have a word.If GM's can get rid of the Zeny bots (dedicate a Bot Hunter in your staff (hire more people if necessary) and put a jailing system(like many other servers)), balance WOE by restricting some items and get rid of lag issues then the game is as good as any other MMO.

												This game just shows that fancy graphics aren't what makes the game amazing when you play it. Simple enough to get on and make great progress in a few minutes and yet complex enough that there is allways more you can do, these combine to make playing the game for hours very easy. The older sprite-style design of the characters, monsters and gameplay also seem to add to the game letting the player know they are being lost in their word of fantasy, which can be lost on the graphics we have today, which make everything seem so realistic that we can't seperate them from our average boring world. I am not so far in the story at this point that I feel any compliment I could make would do it justice but what I have experienced so far has allowed me enough room to say that it is a fantasy epic that could rival those of Final Fantasy and Star Ocean. I know that I will be enjoying my adventrues with my little poring for hours to come with this game, that is if my friends don't kill me first for talking endlessly about the game. I give it a four out of five for gemplay and enjoyability, and a five for the graphics for the unique way they bring the user to a new life. Lastly I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys MMO's, dungeon crawlers and Fantasy games.			"

I took a long break from playing due to my studies at school.This is based on Norse mythology and on the manhwa title ""Ragnarok"" by Lee Myun-Jin. Sadly, the manhwa was left unfinished but the game goes on.Character designs are 2D but in a sort of 3D environment.The game itself will run even on a ""normal"" or non-gaming GPU.OST is great to hear.The quest stories are great if you read those dialogs.As with other online games, there are bots that farms for items but the game masters are doing whatever they can to reduce the impact on legitimate players leveling up their characters. There is no in-game advertising from other companies except by those bots that sells in-game currency in exchange for real money (scam). That practice is illegal though and if a player is found to be involved in that transaction. Then, character ban will result and sometimes character and items deletion.Just don't do something illegal in-game and this will be a good game. Lots of grinding if you go solo. So join a party and do quests to avoid too much grinding.			"

												I'd recommend this to anyone who has played this game and enjoyed it. Getting good at this game requires study and effort, which goes without saying for any mmorpg. Don't complain about this when you've clock a major number of your years in WoW or DoTA. The only horrendous downside is when you got hampered by a bug, expect intense aggravation as the support staff is highly incompetent on both the game and Steam's side.			"

												Ragnarok is a action mmorpg that will be more fun if you have friends to play with.You need to keep in mind that if you don't buy items using real life money , you can't grind as fast as cashers.From what I've seen, there are still bots, which makes normal players can't farm or grind at some maps.It seems that gravity is making players to separate,because of the exp boosts and else.Which makes the ""mmo"" part go away.Don't get me wrong though,I am enjoying this game very much,and I kinda use real life money as well.The point is, if you didn't (or won't) top-up,the game will seem harder to you.

												It has always been one of my favorite mmorpg games and it was amazing to find out that it was free to play here. I couldn't recomend it more, it has tons of places to level up, tons of npcs to fight and the most amazing music =)			"

												I've played Ragnarok Online for years, While people were waisting away with World of WarCraft I was here, playing Ragnarok Online. Its an anazing game but dated. So dated its almost unplayable. The only way I could ever see my self playing againis if I got the gold crew back together to kick some butt. A word from the wise, Don't play the offical server. I hate saying this seeing as I would very much like to see this game get support all these years later but Privet servers are where you need to be to fully enjoy the emersion of Ragnarok. I've spent countless hours in heRO, TalonRO, as well as dozens of higher rate servers such as GarmRO, ScytheRO, FrosakenRO, DreamerRO, and so on. Ive even been a GM and Event GM in privent servers, ive seen it all. In my mind no game will ever come close to being as indepth and fun as Ragnarok, but sadly new players will never feel the same way. If you guys really want to get into RO, go with TalonRO privet server. They have a great community and the server is far more populated than the offical one.			"

												I played this game a lot in college but over time it's lost it's appeal to me.  It's a beautiful game with lush environments and colorful sprites and monsters.  However, it gets repetitive and boring when you start leveling up in hours instead of minutes and the charm wears off.  For a purely casual RPG gamer side step this one.  This is also not a game you can play on your own which is bad for a solo player like me.  You will need friends or join a guild or you will never see all of the game's content.  To it's credit the combat is solid and the skill trees are good and leveling is satisfying.  I did though spend a lot of time trying to close out a dozen hot-key bars I accidentally opened.  All 100 different maps, charts, bars, screens have a macro to turn them on and off in your display and each one is explained briefly and only once in the 2+ hour tutorial section and good luck figuring out how to close them.   If you can spare the time to grind all the way to 100 twice, create another character to craft all your gear and potions, farm for card drops for weeks, and turn Ragnarok into essentially a full time job then go for it.  I am already tired of it and I'm not even level 30 so there's no way I have the patience for that.			"

												Some people are going to review this game negatively even though Classic exists and Renewal is still good.A lot of it will probably be that they think it doesn't hold up.I don't know about all that, but for me this was the only MMO I played at that time that was ever entertaining. Truly surpassed all its competitors back then.Over ten years later, I still feel the same way. It's still the most entertaining to me and its sequel, while possibly enjoyable, truly sucked in comparison to the original when I played it. Disregarding gameplay, RO is a game that will never expire: its art style with beautiful sprites is still fantastic and its environments while dated are done just well enough that they hold up well from the angle you play the game at. Many hours were burned through with this game and having not played it in two years, I'm sure many more will be, this time on Steam. Even after the game went free to play, it maintened everything that made it great. It's gone through so many changes but its core is still the same, and I can't recommend it enough to someone who wants to play a MMO that's satisfying and not completely generic.			"
