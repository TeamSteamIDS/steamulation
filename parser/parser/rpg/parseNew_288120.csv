												A long time ago when I was only young I played a Roguelike- This Roguelike was pretty much perfect in my eyes. It had a great mix between being challenging and being accessible. The name of this Roguelike was Castle of the Winds and it has long held a place in my heart as being the best of show out there for this genre. Now I think after many years Castle of the Winds has finally been toppled in my eyes. Dungeonmans is the best Roguelike I have played in a long time- it has an easy to learn and use gameplay which is unforgivable the further out you go. The game captures everything that I loved about Castle of the Winds- the crisp but simple art, the spellbooks for learning new spells, the absurdity of monsters you find in the deep... Then it puts everything into overdrive. With Dungeonmans one of the most innovative features is the Academy which grows based on deeds, you don't simply pour money into this academy to make it better, you fill it with the blood and sweat of a ton of dead dungeonmans. As someone who always likes persistant strength options in Roguelikes, this is good, but what makes it better is the fact that all of the unlocked perks are optional to pick up. If the game is too easy for you, just don't pick up the perk at the start. No harm done. You will still do awesomely if you are skilled enough for the task. The music of Dungeonmans is also pretty phenominal due to being the work of the great Zircon, a remix artist who makes the game come alive. The art is pretty standard, but the simplistic nature of it actually works well with what is trying to be achived. As you go deeper into the many dungeons you will find an increasingly powerful variety of loot capable of making you feel like a king- and if you die while carrying one of your favourite swords it is even possible to find the sword in a later playthrough in a more powerful form. There is so much to unlock in this game too- you can find hidden skills, dungeons, artifacts of power and more based on how you play and what you do. I won't spoil them, but basically the game rewards you all the way in the best possible way. Overall- this game scratches many itches for me. The itch for a good Roguelike, the itch for constructing my own ""x"", the itch to find a game I can happily play for countless hours-Full disclosure though- At the end of this I feel that I should say I was a kickstarter backer. While I don't belive my experience has been coloured by that fact, it is possible that some of my praise is the work of a Rosetinted Glasses look of someone who didn't want to have wasted their money. So please do take my review with that in mind,EDIT: Also one slight warning- The game is best played with the numpad for movement so if you have a laptop which does not have one... keep that in mind. There is mouse control but it makes the game seem a lot more ""slippery"". Though, it should also be said numpad controls is just another reason why this game is rocking it CoTW style.			"

												I backed this game on Kickstarter many months ago and it has been one of the few games that hasn't disappointed me at all.I'll start by saying this is my favourite game out there, literally. I must have clocked in hundreds of hours since I backed this on Kickstarter last year and i've loved every moment of it.I've always been a fan of traditional roguelikes, even those that use a ASCII style interface and though recently i've seen more and more games being released as roguelikes none of them really seemed to feel like them to me. That was until Dungeonmans. Dungeonmans is a roguelike in the purest sense made by someone who clearly loves the genre.In Dungeonmans You start by picking from 4 random rolled stats (Stremf, Skills, Science and Foom) and then your class from many different classes. Each class starts with different player abilities which you can choose to level up as you play on through the game.A key feature to me that makes it stand out is the fact that when you level up and choose new abilities you can choose any from the skill tree, even if that was not the class you chose to play in. Feel like running around with a shield as a Rangermans? Well, you're free to do so. Just...don't.The game, like all roguelikes, has permadeath but that's not the end of your adventure. As you travel through the world and various dungeons you'll kill bosses and collect artifacts and books. Both of these things can be used to level up your 'Academy' which is where you, and all new-spawns will start. Upgrading the academy and bringing back artifacts unlocks things like 'all level 1 potions identified for every new Dungeonman you play with, so even though you lose your progress and level on your Dungeonman when you die, you don't feel like you're starting over entirely. I've played games like Dungeons of Dredmoor, Rogue Legacy and other modern Rogue-likes and they are great but there is something about Dungeonmans that keeps me wanting to come back and die just once more.And you will come back to it, over and over, and most likely die, over and over, but dying never felt this good before. I should also mention that whilst I play keyboard-only, for those who aren't too comfortable with that there is an option to use your mouse aswell :)There isn't too much else I can say about the game, the simplicity and beauty of it is in playing it for yourself. Now that the game is out of Early Access it's content rich and even more fun than before. So if you want a modern yet honest-to-the-name rogue-like with tons of loot, enemies, a soundtrack that really makes you feel epic and dungeon after dungeons after dungeon then this is the game for you.Just remember, as the developer says himself. Don't. Get. Surrounded.			"

												For a while now I've considered myself a fan of the rogue-like/rogue-lite genres. I've played more than a dozen of both the free and paid varieties over the years and I'm sure that number will only grow. Despite the breadth of the rogue-like/rogue-lite genres and the sheer variety of games and game mechanics contained in those terms, Dungeonmans is among my favorites. But to understand why I love this game, you first have to understand what it is not. Dungeonmans is not a story-based experience in the slightest. If that's what you want, look elsewhere. Dungeonmans is not the sort of rogue-like where starvation is a constant threat--there is no hunger mechanic whatsoever. Dungeonmans is not a rogue-lite. You will not find the twin stick shooter chaos of Binding of Isaac. You will not find the platforming of Spelunky. You will not find the music-based gameplay of Crypt of the Necrodancer. You will not find the castlevania stylings of Rogue Legacy. All of those games are good, but they are not what you will find in Dungeonmans.What you WILL find in Dungeonmans: A skill system that rewards patience and emphasizes maneuvering above all else. Several classes, from the conventional warrior/mage/archer archetypes to the less common like polearm specialists who can create area of effect zones to bolster their power/debuff their enemies and berserkers with a penchant for dressing with class and drinking tea.  The ability to ignore the preset classes and tinker with hybrid builds as you see fit. Wizard/necromancer? Done. Archer with plate armor? Fair enough. Some dude who picks and chooses from several classes at once and potentially sucks at all of them? Rather likely in the short term while you figure things out.  Dungeons to delve and monsters to slay, from slimes and evil wizards to pseudo-British bomb throwing anarchists. A system of progression that allows you to build off the successes of previous characters through things like auto-identified potions and scrolls, better starting gear, or more stats to go around. Or, if you feel like it, none of that at all. An overworld map teeming with dungeons to explore, towns to sell excess loot, and occasional bandit camps. The roguelike staple of potentially cursed gear. Hidden shops staffed entirely by talking bees.It's not a perfect game, as no such game exists. The progression system inevitably bothers rogue-like purists, even though it can be almost entirely ignored or opted-out of. The game's sense of humor can and does rub some people the wrong way. The flexibility of the skill system can leave some players lost, or others annoyed that it isn't as complicated as say, Tales of Maj Eyal. Yet looked at strictly on its own merits, Dungeonmans is what many rogue-likes strive to be: a rewarding adventure where the risk of death comes primarily from player carelessness, where mechanics are simple enough to learn but deep enough to experiment with, and there are always more foes lying in wait to slay. Give it a shot.			"

												Underneath the silly, this is actually a pretty fun & well put together Roguelike (a REAL roguelike - not those games with permadeath and level generators that call themselves ""roguelikes""), with enough unique features to keep it interesting. Its more than just running dungeons, you have your ""Dungeonmans Academy"" you need to bring things too to make it better, an overworld to explore, ect. Theres lots to do, many character class & traits choices. I havent played too much yet, but this looks like a Roguelike I'll have fun with.The silly, however, is overpowering. Sometimes its amusing, but IMHO it beats you over the head a little too much. It may be funny if you're a teenage guy, I'm a 30-something chick, so I can't judge there. Still, theres lots of clever Roguelike humor for long-term rogue players. It is out of E. A. but still seems a bit incomplete (the ""help"" button in options does nothing that I could see), there are gender options such as ""beast"" and ""who cares"" but the only images are of stereotypical fantasy males and females. Come on, if youre going to be silly, give us some funny icons to work with those genders! The graphics are pixel tiles. They are colorful and cartoony and fit well with the style of the game. My one (minor) complaint is getting new weapons and armor does nothing to your tile. Like if you have the barbarian shirtless guy with the sword, he remains the shirtless guy with the sword even if youre wearing platemail and carrying an axe. Its kind of nitpicky, but Roguelikes have progressed from the days of ""@"", or even the tile systems of *Angband. I love games like Tales of Maj'Eyal, or Rogue's Tale where your tile changes depending on what you have equipped. It would be an asset here.Overall though, this game is defintely worth taking a look at for Rogue fans. It has a lot of content and is something a little different.			"

												This is a letter I just wrote to PC Gamer, they probably wont reply, but it reflects how I feel about dungeonmans:Dear Tyler@pcgamer,You guys ran an article a while back, giving  a tip on an ""in development"" game called Dungeonmans. I had already been a kickstarter backer when you ran the article, but really didnt have too high of hopes for the game. I was on a kickstarter binge for a while there, and dungeonmans was kind of my long shot. In the time since you ran that article, dungeonmans has released, along with a few of my other kickstarter backed games (at least EA builds). These games include:Massive ChaliceRoad RedemptionWasteland 2Shovel KnightDreamfall ChaptersElite DangerousGodus (bleh)Star CitizenI have spent far more hours in Dungeonmans, than any of those other games. Not saying I dont like the others, they are all (for the most part) great, but Dungeonmans is up there with Spelunky for me in the roguelike genre. It is currently my 9th most played game on Steam with a library of around 300 games. Obliviously most of those dont get much play time at all, but I do game every day (95% Counter Strike), and Dungeonmans keeps drawing me back, especially when I'm in game downtime (waiting for a team). My whole point in all of this is that it would be really cool for you guys to run a review on this game sometime. I think its fully released now, its been quite polished for some time. It kind of makes me sad that this game didnt make a top chart once, I keep looking for it to gain some love, but I just havent seen much press on it. Get one of your rogulike lovers on it, I would be surprised if they didnt like it. Seriously, the game is like crack. I bought it for my friend who is also my main CS teammate, we talk dungeonmans builds all the time. I honestly havent even beat it yet, I'm not sure I've even gotten close. Anyway, I probably sound like I work for dungeonmans at this point (I dont, as far as I know its made by a single person, maybe two), I honestly just feel like gamers need to play this one. Its truly a hidden gem.Thanks for your time________________________________________________________________________________So yes, Thumbs up "

Early Access Review
								What is best in life?I started playing this game around Early Access v1.2, with diminished expectations. It looked like a typical sprite-based permadeath fantasy roguelike-like, something I'm not the biggest fan of.Appearances can be deceiving. Having logged many hours since, I find Dungeonmans rather unique. There are roguelike elements, yes, but also a plethora of accessible game design concepts from other genres, some of which have been unjustly abandoned for years, all stuffed into the trappings of a modern indie game.Remember the simplistic visual charm of early turn-based PC RPGs, such as the SSI Gold Box D&D titles? Dungeonmans has that. How about the grand, synthesized orchestral scores of early Playstation JRPGs? That's here, too. Weaponry with dramatic prefixes and suffixes that denote their crazy powers? A wide variety of procedurally-generated dungeon styles? Humorous tongue-in-cheek dialogue and item descriptions? Skill trees? Potions galore?Dungeonmans is both a parody and an homage to the best aspects of role-playing games over the past two decades, and a sort of fast-paced frustration-free approach to the roguelike model. Yes, each Dungeonmans (or gender-equal Lady Dungeonmans) gets but one life to live, but they leave behind a wide selection of enhancements for the next adventurer in line, some more difficult to retrieve than others. Defeat is quickly forgotten, vengeance is sworn, and progress resumes on the path to crush your enemies.While all the post-mortem handouts make the game less punishing than the average roguelike, mistakes made in combat still lead to a swift death. However, once a player learns the effect of each skill, and how they interact with statistics and potion-based enhancements, progress is limited only by how aggressively you wish to press your luck. Bigger risks bring bigger rewards, and it feels pretty great to outsmart a party of high-level monsters, see them driven before you, then return triumphantly back to the Dungeonmans Academy with many Proofs of Stremf.The numerous skill trees lead to many different but equally successful play styles, which keeps things fresh. Speedy players can blast through dungeons as a rampaging “Southern Gentlemans”, while methodical players can become a plodding pillar of death with “Sword & Board”. Understanding the abilities in each tree is essential when taking a Dungeonmans and the Academy to the highest level, and the truly skilled will leave behind only a few grave markers on the path to ultimate success.The visual presentation is a good fit with the gameplay, with colorful sprites and environments hearkening back to the pixel art of the 1990s. The avatar selection for the player is limited but memorable, with a range of exaggerated, comical designs to choose from. Distinct sound effects make in-game events easy to identify, and Zircon's soundtrack is fantastic, especially for fans of Hitoshi Sakimoto (Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story).So what's missing in Early Access, as of the current v1.6c build? Odds and ends, really. Some graphics are absent, or need to be reworked to better fit the style. There are loopholes to farm stat bonuses that haven't been closed. End game content is sparse. The highest tiers of weapons and armor aren't available. However, unlike other alphas, the game is stable and highly playable. You can create characters, kill monsters, hear the lamentations of their gender-neutral life partners, buy stuff, sell stuff, read books, burn books, slam bad guys, slam potions, and I have yet to get tired of any of it.On top of all that, the creator of the game is extremely accessible. Jim hosts bi-weekly live development streams, where soon-to-be-released content is tweaked before an audience. He checks social media and forums regularly, and I haven't seen a question or suggestion go unanswered. This is about as active and transparent as Early Access gets, and may very well be the best part about Dungeonmans.If you're looking for a pure unforgiving RNG-heavy dungeon-crawling permadeath fix, look elsewhere. If you fancy genre mash-ups chock-full of swords, sorcery, sandals, monsters, monster blood, traps, digital die rolls, throwback charm, and use of the word ""enstremfinize"", then I highly recommend Dungeonmans.

												A fun, light roguelike that provides a bit of enjoyment. The only reason I do not recommend it is because there is not $15 worth of content or depth and gets repetitive very quicklyIf it was early access and cheaper I would have bought it looking forward to what the 'finished' version had to offer. + Humor : it has a good parody of other dungeon roguelikes+ Controls : nothing super complicated going on but  it works well+ Music : + Graphics : Not incredible but colorful and fits the atmosphere well+ / - Academy building : You can find upgrades for your academy that then benefit your future characters. I love this type of persistance that lets you feel like you still made some progress even when you die. The con is that it is implemented pretty poorly and feels like an early access version. You max out the few levels of advancement there are very early on your first character and it doesn't make a huge impact so in the end it's pretty pointless+ / - : Unique character classes.. but only a handful and not a lot of depth or choice. I like having classes that play differently to try out and that is true here for the few provided. - : Shallow character depth. Especially a negative since the trailer advertises as 'hella character depth' instead of advertising it as casual. There are a few different trees with a few skills each, none particularly complicated. - : Little combat strategy.  Fights are very very light on strategy and tend to get repetitive after you get a few levels and unlock your small handful of skills. Enemies are pretty dumb and don't have a huge range of variety.-: Boring items. Each character has their weapon type and armor type to focus on. Everything else you find is trash which you just sell or have your blacksmith melt for more pointless upgrades on future characters. The weapons you come use only have a few tiers and the modifiers on magic items are pretty basic number booths that don't really make any difference. Loot just isn't very fun at all. The shops are all pretty terrible and all sell the same exact things. The only reason I'd bother selling loot there is to buy potions. There's an upgrade system for the towns which is a nice idea but implemented badly as the upgrades don't make much of a difference and because it limits upgrades based on how far from your academy they are, even when you upgrade a town you just keep advancing beyond it making it feel wasted. I love the ideas of enhancing towns and upgrading the academy.. but there is just.. nothing there. This does not feel like a finished game in the slightest.If you like casual roguelikes, wait until it's on sale and then give it a try. If you like depth and strategy, don't bother.			"

												Dungeonmans is a thoroughly enjoyable rogue like with several innovations that add depth to the genre. The Dungeonmans starter area known as The Academy is the main hub of these innovations. The Academy allows you to make subtle tweaks to your experience. For instance bringing artifacts back to the academy lets future Dungeonmans use stronger weapons and armor then would normally be available to a new graduate. There are several non-player characters at The Academy who can increase new graduate advantages with the riches that your last Dungeonmans gave their life for.     This game also has a fully realized class system using an intuitive point allocation system.  You also have the freedom to build your own Dungeonmans instead of using a prebuilt starting class. You are allowed to mix and match between magic, melee, and ranged skills over your career. This game has soundtracks, sound effects, and sprite based art that helps to create captivating rogue like environments. The world of Dungeonmans is populated with towns and dungeons galore.     Dungeons have ominous soundtracks and gritty sprites, while the towns are depicted with cheerful music and colorful sprites. Towns provide another place to enhance your experience. Towns can be upgraded like The Academy to give you better shop items from the local merchants. The dungeons vary in size, design and difficulty. Besides being filled with monsters, dungeons can have traps, secret treasures, and ultimately end with a showdown with its powerful master.     The advantages of the Academy are completely voluntary. If you’re looking for a harsher challenge simply don't enhance The Academy and your new Dungeonmans will have no advantages when they start out. Even with the advantages that the Academy provides, you'll still find that the best equipped and experienced players will find challenges in Dungeonmans readily available. This game has provided me with many hours of entertainment. If you’re looking for a rogue like with something new to offer, but the difficulty the genre is known for then look no further. Dungeonmans is the game for you.			"

												Once you get all the achievements, you pretty much have to write a review, am I right? I mean, I want to be a good mans to the developer, who totally rocked it with this one.Anyway, Dungeonmans is a great roguelike with a good sense of humor that I found quite charming. The name of the game is used as a point of humor throughout, so basically any phrase that would end in ""man"" or ""men"" becomes ""mans"" instead (Mans-at-Arms, Lizardmans, Necromanser, Lady Dungeonmans, etc). Also on the subject of humor, one of the pictures on the store page shows the ""Beeholder"" enemy, which fights like a D&D Beholder but spawns bee-type enemies to fight you when it dies.If there's one thing I can't stop thinking about this game, it's that it feels like a really well-designed experience. Some people may say it feels simplified, but this is definitely a ""less is more"" type of thing. I've played ToME and DCSS, and those are fun, but this game has a much tighter scope in my opinion. The graphics certainly don't hurt, either.It's got a good system of turn-based movement and combat, pretty standard stuff in that regard. I felt like there was a good mix of single-target and AOE abilities that kept me using different skills almost constantly. A lot of games in this genre can fall apart once you find that one ability that trumps everything.Also, it's fairly reasonable to think that if you play your mans well, you'll get at least decent gear and be able to really kick some butt. In all the hours I played, I never once felt like I got screwed because I needed a new weapon that just wouldn't drop, or had an enemy show up that my character wasn't at least capable of dealing with (I know, I shouldn't have gotten arrogant and bump-fought that scrolled monster party...)For anyone put off by the mechanic where you can pass along boosts to later generations (it actually can get extremely overpowered if you plan ahead), I would like to state that there's an achievement for clearing the game with a single mans, so that's a good challenge for those looking for the traditional roguelike one-life-to-live experience. That was my first clear of the game, which is probably why I had so many hours logged before it happened.TL;DR:Buy this game, it's super fun. If you do, maybe the developer will make more and I will appreciate you for contributing to that. "

Tons of items to loot, gear to equip, potions to drink and scrolls to use.And, of course, tons of dungeons to explore. Plus, towns to trade in.Add a grain of humor, nice music, old school pixel art - and you'll get the most enjoyable rogue-like that's been released in quite some time (in a year or so, I guess)Gameplay and more in the video:

												Dungeonmans is a roguelike dungeon crawler with a nifty succession system: the premise is, you follow the adventures of the graduated students of the famous Dungeonmans academy. Each student has been trained in the fine art of monster crushing, and now sets out to go forth and crush said monsters. They can find ways to upgrade their old academy - more books for the school's library, more equipment for the alchemy lab, and most importantly Proof of Stremfs. These things let the battlemaster teach you better stats, and most importantly they mean the next graduates start out with better stats when your current graduate inevitably dies.Because yes. It's a roguelike, and you will splat your Fightermans against an enemy with a bigger stick. Or you'll get overconfident, charge into a mob of punks, and die to their fanged pet. Or you'll discover that fighters without stamina can't handle kiting enemy mages. (I should have brought a potion of stamina, or just run away! Picking your fights wisely is the key to leveling up in this game.)But with each death, your next Wizardmans or Rangermans or whatevermans will be stronger, better, faster - and they'll conquer the next dungeon, and upgrade the local towns, and become famous! ...Up until they die.But that's Dungeonmans. Vicious, smart, and most importantly fair: none of the deaths I've walked into so far have been due to the game screwing me over, but instead because I was an idiot who didn't know how to run. I value that in a game. I also value its good music, its charming tilesets, its witty writing, and the fact that I didn't have to beat myself against the GUI to get going. I was in and splatting my poor Rangermans very quickly, and I'm eager to get going with another one.I mean, this one might live!			"

												Very short TL;DR at the bottom.I had a long detailed positive review of this game after a good five or ten hours playing. I had to edit this review, however. It was even better than I imagined.The game starts out as a fun roguelike and it is immediately endearing. The static character sprites become of little concern with all the wonderful animated effects and amazing soundtrack. It seems initially like a well-done roguelike with some cool mechanics involved. I won't get into those mechanics because it would be too hard to explain them without ranting about how cool they are.Shortly after grasping the game and being on your way in a fun roguelike, you become somewhat awed by how well the game plays and how neat the Academy building, nemesis system, soul-retrieving mechanics work. Then, once that shock starts to wear off, you'll notice the many dungeon themes, each with a whole set of mobs to go with the theme, and you'll start finding new themes. It's like a whole world of oldschool Dungeons and Dragons that's just thrown down for you to explore. Towns to bolster the prosperity of, bandit blockades to raid, Scrobold warrens, crypts, mage towers, it's all here.Now, there's a few key points that I noticed.No worrying about food or inventory limit. That's right, no worries on that. This irked me slightly at the outset, but I rationalized that inventory limits cause you to have to do a lot of backtracking and it gets boring tedious, not fun tedious. And there's a TON of loot to nab! So, removing the inventory limit was a smart move for this game. Well,  with no inventory limit, then hunger becomes pointless as it won't be long before you can just shove a ton of rations in your pack and forget about hunger for a while. It might sound odd to oldschool roguelike players, but the ramoval of the hunger and inventory limit are actually very good for this game and it really works.The loot system, while there's just a ton of stuff you're picking up, makes it very easy to manage the stuff you're actually interested in looking at as well as super easy to offload the stuff you don't want, through the clever use of tabs and sell/smelt selections when talking to shopkeeps/smiths.The game also has a lot of really cool psuedo-hidden ""secrets"". Every town is worth exploring. At lower levels, it's easy to ignore towns and, indeed, ignore many of your consumables (not to say lower levels are easy, trust me), but as you start fighting higher level enemies, you start paying a lot more attention to what you're using and how you're using it and you start wishing you'd bought all those scrolls of combat blinking and pin to win, but you didn't need them back then. You'd better grab them up with the next character!The combat itself defeats traditional roguelike standards in every way. The skills are all unique and build awesome characters and force you to truly pay attention to what spaces you're moving to. A fightermans doesn't just bump up against a mob until it dies - you have a number of special moves and you'd better make good use of them! What's more, you can customize your characters move sets and pick new skills from any class as you level. The classes are more like archetypes, really, just to give you a start, but you can choose a custom class as well.There's a resource building mechanic so that future characters will be more successful, but you can opt to build up those resources and still not use them in the spirit of traditional roguelikes, but they're there if you want to give yourself an edge - and in such a way that you pick which edges you want and ignore the others.There's a legacy system as well, but I won't try to explain it, just know that it's very very cool!Procedural world, running legacies, themed dungeons - a - many, very tactical combat, tons of items and loot to find, towns to explore, libromancers to irritate, lots of enemies, champions, and named bosses, this game pretty much has it all!TL;DR I honestly cannot give this game enough praise. It's hands-down the best roguelike I've ever played. If you like tile-based, grid-based roguelikes, DO NOT pass this game over!			"

												An innovative take on the rogue-like, Dungeonmans had me hooked for the first few hours that I played it.  The class and leveling system, though simple, was enjoyable.  The randomly generated world was a great feature for replayability and the legacy system capped it off with an academy that gets upgraded by your heroes exploits and offers perks to future heroes after your each one dies.  Unfortunately, the game seemed to quickly lose its luster when I realized that the difficulty seems quite easy for a legacy rogue-like.The game begins with your character graduating from your academy.  You will select their stat package from several randomly generated ones and then choose your class.  From this point on, you'll adventure through a procedurally generated world that is done decently well, though it could use a bit more variety throughout.  Acquiring special items will improve your academy and the benefits that it offers to your future graduates are exciting to unlock as is finding stolen goods that you can return to a town of your choice to boost their prosperity.  This will in turn make that town have a more effective stock of items that are sold at cheaper prices.In theory, this all adds up to a great game.  That changes quickly, however, once you realize that the game is fairly easy, especially when you consider that as a legacy rogue-like, a large part of its charm is death and moving on to your next hero.  With this foundation a bit shaky, the game's excitement waned rather quickly as the variety for a single hero seemed to be lacking.  I've now played multiple hours on the same character and, whenever a true threat revealed itself, I was either able to escape or outsmart it rather easily without ever being at risk of death.If Dungeonmans were in Early Access, I would give it a positive review as it lacks enough content to keep me playing on a single player and also the difficulty to facilitate me moving through the generations of my academy.  However, it does have a very strong foundation if the developer were to continue adding content and it has peaked my interest enough that I will be coming back to try the game again in the future and will change my review accordingly if it improves.  However, I currently do not recommend this game if only due to the fact that Dungeons of Dredmor is a superior game in the RPG rogue-like category and Rogue Legacy is a strong platformer/RPG rogue-like with an impressive legacy system.

Early Access Review
								Snarky, violent and in-between a Conan slash-em-up and a cartoony strategy, Dungeonmans has the potential to become one of the more remembered and loved roguelikes that have been gushing in the last few years.You are a recent Dungeonman graduate, ready to face the dangers of the land and bring glory to your name and that of your Academy. To do so, you delve deep into the several dungeons, ruins, temples and other dens of danger waiting for you to make one wrong move.In the vein of Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, the game is turn-based, with the ""You move, I move"" style in that sort of game, but that simplicity gives way to the dozens of skills your enemies wield to make your job a bit more difficult: cryomancers summon deadly icenados to stop you dead on your tracks, Giant Carpenter Bees block your way with ramparts, and let us not forget the Dreaded Jabber-Snap... It's up to you and your inventory to sort these motley miscreants out, whether by sword, spell or scroll.Leading these dangerous mobs are the Champions, souped-up, buffed-up monsters well capable of turning your Dungeonmans into Dungeonmash if you're not careful. Should you succeed in delaying your inevitable demise by killing them off, you are rewarded with Proofs of Stremf and Relics, oh so useful for upgrading your stats and your Academy. You read that right, the Academy: with each successful item return to the Headmaster, you are granted boosts and passive buffs to your Library, Alchemist, Blacksmith and Museum, giving future graduates a  handy leverage against the dangers awaiting them.Finally, there is the death system: when you die, and you will, your Dungeomans is dead and gone, with only a tombstone to remember him by. But fret not!: you did not die in vain. When exploring your previous place of death, future graduates may find the body and soul of the Dungeonmans, which grants you stat boosts and, were he powerful enough in his previous life, an artifact weapon, infused with the true Dungeonmans power.As the game is, it might seem short in content at times (the developer admitted to the need for more unique weapons and mobs), but what is there is enough to leave us oogling at and begging for more. I heartily reccomend this game, if not for the sake of its quality, then for the value it brings to this generation of rogue-likes.			"

Early Access Review
								Dungeonmans is a huge value buy. I'm over 100 hours in and it still provides new and interesting moments every time I play.It's a rogue-like and that means challenging permadeath gameplay; however, the game also has the ""Dungeonmans Academy"" which provides limited permanence and can make the game more forgiving over time for less skilled players. The combat is highly tactical (all turn-based) and different combinations of enemies continue to provide unique challenges even after you're familiar with how to defeat each enemy individually. The main level cap is 15, which sounds low, but each level represents a significant bump in power and challenge.Character advancement is simple, yet rewarding. Powers can be chosen freely without class restrictions, so you can have a wizard clad in full plate wielding a giant axe if you want. Some powers can only activate with certain gear equipped and a small handful of the most powerful abilities have to be ""unlocked"", but those restrictions all feel quite reasonable.One aspect of this game that's hard to describe is the humor and the overall feel. As you well might gather from the title ""Dungeonmans"", the game doesn't take itself too seriously. Oddball monster varieties, subtle self-reflective mocking of RPG/adventure game tropes, and humorous flavor text are woven into nearly every piece of the game. It helps balance the seriousness of the gameplay, frequently giving you a reason to smile while playing. It's also nice that the humor is unimposing and unpresumptuous--it doesn't try too hard to make you laugh. It reminds me a lot of the feel of a tabletop D&D session with old friends--occasionally serious, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, always enjoyable.The game is highly replayable for a number of reasons. 1) You usually know exactly why you die when you die (needed to drink a healing potion 3 rounds ago, shouldn't have entered that large room at half health, etc). 2) Since the academy makes subsequent attempts incrementally easier, there is always the challenge to complete the game in fewer characters. 3) The randomly generated dungeons occasionally have hidden rooms with very challenging encounters (sometimes optional, sometimes not). On later playthroughs, you can keep it interesting by opting in to these big challenges. 4) There are enough rare/unique items that I still see new loot nearly every playthrough. 5) The developer has teased several types of end-game content which will likely be available once the game is out of early access.The last thing I will say is that the developer has done an incredible job with the ""early access"" phase of this game. He is highly responsive to individual players, he openly shares progress, and regularly incorporates community feedback into the game development. He streams development on Twitch and releases updates regularly. That's exactly why a lot of gamers prefer indies over AAA publishers, so we need to make sure to show our appreciation for the ones who go out of their way to focus on community.SummaryPROSold school rogue-like challengehigh quality pixel art with a retro feelboth traditional keyboard and point-and-click input supportedawesome retro-RPG-inspired soundtrack by Zircon (of OCRemix renown)great replayabilityhighly engaged, responsive indie developerCONSPC onlydifficulty may be frustrating at first if you're new to rogue-likessprites are not fully animated (abilities are, but the sprites themselves remain static)difficulty curve spikes at some levels and falls off at others (may be resolved with full game release) "

Early Access Review
								Having played the Alpha the game has progressed significantly since it started 5 years ago.Since the game is still early access expect some of the weak points and criticisms to be fixed in later releases.The pre-alpha was released in 2009 and was very rough but was an original concept for Roguelikes that poked fun of the gentre well before ""Dungeons of Dreadmor"" was released.Graphics- Although the graphics are 2d they have a charm to them and Monsters and Boss monsters can be easily distinguished.- Each Character class has a Male and Female icon although it would be nice to see more Fightermans Icons and not just the Barbarian archtype.Characters- The class name are not Roguelike Standard names which gives the game some style and charm. more classes have been hinted at for later releases. Plot- Like other Roguelikes there is not a given Big Quest, it's more explore and discover.Magic- Scroll system has humorous names for spells and potions. As usual drinking and reading unidentified scrolls and potions can have negative effects.- Identified magically enhanced items are blue and identified cursed items are red. All unidentified equippable magically enhanced items are blue so be careful.This game has both dungeons and towns to explore. You start at the Dungeonmans Academy where you can get basic training and upgrade later as you complete dungeons. The advantage of upgrading the Academy is that new characters star with better equipment and more knowledge. This is a hard game don't expect your first character to survive the first dungeon, half the fun is trying out different characters and playstyles.I recommend this  for people who are tired of standard Roguelikjes and like homor in their games.I've not given class , monster , item or skill names to avoid spoiling the fun.Although the sound effects are fairly minimal the music is exceptional and very reminiscent of Tangerine Dream's 1980's period. Expect me to update this review as the game is updated.			"

												Dungeonmans is a rougelike with a delightfully snarky sense of humor. As a recent graduate of Dungeonmans Academy, you are sent forth to make the world safe for ordinary townsfolk. You'll face dozens of dungeon-dwelling enemies, from strange and exotic creatures, to knights and wizards, and eventually come face to face with the Dread Purpleonians.After picking from among some truly abysmal starting stats, your hero-to-be can select from among several pre-built classes, or mix and match masteries to create a customized monster-bashing powerhouse. Each of these classes has a very different style of play, allowing for different tactics. Whether you favor a Wizardmans, Necromanser, Rangermans, or Southern Gentlemans, you'll need to keep an eye on important resource pools like Health, Stamina, Foom, Ire, and Deadpulses to unleash powerful attacks or invoke defensive manuvers.The overworld is persistent -- although you can generate a new world map at any time --but each dungeon or tower is randomly generated, as are the beasts and treasures within. Defeat Champions to collect Proofs of Stremf, trophies that allow you to enhance your hero's stats and boost those of future graduates as well. If your hero can fight his or her way back to the Academy, you can deposit these Proofs of Stremf along with books, equipment, and other trinkets that can be used by other Dungeonmans in the event of your untimely (and highly likely) demise.I've played this game since its early beta days, and it's gotten better and more polished with each update and expansion. I've sent more than 30 adventurers to their deaths so far, and never had a single one make it beyond level 10, but there are always fresh faces back at the academy eager to test their mettle, and I keep coming back for more.Someday I'll crush those Dread Purplonians. I won't let you down next time, Headmaster!			"

												Let's be clear: The core gameplay here is very fun, there is a wide variety of skill trees and character types, the humor is spot on, and the academy building between-characters metagame is well implemented and feels rewarding. Enemy types are varied, and many have abilities that move themselves or you across the battlefield to keep things fresh. And honestly it works well as a roguelike.I really, really want to recommend this game.But I can't in good conscience, because it feels half-finished, like an early access game. And the developers show no signs they want to fix anything.First off, there's bugs all over the place. Both big and small, including some that wreck people's save files. There's also lots of stuff (especially in the late game) that is missing its description because they never got around to it.Game balance is also wonky. The defensive stats do practically nothing for your defense early on but makes you virtually invincible at high levels, except against a few specific enemies with specific spells. Some skills do virtually nothing but act as as stepping stones to more important skills, or are hideously weak compared to skills that are available earlier. You can tell at a glance that some character perks are stronger than others. The graveyard dungeons have way too high a loot-to-risk ratio. Many bosses are pushovers, except the final boss who has an instant-kill attack (yes, in a roguelike). And the holy/dark elements are given tons of weight in the random item abilities but are virtually absent except in the final dungeon (where everyone's dark).So overall, this game is very fun but has massive flaws. I just can't give it a positive review when it's this obviously unfinished.			"

								Dungeonmans is an incredibly satisfying roguelike, in whose current incarnation bosses literally explode into piles of loot. The constant progression of the Academy means you actually eke out a little progress each playthrough, even when your character dies. The varied skills and satisfying ranged combat means there are quite a variety of valid play methods, while the 8-way movement/combat means it's important to think tactically to make sure you're not surrounded and pulped by a mass of enemies. Overall it's a terrific game, with a good balance of difficulty and progress reward to keep you coming back for more.			"

												I'm LOVING this game! It has a good sense of humor, is very colorful, adds interesting game elements in the form of the Academy you build up, and WILL KICK YOU IN THE TEETH if you aren't paying attention! I say that as a term of endearment. The price of ♥♥♥♥ing up is very high - you die. No extra lives, no loading saves. You DO get a statue built in your memory at the Academy, though. Then you'll roll up another graduate, that benefits from the Proofs of Stremf (NOT a typo) you earned from beating worthy (Read - not weaker than you are.) mini-bosses. You'll feel like you're tear-assing across the land like a tumultous tornado of♥♥♥♥♥kick, testosterone, and mansliness! Which is highly satisfying, but you better not get in over your head, or that high will come crashing down FAST. BAM! Dead, create new graduate!Yet, for all that, its a fun and challenging experience, with ability to mix fantasy achetypes as you go along. The flavor is strong with DnD style - items of +1, +2, et cetera that can be upgraded if you find the proper scrolls to enchant them. There are many highly-useful scrolls and potions you'll come across to use. They WILL save your life, for which I refer you to the above paragraph, and allow you to keep that tornado rolling!Just buy the game - its well worth it! Unless you're a wuss who wants an easy-mode that holds your hand when you should be dead (in-game).			"

It's a pretty straightforward nod to Rogue, Larn, NetHack, and many others. Just make sure you dig into the skill tree. There's more there than is first apparent.			"

												Do you want a roguelike that isn’t hard, but also isn’t easy either? Then Dungeonmans is a great choice.Here’s one of my biggest hurdles when it comes to roguelikes, the sense of dread when I lose my fav character. There are days I’m in the mood to do some ironman runs on games, and most days I’m not.Dungeonmans manages quite gracefully to find a middle point between those playstyles by letting you add more info about the enemies through books and experience. Your homebase is like a lovely reminder of how much you’ve accomplished during the past runs.But, as I stated before, it doesn’t make things easy for you. One misstep and you’re dead, learn how to create safe spaces, how to properly apply skills and you’re in for a treat. On top of that, great sense of humor and some nice aesthetics. And oh! If you’re like me and prefers mouse instead of keyboard, the dev went out of his way to make it completely playable in both cases.  "

								Preliminary review: it's good, buy it.Ranged combat is very satisfying: you can hold the fire key down and keep shooting arrows in the same way you can hold down movement keys to keep moving in games.There are definitely some rough edges but they don't detract from the fun too much. Things like when you get new skills they aren't automatically placed on your hotbar, and trying to drag a skill in icon form from the skill tree to your hotbar crashes the game.There is quite a bit of persistance though. You are always upgrading your academy. The world map seems always the same - at least with a new character with the same academy.The overall feel is like as if they made Rogue Legacy (a roguelite platform game) into an actual roguelike game. You even pick 2 perks for each new character. "

Are you Dungeonmans material?Bash mans with mighty stremf, blast mans with mightier foom, use the power of science to discover new and powerful methods to crush mans.Build your academy and pass down your mightiest weapons and armor to future students. Train your trainers to train your new mans to become mightier Dungeonmans before they step foot in a nasty smelly dungeon (or inverted dungeon, we call these towers).Is Dungeonmans for you?Do you enjoy bashing other mans and womans?Do you enjoy a freeform skill system that allows you to cherrypick the most broken skills create the custom mans of your dreams?Do you like the thought of exploring a persistent world and building your own Academy and the towns in the world?Do you enjoy a dungeon crawling rpg with all the fat trimmed and nothing but lean purple muscle remaining?Dungeonmans is not yet a fully polished game, there are skill, equipment, economy, monster, and dungeon imbalances. The final purpleonium (really) area isn't quite done yet. The Academy still has more renovating to do.But that said, Dungeonmans is a fully playable game from start to finish, has charming sprite work, wonderful music, extremely simple controls, great tactical combat, enemy and dungeon variety, some very sharp design concepts, and a ton of potential.For veterans of this genre you will probably knock out the final boss in a few days (and a few dead mans) and be left thirsting for more.For players new to the idea of permadeath, Dungeonmans is a great introduction to the genre, as the Academy ensures that each new character you create will be just a little bit more powerful, and game mechanics are largely intuitive and easy to grasp (... which is not to say the game itself is easy, you can and will die quite fast if you don't pay attention!).Dungeonmans is a fun game right now, and it is simply begging for expanded content and more refinement of its already enjoyable mechanics. Dive in now if you like (or think you might like!) this sort of game, otherwise, slap Dungeonmans on your Wishlist and keep an eye on it, it's only going to get better from here.			"

												Dungeonmans is a neat game where you play as an adventurer, explore the realm, likely die horribly, and then - you start a new adventurer in the same world!No, wait, don't go, this is still a rogue-like! You'll find that the dungeons you explored initially will all be procedurally randomized again!Whoo, okay, so! -Dungeonmans is essentially a Rogue-like with a persistent world. You essentially make a seed for a randomly seeded world map, and then spawn your character into it from the Dungeonmans Academy (more on this later). From there you venture out into the world clobbering enemies and likely eventually getting clobbered yourself! When you die, your remains will remain in the level of the world where you died (unless you get to a high enough level, in which case something else happens); and you will have to make a new character to spawn into the world with.Spawning into the world again, you will find that the world map is the same, though there will be some negative effects from your last characters death. Bandits will have set upon the roads and towns, and towns you invested in on prior run(s), dungeons you visited will be randomized to feature new layouts to re-explore, and the remains of your prior adventurer will be around to collect loot and experience from.And that pretty much sums up what this game is all about above. But there is more - and unfortunately, not all that good....Essentially, if your character gets to a specific level, you can retire your character. Retiring your character you might go and opening an inn, go back to teach further recruits of the dungeonmans academy some learned tricks from your retired character, or just go about wandering.The key problem here though is that is leads to a situation where you'll be doing unfun things like 'farming' characters to level 10 to retire so that you can essentially make better and better dungeonman characters to do things with.Now, as a note, this game does now have an Ironmans mode as of this review, but playing on a single run will have a very generic rogue-like experience that gets away from what the gameplay of dungeomans is really all about - a persistent world.This is one of the odd rogue-likes that I both 'recommend' but give a wary warning about. It is a really interesting example of a rogue-like because it has that persistent world concept, and it is worth experiencing because it is really neat.However, because of the farming factor present, this is also a game I would suggest avoiding if you want a game you could really sink your teeth into and enjoy			"

												Alright, so let me just say first off that this is the best rouguelike I've payed for to date.First lets examine how it shapes up as a roguelike, its got all the elements that I would consider defining for the genre. Turn based combat in a square tile grid, full keyboard controls, randomly generated loot and monsters, secret passages and a progression system[levelling up] for your character. Diverse and varied classes, albeit in my opinion there is a distinct lack of classes, which I would count as a negative but hopefully classes can be added later or modded in. It also has the characteristic difficulty, if it is slightly easier than most rougelikes but, if you're not careful you can find yourself out of your element and dead quite quickly.What it lacks in the hardcore area it makes up for in the actual playability, graphical fidelity and clarity. While there are some elements of the UI I'm not super impressed with generally speaking its miles ahead in terms of accessability so - if you've been looking to get into the rouguelike genre I think this would be a good place to start. The only problem is that you will probably miss out on a lot of the genre related jokes but there is plenty of humour to be found here which is tucked away in descriptions and text which you only read once.In terms of graphics its not amazing, but compared to others of the genre I feel its miles ahead, which a strong aestethic and good clarity you'll never be squinting at the screen trying to see if thats a goblin[g] or an arch wizard[Z]. The combat, in my opinion is very advanced for a game of the genre. It takes the basics of rouguelike principles and throws a few wrenches in the works. Time honoured tactics of hiding in doorways to funnel enemies in one by one work great. That is until you encounter more advanced monsters - who can fling you around the room, dash through you to surround you and knock you back either throwing you into a room filled with bomb throwing maniacs who are as much a danger to themselves as you or getting behind you turning your careful funnel into a two versus one. Additionally some monsters will spawn barricades and ice blocks to trap you in with their friends which keeps the combat frantic and yet the player must be deliberate and pray that the carpenter bee doesn't summon ANOTHER barricade in the way of the door lest the swarm of blue lizard men things do horrible things with their claws and spears to the heroes hasty behind.Each class has a distinct playstyle, the gentleman AKA barbarian builds up fury when hit and can unlease it in a tantrum, giving them a lot of buffs to damage as would be expected. The Bannerman fights with a spear and favours being fairly immobile with lifesteal and ranged purity magic - though he can get a move on when he needs to, opting for a more mobile polearm and bow style or entrenching with a heavy shield and poleaxe to cut down multiple foes at a time. You'll be spoiled for choice as each class can be played in a variety of ways. Even the necromancer doesn't really use magic as you would expect, instead generating a resource from corpses that forms the basis of all their spells. Summon the undead to do your bidding or blow up a corpse potentially chaining through an entire infested room causing utter destruction and chaos. There are meaningful choices and paths to take for each class and I think this is one of the games biggest strengths.As for the permanent buffs that can be obtained from adventuring and making it back to the Academy alive? They are, for the most part, fairly underwhelming and are more of a kickstart to your adventure allowing you to optionally identify some of the potions and scrolls in the game although - if you like to kick it old school you can and instead discover things as you go. To be fair though, as you progress later in the game some of the artifacts can be quite awesome. Even the stat gains you earn permanently seem to have diminishing returns meaning its hard to get to the point where every character will be utter ownage and its more of a long term slight boost with each run. All things considered, this is a refreshing and interesting title in the rouguelike genre. Rouguelike players are notoriously new-game-ophobic as they're comfortable in their habits. This title makes some great efforts to shake things up and I think it has done so tremendously. My only real negative for recommending it is the price point, I'm not sure the game feels justified at the 15$ mark[15Euro for us europeans] but I have got nearly 3 times the entertainment time of a movie ticket for around the same price so I can't complain too much. I probably would have avoided this title at the 20$ mark, but at 15$ it less questionable. If you're not sold on this review but are interested I'd recommend picking it up on sale for anything around or under the 10$ mark. At the time of writing at least, with 7 hours in.			"

Early Access Review
								A very mediocre rpg-roguelike, where you take the role of a young adventurer, that travels the world to grow strong enough to beat the big dog.I had pretty high expectations in this game, but realized fast, that the videos imply more than there actually is, and regret the bought, at least for the current price and state of developement, which felt more like an alpha version to me, than an almost complete product. There is so much room for improvement, and such an obvious lack of polishment everywhere:* There is no story(line) and there are no quests, just an open world. Which is bad, as the game lacks long-term motivation right now* There are no difficulty levels, which means, that some players will find the game too easy or too fast-paced, while others will find it too tough or too slow-paced...* The interface, in the current state, is pretty bad: unintuitive, ugly and incomplete!* Almost all battles play always the same: Kill everything (with your standard attack(s)), press ""rest"" until you are fully recovered, go on* Leveling is painfully slow. After the first couple of level-ups, you will need to ""farm"" forever to advance* There is little depth, little complexity (both not even close to TOME) and very little to do (besides monster hunting).There are few abilities for each class, and event though they can be mixed freely, characters reach their optimal configuration very fast* The balance is pretty bad atm. There are dungeons that are labeled as too easy, and thats what they are. Just rush through and kill everything you see. And then there are the other dungeons, where permanent death comes incredibly fast, and is often inevitable* Whenever a hero has died, its name is blocked for future heroes* Hero creation is a painful process: Stats are randomly generated, and if youre not happy with them, you have to delete the world and hero and start all over...(theoretically, you can keep your world, if you can accept to have to think out a unique name after each roll, as every name of every hero you dismissed will be permanently blocked as well).That rolls are saved for several turns, makes the creation of a good hero extremely stressy and time-consuming.* There is a very small crafting feature, in which i had big hopes, (to be honest, it was the reason for me to buy this game) but which isnt planned to be expanded, so that there isnt a single aspect, that would make this game unique among the stream of competetors* The game uses a rude form of humor, which i can neither enjoy, nor would i expect such a niveau from a professional game(f.e. ""This library [...] is as barren as my miserable wifes dusty womb and as empty as your rattling head"")* The game did NOT save my content until i had completely deleted and reinstalled the game.By that time, i had spent a whole hour creating a strong hero, and another two hours playing, just to realize that my whole content was lost in the meantime!* On the subjective side, which is an important reason for me to to support a product or not: In my personal oppinion, the dev is arrogant, unmature and unsympathic!(One example from the forum, where i asked for WASD key usage: ""Also, WASD is for chumps [...]. Use the numpad and be a professional"").I have no words for such a person and behavior, and will definitely NOT support this developer EVER again!And regarding the fact, that the game is supposed to be released soon, no fundamental improvements can be awaited, which is bad, as the game gets repetetive and boring fast, as there is hardly anything to do than killing enemies, which usually doesnt need any tactical behavior and isnt as rewarding as it should be.And here we got the main problem: Its a game about battles, almost purely, which failed in creating a decent mechanic around those. The current possibilities of hero developement are small, and many talents are just not worth using them, so that a player gets to the point, where he has reached the one optimal configuration for each class-combination fast, and after that, the motivation sinks rapidly...Therefore, there is -currently- no reason to spend 15$ on this title, where there is so much better stuff available (f.e. TOME, Dungeons of Dredmor, ADOM, Abadon, DoomRL, Elona...) for less or no money.Still, there is hope, as the potential is there, and the game is still in developement...			"

												I don't really understand why this is reviewed so well. It's really not a well-designed rogue-lite.So, what is dungeonmans? It's a rogue(lite) game in which you pick a character, customize some of it's stats and perks, select a class (optional) and off you go to slay random monsters around the randomly generated world. Or die horribly.What is different from most roguelike games is,  that unlike most roguelikes where after you die you roll a completely fresh character, is that you can eventually upgrade your starting characters with various perks by bringing back various items to the starting zone: base stats, better starting gear, you can even unlock entire skill trees from the get-go.However, this is where the core issue lies. The game balance is designed with this in mind. You will need to essentially farm stats for your future character to succeed. Otherwise you will literally get one shoted by higher tier monsters. And there is no way of working around it. The hordes of enemies and the lack of complex spells and abilities waters down the gameplay to ""grind stats, die, start another characters, repeat"" until you EVENTUALLY get strong enough to walk over everyone' faces.The ""randomly generated"" dungeons are very repetitive with no interesting objects to interact with. The loot is tiered, meaning as soon as you get an item from a higher tier the other ones become obsolete. The skill ""trees"" are a sad joke.Overall, not a good game, not even as a ""babbys first roguelike"".			"

												A fun game, but with many flaws. If the game would have been more polished I would recommend it. As is, I can't.ProsThe progression system is great. Every play-through will earn you points that improve your next play-through.When the going gets tough and you try to flee and have a near-death experience, the game is at its best.The in-game (dungeon) map is great.The levels are also a good size. Not too small and not too large (my opinion).There is a fairly good variety of types of dungeons.ConsThere is no proper manual. I've literally had to ask half a dozen questions on the forums to try and figure out how things work. The wiki is also completely useless. Even the most basic things are hidden and have to be guessed.One-shot kills. Sometimes you encounter an enemy that one-shot kills you. Out of the blue. Hours of working on a character arbitrarily gone in 1 second. This has forced me to write a script to do save scumming to circumvent this totally unfair game mechanic.One of the most important things in a loot game is item comparison. It is downright terrible here. There is no way to quickly compare items other then taking out a calculator and doing the math yourself.The inventory system is very poor. There is no way to sort items. Also, different types of weapons and armor you can't even wear aren't separated. This makes sorting out a long list of loot needlessly time-consuming.The world overview map is incredibly bad. It's a jumbled mess with random numbers and a POI list going off screen! It is completely unusable.The world map itself is also terrible. Dungeons that are cleared partially obscure other dungeons. There is no easy way to see which level a dungeon is (you have to mouse over them one by one which is incredibly tedious). Trivially easy dungeons can be skipped and you get loot for them, but you need to click them one by one and the loot flies everywhere. This gets incredibly tedious when you need to clear 20 or 30 trivial dungeons at a time. Also, the loot is invisible because it is behind the dungeon icon.There are many bugs and random crashes. Luckily, the game saves often so you generally don't lose too much progress.Very laggy. Especially when you have a couple of summoned skeletons.No real AI, all enemies walk straight towards you.Poor path-finding (sometimes it literally doesn't work).Navigation is annoying because of diagonal movement. I use the cursor keys to move and use the mouse to move diagonally. I generally just take some extra hits so I don't need to reach for the mouse to move diagonally. It totally takes the pacing out of the game. You can set keys for diagonal movement, but I find that very unwieldy.The bonuses are incredibly obtuse. They are of the form ""Sometimes causes <effect>"". How much is that? 1%? 10%? Completely useless for determining whether it's a useful effect or not. "

												I can almost give this game a thumbs up.  It has a lot going for it.  It has some dynamic classes you can make, and I like the persistence of the academy where you can get previous hero's gear, id potions and scrolls and a few other things.  I also like the open nature of the world and the fact that you can customize your gear with enchants and stuff.However, there is something that really pisses me off about this game and I consider terrible game design.  I had several good runs just end because of total BS bosses.  Really, the final one took the cake and just was beyond stupd and made me not want to play this game anymore.Anyway, in general it goes something like this.1.  Open a door.2. DieOr1. Open door and enter room.2.  See some odd effect on a boss and wonder what it does.3. Die.When you are in a dungeon where most of the monsters, including champions don't even touch you, that the boss, while challenging, should not one shot you or wipe the floor with you as you desperatly get away.  Unless you are stupid, you should not die like this.   There is an escape scroll you can use, but it takes 20 rounds to activate. Plenty of time to die some of these BS bosses.Now let me tell you about the last, total BS boss.  It was not even a dungeon boss, just opened a door and there he was.  I guess that makes him a champion and not a boss (even worse).The first thing this boss does is steal my weapon.  This has never happened before.  I rummnage around my backpack and get another weapon and equip it.  While I do this, he steals my armor.  Again, this is beyond stupid.  I also have a pet called a hateglacier which is fairly tough.  He 2 shots the pet.  I had close to 400 hp, and he drops me to 60 pts in one hit.  I teleport away (after having lost my really good armor and weapon to this guy).  I do through a scroll.  BTW when he hit me, not only did he do a tun of damage, but he took away nearly all my stamina too.  Then I try and run away, but he is really fast.  I am sucking down potions and teleporting, buring all my consumables. It is no use.  Game over.I spent like 6 hours on this character and that kind of end just doesn't sit well to me.  Difficulty should ramp up and scale somewhat evenly. It should not spike like a 1000 foot vertical wall.All and all this game is somewhat repetitive (after having like 10 characters I was really bored of the first part of the game) and clearly needs some major balance.  If you are in a dungeon and you are fairly ""safe"" from even the occasional champion, you should not open doors to things like this.  Also stealing equipped items is just stupid (although, if he did not steal those items, I am sure he would have wiped the floor with me anyway).			"

												This game gave me quite a journey. I found it more fun than FTL but that's just my opinion. Choosing the proper skills and equipment that go well together is a key for survival and winning many a victorious battle. It also helps to have a lot of potions as back-up in case things get hairy, akthough near the end game you should have more potions than a bar has alcohol. Definitely will pick this up for my friends for over the holidays.			"

												There is a lot more to this game than it seems! The concept may appear simple, but there is great depth to the amount and diversity of the dungeons, equipment, skills, and monsters. It's also a game that doesn't take itself very seriously, which just adds to how much fun it is. Random worlds and dungeons combined with fast-paced gameplay and the ability to save anywhere make it an equally great game for when you have a few spare minutes or hours on end.This should be in every rogue-like enthusiast's library! Just be ready for lots of bees, references to bees, and jokes about bees!			"

								Let go of your mouse and let the fun begin :)I have to admit it took a very quick first death for me to learn the systems and controls in this game.  After this:  it has been nothing but fun.  Personally, I prefer both the art style and the view distance to a game like Dungeons of Dredmor.  It feels more strategic when you can see more than a few tiles away in each direction.  I also prefer the humor in this game to most ""funny"" games on steam.  I think this game does an even better job of nailing the humor Dredmor was going for.  I have played 4 different starting classes now and found all of them enjoyable.  The things I havent much liked:Lack of character/event animations for certain things (probably will not be significantly improved due to the graphical style and limitations of indie dev) UI improvement and missing art assets.  (Both of these have been addressed as planned for future updates)Wishlist:Additional ""content"".   You are going to play this game a lot of times if you enjoy it.  It would be great if there was a little more variation between bows/ shields etc early on.  The more variety/within reason (obv you have to control the RNG) the more fun for the player :)			"

												I watched this game for a loong time. Had it in my watch list since earlier this year. And I can honestly say I was missing out. The game isn't as hardcore as other Rogue Likes,. And at first, that was kind of a turn off. But I quickly found out that the  difficullty ramps up quickly. And takes skill to master. It strikes a perfect balance of greed vs peril vs reward. It keeps you coming back. After cursing yourself for getting in over your head  for that sweet loot and dying, you quickly fire up another game. The sound efx and music are some of the best I heard in a rougue-like. The game doesnt take itself seriously and I found myself enjoying the jokes. This is  the National lampoon of Rogue-Likes. But well madeeditAfter putting in major hours I still reccommend it but there are quite a few bugs that need to be fixed. While this is great,  there are still some bugs that can take the skill away and leave your life up to happenstance.update. All major bugs squished enjoy!			"

												Note before reading: This is a really fast pace dungeon rogue like (You barely notice its turn based. Not that it is a bad thing) that is challenging but very much skill based. Contains permadeath and uses it in a unique and amazing way. It's in my opinion worth every cent.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Truly a work of art this one. I love what they did with the permadeath that the legend of your past life still is being told by others. The things you did in the past lives you lived change the world in a good scale. About the gameplay. It's perfectly done along with the classes you can choose. The perks and weapons all play differently. Replayability is perfect in this game. Note about myself: I love Roguelikes since I played Dungeons of Dredmor (Also a really good game). And love challenging games with permadeath(Rogue like or not does not really matter).			"

												Definitely recommended if you enjoy diffisult turn-based dungeon crawls.I bought this game on a whim since I enjoy roguelikes, and I was not disappointed. The game takes a little getting used to even with a passing familiarity with the genre. There are certain aspects of the game that are not very intuitive right now. If you clear the dungeon closest to your starting Dungeonmans Academy, you'll already out-class all the other surrounding dungeons, with no option to go inside them. You do get an option to receive a handful of loot from them, but it's typically not that great. Once you find a dungeon you can enter, the difficulty is typically much higher than you can handle with just the first cave's loot and experience. This quirk resulted in several futile attempts at the game until I figured out that you can enter a dungeon and leave, which marks that dungeon and lets you re-enter it later even if your level ""surpasses"" it. Since this issue has a workaround, it's not game-breaking or anything, but I do think the level restrictions could be loosened or allow a third option to enter a weaker dungeon anyway, rather than just ""auto-clear"" and ""leave it alone"". There are some dialog options in your Dungeonmans Academy that seem to do nothing, particularly with the museum curator. I've not run into very many other bugs.In all other areas, Dungeonmans surpassed my expectations. The graphics are simple but look great with some nice detail, and are suited to the old-school style of gameplay. There is a variety of classes to play as to change things up if you get bored playing the game one way. The music is pretty good, and gives a nice atmosphere to the various dungeons. There are multiple dungeon ""types"", such as swamp, catacombs/graveyard, ruins (typical dungeon), and tower. Each dungeon type provides a different experience, and I found it a nice changeup while playing. There are also some nice touches such as secret doors, magic pools that will randomly help/harm you, and portals that may take you to rooms filled with either monsters, secret shops, or several strong ""champion"" level monsters. I've put about 15 hours into the game as of writing this review, and I plan to play it for many more.			"

Early Access Review
								I love this game, and I played its VERY old alpha demo for 20+ hours(over a year) guaranteed, and now I finally get to buy the game on steam. Everything's is much more polished, though the help screen displaying the keybindings could seriously need some cleaning up. Edit: They quickly fixed this in a recent update, just a day or so after this review. Coincidence? I like to think they saw my suggestion and listened. Makes me feel special and feel like I helped. :D:This is a traditional roguelike with a tileset, and a persistent base called the Dungeonmans Academy that can be upgraded, and all features unlocked/improved can and will be used by future characters. In the beginning, you make a world, then you make your character. The character starts out in the Academy in your world, and you go forth from there. The Overworld is generated when you make your world, and stays the same, though the dungeons continue to be randomly generated. When you die, you make a new character, and go back to the same world with the Academy you've been working on. You can have 3 seperate worlds at once.There are plenty of skills and passives you can unlock when you level, supporting many styles of play: Dual Wielding, Sword and Board, Magic, Two-Handers, Necromancy, Bows, Spears, Light/Medium/Heavy Armor(or Light ""Armor""/Medium Armor/Real Armor as the game calls them). And I know I missed a few. There are also unidentified and randomized names for scrolls and potions too. The large variety of potions and scrolls reminds me of Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.There's also a lot of goo humor in the game, from the dialogue, item/skill/spell descriptions, and events.I definitely recommend this game to any fan of roguelikes.Edit: Since it sorta looks like they saw my review with a suggestion and listened, I'm gonna try and help more, and give suggestions. I'll update this fairly often. Only real problem now is that getting to the center of mountain ranges is a pain, since I hate having unexplored areas within my travel range. It'd be nice to have mountains traversable, but take longer to do so or guarantee us being attacked. In the Roguelike 'One Way Heroics', you have to hold the direction key in the mountains direction for 3 or so seconds, then you move onto that tile. Maybe have it so that happens, and you're guaranteed to be attacked by mountain bandits/scrobolds.This was updated 3 times so far on February 8th, 2015 "

Early Access Review
								I supported this game's kickstarter on the basis of a very strong pre-alpha demo, and since then, the game has continued to get better and better.  This is a roguelike, but with an academy that is persistent between characters, that you can upgrade in a variety of ways in order in order to make the game slightly easier for each subsequent character (these improvements are all optional, so if you want to treat this as a more traditional/dangerous roguelike, you can).The game includes several classes that you can play, but this is misleading, since every character can potentially learn every skill.  The classes serve more as a good starting template for a particular play-style.  You can also select the 'Adventuremans' class and build your own from scratch, if you prefer.  Classes include Warriormans, Wizardmans, Rangermans, Necromans, Southern Gentlemans, and Bannermans (as well as the blank slate which is the Adventuremans).Even though this is early access, it feels like a fully fleshed out game.  The devs are VERY responsive to problems and active in the Steam forums.  And there are more features coming in at a slow but steady pace (crafting, for example, isn't quite there yet, but it's on the horizon).Even in its early access state, this is one of the best roguelike games currently available on Steam.

												Asking price is over-the-top, really needs to be toned down by at least 1/2 considering how little depth there is in the combat and skill areas. The only feature that is noteworthy is the academy, everything else, the art, the way the game mechanics operate and the overland map are very lackluster. Considering I've bought or played for free Dungeons of Dredmore, Bionicdues, Sword of the Stars The Pit, TOME, ADOM, IVAN, Stone Soup, Rogue, and several mash-up games, like Don't Starve...this one is meh considering the price..

												This is what I had hoped Rogue Legacy would be. You can win with any given character (there is an achievement for winning with your first), but failing isn't too bad.The main ways of improving future characters are getting to xp level 9 or higher (out of 15) and winning (and returning) stat increase items from powerful enemies. You gain 2 points to spend on stats, and all future characters gain one.My only complaint is the abilities are all cooldown-based, but at least you can still use abilities on cooldown for an increased cost.

								Wow.  I've played a lot of ""retro rogue-likes"" lately, and they've all let me down.  After seeing this game mentioned somewhere I grabbed it on a whim, and suddenly my entire Friday night was gone.  The randomly generated dungeons filled with loot, the incredibly rewarding combat, the joy of exploration and reaching the end of the dungeon and killing the boss...  It's all great.  Strongly recommend!			"

												This is one of those games that you tell your friend, "" the graphics are ok but the gameplay far exceeds what it looks like and make it worth every penny""There are several classes and difficulties to start with and each builds nicely with in game Mastery skills that are both class orientated and generalized for dungeon crawling. The real meat of this game in my opinion is the Academy and its abilities to grow and upgrade your future characters, while also providing benefits to your current character.The Roguelike piece comes in with the academy where you character is basically permadeath and he helps to build things and make life easier for your next character. The academy is a potion shop, library, blacksmith and a few other pieces that really make the gameplay fun. There are also towns along the way that you can help to upgrade their wares with prestige chests found in the game.The turn based combat fits very well with this game as it allows you to actually strategize your moves when surrounded or in a bad situation, you make a selection of move and the enemies react all together and it continues one move at a time until it’s over.The only thing really unsure of but has grown on me was the controls in the game, as it is best played with Keyboard or controller only, this was hard for a KBD/Mouse veteran like myself but the keyboard functions are all mappable and they work well.I can’t say enough about this little gem of a game and there is no better time to get it then now during a Steam sale but it is definitely worth every penny at normal cost, will provide hours and days of fun....

								I backed this game on Kickstarter and I have been very impressed. I've played dozens of hours and a decent number of characters. It's great to see this game finally get on Steam, and it certainly deserves to be here.You can start with the ability to choose one our of a few random stat lines. You then choose a character class, complete with basic skills and gear, or you can choose a generic Dungeonmans and you get to play as you like. You can be part magic, part ranged and part melee if you really like, though I find a combination of two of those damage paradigms works nicely.The game has come along nicely since the first public version was released. The creator has responded to feedback quickly and it's obvious that he loves this game, and he wants it to be the best it can be.What I love is how it's permadeath ... BUT your next characters will be better due to the efforts of your fallen Dungeonmans.I encourage you all to pick up Dungeonmans and hopefully you'll have as much fun as I have had. Or if you choose to wait, at least add this to your watchlist to see how the final game turns out. In my opinion there's no need to wait, as the game is great as it is.			"

								Dungeonmans is fun in short bursts. As a graphical rouge-like it has a wide over-world as well as many dungeons to explore.What sets it apart from other rouge-likes is the persistence of the world. As your heros explore and return with knowledge, this can be passed on to the next hero, or not. It is up to you if you want to have scrolls and potions identifed before setting out.So far it is fun for an hour or so at a time and the death of a hero doesnt really mean a great deal. So while perma death is very real the game is still fun for the casual player.			"

												Out of pure stubbornness, I've made character after character until finally I realized that this game just isn't any fun. Starting over, over and over and over gets Really old after a while. Yes, the stremf point collection makes it a little faster each time, but so what? Doing the same boring crap over again a hundred times, trying to rebuild your inventory and cash supply is mind numbing.   But you know, I could actually grind through that if not for the simple fact that this game is at random TERRIBLY unbalanced, and you can't plan for it.   You can be breezing though a dungeon without issue, then suddenly you're surrounded by higher lv enemies and dead before you can respond. Why not just introduce deadly diseases if you want us to die at random?  ""Oops, you died of undiagnosed CANCER! Time to start over!""  No thanks.I know it's ""rogue-like"" and people without imagination think that means it's supposed to be incredibly frustrating so that 90% of people won't enjoy it for long, but that's just geek snobbery. This game just plain isn't fun anymore, and I regret spending  money on it. If it were $5, Id say it was worth it. At 19.99 I very much regret buying this, as I won't be playing it anymore. Tales of Maj'eyal was far more entertaining, go look at that instead.			"

												Excellent mix of retro-rpg atmosphere and roguelike dungeon crawling. The academy mechanic inspires you to do your best not only for yourself, but for future graduates after your impending death. All in all a great game; more laid back than most traditional roguelikes in that instant-deaths are pretty rare, but the challenge does scale up pretty well and will make you consider each turn during some of the tougher fights.Well worth the asking price. If you need more convincing, check out the interviews with the developer on Roguelike Radio (www.roguelikeradio.com).			"

												Dungeonmans, oh dungeonmans.My favorite things about Dungeonmans after over 90 hours of play:- Humor - It gets a bit silly at times, but in general the game is very amusing.- Varied Playstyles - There are several significantly different playstyles available, and it's fun to explore them all.- The Academy - I'm a huge fan of how each hero you play can improve the Academy for future heroes. It's a fun way to add meta-progression.My least favorite things:- The difficulty can be unpredictable sometimes, especially towards the endgame.- The Academy - As awesome as I said the academy is under my favorites, it gets maxed out too quickly, and leaves me wanting more.

												Dungeonmans is a fast-paced roguelike that has an excellent sense of humor. On top of all your normal roguelike tropes (permadeath, random dungeons, piles of gear, hordes of enemies to kill) Dungeonmans is built upon a number of pillars that make it an absolute joy to play.Constant Progression (!! Optional !!)This is something that could turn off someone looking for a more hardcore roguelike were it not entirely optional. When you first create an academy you have the option of instead making an Ironman Academy that forces you to start completely fresh with each character in that world.If you elect not to play with an Ironman Academy, each dungeonman you throw out into the world will help to slowly build up your academy so that it grants bonuses to newly trained dungeonmans. These bonuses primarily come through proofs of stremf which allow you to increase your ability scores, but you also gain the ability to auto-identify potions and scrolls, and gain some (random) bonus skills on new characters.Character CustomizationThere are no set classes in Dungeonmans. Instead you have a variety of different trees that you can pick and choose from to build your own character that plays how you want it to. Each tree encourages vastly different playstyles than others and mixing and matching abilities from all of these trees allows you to build some truly interesting characters. There are also a number of hidden trees that you unlock by learning certain groups of skills.The level cap of 16 gives you a fair number of choices to work with (each class tree possesses 9 skills) and, if you choose to play a Dungeonmans instead of one of the preset skill allocations, you get five bonus points to spend on abilities which brings the total up to 21.  Not only do you have many different options to choose from but, for the most part, they're very well balanced. I can't think of any specific ability that I would call useless and since skills don't have ranks, you never have to worry about whether spending a skill point to get a +X% bonus is actually worth it.Oh, and you can find books that grant you skills that you might not otherwise have. They are fairly rare, though.The WorldOnce you've chosen the type of academy you wish to create (see Constant Progression below) the overworld is procedurally generated and, once generated, it remains static between characters. On the overworld is your academy, a number of towns, and many dungeons to explore.Towns serve as hubs to sell your loot and purchase consumables or possibly equipment upgrades. You can also upgrade towns with items that you find in certain types of overworld encounters. Doing so increases the quality of goods that they have for sale. These town improvements carry over between characters and if you max out a town's ""prosperity"" they build a statue of the character that helped them out so selflessly.There are a handful of different types of dungeons in Dungeonmans. You have your typical dungeons, as well as towers, temples, graveyards, and possibly a few types beyond that which I haven't encountered yet. Towers, temples, and graveyards are all unique in that they have their own way of going about the dungeon crawl. In towers you're going up a spiral layout to face off against a powerful tower guardian in a one-on-one bout. Temples see you puzzling out how to open their gate (hint: it involves violence) before working down into their depths to defeat the temple master in a grueling trap-filled arena. Finally, graveyards see you fighting through hordes of undead to plunder a tomb filled with horrible undead monstrosities that are all to happy to add you to their numbers.There is also a semi-secret post-game dungeon that lets you play indefinitely should you so desire.CombatCombat in Dungeonmans is much faster paced than in most roguelikes and this can certainly be offsetting to those expecting a game where you have to constantly plan out what you're doing every turn. There's actually an entire skill tree based around playing recklessly that rewards you for not taking time to think between mowing through your enemies. To emphasize this, the majority of enemies that you face will fall easily to even your basic attacks. You will quickly learn that not paying attention, however, often ends up with your dungeonman getting a rather permanent case of death. Champion enemies will pose a threat to those who play recklessly and their telltale glow should always see you stopping to take a minute to assess the threat they pose.In addition to champions there are also the various bosses you'll face at the end of dungeons. As far as I'm aware, dungeon bosses are simply more dangerous versions of the champions you'd otherwise be facing. This does not exctend to the bosses of towers and temples. Tower and temple bosses are bad news and will wipe the floor with you if you go in expecting to simply smack them in the faces until they die.Generally speaking, so long as you're in an area of appropriate difficulty, you don't have to worry about being surprise one-shot. There are a few situations when it can happen, though, notably when opening secret doors (let's just say that some secret doors were made to keep things in). Even situations where you face overwhelming enemy forces can be escaped from so long as you hold onto resources that let you quickly escape from combat situations. Do your best to always have at least a scroll or two of combat blinking on hand at all times!Loot!Dungeonmans takes an almost action-RPG route with how it doles out loot. Each item type is present in several tiers, with each tier being more powerful than the last. On top of that, items can be randomly rolled with affixes that add various modifiers to them. Like in an action-RPG you have your common items that don't have any magical properties, you have magical items that have a few properties, you have rare items that have many properties, and then you have artifacts that have a few unique properties that can't be found anywhere else.In addition to finding loads of magical items, you can also make your own (or further buff the ones you have)! In your travels you will find magical scrolls that enable you to layer additional special properties onto equipment that you find. There are limits to how much magic an item can hold, but by the time you reach them you'll have some incredibly potent gear.If you're looking for a very particular modifier on an item, you can mill down items at your academy and use the resulting resources to craft magical hammers that allow you to apply specific affixes to equipment.No Auto-ExploreThis is something that I consider a non-issue and is really only here because it's something I've seen the roguelike community bash the game for. You actually have to press keys to explore dungeons in Dungeonmans, the game won't do it for you. If you want the game to do your dungeon diving for you, you're going to have a bad time with Dungeonmans.			"

												Dungeonmans is my favorite roguelike.  There, I said it.  First off, Jim's sense of humor is highly compatible with my own - and this game is not only a rock solid roguelike, it's also like a layered onion of absurdist humor revelry.   Do you like Dredmor because it's a good game and also funky hilarious?  Same deal here, but slightly different flavor and very different mechanics.  It's like ice cream - comes in different flavors but is awesome either way.I would have declared the game more than complete a long time ago, but Jim is clearly an obsessed maniac who can't stop dumping more content into it.  He'll probably be 90 years old one day, still making this game.			"

												The phrase ""If you enjoy Roguelikes you will like this"" is played out pretty bad, but it honestly fits here. Dmans is just a fun game about exploring dungeons, crushing monsters and looting all the loot. On top of that, you also get a good sense of humor and rad music and visuals. The Academy mechanic allows your next character to get a leg up if you so desire. Death comes swift in most RL games, and it's nice to have the choice to let your next character slingshot through the early game. But it's your choice if you want to take advantage of the boons, or start without taking them. Dmans plays fast and fluid, and a lot of dungeons can be played on the fly. Though, don't take that as this game being a brainless hack&slash for your cofee break. It's still a Roguelike where a wrong decision can doom you.The game is stil fresh and needs to grow a little more as of now, but I seriously enjoyed every minute I've played so far.			"

												SUMMARY: A humorous, sprawling, fun, .complex, and deep roguelike game with a persistent world , plenty of player customization, and great replayability/continuing play.  Dungeonmans is a must-buy for fans of RPGs, Roguelikes, and fantasy.  I've played this game through from Early Access  (ver 1.5.1 to be precise) to Full Release (ver 1.02), so I can comment both on the game and it's evolution.  The short form is ""it's great and a lot of fun and you should buy it,"" but to really appreciate Dungeonmans, you have to go into the details - because there's so much to it, and all the elements come together to make something truly special.Dungeonmans is a mix of Roguelike, mild setting building, character improvement, and humor that's quite enjoyable and good-natured, while taking some real planning and tactics.Start an academy, go forth as a Dungeonmans (the term is gender-neutral) of a given class.  Find loot, bring back artifacts, improve the academy, die horribly, come back as someone else, and venture on.  Much like Rogue Legacy and similar games as you adventure you find things that improve  things for future characters - in this case the academy, your starting character's equipment and knowledge.  Books improve the library, equipment improves the alchemy lab, knowledge improves the museum, leftover equipment lets the blacksmith make new things, and so on.  Sure your character may die, but their legacy lives on (and dies on as you burn through characters).  High-level characters that die can come back as teaching ghosts and characters can retire to teach or do other things.Character building presents you with plenty of choices.  You can start with a premade class or customize from the start with a general Dungeonmans class.  Pick the skills you want to learn and build, and develop your own playstyle.  My personal favorite is a kind of arcane archer, but maybe you'll favor a heavily armored necromancer, a dual-wileding trickster who creates duplicates, or a warrior armed with magical banners.  There's plenty of fun strategies you can come up with depending on playstyle.Improving the academy and towns, finding resources, and more enhances the chance of current and future Dungeonmans to live longer, venture further, and perhaps unlock the mystery of the game.  Strategic choices, management, and thoughts of the next student really weigh on your mind.  Take a special weapon knowing it may end up collecting dust with your corpse - or that it may let you survive.  Melt down enough gear to build upgrades or sell it for cash (and knowing a future Dungeonmans can buy it later)?   Options once chosen affect the game later.There's enchanting of items as well - though unless you spend the resources to do it specifically with Upgrade Hammers (that can break overpowered items), it's random.  Still, with a few scrolls and luck (or blowing a lot of resources recovered from old weapons) you can craft some enjoyably insane stuff.  Want a sword that freezes people in place and sets them on fire?  A suit of armor that resists, well, everything?  Go ahead and make it - or use a Solvent scroll to start over.  You can even find blueprints to make special items if you have the resources.Adventuring starts out as pretty straightforward adventure-battle-loot.  Over time it evolves as you face more and more powerful enemies, make decisions about using artifacts and crafting items, or figure which towns to upgrade.  The game never becomes too complicated, but it does ramp up in complexity over time.Finally, there's a lot of depth to the game.  Right when you think the dungeons look alike, you discover something else.  A random boss gives you a chance at improvement. or death  A new monster surprises you.  An item you find is enjoyably bizarre and useful.  Modified towns have new inventory.  Character's that have passed may leave surprising legacies.  Dungeonmans is packed with things to discover.Best of all, as of this writing, the developers are actively bugfixing and improving the game.  That's the kind of commitment to quality that not only makes it more fun and gives me more confidence, but speaks to the level of commitment to making a good game.  As of this writing I'm on my third playthrough, which should give you an idea of just how fun the game is and how much is in it.An enjoyable game with a sense of humor that delivers adventure, challenge, and surprises - all with a sense of sheer, good-natured fun. Well worth the purchase.Also worth playing through twice.  At least.			"

												Truly a wonderful rogue-like game.  The game has wonderful balance which eliminates being killed by some one off insta kill hit.  Not once did I ever feel as if I was too powerful to where the enemies were a joke or that I was being absolutely destroyed to where I wanted to quit.  The progression system with the academy works wonderfully and gives you just a slight boost in the beginning to get you on your feet when you start a new character.Again a wonderful game that I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of rogue-like games.

												The phrase ""If you enjoy Roguelikes you will like this"" is played out pretty bad, but it honestly fits here. Dmans is just a fun game about exploring dungeons, crushing monsters and looting all the loot. On top of that, you also get a good sense of humor and rad music and visuals. The Academy mechanic allows your next character to get a leg up if you so desire. Death comes swift in most RL games, and it's nice to have the choice to let your next character slingshot through the early game. But it's your choice if you want to take advantage of the boons, or start without taking them. Dmans plays fast and fluid, and a lot of dungeons can be played on the fly. Though, don't take that as this game being a brainless hack&slash for your cofee break. It's still a Roguelike where a wrong decision can doom you.The game is stil fresh and needs to grow a little more as of now, but I seriously enjoyed every minute I've played so far.			"

												The bullet-point feature list for this game says it's ""Tough but fair"". I kinda disagree. Most of the time it is, but sometimes it can be pretty unfair. Or at least feel that way.You fight your way to the end of a dungeon, there's been ups and downs, but you're doing alright. Then you open a door, and you're immediately decimated by a boss who pretty much one shots you. I'm not really seeing how that's fair, and I'd love to hear from the dev's on this. A good game punctuated by odd, frustrating difficulty spikes. The above scenario has happened to me a few times, and it's been enough to make me quit and not want to play anymore.And in a game where a character can die permanently, the balance needs to be spot on.

												Truly a wonderful rogue-like game.  The game has wonderful balance which eliminates being killed by some one off insta kill hit.  Not once did I ever feel as if I was too powerful to where the enemies were a joke or that I was being absolutely destroyed to where I wanted to quit.  The progression system with the academy works wonderfully and gives you just a slight boost in the beginning to get you on your feet when you start a new character.Again a wonderful game that I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of rogue-like games.

												15 hours in seriously enjoying the game, it is difficult and you will die ALOT but all the loot drops and diverse skills allowing you to create any character you want and play how you want will keep you comming back and creating many characters.Lots of content to explore, close calls.. nice combat effects and good humour and friendly fire!..found out the hard way when I accidently selected my own character and obliterated myself..at level 7 ..oh the pain.Few beginner Tips (learnt the hard way) -Make sure you stack up on healing / lesser champion potions at the towns.Take note of the difficulty of the area in the overworld your exploring (top of the map) trivial - mundane - dangerous, you dont want to be exploring the overworld and have a random dangerous battle appear that you cant avoid.Apply enchantments to your armour and weapons from scrolls you attain (that are not enchanted already).Dont forget to hand in all your legendary artifcats / books and battle skills to the headmaster and then spend you skill points.Use scrolls to escape dangerous situations or spikes to block doors to run away (especially from them white rabbits)Enemy champions are highlighted by a glowing red.Until your powerful enough dont take on hall of champions, monster party portals that will randomly appear, portal of hives however, is a great boost if you have the money.There are many more I could offer but just go purchase the game and find out for yourself, definitely recommend this especially when on sale!.

												This is the story of Bob Leather a horrible evil bandit who ambushed an innocent dungeonmans, just so he could finance his own dungeon. The  brother of Fjial, the inocent dungeonmans, went to aveng his brother's death. Fujail fought long and hard all the way down the the second level of Leather's dungeon, but sadly my friends, it pains me to say that the most horrible creature alive struck Fujail down. AN EVIL ALBINO RABIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CAN BOB EVER BE STOPED!!!?!?!?!!??!? or is he the academy's downfall?....BUT THERE WAS STILL HOPEOut of the ashes of his father, and his uncle's failures a lone Rangermans rises to fight the evil and elusive BOB OF THE DEAD!!!!!! He entered the ever expansive labryth of horrors that was home TO THE HORRIBLE BOB LEATHER!!!!!!!!! But did he fail at the first level? NAY!!!!Did he get struck down at the second level of the tumultous dungeon? NAY!!!!BUT HE MAID IT!!! Crashing through the doors of the 3rd level like a freight train of justice the lone rangermans spit death and arrows on all who so dared to stand in his way.And then there was BOB.BOB was quick and fast, but he was NO MATCH for the speed of the lone rangermans. Out of the haze of confusion, chaos, sound, and arrows a figure appeard.  Perched glouriously over the arrow riddled corpse of the evil Bob stood the lone rangermans.SON OF FJIAL!!!!HEIR TO THE LAND OF FJIAL'S MIGHTY FART!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I DUB THEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..............BOBSLAYIER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												If you want to play a real rogue-like hack and slash RPG for the first time, this is the game for you.A very good character progression system is implemented. Even though there is perma-death, there are persistent world characteristics in this game. For example, your academy (or base) upgrades will stay in place. There are stat boosts (earned through killing bosses) which are available to help your new character start off.The game's interface is good. Unlike most rogue-likes, there are not many keys to remember (none of those ctrl+, alt+, shift+ hotkeys that are usually found in other roguelikes). However this game is still deep, with lots of items, consumables, trophies etc.It's also a very challenging game. Prepare to be caught off-guard and die many times from your own complacency.			"

												Very fun little game if you like old-school turn-based RPGs.  Simple game mechanics match with intriguing enemies and items.  While it can be frustrating to level up your character only to die by some unknown monster, this is part of the fun.  One tip for newbies:  If you travel back to the Headmaster at the Academy (where you start the game) he will identify unknown items for you... for FREE!  (Saves using Identify scrolls).  Overall I would recommend Dungeonmans if you are looking for a game that's easy to play but challenging to master.  The soundtrack is also excellent and worth buying if you like the ""orchestral RPG"" genre of music.			"

												I have a love hate relationship with this game.  ask you can see im nearing 300 hours of playtime and have still yet to beat the darn thing. First things yes this is a rogue liek so if you like punishment and a challenge youll get your bucks out of this easy. The worlds are randomly generated along with the dungeons. Which can make for some seriously deadly surprises if your not prepared for them. Monsters can pull you into a room filled with other monsters and gang bang you in a few rounds if your not packing the proper skills or scrolls. at any time you can redo your world if you get bored with it creating an entirely new space to explore. I personally love this. There are several specializations necromanser and the archery tree IMO are a must along with the ""real armor"" skill as the first ability negates bleed, and poison damage when used. The game has a good balance of pwers sword and board, polearms, bows, dual wield and 2 handed each with distinct fighting style  all with a tongue in cheek tilt. The game pokes fun at all the tropes of ""dungeon games"" monsters range from your mundane ""Skrobold"" play on kolbold to the more serious bad♥♥♥♥♥super elite named monsters that will one to two shot you even when fully prepared and buffed *they still ahve silly names though xD*   there are still a bunch of hidden things im sure i have yet to experience.  For those lookign for a quick game during work or to waste 30 min or HOURS this game fills that niche perfectly you can stop anytime save and exit and come back to exactly wher eyou left off  a godsend for those of us with abrupt or hectic schedules. The downside is until you get used to how the game plays and its still many bugs that will kill you in combat. You will die...many many many times. after about your 10th character you will have a good idea of what works and what doesnt work. I think im on my 100th character and even after all those deaths im still not even close to get to the end content *mainly because im a dumb♥♥♥♥♥ but also because bugs keep killing my character either through sheer brilliance or inability my characters always tend to die becuase of a glitch. which can be INFURIATING especially when youve worked ahrd and fianlly get a character a suffient level 8+ and soemthing happens and BLAM dead.Character death is BRUTAL. you loose all gear, all equipment and all items GONE. when you create a new character you must level them up and attempt to retrieve w/e kille dyour previous character. btw the thing that kille dyour character takes over the dungeons as a boss and gets a serious boost so if you end up opening a secret door to a boss that one shots you might as well write off that dungeon because your not getting that♥♥♥♥♥♥back. if your previous character was of sufficient level you will get ONE ITEM randomly choosen typically a weapon some XP and all the quest items they had. which isnt to bad but when you spend rescources on a character and end up compeltley loosing those rescources without a way to retrieve all that great gear it puts a sever damper on your mood especially when the GAME kille dyour character and not your inability theres a difference when the GAME kills a character and when you screw up and take a bite bigger than you can chew or get yoruself into an unwinnable situation.still even with those gripes i cant put this down i keep coming back to it like some stockholm syndrome patient. I sound liek some beaten wife  ""it's not bad ALL THE TIME"" Im kidding though Dungeonmans in my most humble of opinion is a great little roguelike title with some good gameplay and challenging scenarios with heavy ephasis on tactics and rescource managment always weighing wether youshould upgrade a certian piece of gear or take on that ""Adventurous"" level dungeon rather than the mundane one.The creator is constantly updating the game and has made an easy way of sending in feedback via an ingame menu. and actaulyl takes that feed back and FIXES the bugs. not to toot my own horn but i've persoanlly pointed out about 20 or so bugs or more and they were fixed within the month!All in all Dungeonsmans is worth the money the sheer amount of glee you get after killing a boss that has killed off countless nubmers of your heroes with a special scroll or skill and outwitting the game while rare is worht the ego boost and worth every penny.

												I like this game.  Combat is fun.  Dungeon crawling is good, with a nice variety of different dungeon types.  Proceedural generation of dungeons works pretty well and there is a decent selection of monsters (though I would like to see more).I'm giving this a reluctant thumbs up though.  For me, the ""unique selling proposition"" of this game was the proceedurally generated overworld.  This is what Dungeonmans offered that other rogue likes do not.  Unfortunately, there really is nothing to the overworld.Yes it generates various terrain, roads, towns, and dungeons--but none of this really matters.  Since there are no food or supply requirements, you don't have to worry about distance or travel times.  It makes no difference whether you are traveling through a forest, field, or road--it has no impact on the game.  Well, on very rare occassions you will have a random encounter in the overworld--and where you are will determine the terrain of the battle field, but these encounters are very rare, and you almost always have a choice to avoid the encounter anyway.It doesn't matter how far away you are from the Dungeonmans Academy--if you need to go back, there is nothing stopping you--no time considerations, no supply worries, no real threat from the inhabitants--BUT, there is one obstacle, and that is the tedium of walking your icon all the way across the map to turn in some artifacts and id magic items.Basically what the overhead map amounts to is a very cumbersome and clunky menu where you select which dungeon or town you want to enter.  Unfortunately, instead of just selecting the dungeon with mouse and cursor, your cursor is your Dungeonman and you have to walk it slowly across the menu that looks like a map to select the dungeon you want to enter. In short, there is almost zero gameplay to the overhead map element of Dungeonmans--its just a very thematic but cumbersome menu.Ive read a number of reviews for this game that say Dungeonmans is fun, but why play it when TOME already exists.  For me the answer would be a proceedurally generated overworld, but Dungeonmans failed on this aspect.Despite all that, I have had a lot of fun with the game, so i do recommend it.  Maybe grab it on sale.			"

												For an in-depth review of the game, I'm going to suggest that you read Docjekyll's review. He's an old friend of mine who really got me into this game, and I could easily parrot everything he said as major selling points. Instead, I'll give you my recommendation to buy this game along with a few others and to play them in a certain order. I believe that this will give you a greater appreciation for the genre and for the gem that this game truly is. Just make sure that you don't get rogue-burn from a glut of rogue-likes and rogue-likes to the point that you can't appreciate Dungeonmans. So here is the order that I recommend playing up to this wonderful game:1) Rogue Legacy 2) FTL3) Dungeons of Dredmor4) DUNGEONMANS!I recommend buying and playing them all, but Rogue Legacy and FTL will get you used to the idea of permadeath while still letting you grind through things, and Dredmor will get you to a point where you learn to think carefully about your actions (and will punish you for irresponsible crafting, which you need to avoid in Dungeonmans). I've played an immense amount of this game and have successfully completed an Ironmans run of my own (a no-death run of the game). If you're feeling hungry for more rogue-likes and rogue-likes after playing this game, then here are some more that I would recommend:-Nethack (not on Steam, but free; this is the poster child for a true Rogue-like game, apart from Rogue itself)-Crypt of the NecroDancer-SanctuaryRPG: Black Edition-Dungeon of the Endless (same universe as Endless Space and Endless Legend)-Sword of the Stars: The Pit-One Way Heroics-Fatal Labyrinth (originally on Sega Genesis and not ""truly"" a rogue-like)			"

												Simple controls, great character customization, addictive strategic gameplay. Wonderful satirical humor, poking fun at fantasy genre conventions and RPG tropes with clever enemy names and ridiculous dialogue. The sight and sound of loot exploding out of monsters never ceases to be satisfying. This game is simultaneously a critique and a love letter to hack-n-slash procedurally generated games.As of this writing, there's still some polish that needs to be added, but that's minor. This game exudes charisma and bleeds fun. Get ready to lose many hours (and characters) on your quest to crush monsters and become the ultimate Dungeonmans!			"

												Just finished my first game. For an Early Access /ALPHA/ quality game... this is great. It's a classic roguelike, with a really humorous and snarky style that fits me perfectly. Very glad I bought it, and looking forward to many more dev streams from the creator. Can't wait for the next update, which will hopefully add the awesome Dragoon abilities I saw him coding...Follow-up:I've now got MANY hours under my belt in this game, and I still love it. It's continued to improve as updates have been made, and even the early stages of the game that I've played dozens of times are still interesting. Maybe someday I'll be good enough to make it past level 10. I'm a scrub.Follow-up 2:I have one achievement left to get. The developer is still updating the game. It just KEEPS. GETTING. BETTER. 150+ hours into the game, and I'm STILL excited to play it. :)Follow-up 3:Nearly 200 hours on record as of this review. Still enjoy playing it every weekend. 200-ish episodes recorded for my YouTube channel. Continuing updates to the game have improved it immensely since I started playing over two years ago. If you're looking for a challenging but humorous rogue-like, this is your game. It's definitely stood the test of time for me, and that's why I nominated it for that award.			"

								I am absolutely loving this game at the moment. As others have mentioned, it's very much a modern take on a classic roguelike game with all the key elements: permadeath, classes, turn based, etc. All of the things that are in traditional roguelikes are in here.But what really seperates this game apart is the academy you build up over time. When you find relics and historical artificacts, you can turn them into the academy and it will get bigger and better and thus make your new adventurers better as well. Your first few people may die in the earlier dungeons, but as you get better and your character benefits more from the academy upgrades, you'll be able to make it farther and farther into the game. The class system is very basic at the moment, but still feels fun to me. Fighters run up and smash things, rangers use bows and shoot them, wizards blow things up with magic. Solid for the moment, but I hope the dev does more later on to expand on them (it's early access, so it's understandable to be basic still). The dungeons and the art style are solid and the game overall looks great. However, there are areas of missing textures (dungeon libraries for me) and various bugs that are present (treasure spawning in areas you can't get to), but this is to be expected of an early access game. Given time, I'm sure this could become a great roguelike as it already has some solid foundations to be one. I'm expecting great things from this, and i'm very glad i backed it on kickstarter.			"

												I think this might have been the first game that I kickstart'ed.Either way - it's a fantastic roguelike, made with love, and full of content.  You can go wrong adding this one to your library and I look forward to what the developer works on next.			"

								This game is at times daddy on you with the belt and at other times is rewarding beyond measure. Lots of dungeons to explore and blood to splatter to the southeast! Lots of weaponsPlenty of variety of classRandom insanely hard situations out of nowhereThis game has potential for greatness, just a few things here and thereDeleted my saved game that i was sooo far in... it really upset me, but i will still have to recommend it!

												This game is absolutely amazing.  I'm glad that a friend bought it for me, I was thinking I was going to have to wait until January to play it.   It feels like you're playing Dungeons and Dragons solo to an extent and moving your piece around.   There's no over-arching story or anything, but the characters and interactions in game are absolutely hilarious.   I definitely recommend it!			"

												As someone who's played a lot of RPGs, this was a nice change of pace from the sometimes grim reality of dying in other games.  I find the game fun and the graphics cute without being overly so.I died once so far and even that was funny.  The game is easy in, easy out and entertaining with many classes to try out.  I fully expect to be playing a lot of this game.My only complaint is I'd wish mana regen was faster, I have to run back and forth to regen it while hoping no new mobs spawn.   Lucklily the staff never runs out of bolts, they just don't have a lot of impact compared to spells. "

												Dungeonmans is a great fantasy RPG (or rogue-like if you prefer) featuring a single character that you can mold freely along different skill trees to suit your play style. While fairly tongue-in-cheek, the game is constantly challenging you to adapt to new monsters and situations. I rarely felt that monsters got cheap shots in on me - careless mistakes were always my own fault.Also the game features an evolving Academy, similar to that of Rogue Legacy, where each successive character that dies leaves something in the wake for the successors to benefit from, whether it is knowledge, equipment or skills. This helps cut down the whole starting from scratch and slogging through early areas repeatedly, as you become slightly more powerful each time. This keeps the game surprisingly fast moving for an RPG - I didn't ever feel that I was grinding a dungeon out in order to progress.It's somewhat similar to Tales of Maj'Eyal and just as enjoyable.

Хватает как классических элементов типа пермасмерти, рандомных уровней, тактических боев, тонн разнообразного лута, YASD и т.д., так и современных нововведений вроде прокачки базы и стартовых параметров героя (что-то вроде Rogue Legacy; в данном случае со временем позволяет избегать наскучивших стартовых данжей). Боевка очень динамичная, во многом за счет уникальных скиллов, которые не просто добавляют плюсики к резисту, а позволяют дэшиться, отпрыгивать от врагов и вообще творить всякие интересные вещи.Короче, пока все весьма хорошо.

Simplistic controls and interface in comparison to alot of its kind, while still being very difficult. It takes itself very not seriously, while still being a serious game with alot of depth. It makes a very good gateway into the more eyerolling hardcore rogue style games (♥♥♥♥ the term roguelike). Doesn't require much of a time investment, and if a dude dies, its always a fun adventure trying to loot his crap so your current guy gets stronger, or to avenge his death or whatever.

								A solid game for lovers of the genre, but very -very- far from a finished product indeed.Almost everything needs finishing. Graphics, balancing, classes, content-- well, you get the idea.If you like this kind of genre, however, you'll find more than enough content and things to keep you busy. Classes and abilities are pretty interesting, and there's lots to explore and do, and an Academy to upgrade. Permanent Death is a factor, but working for future generations of heroes keeps a steady progress to the game.If you don't mind playing a game in it's earliest alpha stages, because you love the genre, get it. If you're looking for a solid RPG/Roguelike, wait for the game to fully develop.			"

												This game has so much potential and yet... ugh. It starts out with character creation. If you don't like your stat options you can discard your character but never use that name again. Really? Thats just silly. The combat itself starts out easy, you should be able to roll through the dungeon a-ok. After that though, this game falls into the trap that so many do. The difficulty scales very sharply and if you don't nail your build you die. Another failing of this game, like so many like it, all it takes is one lucky crit from an enemy and everything goes down hill. This game was fun for a few hours but no more.

												I have played this game for almost 55 hours and, how can i answer to a question Do you recommend this game with NO?Well there’s only ONE major reason, which made me answer this way.Long story: I used one save for more then 40+ hours, I was playing game enjoying it. When suddenly I got an error the game stopped (closed) and popped a window the so called crash report which says if you have any bugs explain them leave email and we will contact you or something very similar to that. At first I didn’t care too much. What’s the worst your level 13 + is dead? Although he was not in any danger. Yeah that would be bad but not bad as this. I tried to load my save (city ) it says load my lvl 13 dungeonman (The 1st floor of the Villains of grimsly trail) around x5 times+ I got crash! The same window appeared with crash report and there’s nothing you can do about it. I tried searching internet to try and find a fix it, I even posted in dungeonman steam bug discussion this problem, and you can find it at page 55 if someone is interested. But no luck I did not get an answer on how to fix this game (save). Don’t get me wrong I did send my problem in the crash report with email 4 or more times. Once every week, but developer did not contact me.I can start a new city but what is the point? To play and farm some good gear and maybe again get this problem. That’s not fun, If any game (fighting, RPG, rouge like, driving, simulator etc. had this problem I would not recommend it!) This game has smaller much smaller bugs (problems), but many people continue playing this game because they didn’t experience this problem. Or maybe they didn’t get Salty as me.If I didn’t experience this bug (problem ignoring from developer or his team I would have posted amazingly good review and would recommend to play this game. I mean what’s the point of the crash report, forum etc if you will not try and help people to solve something like this. More than 4 months passed did I get an answer on how to fix this bug? NO.If you wisit their official website when was the last bug fix, update for a game? 25.09.2015			"

												After over 8 hours of play, I can safely say that Dungeonmans has joined Binding of Isaac, Dredmor and The Pit as one of my top roguelikes on Steam.  Gorgeous graphics, gorgeous music, challenging, rewarding gameplay, and great comedy everywhere.  You will die a LOT, but like all great roguelikes, each death makes you stronger, and you feel pushed to better yourself and do better next time.  And when you finally, FINALLY beat that one dungeon/boss that's been killing you over and over, there is nothing more satisfying.Any roguelike fan owes it to themselves to check out Dungeonmans!			"

								Dungeonmans is just the very basics of what is needed for a rogue-like game to work. If you are looking for flashy visuals and special effects, a game that looks like a movie and plays like one, too, or one with a definite ending, this is not for you. But as far as rogue-like games go, this game is the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Definitely get it!			"

												This game is awesome! I play all sorts of rogue and rogue lite games, and I mus stay that this one is very good. It is extremely hard and has a bit of a learning curve. After about my 12th attempt I started to get the hang of it. Being a rogue lite, it has permanent death, but you can pass off some things off to different character like legendary weapons and stat boosts. I have no idea if the game is possible to beat on a first attempt, but I certainly don't think I could. Games it reminds me of: Tales of Maj'eyal, Nethack, Sword of the Stars the Pit (but much better IMO).			"

												Honsetly games don't get much better these days. They do get better but not by much. These are dark days.My best run is by a hero named Farts. She will be remembered forever in the Hero academy Memorial of pooptown. Easy to play hard to win, made me cry. Start over on death, but there is a base to develop so I have that. Too many consumables to name. Huge inventory, exactly what I wanted out of a game. More content will be sweet 11/10+easy to play+balanced+no set path+go as fast as you want to or can-no coop			"

												As a big fan of roguelikes/dungeon crawl games, Dungeonmans is a solid addition to my collection.  For a bit of background, I have played quite a bit of the genre from the original Rogue and own Tales of Maj'Eyal, Dungeons of Dredmore, etc.  I bought this for full retail price, and at the time of this review have 14 hours completed over 4 characters.  So why was this worth my $14.99?Streamlined Gameplay:  Dungeonmans provides a streamlined experience with lower barriers to entry than most other games in the genre.   With about 75 skills spread over 8 or so categories you can mix and match your build to your tastes.  While fewer than Dredmore and ToME, I was easily able to understand each category quickly while providing enough flexibility to create interesting decisions during my character progression.   Another great feature is the ability to autocomplete dungeons (with a nice jackpot of loot) that would be of trivial difficulty to your character.  This cuts down the grinding a great deal.Permadeath and the University:  Yes this game features permanent character death, but unlike most games in the genre Dungeonmans has your core base of operations: the University.  The University contains lots of fun *persistent* features that allows your next run to be that much easier.  These include autoidentification, bonuses to your starting equipment, additional mob information, and free stat boosts.  This greatly cuts down on the intimidation factor since you know each successive run you'll be just that much stronger and wiser.Sense of Humor:  This is hard to describe without experiencing it yourself, but this game has a cheeky sense of humor that I appreciate.  The main tips area in your University is literally a Wall of Text.  Accessible Developers:  If you couldn't tell by the discussion responses, the developers care about their product enough to invest their time to address issues, concerns, and even thank those that are enjoying their experience.  I have seen one even visiting Twitch streams providing advice and support.   I would take a dozen developers like this over a Triple A company that puts out a broken and unsupported product.Value:  With so many games left unplayed, I started to valuate my future purchase differently.  How much per entertainment hour would I get?  Honestly I can't answer that question for you.  What I can say is that I am at nearly $1 per entertainment hour and the value is only getting better with every playthrough.			"

												This is some seriously polished classic dungeon adventuring. For the most part it's traditional rogue-like fare, the few places where twists have been added work really well and only serve to improve the experience. There does not seem to be any of the more hardcore elements of some rogues (like hunger, involved sound/smell, etc) but the game still provides a rich, deep game play that is fairly quick and fun to jump into but involved enough to capture you for a LONG time as you experiment with different types of characters and strategies in an attempt to just not die.The end result is a well balanced game that people new to this type of genre may find a little more ""easy access"" than some other offerings with various input options (that ""just work"" when you use them) to control your character and an easy to read/understand interface but enough complexity (and traditional rogue controls if you already know them!) and depth to keep those of us more experienced hooked for.. a long time. Just look at the play times listed for the other reviews. Great $/hr value!Finally then: expect a world map you traverse to get between dungeons and towns, expect several varieties of dungeon (warrens, dungeons, crypts, temples, towers, etc) each with their own little twists, a ""spend points where you want"" skill tree, potions and scrolls to identify, loot galore and equipment (potentially cursed or magical or plain), champion monsters and dungeon bosses. The rest go discover yourself :)ps: art is lush and music is awesome.			"

												I think the best way to open this review is with an empirical statement: Dungeonmans is brilliant!Now, I suppose to make this review a little more useful I should offer you some of the facts that prove my opening statement is unquestionably accurate. So, I'll do that:First off, Dungeonmans is very true to the Rogue-like ideal. It has everything you would expect: Permadeath, turn-based gameplay, loads of unique creatures inhabiting a procedurally generated world, loads of nasty surprises that will make you think “Man... I shouldn't have gone through that portal”, and, of course, tons of unidentified and potentially deadly loot.The classic formula is there: Go kill the bad guys, take their loot, get more powerful, go kill more powerful bad guys, take their loot. On top of that there are a number of ways to pass your progress on to your next character (and you need that because you're going to die a lot). Much of your forward progress comes in the form of upgrading the Dungeonmans Academy. You can find a number of artifacts to improve the academy making things easier for new recruits. In addition you can get relics which only “unlock” once the character that discovered them has died. So new characters can enjoy a number of benefits from those that have passed on before.Of course, your current Dungeonman can also find artifacts that help them. Proofs of Stremf can be used to increase stats immediately, saved to give to future recruits, or both. Equipment can be enhanced using the smithy at the academy or by using magic scrolls you'll find in dungeons or shops. You can make some truly epic level gear. (And that's a good thing, because you're going to need it.)The artwork is a beautiful example of old school 2D and it perfectly fits the theme of the game. On top of that Dungeonmans is loaded with humor that has quite literally made me laugh out loud time and time again.All things considered the game is hours and hours of fun. I would love to tell you what the end game is like, but I haven't gotten anywhere near it yet. However, I am very confident that the game continues in the same vein. If I ever manage to hack my way to the Dread Purpleonians I'm sure there will be an interesting (and humorous) grand conflict.So, the long and short of it is this: Dungeonmans is certainly worth the price of admission!

												I really like Dungeonmans, and I do recommend it.  However, I find myself always choosing other roguelikes over Dungeonmans due to a totally unfair factor: more content.Dungeonmans feels like it has very few abilities and character options, which makes sense since it just came out.  But if I find myself wanting to play a vampire assassin, or a troll monk, or a spriggan priest, then I turn to Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.I really like the persistent academy that Dungeonmans has, and I look forward to more character options.  As for now, though, I find DCSS more addicting.			"

												TLDR It’s a great game, worth the full price it’s asking.I’m really surprised how much time I’ve been investing on this. I love the sound design and how much it adds weight to otherwise lifeless sprite animations. Music is awesome; it really reminds me of old JRPG’s.  The skill tree is numerous and diverse enough for a hefty amount of reply value. My only grip right now is sprites, I want more sprites… I wouldn’t mind a DLC for sprites  "

												This game has a great sense of humor, and I love it. Coming from a Dungeons and Dragons background, I find many of the jokes made in this game to be hilarious. I also love the art style for the rogue-like, it is vast and has many different pictures for gear that help set it apart.From the asthetics, let's get into the actual gameplay. It is a lot of fun! I am going to sink many hours into this game. It is one that I played all night last night (passed the time I should have) and one that I played this morning as well. I can see myself continuing to play this until it is mastered. Which brings me to my next point. The game seems relatively short. In the time that I have played, I have almost made it to the last dungeon. That being said, for the price point I think it is defitinely worth your while.I created a Let's Play series for this game that shows you a little bit of it if you want to check it out. Thank you so much!

Each time it becomes more personal as you advenge your legacy. I'm only an hour in and I love this game. But if you don't want to play a game were your going to die. Then put this one down now. But if you don't want to play a game where your going to die. Please go play angry birds.			"

												One of the more interesting rogue-likes I've played. It offers a different feel from some of my other favorites (Tales of Maj Eyal, Dungeon Crawl, etc.) that I come back to it fairly often.If you like the genre, you should give it a try as it's one of the better ones on steam. It has a good use of powers and each one feels impactful. The biggest con is the early game, which can feel very slow especially after you've upgraded your academy. This is a rather common issue with most rogue-likes however. "

												I bought this game thinking ""this looks like a fun time sink"".Oh man was that an understatement.  After many hours of killing and frustration.  I find that I cannot stop playing.  While you will die often each character you make adds a little bit to your academy and makes each subsequent dungeonmans last a bit longer.  So far I've gotten a lvl 12 dungeonmans and it was a long hard process.  You need to pay attention to your health,  mana,  potions and scrolls or you will die quicker. It is good mindless (but very much not mindless) fun with a good,  dark sense of humor.  ""Well you know what they say,  14th times a charm"". You'll see. Buy it			"

												Great procedural roguelike, or roguelite if you prefer the term. Strikes a good balance of learning curve and complexity with ease of play to be easy to get into without feeling overwhelming but complex enough to have alot of replayability. Should come with an addiction warning imo, I haven't been able to stop playing it. Definitely worth grabbing on sale if your a fan of this style of game and one of a very few games I've played where I would have happily paid full price for it.			"

												It looks great, but the gameplay's not great.The art assets (graphics, sound) are great and most of the lines are pretty enjoyable and cheeky. The core roguelike gameplay is there, but the unique part of it sucks; progression shouldn't be measured by how OP your academy is but by how far you go based on your accumulated general knowledge like pretty much every other game in the ""true roguelike"" family. Mix this with the fact that if you follow the ONE guide that's been published for Dungeonmans on its community hub, you'll pretty much be set for the entire game. When I die in $TraditionalRoguelike (ADOM, Tales of Maj'Eyal, Dungeons of Dredmor, etc), I learn how far I can push in any given direction with the build I'm running. When I die in Dungeonmans, it's a totally whatever moment if I'm skilling in the direction I want so the NEXT character can go until they drop.Overall the game just rubs me the wrong way; it doesn't fit the ""true roguelike"" label because of how the academy works, it's pretty rigid build-wise, it's a boss-slaying simulator without an end goal (even one as simple as ""defeat the lich overlord), and there's no hook that makes me want to keep playing.

Early Access Review
								First of all, let me start by saying that if you want a polished sparkling perfect game, you should probably wait until this game is out of early access. If you can put up with a game that is unpolished but still quite enjoyable, and you feel tike this genere of game is one that you like to play, I would recommend it, as it is quite playable in its current state.I am generally a fan of the ""rogue-like"" genere, and I heard an interview with this games developer, Jim Shepard, on the podcast Roguelike Radio and became interested in the game. After researching it a bit, I put in $40 for the game, as Iliked both what I saw of the game, and the enthusiam i perceived from its developer.I decided to wait til it was out on Steam to try it more than a few minutes, and from what I have seen so far, I am not disappointed. I only have about 10 hours into the game, but I suspect it will end up being one of those 100+ hour timesinks which I love so much. I can't wait to see how the game progresses in the future as it is polished into the beautiful gem I suspect it will become.			"

								First: I've been playing the alpha, hence I have no hours logged on Steam, yet!Dungeonmans is excellent. The combat is fun - even playing as a plain-old fightermans, you're still juggling skills and special items. While playing, you can upgrade your Academy, nearby towns, and even earn stat boosts for future characters, so that even when you die you can still make progress. It's light-hearted without dumbing down at all.At the moment, it's a little rough around some edges, but I know it'll get polished up in no time. :)			"

												just finished the game with a archer/necromancer on lv 15 so i figured i write a review  on my experience.firstly u will die but dont fret its all a learning expeireince also dying is good because all the bonus stats u collected from slaying ubers will transfer onto yr pupil plus other boneses depending on far u got not to mention the guild will also advance as u progess and will remian the same for when yr demise will come.i had off my head i think 6 serious heroes die untill my hero VEGETA came out glorious overall i had a great time playing this game i lauged from the humor and i cried/got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when my hero died but with death being rewarding it helps u to pick up that sword/bow/staff up agian and slay those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who killed u and take revenge on yr fallen comrades.TIPS for new players stick to the main classes before u take up a dungeomans in the class selection once when u have become expeienced and when yr hero dies yes he will die u will then know how to make a hybrid build .depending on yr build always pour some of yr stats into science finding hidden rooms is cool and all but its mostly best for the elementle resistance rating u get.i found light armour to be frustrating because u had to keep yr shield  up at all times to prevent from dying so i recommend using medium armour or heavy armour over light armour even if yr playing a mage.dont be afraid to use yr potions and scrolls they will save yr life even to use some before a boss fight is a good stradigy to save those turns in pumping out damage instead of using up yr turns drinking the potions and reading the scrolls.thanks for reading hope it helps and enjoy yr dungeon hunting young dungeonman			"

I usely hate rouguelikes but the persistant elements of growing your academy and collecting/storging items and experience from your past dead dungeonmans is very awarding. Delightful bits of humor thrown in there as well.There are most definitely some rough edges in the buggy UI, unbalanced dungeons, and incomplete academy but nothing game breaking which is a pass for me. I think once these problems get solves this will be a very solid game. The beauty is that things like balancing issues and a need for additional creative content are only going to be discovered by players and their feedback, so buy this and get dungeoning!			"

								Excellent game, even in Early Access. Game play element blend together perfectly. Leveling up your academy, local ltowns, even as your characters die keeps you wanting more. Reminds me alot of Rogue Legecy's system.. End game isnt completely finished, but is still very challenging, and you'll probably not finish it by the time they update it further as the difficuly ramps up nicely.Writing is hilarious, and even some jokes at their own expense make the missing elements forgivable; and make you look forward to them; rather than frustrated at the wait.Combat, leveling, and monster difficuly are pretty much spot on and finished. Much better than games fully completed!Issues:1. Needs lots of work on towns upgrade system. It is interesting, but is very simple and straight forward. If they expanded out the towns (as well as a significant amount to the academy) this could be a real gem, and potentially one of my favorite games.2. Lots of flavor-text missing on stats/items/abilities. You quickly figure out the important stuff, but a large portion of info is missing. They clearly went with quality rather than quantity as the finished writing is very clear and often funny.Overall: Worth the price now, and if updates continue, then this could be a amazing game			"

												This is a fresh restart on roguelike, and I like it a lot.I've just played several fightermens and a rangermans, but it's already clear to me that it will take a very long time before I switch to other classes, I'm already having tons of fun.It's straightforward, there are some kinks to read about and to get used to, but they're minor and after a short while give the game a special feeling.What I don't like so much are the flat skill trees. Instead of a deep skill tree per class, you have a 6 or 9 skill tree (3 skills per line, 2 or 3 lines). As far as I can tell the idea behind this is that at some point you mix and match with skills of the other classes, which are weaker when played by a foreign class. I can't confirm this yet, but if it's the case then there's a lot of variety and combinations to try out.I whish there were more avatars and gear would actually show on them.			"

								This is indeed an outstanding roguelike - all the classic elements are here, revitalized with new ideas (very interesting take on meta-progression), tons of humor and tight gameplay centered on challenging tactical combat. The game is in early access as i write this, but is already very playable. 100% must buy for any roguelike fan, thats just it.			"

												Despite the game being the kind of game i usually love, its awfully hard to get over the lack of basic pathing when it comes to controlling your hero with the mouse(i.e. if you click to walk somewhere and any obstacle is blocking the most direct path, your hero just walks up to the obstacle and stands there like an idiot... you must manually control the hero to walk around any obstacles between you and where you are going)Its so basic its crazy its missing, almost like ive gone to see a movie i thought looked sweet but then when i got there i found out it was a stage play and the star was a doofus wearing a blindfold who had to be yelled instructions from the audience to forward the plot - the content becomes irrelevant because the experience is tedious.If you'd prefer to control your hero with the keyboard every single tile of the way then great!But I think from what ive seen and at its current price...  i would not recommend this game to friends until there was at least a patch to add pathing to hero move orders given with the mouse... sidestepping props every step of the way really takes me out of the game.

								Fantastic game overall. Humor is really well done, as is the interface and artwork. This game has SO MUCH potential to become what ToME is/was for many loyal fans. At $10 bucks (at time of this review), this is well-worth the price. I have already almost put in 20 hours worth and have not exhausted everything there is to offer. What needs to happen now is rapid expansion. As an example, right now there are like only two rings in the game. The infrastructure is in place, the devs just have to add lots more content.Overall, I am really excited for this games future.			"

												Ok so Dungeonmans is a difficult game to review for me.  Yes, it is nostalgic.  Yes it is fun..sort of.  Yes if you enjoy hard games for no reason due to randomness then you will again enjoy Dungeonmans.  However, after about 7 hours of gameplay, you will notice what the developers want of you.  You are supposed to die, alot.  Hopefully with each death, you earned some symbols of strempf to turn back into the academy or you will get nowhere. Those symbols allow you to boost your stats and the subsequent stats of your future heroe's.  My issue with this, is that the map never changes, unless you opt to do that and lose the chance to find  your previous heroe's gear on the map.  The dungeons are always the same once the map is generated.  Yet sometimes you will encounter the boss mob in the dungeon and think you'll wipe the floor with him only to die in 3 hits because the game spawned an extra hard boss.  You will be completely decimating the dungeon, only to die quickly to the boss.  This has happened to me several times and is very frustrating.At least have some consistency game, so I can enjoy myself after spending 3 hours with one hero.			"

												TL:DRAn excellent use of persistence, humor and difficulty with a nice fast paced combat that makes play-throughs seem breezy. It’s not perfect, but it’s very well done. Would love to see more content drop on this game, as I have seen little over the course of owning it.  The pros far outweigh the cons, and don’t kill the satisfaction you get from the game.Pros:Humor is genuinely funny, which I find to be rare in a game. Perhaps not always the safest humor, but it’s definitely to my taste.Combat is quick and easy to execute with the num pad or mouse which can be both a boon and a curse as the game does require some critical thinking with little room for error in its tightest situations.Persistence is done well because the game is satisfying even in a losing scenario. Yes the game is not really feasible to beat in 1-2 or 3 play-throughs, but you’re playing a rogue-lite-like-“worst descriptor for a game ever”. You’re playing a difficult game with perma-death streamlined for quick play… how about that. Why do you need to feel like its fair right from the get go? Because you thought you were King The-best-at-games? If you can get past your own hubris, then playing each run to the best of your ability and feeling like you took home a doggy bag of treats for the next run feels far better in a game that was designed to be played more than once through. Sure you can just hump through the game like an idiot and probably accrue enough power to steamroll as well, but to each their own. This game allows you to get out of it what you put in.Going to jump back on persistence here, because this is really what the hook is on this game. Having famous bosses and dungeons that killed your characters grow in fame is pretty satisfying. Going to a boss that killed 2 or 3 of your characters feels like there is cross play-through narrative and gives some context to a pretty random world. Statues in towns you upgraded with champions throws some history into the mix. Overall I would say this does an even better job at rewarding persistence than the Dungeonmans HQ even does.Cons:Heavy reliance on character displacement as the key to difficulty, which can create some frustrating deaths.  There are definitely ways around this, I simply wish it wasn’t so heavily relied on is all.  It’s the single most necessary to mitigate creature ability, which exacerbates the next con on the list.Character development skill trees could have been a bit more diverse. There are a lot of skills, but maybe not as many as there should be designed around certain characters archetypes. It’s a bit like the game is more designed around armor and weapon as an archetype than skillsets as an archetype. You’ll probably grab wizard skills as a warrior. Hell you will probably be a wizard and necromancer. But the question is really will you use light, medium or heavy armor or dual wield, sword and board, staff, bow or lance. I know that sounds nit-picky given that that’s a huge number of combinations with just those two variables, but I would have liked more non-equipment based paths to travel.Your base of operations progression is pretty vanilla. It would have been nice to see more varied artifacts being brought in to the mix with more variety in bonuses across play-throughs through the HQ. I know it’s not a management game, but accruing marks of Stremf and storing the odd piece of equipment does feel a little lack luster. Less of a con and more of a missed opportunity.RNG doesn’t bring a huge amount to the table here other than dungeon layout, and even that isn’t really noticeable. There aren’t a huge amount of unique objects that you feel special seeing that aren’t equipment based. It facilitates replay, but doesn’t enhance it. Rarely do I feel RNG is implemented well, though, so I suppose take this with a grain of salt. I believe RNG should be used to add to narrative, and in this case the persistence takes its place effectively. Again, less of a con and more of a missed opportunity.			"

												This game is amazing. If you like action packed games that still require you to think and/or if you like roguelikes you should definitely try itDungeonmans is a roguelike with mechanics that feel both unique and classical and the world has a very satisfying sense of permanence, even though your own characters will inevitably die repeatedly in their quests to rid the land of evil. Characters have free reign to choose any abilities the game has to build them. There's tons of things to discover and the game has an incredibly satisfying sense of adventure. The battles can be very very deadly and require use of tactics and consummables to survive. The writing for the quips your hero makes, as well as the funny and amazing things you will find and see is very well done and amusing. If you like a good roguelike with an emphasis on in the moment tactical decisions and a world that will show the effects your adventuring has on it, try this game.			"

												Gets dull quickly and most of the loot just seems pointless, even the rare bit of stuff for the university. You spend most of your time having no problem killing individual spawns but then suddenly a champion with about 6-8 other enemies spawns, pulls you towards it, the other block you in and you're ******.They really need to fix the balence to either make it so that the spawn behavior is more stable, not ages of easy spawns then a sudden impossible one, or they need to remove the enemy's ability to pull you towards them so at least you can flee when that happens and come back later.The game also desperately needs to make it easier for you to exit the dungeons without having to travel between the various stairwells. Even in the first release of Diablo they realized to make town portal scrolls as common as muck, how come this lesson escaped the creators of this game? Travel is borrrrringgggg!!!!Unfortunately the 2 problem amplify one another since the risk of overpowered swarms means that you need a proper way to offload the loot, without this you lose a lot more progress when your character gets ganked.I'd suggest giving Rogue Legacy a try instead, similar concept albeit a platformer/dungeon crawler instead of top-down dungeon crawler. it has a more stable difficulty within individual areas though the luck element to finding new blueprints to improve your character can get frustrating.

												This game could have had potential to be good. For one the gameplay and combat gets very repetitive. Character creation is a joke as stats are random and if you don't like them guess what? You can't just go back (like most intellegent games allow) and start another char with the same name for a chance to get the stats you want for the type of character your going to play because you have to pick another name. Like the academy wouldn't ever have two students with the same name. Ridiculous. Also I have never played a roguelike where you get killed so cheaply and easily. You can open a door and die instantly no matter your level. Don't waste your money and time, there are plenty of better rogelikes than this one.			"

Playing with Academy you can grind any amount of stats and power to faceroll through the game, it's not even a roguelike. Playing without Academy, it's a really buggy (just try the unarmed skills!), unbalanced and clunky roguelike that still allows you to grind however long and much you want, with no food clock and infinite sources of loot.On the bright side, it's still better than Dredmor (*anything* is), and writing's rather funny.

												Found an Academy and create your first hero.  Strike out to make a name for yourself and your Academy.  Early on, while you aren't clear on how to survive well, there will be bumps in the road and your heroes will fall -- but ""you"" are not the heroes; ""you"" are a collection of heroes, the legacy of the entire Academy, and you will lead its graduates to make it great.  Knowledge your heroes live to bring back, the Academy keeps; your graduates steadily start better and better equipped through the efforts of those who came before, perhaps even taught additional skills by adventurers past who teach at the Academy.  Choose masteries from about a dozen possible disciplines (and counting), and build the Academy inexorably until none can stand against its heroes.If you've never played a ""roguelike"", or you've never heard the term, there's a learning curve you'll find a little steep at first, but stick with it -- once you get the hang of it, the rhythm of this kind of game, it's addictive.  For those who've played a roguelike before, this is a new twist -- permadeath is totally a thing, but not ALL of you dies.This game's graphics will not rival a console AAA title (though its music might).  Gameplay is turn-based and easy to pass up based on prejudice of presentation, but you will have missed out on a gem.  Not only is it fun to play, Dungeonmans represents a new step in the development of a very, very old legacy -- older than the Internet, older than Windows and even DOS, to when a computer had one -millionth- the memory yours does now.  Dungeonmans takes a fine, sacred tradition, adds generously in personality and presentation, and offers some of the best few bucks you'll ever spend on Steam.			"

												I am now Dungeonmans, thanks to Dungeonmans Academy, and you can be too.Serious Review:Dungeonmans is tons of fun. It's the kind of game that looks at the concept of an inventory limit and scoffs. There are always more zones to clear, more loot to find, more artifacts to find. In addition, the NPC towns you encounter live and die by your success or failure. The death of a Hero causes all the towns to lose a stat called Prosperity (exactly what it says on the tin), but you can bolster a town's Prosperity by donating a ""Purloined Inventory"" or 3. You get those from being a Dungeonmans and killing named/champion enemies. They also drop artifacts, which I mentioned earlier. You can turn those in back at the Academy, but here's the catch: your current run will not benefit from this in any way. It takes the Academy some time to figure out exactly what you've given them, and how to use it, but future Dungeonmans will thank you by killing lots of things presumably in your name.And that's just what I've unlocked so far.

												A great starter idea and prototype for other indie developers (hint hint) with more skill to work from and upgrade.That being said, Dungeonmans does something COMPLETELY new by taking the rogue-like forumula and giving it a sense of progression by allowing you to retain what you find in many various ways.There are a few things that could be implemented that would totally obsolete this title but for now this is the best of the lot when it comes to turn-by-turn dungeon exploring.I don't, however, feel this game to be worth fifteen bucks but since others are happy to spend $20 on Metroid rehashes like Axiom Verge I would say that, on Steam, you're getting a steal for that price.

												Picked this game up on the recommendation of a friend and was truly happy that I did. The game is simple in concept but the skill options item choices really add depth. Random dungeons and encounters keep you on the edge of your seat. As an old school gamer I appreciate the difficulty that comes with suprise monsters far stronger than you, and the thrill of figuring out a way to defeat them. Not being able to reuse Character names and possibly having those characters become teachers at your academy helps you really bond with each incarnation of your hero, this also makes it very frustrating when you die but the game also gives you a chance to avenge your hero and reclaim some of their best gear. Truly and engrossing game. Now if we could just get multiplayer :P			"

												What really makes this game work well is the academy, where information learned from previous Dungeonmans can be passed down.

												Below is a summary of a much more in-depth review I wrote over at www.reaxion.com/3396This game is sweet. A very nice balance between the randomness and challenge of perma-death featured in most roguelikes, yet also with the ability to keep some of your progress for future charecters with the academy system. The tactical turn-based combat is extremely well-done and has a lot to offer.Some of the negative reviews are hilarious (not that there are many, and for good reason), a guy spent 70 hours on this game and couldn't beat it and left a negative reveiw. Must suck to be so bad. I beat this game in 50 hours and left me hungering for more. That is the sign of a great game. In this game, if you die, it's your own damn fault because it's TURN-BASED, if you run into a powerful monster you can't handle then use a scroll of teleport and gtfo. Also, after about 10 or more charecter deaths, the amount of stuff that gets piled into your charecter through the academy in terms of stats is enough to snowball you through the game, but there's also other cool features (SPOILER) such as powerful charecters who become ghost teachers at your academy upon death that give future charecters skill points in certain skill trees(/SPOILER).Anyhow, if you feel 50 hours of quality entertainment is worth 10 bucks or so to get this game, give it a try. This is a much better game, in terms of gameplay (not graphics, sound, story) than 95% of games on steam.			"

												Bought this game less than a week ago, just finished it. Loved it, burned myself out, not gonna touch it for a while. Pros:Really addictive. When your doomed or careless mans dies, you just want to do better. Immediately. It  has humour without being silly (IMO). I did not like the humour in dungeons of dredmor, I love the humour in dungeonmans. Academy is a great idea, and provides some progress from game to game, even if a bit overpowered. Loved the GUI and 'feel' of the controls. Being class-less (no rigid fighter-cleric-wizard stuff) allows many potential combos. Some are more useful than others, so there's a lot of fun (and frustration) in experimentation. Loot, monster types, skills, bosses, map types are all varied and good.Cons:Feels kind of unfinished at times. Stuff are getting fixed, but some glaring ones still remain (shield visuals not transferring from level to level, tiles being wrong at times, loot falling on unreachable places, enemies stacked together, museum monster entries being pointless to name a few)Stat stacking from death to death can create some really overpowered characters. After the death of a few lvl 10 chars, you'll have a mean killing machine that can tackle legendary places  with ease. Sounds great at first, becomes boring after a while. My winning player killed the final boss with 3 skill hits. Too few set items. In ~50 hours I found parts from only two. Several parts, more than once.Some dungeon types are too big. Combined with lack of autoexplore, they become *boring*.City functionality is underwhelming. Could do with (a lot of) improvement.Dungeon layouts could be better. Doors leading to walls for example. TLDR: Money and time well spent. Really good. Really, really good. If you like RPGs / roguelikes, I can't recommend it enough.			"

												If you like ToME or are familiar with its gameplay, Dungeonmans is similar but different in some areas.  I might end up liking it over ToME because of it's humor, charm and accessibility.  Both are excellent, so if you've played one of the two and like it, the other is a given.I've spent about 12 hours with it (I play some steam-less so the hours played won't be accurate) and I've gotten quite far, yet I'm still surprised quite often.  I've barely explored the world map, but that's mostly due to my completely self-inflicted deaths.  I'm getting the hang of it now and the fact that you can combine any class skills together in combos makes for excellent versatility, replay and fun.  Right now, I'm playing a heavy-armor wearing ranger / necro hybrid.  It's awesome.While ToME may be rich in story / lore, Dungeonmans makes up for it in charm.  The visuals, sound and music are excellent.  I especially love the over-the-top level up screen and boss defeat animations.  This game also has some persistence; that is, if you provide your starting academy with certain items you get when completing dungeons, you'll get to assign more stat points to your future ""dungeonmans"".  You also find rare skill books, and if you'd rather not use them, donate them to your library and eventually you'll be able to start the game knowing more and more scroll effects.  Provide your armorer with loot that's been molten down and you can start your future dudes with stronger armor, weapons, etc.You have your overworld map, which is randomized and contains towns you can visit to buy/sell loot, dungeons, bandit barricades and other stuff.  Random battles rarely occur when you're on this overworld map, and you can skip most but not all.  I personally like them; they're different than your usual dungeon crawling and can have variety of enemies including champions.What's also cool is if you die in a certain dungeon, you can go to that same area / floor with your next guy and collect some XP and possibly a weapon.  It's not game breaking but it surely helps.Mouse and keyboard control work very well, but it would be nice to be able to remap the controls without delving into a text file.  Thankfully, the text file is easy to understand so remapping the entire keyboard can be done in minutes.  The file, along with Dungeonmans's savegames are located in \users\*username*\AppData\Roaming\Dungeonmans.  I think the file is keybindings.txt but if it's not, it'll be fairly obvious.In conclusion, I'm addicted to this game.  I can already tell it'll become one of my mainstay roguelikes that I can enjoy for years.  To the developer - you should port your game to the PS4 system.  It is sorely lacking in fun roguelikes, and while PC is an excellent platform, your game would be the perfect mix of difficulty, charm and fun for the console community.Well worth the full $17 I payed.

												Surprising gem of a game. Simple, solid gameplay and mechanics which introduces some nice ideas. The Academy, a persistent base for your heroes built on previous characters blood and sweat, is a clever idea to lend depth to world and new heroes. It adds the extra dimension of trying to set up a solid legacy with a new hero while still playing as your old character. Will Fredrick the Rangermans surpass the great level 12 Wizardman, Fizban? Or will he die at level two because you weren't watching your stamina and couldn't jump away?Beginning a fresh game can be tough when you have no legacy. Its part of the game to overcome this, stick with it! That being said, the game is quite simple to pick up and play, and skills are not convoluted with text. The main thing that will get you killed is your ambition to go one more floor of a dungeon rather than turn around and go home. It won't be until you open that next door that you'll realize you are in over your head.			"

												I have nothing bad to say about this game. Period.It's a fun permadeath game, I've been playing it non-stop and I've been slowly losing my mind because it takes a lot of dying to learn what to do in certain situations. I'm too lazy to think of  a list of pros and cons so I'm just going to describe my experience.My first Dungeonmans was an Archer, not a very versatile class to begin with but easy to use. Anytime I'd get stuck in a corner I'd just hop over one of the enemies and fire an arrow into there skull as I flew over. It was going smoothly, I started getting confident and that was my downfall, started running through dungeons, was working well for me until I walked into a room with a mage and a Pangolin Champion. The mage set me on fire and pushed me around, and the pangolin kept juggling me from one side of the room to the other. The archer relies on evasion, but you learn later on that it's a poor choice when you start meeting the new enemies.Next dungeonmans was a Wizard. If you want to play wizard, make sure to activate light shield whenever you get into a fight with enemies at your level or higher, the wizard can be a real tank if used right. Anyways, go to a dungeon, usual enemies, then again, new enemies. Cryomansers and Necromansers, get frozen, get poisened to death by a deathly fog because my light shield wore off.Bannerman was next, who is so far my favorite class other than Necromanser. Both mentioned classes are highly versatile, Necromanser even more so. My bannerman was my strongest dungeonman of all, but died when I encountered my first Tower at level Nine. It was a breeze, all the Necromansers kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off with the toxic clouds but Fervor helps a lot. Get to the top, and now I'm in what seems to be my first real boss fight. My bannerman was a beast, but the boss happened to be even more so. I was at 60 out of 240 health and I needed to heal so I combat blinked away, but I didn't know this boss could charge in a straight/diagonal line across the arena. He slammed into me and one shot me, I died a little inside at that moment.Many more of my characters died, the graveyard has grown a few tiles.With each death comes more proofs of Stremf, which makes stronger dungeonmans.Death is unavoidable, and I have to say, no game has challenged me this much in a while, I actually have to think and learn every aspect of the game to thrive.

												I love this game. It has very charming art style, with good music and funny humor. Game mechanics wise it's fairly simple and approachable, atleast compared to many other roguelikes. There is still plenty enough character options to choose from, and combat is fun.The game has a progression that you can keep even though characters that die are gone for good. Heroes of high enough level drop theyr weapon that becomes fairly powerful if you can retrieve it with next character, also killing champions monsters gives you proofs of stremf that you can cash in for increased stats that future characters can also use. Powerful set items or heirlooms from previous characters can also stored in a bank for future characters.Only downside i can think of is that the early game tends become boring chore if you die a lot. Having each character be more powerfu lthan previous because of proofs of stremf makes the early game on each character quite boring until you get back to the challenging stuff. This in my case caused me to try to rush back where i was before, which caused me to die for not paying attention to the boring early game enemies, which meant i had to start over again.			"

												This is an imperfect but very fun roguelike.  Highly recommended.  You will need potions.  Also, like any good roguelike, there are a lot of ""that was a mistake...."" moments.			"

												A solid and humorous traditional roguelike which has great gender options. :D That may not be important to most, but it really made my day.			"

												Rest Often, if it hurts-RUN, Controls have a bit of a curve and the menu system takes a couple tries to get used to...I am still overwhelmed at how much I enjoyed this game...even after the first few rewarded deaths..			"

												I own 70 games, including a whole bunch of rogue alikes, and this is the absolute best I won. I spent about 3 hours on it day. The game is easy to learn, has some good paradigms. I like them meta quest world.  the buy sell system is fantastic. The identify system is fun and easy, and not frustrating. What is not to like. This game is clearly a buy, dont hestitate. Buy!			"

												Lovely game! Must play for any rogue-like lover. I am having a blast here and I feel like I didn't even started properly. Fun classes and combat, outstanding progression system, great humor and easy to learn gameplay. I aboslutely love the Academy thing: it helps your progression even if you're failing miserably. Every next hero comes stronger and all thanks to the guys before him. Active developer in community and promises of more things to come! I can't recommend this enough			"

												Addictive little dungeon crawler with a little bit more. This quick tiering rogue-like fantasy game is a good time buster that'll get you hooked in minutes. I have a lot of fun with this game, but I can only play it when I can zone the day away. Pretty hard to put down... until you die of course.			"

												I was a backer for the kickstarter for this because I enjoyed the demo versions available then and I like the way it has progressed to now.This game has a bit lacking presentation quality compared some other paid rogue-likes (still above most popular free ones) using tiles so no animations, fixed tiles not changed by equipment, the help option opens up essentially a readme in another window. I was impressed when banners showed their new effects in tooltips when leveled up, but disappointed to find upgrading light armour didn't do the same.The game keeps things interesting using lots of active abilities on the player but also monsters. However sometimes the list of actives to try to set up, as well as potions to quaff, can sometimes seem overwhelming, one character had 4 abilities to buff themselves up but focusing on that leaves no time to move or attack- and so I found myself focusing on the other 2 abilities that give enhanced mobility and attacks in one. Some longer, cheaper buffs are optimally constantly active but can be a pain to keep up- especially the light shield power offered by light armour skill as using it before it expires causes it to explode rather than refresh and that explosion puts a cooldown before you can make shields again.In the kickstarter version my deaths were domiated by a few types of monsters putting out massive damage who thankfully seem to have been toned down- though the triger seems to want to take their place- and since then I've ran into some very nasty bone barons who create powerful summons as well as being strong on their own. Also unleashing ancient kings by opening secrets can sometimes lead to a quick death- unlike other secrets or exile chest which give you a prompt whether to fight them or not.While the game has no strict classes you still have starter options, and even going for choice with the dungeonmans (as I tend to do) you still stick within skill trees so I'll mention as few things. I enjoyed and was pretty successful on the bannermans, though I'm not convinced using banners for buffs makes all that much of a difference compared to just buffing. Southern gentlemans have a fun theme and interesting gimmick of real time that is very flavourful for a berserkerish character but I don't think being encouraged to play quick and sloppy is that good a gimmick, and their skills seem random in a way you seem to need to react to, certainly not good for a character that encourages button mashing. Playing some other characters i found myself relying on archery powers even on characters that started melee focused and wonder if the ability to kite melee enemies and not be kited by ranged ones makes ranged characters too good compared to melee. I did still manage to have a lot of success on a sword and board, so it isn't needed. I seem to remember necromansers used to be very mage related but now aren't, which is nice for options but does leave necromancers (and southern gentlemen) without and clear idea or real synergies with any weapons set up, especially as the game doesn't really say what stats their skills benefit from.One major feature, but unfortunately one I'm not a massive fan off, is the idea of a persistant academy you build up. It lets you make characters brokenly skilled, statted and equipped in the early game, but still doesn't really let you skip the early levels. There is also a lot of randomness, or sticking to what successful previous characters have done, that can make the usefulness vary massively between different characters. As strong as characters can be early later on is still a challenge, which is obviously somewhat good, but also means very successful early characters can easily find themselves underpowered. Really not a thing I am sure about, but hasn't been deal breaking and there are neat elements like avenging dungeonmans and aquiring some of their equipment, or gathering information on enemies.			"

												Don't let the puns and tongue-and-cheek take on fantasy fool you. This is game with a great deal of intelligent design. If you like roguelikes this is an auto-buy. If you want a fantasy dungeon crawl, make this your first purchase.			"

												A very fun and developed rouge-lite at this point. Major issues are similar to most games of this genre. Very easilly to be killed, a lot of grinding to make up your way back to where you were... on the plus side its a really fun core set of mechanics and finding new loot in this game is great.Overall I wish it had a little more development for the mid-end game. It gets very repetative after a while but totally worth the cost of entry. Super fun game.			"

												This, to me, is one of the most unique games going.  It is hard as hell, but very addictive and fun.  I knew I was going to like before I even finished character creation.  Gotta love a game that refers to ""Strength"" as ""Stremf"".			"

												I love this game. It has very charming art style, with good music and funny humor. Game mechanics wise it's fairly simple and approachable, atleast compared to many other roguelikes. There is still plenty enough character options to choose from, and combat is fun.The game has a progression that you can keep even though characters that die are gone for good. Heroes of high enough level drop theyr weapon that becomes fairly powerful if you can retrieve it with next character, also killing champions monsters gives you proofs of stremf that you can cash in for increased stats that future characters can also use. Powerful set items or heirlooms from previous characters can also stored in a bank for future characters.Only downside i can think of is that the early game tends become boring chore if you die a lot. Having each character be more powerfu lthan previous because of proofs of stremf makes the early game on each character quite boring until you get back to the challenging stuff. This in my case caused me to try to rush back where i was before, which caused me to die for not paying attention to the boring early game enemies, which meant i had to start over again.			"

												Definitely recommend this game! If you like Dungeons of Dredmor, it's similar to that. Only this game is a lot more smooth than Dredmor. I really enjoy the simple humor in the game. I've laughed quite a few times. The game doesn't take itself that seriously and I think is cool. I'm on my sixth hero right now with only ever reaching level 5. It's easy to die if you go too fast, which is also easy to do considering how fast paced this game can be despite it being turn-based. Each hero can help improve your next game, which in my opinion is a good idea to implement in a rogue-like game. $10 might seem more fair of a price, however I don't know how long the game goes for. But there's obviously lots of replayability as it is a rogue-like. Decent amount of variety in gear and traits. Artstyle is good. I think overall for what it is it's a great game. I've been on the look out for a while now for a rogue-like that isn't too tryhard but also isn't too casual, I think this game is right on the mark.			"
