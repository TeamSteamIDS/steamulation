												Mind-numbingly simple combat, completely forgettable character classes and art, possibly the most boring loot / player progression I've ever seen, and mechanics that were proven as broken in 1995. For example:You recover HP by moving around. Okay, that's pretty standard. But every monster moves exactly as fast as you, and they do not recover HP. So you can beat every single monster in the game by running in circles while they fruitlessly chase after you, chipping away at their HP when it's safe. This is unbearably tedious, but it's the ""correct"" way to play, especially since the game has no qualms with guaranteed boss monsters that two-shot you on the first floor. Better games solve this problem (that, again, was established twenty years ago) through a variety of methods. Monsters that are faster than you, monsters that heal when you walk as well, wandering monsters that can show up and block your path, etc. Quest of Dungeons' developer has made a technically competent game, but he is a very poor designer.Pro Tips for aspiring roguelike developers: read this, the design philosophy of the best roguelike out there. http://crawl.develz.org/other/manual.html#n-philosophy-pas-de-faq . I'm not saying every game has to be exactly like Crawl, but for the parts of yours that are different, you should be able to explain why you chose to make them that way. Anyway, that was a huge tangent for a very mediocre game. To sum it up: don't buy it.			"

												This game qualifies as a ""Rogue-lite"" with very, VERY heavy emphasis on the suffix ""LITE"".  ""The Orc and the Pie"" is a joke about how, when you get down to it, the lazy standard of RPGs is to just say there's some monster that wants to kill you, and if you kill it, you get some random loot thing, and then get offered a chance to go kill another orc to get more pies.  Whoever made this game didn't get that it was supposed to be a joke.Play as one of four pre-defined stereotypes with no real character customization in a series of square rooms where you can either spam the ranged attack button (if a ranged attacker) or just ram directly into enemies until they all die.  Then, once the orcs are dead, you get to run over anything in the room while spamming the ""pick up"" button, and occasionally run all the way back to a shopkeeper to empty out your pockets so you can carry more random crap.  This game's version of pies are largely uninspired.  You have potions, ""food"" that are potions in disguise, armor and weapons that just straight give +damage or -damage with very few exceptions, and you'll largely be fighting enemies on floor 5 the exact same way as you did on floor 1.  In fact, you'll probably be fighting the SAME ENEMIES, too, since this game palette swaps all the enemies.  Thanks to a lack of enough mana potions, if you play the mage, you'll be treated to a basic attack spell that takes 5 MP, enemies that take several bolts to kill, and needing to waste a dozen turns to get 2 MP back.  Enjoy the tactical depth of running in circles or smashing the wait turn button for hours to get your MP back after clearing a cramped room.  Since there's no hunger mechanics, you can waste infinite time, and are directly rewarded for doing so, with only the toll upon your own patience as a disincentive.  Bosses may be tougher than you, but thanks to the I-take-a-turn-you-take-a-turn nature of the game, you can simply walk away from bosses to prolong combat as long as necessary for your passive regen to put you back up to full health while the bosses have no regeneration.  As a bonus, ""poison"" type effects keep working, so getting a single lucky fireball to start tapping away 3% health per turn and then kiting the boss across the whole dungeon is easy-peasy boss cheesing. Beyond that, everything in this game is either scenery or a target for vandalism.  It tries to add ""humor"" by having random quotes put out there like Dungeons of Dredmor did, but honestly, that just reminds me of how Dungeons of Dredmor is a much, much better game than this.  The ""jokes"" are even mostly recycled, and I can't even be bothered to stop to read them, after a while, much like I can't be bothered to stop to pick up the bajillion coins that fall out of the hundredth palette swapped rat I just barbecued with my thousandth fireball.  Procedural content is only as interesting as the effort put into making each area actually feel different.  This game is just the same room copy-pasted every single time.  Kick in door, kill orc, take pie.  Kick in next door, kill orc, take pie.  Rinse and repeat until your eyes bleed.  Few games manage to be as offensively boring as this...In summary, don't play this game, it's a lazy knockoff Dungeons of Dredmor wannabe.  Play the real Dungeons of Dredmor.			"

												Disclaimer: Reviewed using press copy provided by developerFirst Impressions:I had fun with this! simple, but not bare minimum on features. lots of health & food pickups kept me from being immediately eaten by a rat and/or bat tag team. I like the art style's inoffensive cleaner presentation, and the dynamic-ish room shadows are a nice fancy touch I don't see very often. Music is super duper quiet though, wish it had some hot lute solos. Gameplay is basic click attack, but there are right click power moves unique to the 4 classes. Will be important to compare how balanced ranged classes are vs sword dudes. lots of clicking, but it's a pretty cool little game with enough polish to make a nice impression on people familiar with the genre. I like it. Recommended: Yes doggy.			"

												If you're lazy like me, and you want to eat food AND play a turn based RPG at the same time, Quest of dungeons is perfect! I can munch on my beefy-5-layer burrito while simultaneously pointing and clicking on bad guys and collecting loot! Imagine the most generic dungeon crawler possible, and you've probably imagined something similar to Quest of Dungeons. A loot-hunt, a maze of randomly spawned rooms, baddies that drop gold, hooded merchants who will buy everything you have without question ... Quest of Dungeons just might be a dungeon crawler in it's purest form. This game accomplishes it's intent save for a few exceptions:1- The bosses are slightly imbalanced throughout the game. On the first level, they will one-hit kill you, on the seventh, you will one-shot them from across the room. Somewhere in the middle you will encounter bosses at about the right level.2- The randomized levels have a chance of ruining your game. I finally made it to the last level on my third play-through, and what was immediately behind door #1? THE FINAL BOSS! I discovered later that the final floor has it's own unique bad guys and rooms to explore. So beware, lest the final boss is at the foot of the stairs.			"

												Now this is what I call a good Coffeebrake Roguelike. It's not complicated, it doesn't demand you to teach dozens of combinations (recipes, spells, dieties of Gods, etc.), it is quite dynamical and fun. You progress really quick. You can find an arsenal in a single chest, or you can travel plenty of rooms with a stick and a lid. I was INVINCIBLE!!! I had like 10 skills learned from looted book, but then... A boss happened. Anyway, the game may need some more feats and content, but for a $3 coffee brake Roguelike it's fun as is. I'd give it 4/5 in it's genre. Thank you for your attention.			"

												This game is a rogue-like dungeon-crawler.Firstly, you have to choose between four different classes (Warrior, Wizard, Assassin, Shaman) and four difficulties (Easy, Normal, Hard, Hell).Then the game starts, and you have to go through 7 floors killing monsters in order to get xp, money and items.You will encounter bosses that are quite challenging to kill. Do not hesitate to escape, by closing the door that you opened a few seconds ago for instance, if you think that you will have a hard time killing a scary boss !You will trigger quests (between 0-3 at each floor) that require to either kill a boss or find an item. You'll be rewarded with both money and xp. I think that you should clean an entire floor before triggering a quest (at least in Hard /Hell difficulties). The point I want to make is that if this is a boss quest, you might be in trouble if you have to fight a boss that you've just spawned plus some regular monsters.Cleaning an entire floor will bring you everything you need : xp, money and items. You should get the best stuff you can and some potions before fighting the final boss. Regarding this final boss, I do not want to spoil people, but there is one thing I want to say : how is it possible to give him the ability to kill us with one skill and one shot ? If the skill ""Death"" hits you, you will die 10 turns later, no matter what you do ... You have to hope that it will fail :sRegarding the achievements, there are quite easy to unlock, except maybe for the one that needs you to beat the game in Hell mode. I might make a guide to give you some hints.To put it in a nutshell, I think this game is quite good, especially for its price (5€ at the moment). I hope that there will be some updates in order to add more contents (more floors, maybe a ""survival"" mode with infinite floors ? ...). If you like this kind of game, do not hesitate, buy it !			"

												There are far better games of this type out there. Unless you are really stuck on the 8-bit art style, I'd instead go with Wazhack or Sword of the Stars: The Pit, both of which are excellent. OR try Hammerwatch if you want live-action roguelike as opposed to turn-based, which this is.Here are the pros:1) A little humor in the game which is mildly amusing.2) Scratches your 8-bit nostalgia itch, if you have one. 3) The music tracks are cool if you like 8/16-bit MIDI tracks. I quite like them personally. Here are the cons:1) Waaaay too easy on normal difficulty. Only the boss fights are hard. The rest of the time you will rarely if ever need to use your special abilities. Overall gameplay is fairly simple compared to some of the other rogue-likes I've seen. 2) Loot system and the game in general is not well balanced. You gain skills by acquiring skill books. These drop way too often, so by level 3 of the dungeon you've already acquired all the skills for your class.3) There are ONLY 7 LEVELS for this game. VERY short for a rogue-like game.4) Generally uninspired and derivative. Absolutely nothing new is introduced to this ancient formula. It's been done better many times before.Basically this game feels half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ The devs did not pour there heart and soul into this game. It is paint by numbers. And the painting is pretty sloppy at that.			"

												Quest of Dungeons is an incredibly fun game, that is very addicting, and more than worth the price.Following suit of classic dungeon-crawler games, Quest of Dungeons provides humorus lore, randomly generated dungeons with plenty of rewards, a simple-- yet effective, currency system, a multitude of themes and matching monsters, and one of the best game soundtracks I have in my steam collection.With it's perma-death system, many gamers would be cautious to pick up this title, but upon playing it I  can assure you that it only adds to the thrill of the game. When you get stuck between a boss and its minions, and are lacking a health potion or two-- it requires ciritical stratigizing to heal up and return the damage without dying, and will hold you on the edge of your seat trying to figure out the best way to go about a quest.Speaking of quests, they are the one thing that I find lacking-- somewhat ironically, in Quest of Dungeons. The lore behind this game is very humorous, and I find myself laughing at the premise of the title-- which essentially is to kill an evil sorcerer/tyrant/thing, to restore the good in the land. The storyline is vague, and very satrical at it's own expense. However, in-game quests lack any real reason behind them-- ironic or otherwise-- and while they do provide an exceptional amount of gold and XP, I find them somewhat boring to complete.In the end, I found Quest of Dungeons to be an excellent title that I would reccomend to anyone who doesn't mind restarting their game and thinking critically.9/10 overall score.

												Permadeath.  Get used it.Premise: Return the ""light"" stolen by a Dark Lord.Deceptively simple, easy, roguelike, single player, quest adventure.  Can be done in 30 minutes or less if you are good and lucky.Did I mention Permadeath?What makes this game a challenge beyond the randomly generated dungeons is Permadeath.  Each and every time you die the dungeon respawns and the player must begin again from the very beginning as a new character.  No in-game save points.  No tutorial.  Learn as one goes, and player arrogance and over confidence is the biggest enemy.7 levels to traverse through with random encounters, traps, loot, side quests, and mini-bosses that will kick your butt.4 difficulty settings: Easy, Normal, Hard and Hell.  For Hard and Hell all those OMG 'these are stupid tricks' come in handy when the monsters are OP and there is no shop keeper to buy health or mana from.Four character classes: warrior, wizard, shaman, and assassin each with their own unique play style and power ups (which one may or may not get during game play).Can you go the distance in this scoreboard game?  Simple things can be the hardest to achieve.			"

												It is cheap. It is brainless entertainment, really good if you are ill, or tired or don't want to think too much. It doesn't have lore, nor tactics, nor a story, nor does it look great, it is repetitive, but it is just plain simple hacking monsters and some bosses untill you reach the downmost level of the dungeon and slay the final boss. It took me 4 hours (with two restarts as you die permanently) to play through chapter 1 (there seems to be another chapter), which is 1,25 euro per hour, about half a cup of cappucino. The dungeons are generated randomly, so if you are looking for a lot of careless entertainment, it should suffice.Great if you lack energy, or lack time.			"

												This game is essentially a remake of the 1991 Sega classic ""Fatal Labyrinth"", which is also available on Steam. Quest of Dungeons adds a few elements to the formula, some good and some bad, but doesn't really aspire to improve it so the few flaws that Fatal Labyrinth had are still here in Quest of Dungeons. This game adds more loot and a store to sell and buy items. But most of the loot is just junk to sell anyway, and there is nothing worth buying except healing potions. Quest of Dungeons also tries to add personality to the player character and the monsters, but fails completely. The character says random things like ""This game was made with C++"" and ""This game was made with OpenGL"". The monsters say equally weird things, according to another reviewer they are mostly references to movies that have nothing to do with the context of this game.Like in Fatal Labyrinth, the only way to heal between battles is to run around a bit. In this game the healing is a lot slower so the running around just to heal yourself gets even more tedious after a while.I quit playing soon after I got to the 4th floor of the dungeon. There you encounter monsters who steal stuff from your inventory. This is another ""feature"" that was present in Fatal Labyrinth as well. But again, Quest of Dungeons makes an annoying feature worse. In Fatal Labyrinth the monster sometimes stole an item from you, in this game they almost always succesfully steal from you, so you see the few good items you didn't sell before going to the 4th floor disappear from your inventory at an extremely frustrating rate. And you can't get stolen items back from the monster after killing it. Within a few minutes I lost the three keys I had in my inventory (the most important items in Quest of Dungeons and not easy to find) and the better part of my gold. This is such a cheap mechanism to make a game more difficult (and Quest of Dungeons has a few of those) that it made me decide to quit playing.Conclusion: the premise of the game is good but we saw that 25 years ago already in Fatal Labyrinth. And Fatal Labyrinth is still the better of the two games: it's longer, more balanced, less frustrating and annoying, it doesn't have the weird and even childish atmosphere and it has a ""continue"" system (if you play it via the emulator that comes with the Sega Megadrive Classics / Sega Genesis Classics collections, you can even save at any point). So I don't recommend this game but if you're looking to play a game just like it that doesn't have its flaws, I recommend Fatal Labyrinth instead.			"

												Unfortunately I can't recommend this game. It's not a bad game, particularly in terms of polish. It's finished, it works, it has a proper structure... But it's very, very low on actual content and challenge. The game is easy, gold is utterly meaningless (therefore shops are essentially just an item creation menu, because you know you will ALWAYS be able to buy anything you want at them at all times) and it has no real storyline... though thats normal for this genre at least. You'll learn all your spells within about 10 minutes, your level doesn't really matter (there's no other progression either), items are all boring with no visual effects and they rarely even have extra stats making it a game where you just look at one green number to choose all your gear and by the end i didnt remember even a single item I had on.The upside is the game is fast and you can finish it within 30m (so sayeth the achievements, I suspect faster is possible) so if you want something to play in short bursts its good for that. But with so little content I find it hard to believe you'd want to play this much. People are mentioning this being a port of a mobile game, if that is true it certainly would suit that format and I'd actually recommend getting it mobile if that's an option instead. It's a game for thumbing at on the bus or in the bathroom, not fullscreen sit-down PC gaming.So don't buy it. Not unless it receives a big patch. The potential for a really solid game is here if only it was utilised. Then again, it was released days ago so I do hold out some home we see more content coming.			"

												Quest of Dungeons: a rogue-like that's both simple, funny, hard and addictive. This is one of the first Portuguese games ever to make it to a major videogame digital distribution platform (previous examples fall to A Walk in the Dark on Steam and Under Siege on PSN), and the results are positive. Let me explain the topics I've mentioned above: the game is simple. You only need the mouse to play it, but the WASD keys are also very helpful. The mechanics themselves are very simple and pleasant, and even if one hasn't ever played a rogue-like there will be no difficulty in adapting to the game mechanics. Funny, because the plot is based on clichés and ironies. The plot is not a big deal, of course, but that's the objective. Hard, because there is permadeath: you die, you're over. There is no respawn. You have to start from the very beggining. There are also random bosses that can bring instant death if they are found early in the game. Addictive, because of the very reason that makes games like Binding of Isaac addicting: every thime you die and have to start over, you reach further areas and advance a little more with each time you play. You discover new things, new techniques, new content and came, step by step, closer to finally reach the end of the game. So, I have written this review without finnishing the game, and my opinion might change a bit when I finally do it. If that proves right, I will edit this review in order to make it more actual. Now, if the game is worth the 5€: it depends. If you're a fan of rogue-like games, then buy it. If you are just looking for a game to relax, consider buying it with a discount. I usually don't rate indie games, especially indie games like this, but I'll advance with a score of 76 out of 100. Reccomended.			"

												Quest of Dungeons is an... interesting... title.It is a well-oiled roguelite, to summarize. I recommend it.But I find that all game elements this game does well, is done better in other games.It is a humorous piece, with some funny quotes from the NPCs, with a now-and-then jocular atmosphere, and a tongue-in-cheek type of humour.But I find that if it is the comedy that attracts, then games like Dungeons of Dredmore should be your go-to choice as they performs it better.It has a nice graphical style, with a tidy, simplistic look, pretty animations and all put together, it looks really cool.But there are many games, including roguelites, that fit this description and possibly even does it better.The combat system is nice, if fairly generic, with a normal weapon-based attack, and several different spells to use, ranging from buffs to fireballs or bombs.But, just like before, many games do this, and sometimes even better than here.The looting system is good; it has its flaws (for instance, selecting what to pick up in piled up on the ground is not possible, but you need to go through all of them to reach the bottom one) but it still works pretty good and it's easy to adapt to.Quest of Dungeons also lacks in a few other aspects, which keeps it from playing like a finished game. For example, although I liked the available options in the options menu, it lacked some important things like sound control/mute, key schemes and rebinds, changing the resolution manually, etc.And if, viewing certain equipments (say, a helm) while not wearing any of that type (head armor), would have all stats glow green, just like they do when compared to stats of the current equipment of that type, that would be slightly handy.What makes this game recommendable is that, even though it does not have any single outstanding quality, it all still works really well together. The art style, the combat - everything just works well together, even though not always being perfect, and it ends up still being a very, very nice product.I don't usually rate titles, but this would be a strong 7/10.It does not really have any amazing game elements that makes it an absolute must-buy,but it is a good enough roguelite and is worth the money it costs for a fan of the genre, especially on sale.Except for, perhaps, hardcore rogue-like players who enjoy deep and complex mechanics.

  +Graphics ""16-bit retro artistic look""   +Gameplay Turn based dungeon crawler - The world is randomly generated - You have to kill monsters and Bosses while progressing from chamber to chamber , leveling up , acquiring new armor+shields+weapons(No visual change, only makes you more powerful) and skills like an attack that make the monsters paralysed or an earth quake. 4 Different characters that change the gameplay. Oh and Permadeath Suckers! The bad side of the gameplay can be seen in easy and normal difficulty where you can abuse the turn based system by waiting or turning around in circles like a jackass in order to gain your health back and also the spells cooldown. You can actually still do the spells cooldown in even in hard and hell difficulties.     Storyline ""An unspecific evil Dark Lord has stolen all the light, so your mission is to enter his lair and defeat him. That's it, now go get him.""    +Soundtrack Nice descent soundtrack that can get a bit repetetive.   -customization Non Visual, all the different weapons and armors just makes you more powerful.   +Enemies Different enemies and bosses . most of them attack with melee while some others attack from distance.   +Steam Achievements Most of them are achievable   Difficulty 4 : Easy (finished the game in it) Normal (Same) , Hard and hell .   Levels(Floors) 7 levels.   +Characters 4 : 1/Warrior : The melee based class. 2/Wizard : Mage ranged based class. 3/Assassin(Most powerful class) : Archer ranged based class. 4/Shaman : a mixture of ranged and melee class. Apperently he can learn to use swords like the warrior wich will probably make him more powerfull in melee attack, i actually never found the spell to learn to do that so untill then he is the weakest character.  + : Good- : Bad			"

An underrated gem.To tell you the truth, I found Quest of Dungeons by accident here on Steam, while I was looking for some new games to play. And I'm glad I found it! At first, it may appear to be just a simple game, but there's a lot of depth in it.The drop system is great, and you just drop gear for the hero you choose. So, unlike many other games, you can't drop an exceptional armor/weapon that you can't use. This helps a lot.Some people may dislike the skill system, because you don't learn new skills by levelling up, you have to drop books to learn them. On the one hand, it's a totally random drop and you may only find the skills you want later on in the game, on the other, you can never drop the same book of a skill that you already learned (only if you already have a book in your inventory that you didn't used to learn the skill, then it can drop the same skill book). I personally liked it.One minor complaint I have is that I found the game to be kinda easy, even on the hardest level (Hell mode).Overall, Quest of Dungeons is a solid game. Totally worth it even at full price.			"

												This is a very casual roguelike: dungeon crawling, turn based combat, random maps and items, etc. However there are few tactical actions and inventory elements. In other roguelikes, most items are unidentified at first, and blindly trying every potion, scroll, armor, etc., where may be dozens of different kinds, becomes a part of the game as well. But in QoD there are no such elements and thus there is little replayability. The skill tree for a character can be available half game. You keep leveling up but don't get new skills.So, this is a roguelike you can finish. It is enjoyable for a while, but once you have finished the game with one character there is little incentive to keep playing other than to see the skills of the other ones (which, as said, can be done quickly).I guess I'll ""recommend"" the game, but don't expect much if you are familiar with other roguelikes. Word of advice: play in ""hell"" difficulty or you may find it way too easy.			"

												4/5 Worth owning.Most of my play time with Quest Of Dungeuns has been via the Humble Store (DRM-free + Steam key + Android apk file) version. I've also played it ALOT on my Android phone. My Steam stats don't even scratch the surface of my experience with it.PROS:+ Fun.+ Randomized dungeuns keep the experience fresh.+ 4 playable character classes, with a rumored 'unlockable' fifth.+ Very modest hardware requirements; netbook friendly.+ Windows, Mac, and Linux versions all included.+ Easy 'mouse click' controls, with gamepad support being added.+ Humble Store version is DRM-free and includes a DRM-free Android 'apk' file for Android phones and tablets.+ Android version uses a very simple touch-screen interface.+ Steam version includes Achievements and cloud saves.CONS:- Graphics snobs beware.- No multiplayer...yet.

												I loved this game. Is it super deep and long? No, but that's okay. I can play this game with one hand, which I enjoy when I am feeling lazy. I enjoy the style of graphic and find most of the dialog funny. At first i thought the game was difficult but then I got used to the ""system"". I've beaten it a few times. I got this on sale however I do feel $5 isn't too much for this game. It's short, it's fun. Enough said.			"

I tried lots of this kind of games but this one is special.I can invest a lot of hours playing it.It's an RPG, what means a lot for me. With progressive leveling and all kind of regular and/or special items.I totally recommend it. It's not easy (I don't like the easy ones), just expect a lot of fun and prepare to DIE.			"

												This game is quite difficult, where as if you die you must start from the beginning. However, it is rather fun. Play smart and remember that it is a turn based game and you will be much better off in your approach. It's cheap. The dated graphics are kind of the point of the game. It's not to be taken to seriously, but when you realize all of the subtle nuances of it, it makes it far more enjoyable. The level progression and procurring nice loot, weapons, and armor are taken into account, the game really comes alive. It's not for everyone, this game appeals mainly to the oldschool. It is surprisingly more in depth than first glance portrays. I would highly recommend this game if you have the patience and the will to play such a dungeon crawler. The soundtrack consists of very few ""songs"" but I find it to be done quite well.			"

												If you can tell from how many hours I clocked in on this game, I love it! It's hard enough to be nearly frustrating but fun enough that every time I die I think 'okay, this time I'll get that achievement!' and since it is a rogue-type game replaying it is always a new adventure! The graphics and 2D top-down is charming and the simple controls take no time to get used to. All in all, one of my favorite games!			"

												TLDR: Don't buy this game, it's bad. Instead consider playing Tales of Maj'Eyal or Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. Quest of Dungeons is not a roguelike, it is a roguelikelike. It is a dumb, poorly made abomination that merely contains elements that an ignorant may ask and be told, probably from a bored and indifferent source, can be found within roguelikes.This insipid program is a mannequin of a roguelike. There is next to no variety in abilities or items. Most gear is a flat upgrade, additional stats are rare and usually as significant as +1% crit chance. It has draped itself in the trappings of a roguelike but nothing more.It lacks many basic features such as auto-exploration, travel to landmark, or rest till fully healed. And may the Good Lord in Heaven have mercy or your wretched soul if you should even attempt to make use of the click to move feature.Clicking on a square causes you to move to that square, even distant squares that take many turns to walk to. In those subsequent turns you get to watch your character get mobbed to death without you being able to stop it. Yes, this game lacks the basic feature of stopping auto-walk when an enemy appears or you take damage. The first time I had a character die to this I had to immediately kill off a few more just to convince myself that yes, this game is just that badly made. Had the developers placed into this game any sort of love, care, attention, or to be frank, competence, then they would have caught this.No love was put into this game, and I presume only minimal effort. Where are the random and unindentified potions, scrolls, and wands? Where are the whacky item egos and curses? Where is the innovation? Where is the fun? Where are the things that people who love games hold so dear that they want to dedicated a significant portion of their lives just for the chance that they can share them with the world? Where is this game's voice? Oh no, not That Friend's voice. But yes, it is, and we will discuss it.Throughout the game monsters will say famous quotes from pop culture. “Welcome to your doom.” You might open a door and see a walking tree that announces “I am your father.” No reason, no joke, no connection to anything. “The cake is a lie.” These things are just said and said and said, repeated constantly through the game. “Run you fool.” It isn't funny.Say you find yourself, despite all good efforts, alone in a room with That Friend. You know of whom I speak, we all know That Friend.“Do you remember Portal?” he asks, then guffaws. Using his thumb he counts down the greasy fat fingers on his other hand. Star Trek, Terminator, Lord of the Rings, Scooby-Doo. Each punctuated with a false high pitched screech that his dim mind approximates to laughter before moving down the queue to the next reference. No jokes, no punchlines, just references to the existence of pop culture icons. And then braying.Grabbing you by the shoulders, That Friend pulls his oily face within millimeters of yours, dilated eyes blood shot and half mad, spit foaming in the corners of his filthy unwashed mouth, he screams his putrid breath into your nostrils: “Do you remember Star Wars?!” And then the noise, which you will never forget, not laughter, but a robotic repetitive pronunciation of a syllable without variation, screamed at the top of his lungs, into your face, into your rattling suicide-contemplating bones. “HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!”These syllables are devoid of humor and the halls that they echo through are indelibly darkened, even memories of mirth and joy past are erased.This game is bad.It was made by bad people.But it was not made for bad people.It was made for no one.

												Updated!!!The game is a ton of fun and you should check it out.  I'll give you guys a run down of some of the stuff I like and a few things that could be improved.  I do want to point out one thing though.  Since the release of this game the developer has done many updates addressing any and all problems found.  Always good to see a developer so passionate and eager about righting wrongs, tweaking things, or just addressing issues.If you'd rather watch a video than read, I covered Quest of Dungeons twice in my Weekly Runs!!! series, so feel free to check that out as well.

			Since no one voted :( for this week's Weekly Runs!!! series, I chose Quest Of Dungeons. I know that the developer has been patching and working hard with his fans to get the game to the point where...		

orhttps://www.youtube.com/bumpymcsquigumsQuest Of Dungeons is an extremely fun turn-based dungeon crawling roguelike game.  You gain loot, experience, levels, skills and spells as well.  If you liked Hack, Slash, Loot, and wanted a little more out of it, or you are a big fan of Dungeons Of Dredmor, but feel it might be a bit TOO complex, then THIS is your middle ground.  The graphics are minimalist but not bad, the sounds and music are well done and the gameplay is very nice.  You get loot from killing stuff and opening chests and your skills are found the same way in the form of skill books or tomes.    No clumsy skill trees or crazy keyboard commands here.  Just a combination of mouse clicky clicks, keyboard movement (If you want it) and your skill.  Really fun game, I highly recommend you check it out.I was able to review/preview the game through a review/press copy of the game from the developer.  He's a super nice guy and I feel he did an amazing job.  All that being said there are still some things that need work.*** Please Note:  I left the below section in to show what I had said about the game upon release.***********************************************************************************************************************The difficulty of the game (at least with the two heroes I beat it with) needs an overhaul.  The first floor or two can be relatively difficult and if you are just completely not paying attention bad juju can happen, but overall the game is a touch too easy.  I did beat the game on hard and I felt there should be a larger difficulty increase between normal and hard as well as the different floors.Not only that, you also seem to max out your skills well within the first two floors as well.  Now, I'm all about having options but it tends to make tricky situations a bit easier when you have your full array of abilities about 10-15 minutes into the game.  I suppose this could be the reason the game gets much easier after the second floor as well.  My suggestion would be to possibly lower the drop rate or spread out the skill books a bit more.You gain a tremendous amount of gold as the game progresses, far more than you could ever spend.  Again, the first two floors of the game you are sort of skill/gold/gear starved, but after the second floor, little can touch you or at least do much damage before you kill it.Now that's not to say there are no challenges in the game.  The quest mobs and the boss mobs are still pretty nasty, but they really are the biggest challenge.  Traps and normal mobs really offer little challenge at best.********************************************************************************************************************The developer pretty much addressed any and all issues I had above.  He added a new difficulty level, adjust the gold issues, and it seems lowered the skill tome drops as well.  It's almost TOO hard now.  So, if you like a challenge, it's here in spades with the new difficulty setting!  Well done Sir, well done.I still find the game insanely fun and quite enjoyable.  As I stated earlier the developer is updating and making changes frequently and I feel he has a solid game.  The tweaking and work done after release on Quest Of Dungeons has turned this extremely fun and enjoyable roguelike game into an extremely fun, enjoyable, and challenging GREAT roguelike game.  I highly recommend it, even more so than I did before.  Quest Of Dungeons is well worth the small $4.99 pricetag.  It's one of the few games I feel could charge more and it still be a great deal.

												Terrific roguelike that, while it looks sparse, is rich with details.  Fun one-liners from mobs. Shops are class-specific, always. Easy to pick up and play, although bosses are absolutely unscrupulous, and can one-shot you from full health to D-E-A-D. That said, it's a blast, and the dev is always open to improvements, comments, and helpful criticisms. Highly recommended, espcially if the retro look does it for you (it most definitely does it for me).			"

												Quest of Dungeons is a very simple, generic rogue-like game, which turns out to be plenty of fun. There are 7 floors to explore, each taking around half an hour to finish, making a playthrough last 3-4 hours or so. There are four classes to choose from - Warrior, Shaman, Assassin and Mage. I played through the game on normal with the warrior and enjoyed the variety of skills I acquired for him. Not a ton, but enough to add some strategy and keep a ~3 hour game interesting. I'm assuming the other three classes have their own set of skills, which adds some potential replayability. One thing to keep in mind before starting a game is that 'normal' difficulty was rather easy for me and I never had any shortage of money. If you are adept at rogue-likes, you may want to play on a higher difficulty. This game isn't amazing, but it is a fun and simple rogue-like that is very accessible. It retails at $5 so it would be a very reasonable purchase on sale.			"

												I was searching for a game to satisfy a certain urge, the urge for something refreshing and new; but yet with a nostalgic flare. I stumbled upon this game and decided to give it a shot for 5 bucks. Let me just say right now... WORTH IT. I spent nearly 2 hours straight playing it after I finished the 2 minute installation. The fight mechanics are pretty good, if not a little over-reactive with the mouse controls (I sometimes end up unintentionally moving when I click a tile with a monster on it as an assassin) but for 5 bucks it's certainly not a bother to me. This game is really well done for the price in my opinion, and I certainly hope this becomes popular. I imagine this as almost a turn based Binding of Isaac, with equipment you can switch out as opposed to just stacking more on or overwriting it accidentally. Having multiple classes is also a plus, though I have only played the assassin. My point is, if you have 5 bucks in your steam wallet thats burning a hole in your pocket; give this game a chance because you just may fall in love with it.			"

												I absolutley love this game. It is a rogue like. I don't know how to explain it. The game mechanics have been explained before. You can see from the video how it works etc. I have to tell you, I have been gaming for many years. I have hundreds of games. I generally spend more time reading about and collecting games, than playing. This game has captured my attention. I tend to torrent games, but always buy them if I play and/or like them. I read about this game and torrented it. I played it for a few minutes and bought the game on steam AND IOS. I have spent hours on my ipad playing this game. I have gotten very far and lost it all, again and again, the thing is I instantly want to start again. (this game has perma death BTW.) Not only do I recomennd buying this game, I say buy it on steam AND IOS. I finally have an app on my ipad that make me drain the batteries. I love love love this game. I also play this on steam. If you don't have an IOS device, get it on steam for sure. Like I said before, but it on both, you wont be disapointed.			"

												Quest of Dungeons is a fun and retro game. I love its classic style of being a dungeon type of game, but it keeps a simple and easy game. The learning curb is super easy and I only criticize that it becomes slightly repetitive. The music sounds like a classic arcade game which goes sweet with the game. The graphics and their old appearance add to that great atmosphere. But as far as replaying it goes, it does kind of get repetitive. The 4 classes do allow for some extensive replaying of the game but to only an extent. Apart from that, the game is great to have for a short burst.			"

												I knew I was going to like this game the second I bought it. The only problem is, I could not get the game to start to save my life. Finally, my friend figured it out. If you are having issues with the game not starting: Go to your libraryRight click this gameGo into propertiesClick the Local Files tabClick Browse Local FilesWhen you get into the folder, click the GameDependencies folder and accept those programs. The game is supposed to do this automatically, but it's no big deal. It has very addicting gameplay, a lot like a game called Pixel Dungeon that I play on my phone, and the sense of humor in this game is amusing. I walked into a room, a mimic chest popped up, screamed ""YOLO"" and then chased me out of the room. If you're looking for a rouge-like game, and you have 5$ to spare (or less if it's on sale), then I definitely recommend this game.			"

												It's cute, and precisely what you'd expect for the price. What it lacks is balance, in that you'll be cruising along in auto-pilot until a virtually unbeatable boss appears out of nowhere and either forces you to flee, or eats you alive. In addition, because of the nature of combat, and the fact that all creatures (including the hero) share the same walking speed, there really doesn't exist any room for a third option.While I certainly give this game a thumbs up for its sound execution of a simple concept, the concept itself is somewhat flawed. It's an excellent purchase if you're able to pick it up for a dollar or so, but it's certainly not worth the default price tag of $5.			"

All abilities are extremely easy to get and blatently overpowered. But I expected the game would get more challenging and that the early floors where just some stocking up area, I was mistaken. I never had to use a single potion or healing item. Never play this game on normal. Just start on hard. For it's low price point it might be worth trying out.Conclusion: Don't expect a hard or unforgiving game but go into it when you want an easy and relaxed experience. Also start playing on hard!			"

												As a fairly big fan of Roguelikes and Roguelites, i really wanted to like this game. And when i started it, i did. It's repetitive, and the graphics are just generally unedited sprites from a Sprite Pack you can buy for use in your games, but it had a certain charm to it i suppose. Ignoring the graphics because of the aforementioned reason, the sound design isn't great. The music is cute, but generic. The combat has almost no sounds to it, which is fine if that's what you're going for, but it doesn't seem like that's what they wanted. The sounds for eating and drinking (which you will be doing a LOT because of shoddy balance, more on that below) honestly sound like wet farts. The controls are intutive enough i guess. Move around with WASD/Clicking with the Mouse and attack by clicking with the mouse. Oh and loot by clicking with the mouse. Starting to see a problem? This is most evident when playing as the Wizard/Assassin, characters designed more for a ranged approach. Nothing is more infuriating than trying to attack an enemy, only to misclick and just run right up next to them and stick your face out to get punched. Same problem with looting, half the time if you aren't paying perfect attention to where your mouse is, you'll run PAST your loot. While not as much of an issue in the early part of the game, in the later parts where enemies are EVERYWHERE, you'll often run straight into one due to this issue. But honestly, as a fan of roguelikes, i could've overlooked that. The humor of the game is definitely what kept me somewhat charmed, with such items as ""Bottled Water"" (Generic Brand) and the Moldy Cheese item questioning why you even have it in your pocket. And if those were the only issues, i could've ignored them. Honestly though, the balance is definitely the main problem with the game. I kinda glossed over the combat earlier for a reason. As i said, it's fairly repetitive. You click on enemies and hit them, you damage them, they damage you, etc. You have skills you can use, but it's effectively selecting the skill and then... clicking on enemies. Or yourself if it's a buff. As far as i can tell from my best run, there are no party members. Sidequests are practically nonexistant, generally they're just randomly generated fluff, either of the ""go find this item that's randomly spawned in some room"" or ""kill this slightly recolored enemy that either you'll kill in two hits, or vice versa"" variety. There's no visual indicator of progress, your sprite stays the same. But again; this isn't the biggest issue. That... is definitely the balance. Yeah. The balance, of all things, in a rather boiled down roguelike, is ironically the main problem. You know how in most roguelikes your chance to dodge can be affected by equipment? Or rings? Or SOMETHING? Yeah, not so much here. In fact, i still have no idea what affects dodging in this as there is no weight system, and the only items i've ever seen have secondary effects are weapons which *NEVER* have +Dodge Chance or anything similar. This generally means that dodging for you is just a gift from RNGesus. For the enemies, it's a COMMON occurance. For cannon fodder enemies, that's fine. You know when it's not fine? With bosses. Bosses that can dodge all of your attacks and oneshot you at full health when you're already above the needed level for the floor you're on and can consistently oneshot the aforementioned fodder. The recolored enemies are guilty of the same issue. Equipment doesn't make a big difference really, as i said, only weapons ever seem to have extra effects, and they're generally worthless, so it's just a matter of seeing which item has a better main stat. Same with armor. Hell, even rings, generally the only thing in some roguelikes that have other effects, are just more Defense fodder in this. Honestly, i'd like to recommend this game. I can see a mobile port working well (which they're working on a 3DS port so that's probably closer than i think) but in it's current state, on a platform with so many better Roguelikes, i can't recommend it. Oh and for you achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s like myself, it commits a horrible, horrible sin; the difficulty achievements are difficulty locked. Beating the game on Hard for example, doesn't unlock the Normal and Easy achievements, just the Hard one. There's literally no reason for it, other than either the devs didn't think of it, or they were padding the game. If you want a good example of a roguelike that's almost the complete opposite of this in every way, go play Elona. This probably seems like Needless shilling, but i'm serious. It's freeware, and has a large modding community.			"

												I can't understand, why so many people are giving a positive feedback.I'm down to floor 2 and I have over 200.000 pieces of gold with me I don't need, because the Items in the shop to buy are rubbish compared to those, I carry with me. Why?Because this game is still inbalanced!Why collecting gems to sell them later for 12 gold each, when you just can hold on to those books with your skill spells? After completing half of floor 1 I had all my skills, but those books kept coming. So I collected them. With over 5.000 gold per book and dozens of them to sell I am rich now. And bored.Being a completionist I killed all enemies in floor 1. Now I am so strong that I just rush through the rest of the rooms. I can't say what the game is like after floor 2. Because it is too boring to find out. Everytime the same thing. Go into a room, kill the enemies with 2 punches and then the fiddling with your inventory. Why should I carry so many items, when I can buy some potions (stackable). Compared to the food items (non-stackable and less health-giving) these are the best. But in the case of beeing -that- rich: Why having those stupid food items which just overload your inventory?!So you try to keep vour inventory clean. Which is hard work! Why? Because if there are some items on the ground, for example 5 bottles of water and a piece of armour and you just want to collect the armour, you still have to pick everything up, when the armour is on the ground and the bottles above.Every enemy has the same schematic of fighting, the A.I. is also boring as hell - Which isn't exactly true, because I think that being tortured in hell would be more exciting than playing a game which is very, very, very, very, very easy. Maybe you should call your ""Normal""-Difficulty that way. Although it would be a very long button - but not as long as my annoyance will go on.I have played games with the same price and wasn't bored after 1h of gameplay, so I have a right to expect more than being bored and unimpressed after the first floor.Do better. Now. Or announce your little game as not finished. Or announce it as ""Give us your money for nothing. Thanks."". What a great and fun title for your game!Usually I am not this enraged by anything, but since there are so many bad games in steam, people should be warned. I have no problem at all with low-budget games which are finished after 3 or 4 hours. I have no problem with games I can't finish because they are too hard.But here are my problems: I can't enjoy the 3 or 4 hours of gameplay, because it's boring, unbalanced, unfinished and too easy.

												Okay, so after playing around for a few hours, here's what I think.Gameplay? Addictive, simple, rewarding, easy to streamline into faster paced dungeon delvingStory? Who needs it?Personal Opinion? Working towards a powerful character with all abilities/spells feels great. It also provides a real sense of loss when you die and have to start all over again, though the game is simple enough that it won't take too long. So far I've not made it past the 4th floor, so restarting may not be as bad yet as, say, dying on the 10th floor (if it even goes that far).Pro Tips- keep everything with you until you find a merchant. All that bad gear you keep finding? Sell it. You can easily make 20K gold if you sell as much stuff as you can.- once you have lots of gold, always buy keys from the merchants. You never know when you'll need them.			"

												Quest of Dungeons isn't the most complex Rogue-like you'll ever play. It lacks the in-depth skill system of a game like Dungeons of Dredmor, and from what I've seen there's only one kind of trap, and what it does is spawn more monsters, which isn't necessarily a bad thing when you're trying to grind out a little more XP. And yet, even though its simple, and at times just a tad bit bland I still find reasons to recommend it. Perhaps it's because QoD is so focused. You have four classes to choose from, and there's nothing in the way of stat points to allocate. You can loot and equip items but the stat system for the randomly generated loot is easy to read, and so for those who aren't theorycraft extraordinaires knowing how to build a character is as simple as making sure you have level appropriate gear. The focus then becomes knowing when to use your skills and keeping a supply of food items and health potions to keep yourself alive. There is a quest system in the game, but there are only two types of quests: Kill enemy X, or Find item Y. There's a definite necessity to complete these in order to keep up with the escalating level of the dungeon enemies from floor to floor. The game does feature four difficulty levels, and there is supposed to be an update soon which will add a new dungeon. The game is not devoid of content but much of what is there is grindy and similar. For some that will work (I like to play this game in between sessions of hardercore, more mentally taxing games) but those who seek something that will constantly crank up the Wowfactor and throw lots of curves at you might fair better looking elsewhere.I'd recommend this game to those who are new the sub-genre, or else can't stand the complexity that some of us masochists relish in the more hardcore rogue-likes. Those who have already defeated Dredmor a few dozen times and completed Nethack a hundred times over might want to wait for something more complex to come along.			"

												Quest of Dungeon originally got my attention simply for the funny trailer, however as I sank a few hours in, I felt like it was the devs that got the last laugh. This is not worth your money at all. And here's why in this long list of issues.-The game is overly simple. The game throws at you ton food items that any experienced Roguelike player would expect them to serve a greater purpose aka hunger. Here, their only purpose is simply to (restore a bit of HP). They are basically just lesser Health Potion. Also, The only strategy involved with any character is to spam skills whenever they are available. There's no wands of teleport or rings of polymorph to be found here. No fun silly deaths that you'd find in other roguelike eitheir. Here.  Your deaths will be solely attributed to dying to a boss you shouldn't have tackled yet. (But you had no way of knowing prior).- One design choice of other turn based Roguelike is to walk or pass a turn to restore HP, usually you can fast foward this to make this take second and you can't do it forever or you will starve. In this game however. It becomes a gigantic issue that ruins replayability. As the Warrior. You gain a very small chunk of HP by walking 5-6 steps. It takes about 2 minutes of walking back and forth aimlessly in a room to be fighting fit again. THIS IS THE OPTIMAL WAY OF PLAYING. THE GAME ENCOURAGES YOU TO DO SO SINCE THERE'S NO HUNGER SYSTEM. So if you're playing on Hard difficulty. You'ill want to save as many health potion as possible for later. So after every encounters. You should be ready to do the tedious task of regenerating HPs. By walking in a circle around the room. Also, enemies that doesn't appears within your view range just doesn't move at all. So you'ill never be taken by suprise by doing this tedious task. By the way, The Mage character only restore MP while walking around, not both. Enjoy the tedious task of spinning right 'round the rooms for MP instead of HP. Now I want you to picture this: You open a door, a boss appears a few square away. You use any skills available to prepare for the encounter such as Defense Skill and the Warrior's Shout Skill that can stun an enemy for a long time. You manage to stun the boss, you go in for the kill, inexplicably miss thrice. Then the boss acts, he gets a critical hit. You took half you HP bar on that one crit. You get out of the boss room into the other square shaped room you came from, then walk in a circular motion around the room as the boss tails you the entire time without any way of actually hitting you, since nothing will ever come and block your path. You keep turning around the room for a solid 2 minute to replenish all your HP. Then go in for a hit, you hit the boss a few times and so does he, your HP are at critical. Which only means... More of the silly cat and mouse chase around the room until your HP bar is full again-Quest of Dungeon encourages grinding, as much as possible to progress. The anwers to everything is just to have a stronger character instead of having more knowledge then a less experienced player. The only thing to learn are the way to cheese the skills you learn trough randomly dropped books. Basically. All the Warrior's skills has a cooldown after use. (He doesn't have MP to worry about) Let's say your Bleeding Hit skill failed on the boss, You now have a 50+ turn cooldown before you can use it again. You know what that means? You're gonna be running around in circle around the room some more until the skill is available again! Superb! 10/10 gameplay right here. Also on a lesser note, trough the dungeons are stones that activates quest. But there's only 2 variety of quest. Quest A: Kill that boss. Quest B: Find an item that just randomly spawned around the dungeon. Both serves the only purpose of making you revisit the entire floor again with a vague hint of (The item or boss is situated north). You HAVE to do these quest if you want to survive on Normal or above. Pretty lackluster for a game called Quest of Dungeons.Now on to the smaller stuff...-Unlimited skill slot, at no point you will have to make a choice of having a healing spell above stun effect spell. The only anwers is just to read all the spell book you can find until all further books you find becomes (Book of Nothing) which you can sell to the merchant for a quick buck.-Pointless traps that are always in plain sight. In other Roguelike, traps would be invisible to the player until they stepped on it, or had a method of finding them. Here, you will want to step on the spawn monster trap. So you can grind more XP.Also the game features props like a shelves, pots, boxes and other thing that can be destroyed or search for gold or items. And sometime breaking a pot will inexplicabably trigger a trap that makes enemies spawns from the ceiling. (I guess these skeletons were really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I just broke their favorite pot?) One last thing about special tiles. There are invisible stash that can be walked on that yeild more gold, but those are stumbled only trough pure luck, or walking on every tiles of a dungeon. But you'd have to be crazy to do that.-Equipement makes no friggin' sence. Very rarely weapons has additional attributes like (More gold) or (2+ Crits). There's a multitude of weapon sprite, however, that sweet crystal shield you just found could be beaten by that random wood buckler you had laying around in your inventory stats wise. Don't get me started on the equipement name etheir. In the same playtrough, I've got two exact looking pair of boots. One was named (The Boots) with 12 point of DEF, the other pair was named: (Damaged Boots) with 16 points of DEF. This is explained by the fact that all piece of equipment you find seems to have random generated names, it slaps random adjective to the item, so you'ill get things like (Dark Sigil Sword Seeker). Way to confuse new players to think there's actually depth to be found here.-Enemies with ranged capacities are the bane of your existence. And if it's a boss with spells or a bow. Run, and pray that you don't get immolated by that fireball or get a random crit from that arrow. You can ultimately trick them to follow you around the room like other melee bosses, but first you got to walk up to them, and by then you're already on the brink of death.-Item menu, as far as I know, cannot be used with arrow keys or keyboard imput, you have to use your mouse. Same goes for choosing a skill. It would have been nice to be able set the skills to the F1-F6 keys instead of clicking the spell book every time you want to switch.-Along gold, you'ill find gems along the way, there's at least 8 or so sort of gems that are worth maybe 15 to then 20 GP each. Each kind of gem stack with each other, but if you find 6 sort of gems in a row and you're short on inventory space, you'd rather just leave that gem there and avoid the clutter, because ultimately, finding just one random piece of equipement will make those gems feel like chum changes when you realise that even the worst shield can be worth 1000+ GP. -Enemies sometime spout some random lines like: (The cake is a lie) or (You should have taken the blue pill) or even worst (I am your father). Too bad that the humor stops the moment you step in the dungeon. Because the trailer and intro was really funny in comparaison.-Your sprite will never change to reflect the equipement you've equipped and that's really unfortunate and lazy. - Last and more important. It's a roguelike where you have to grind and it's never fun to die.Ultimately, I can't recommend this game to veteran or neophytes alike. At best this game is a good distraction while watching something on the side or eating... If roguelikes are something you might be interested in, go for a free Roguelike like POWDER which is made by one guy and is much more deep. Or you know, dish more money for a roguelike worth it's salt like FTL or Darkest Dungeon.			"

												Quest of Dungeons is arguably the most intense horror game I have ever experienced. Every floor presents hidden dangers that will keep you short of breath and the hairs on your arms standing. Every new encounter is as terrifying as the last, bombarding you with grotesque mutations, horrifying imagery, and creatures that you could only have nightmares about.The fear hits you from the first moment that you enter the game. With no exit in sight, you are immediately thrown into what you can only imagine to be an inescapable demise. What hit me the hardest, however, was the bone-chilling dialogue of your various hunters. I couldn't tell you the last time that I had a good night's sleep.Would not recommend this game to anyone with past history of cardiac irregularities, asthma attacks, stroke, unexplainable twitching, abusive spouses, poor math grades, or whining like a ♥♥♥♥♥.10/10 it's okay			"

												I wasn’t expecting much when I picked up this game but I’m glad I did. Quest of Dungeons is a rogue like in the most classic way. Sticking with the grid based movement and turn based combat the original Rogue had. Almost everything is randomly generated and different classes are available for every play style. The art is very nice with vibrant colors. Each floor is massive and you always want to explore the entire thing before moving on. You can also find books that will give you a random new spell giving you more options for combat. I prefer this method of obtaining new moves over the standard pick from a skill tree when you level up. One of the most unique things about Quest of Dungeons is the quests. When you find a quest it will be added to your journal which will tell you what to do. Some of the things you will need to do will vary from killing a mini boss type enemy to finding an item somewhere in the level. I’m very impressed with this game and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to experience a real rogue like game. 7/10			"

												A lot of the negative reviews focus on the fact that Quest of Dungeouns - hereafter known as QD - lacks the same depth as other games in the genre. I think it's important to bear in mind that QD wasn't meant to be complex and ""deep."" It's a simple dungeon crawler that you can choose to play for ten minutes then put it down and come back another time. The game has a nice sense of humor about it, the music is nice but it could have used a few more tunes. Don't go in expecting QD to ADOM or Moria, if you do you will be disappointed. Rather approach it as a way to just play to relax and you'll find that the ""one more dungeoun level"" feeling will be yours.It's five bucks folks and it provides much more fun than the sticker price would have you believe.

So if you're playing on Hard difficulty. You'ill want to save as many health potion as possible for later. So after every encounters. You should be ready to do the tedious task of regenerating HPs. By walking in a circle around the room. Also, enemies that doesn't appears within your view range just doesn't move at all. So you'ill never be taken by suprise by doing this tedious task. By the way, The Mage character only restore MP while walking around, not both. Enjoy the tedious task of spinning right 'round the rooms for MP instead of HP. Now I want you to picture this: You open a door, a boss appears a few square away. You use any skills available to prepare for the encounter such as Defense Skill and the Warrior's Shout Skill that can stun an enemy for a long time. You manage to stun the boss, you go in for the kill, inexplicably miss thrice. Then the boss acts, he gets a critical hit. You took half you HP bar on that one crit. You get out of the boss room into the other square shaped room you came from, then walk in a circular motion around the room as the boss tails you the entire time without any way of actually hitting you, since nothing will ever come and block your path. You keep turning around the room for a solid 2 minute to replenish all your HP. Then go in for a hit, you hit the boss a few times and so does he, your HP are at critical. Which only means... More of the silly cat and mouse chase around the room until your HP bar is full again-Quest of Dungeon encourages grinding, as much as possible to progress. The anwers to everything is just to have a stronger character instead of having more knowledge then a less experienced player. The only thing to learn are the way to cheese the skills you learn trough randomly dropped books. Basically. All the Warrior's skills has a cooldown after use. (He doesn't have MP to worry about) Let's say your Bleeding Hit skill failed on the boss, You now have a 50+ turn cooldown before you can use it again. You know what that means? You're gonna be running around in circle around the room some more until the skill is available again! Superb! 10/10 gameplay right here. Also on a lesser note, trough the dungeons are stones that activates quest. But there's only 2 variety of quest. Quest A: Kill that boss. Quest B: Find an item that just randomly spawned around the dungeon. Both serves the only purpose of making you revisit the entire floor again with a vague hint of (The item or boss is situated north). You HAVE to do these quest if you want to survive on Normal or above. Pretty lackluster for a game called Quest of Dungeons.Now on to the smaller stuff...-Unlimited skill slot, at no point you will have to make a choice of having a healing spell above stun effect spell. The only anwers is just to read all the spell book you can find until all further books you find becomes (Book of Nothing) which you can sell to the merchant for a quick buck.-Pointless traps that are always in plain sight. In other Roguelike, traps would be invisible to the player until they stepped on it, or had a method of finding them. Here, you will want to step on the spawn monster trap. So you can grind more XP.Also the game features props like a shelves, pots, boxes and other thing that can be destroyed or search for gold or items. And sometime breaking a pot will inexplicabably trigger a trap that makes enemies spawns from the ceiling. (I guess these skeletons were really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I just broke their favorite pot?) One last thing about special tiles. There are invisible stash that can be walked on that yeild more gold, but those are stumbled only trough pure luck, or walking on every tiles of a dungeon. But you'd have to be crazy to do that.-Equipement makes no friggin' sence. Very rarely weapons has additional attributes like (More gold) or (2+ Crits). There's a multitude of weapon sprite, however, that sweet crystal shield you just found could be beaten by that random wood buckler you had laying around in your inventory stats wise. Don't get me started on the equipement name etheir. In the same playtrough, I've got two exact looking pair of boots. One was named (The Boots) with 12 point of DEF, the other pair was named: (Damaged Boots) with 16 points of DEF. This is explained by the fact that all piece of equipment you find seems to have random generated names, it slaps random adjective to the item, so you'ill get things like (Dark Sigil Sword Seeker). Way to confuse new players to think there's actually depth to be found here.-Enemies with ranged capacities are the bane of your existence. And if it's a boss with spells or a bow. Run, and pray that you don't get immolated by that fireball or get a random crit from that arrow. You can ultimately trick them to follow you around the room like other melee bosses, but first you got to walk up to them, and by then you're already on the brink of death.-Item menu, as far as I know, cannot be used with arrow keys or keyboard imput, you have to use your mouse. Same goes for choosing a skill. It would have been nice to be able set the skills to the F1-F6 keys instead of clicking the spell book every time you want to switch.-Along gold, you'ill find gems along the way, there's at least 8 or so sort of gems that are worth maybe 15 to then 20 GP each. Each kind of gem stack with each other, but if you find 6 sort of gems in a row and you're short on inventory space, you'd rather just leave that gem there and avoid the clutter, because ultimately, finding just one random piece of equipement will make those gems feel like chum changes when you realise that even the worst shield can be worth 1000+ GP. -Enemies sometime spout some random lines like: (The cake is a lie) or (You should have taken the blue pill) or even worst (I am your father). Too bad that the humor stops the moment you step in the dungeon. Because the trailer and intro was really funny in comparaison.-Your sprite will never change to reflect the equipement you've equipped and that's really unfortunate and lazy. - Last and more important. It's a roguelike where you have to grind and it's never fun to die.Ultimately, I can't recommend this game to veteran or neophytes alike. At best this game is a good distraction while watching something on the side or eating... If roguelikes are something you might be interested in, go for a free Roguelike like POWDER which is made by one guy and is much more deep. Or you know, dish more money for a roguelike worth it's salt like FTL or Darkest Dungeon.			"

												This game is extremely entertaining but is flawed in a few ways, although definetly worth the five bucks. One very annoying thing, In every game i have ever played (thats an insane amount), i have always favored the wizard / mage if they have one, so obviously i started with the wizard but bosses were quite rediculous, so i moved on to the warrior... After the other classes i did the assassin and it EXTREMELY overpowered the other classes and the enemies. So they did a very bad job at equalizing the strength of the classes, but that is the only main error i have found. Thank you for reading.			"

												This game is pretty cute, it has all the aesthetic appeal necessary to get you into a game of this type, the whole 'Perma-Death' thing might turn a few people away, but it really isn't meant to be played for long hours unless you want it to.It's cute and humourous but also pretty daunting, once you start the game you'll instantly feel lost, unaware of all the controls and options etc. but you can and will learn these pretty fast on your own, it's more the gloomy vibe of the layout that will get to you. You're actually a little scared to see what you might come up against, you have no idea how strong you are in comparison to the monsters you know are there but are yet to see. No idea what any of your stats mean or what any items do that you may have been fortunate enough to find early on, there are interesting looking tiles and things everywhere so here is the biggest thing you'll be doing off the bat CLICK EVERYTHING that looks at all different from the normal tile you see. In fact in the very first room there's a signpost you might want to click on and check out... :3Since that's such a large part of the games experience (IMO) I won't say much more but, go everywhere check everything and be careful! You're sure to enjoy it regardless c:[Design changes I'd like to see]I love this game, but there are some things design wise that I think should be improved. You should be able to move your items around in your inventory at will imo since there are so many items that need to be sold at points, organising this would be majorly helpful. I also think that entrances to new rooms on the map should be marked as a different colour since its quite easy to miss if you aren't looking at it every 5 seconds. Only once you're looking back over a floor do you suddenly see you may have missed or forgotten about a few rooms.Also I'm sorry but I have to question why you're only allowed one save file... What if I want one file per class/character? Can you not give us at least 4 slots? I don't want to have to come on and commit to one class every time and only be able to change it once I die :CAnd what about a 'graveyard' of sorts, or a 'hero's plaque' where you can choose to record your past characters exploits after death ^^Final Thoughts:I don't know if anymore will be added to the game but I'd certainly buy DLC if it were available X3, maybe I'm a sucker, but Pokemon Mystery Dungeon is like the same genre, and I was 100% addicted to it AND it's sequels, if there were more content in this... well I would love it at least <3 9/10-MeGN ''It's decent''8/8-MeSpot ''Not perfect, but as close as any human can get''2/10-MeCritic ''We loved it!''

												1 hOUR 20 MINUTES into my session. Fully kitted out. That evil wizard is going DOWN!Then 1 Messed up move later - 5 health - i have forgotten to recharge my health leach ability. As i stare the boss in the eye - Hes doing 10 damage a hit - he's on full health - About 50.i cant kill him. I cant heal. I cant escape. I stare into the moniter for about 5 minutes desperately looking for an escape. None. Nothing. No way out. No hope. What had just five minutes ago been an amazingly fun time quickly turned to despair and fear. Another minute passes. It feels as though it is an eternity. I decide i have no other option. I mster up all my courage - force myself out of the fetal position - and tap forward. Forward into the embrace of the Giant. Forward to the embrace of death. Gone. All the grinding. All the loot. Gone. Damm this game is good. But you have one life to comlete it or your to disheartend to play it. 8/10.

Also rogue seems like easy street haha. Like I said though I do like it, moving diagonaly would be a nice touch. The experience bar being prettied up would also be nice but obviously not important. Is the intention for us to be allowed multiple spells on our spell bar? Or to have to choose only one which we can use?Apart from that the only thing I see as being super duper important is multiplayer, if you add multiplayer I would recommend without hesitation. Right now it is fun but a little hard due to getting one hit from bosses even on floor 1 in easiest difficulty as warrior, lol.			"

												This is a simple old school (style) dungeon crawler. You have one life to beat through 7 levels. Each level is randomly generated and has randomly generated instances. For example: Locked rooms full of chests, boss monsters, and the possibility of quests. There are 4 difficulty levels; Easy, Normal, Hard, and Hell. You play as one of four classes; Warrior, Wizard, Hunter, and Shaman. The bosses are quite challenging, especially at early levels. Now, while I recommend this game, I would have paid a lot more for a game with more features. I think for the $5, you get a great and fun time killer. It's interesting and intertaining. I think even with multi player, it would have added a lot more to the game.			"

												If you're an old-head like me, you might remember what it was like to go the the local shop or arcade on a Saturday afternoon so you could pump a few quarters into the Pac-Man/Donkey Kong/Asteroids/whatever machine.  Remember that feeling?  Well, this game will bring some of that back.  It's reminiscent of a cross between the original arcade Gauntlet and the NES version of Final Fantasy.  Like those games, it's remarkably easy to pick up and learn on the fly.  If you're looking for a game that will tax your skills, this isn't it.  But, if you're looking to play a game just to kill some time and recapture that feeling of having no particular place to be on a Saturday afternoon, this will do.			"

												Reviewing Quest of Dungeons is, in many ways, a lot like reviewing a unicorn. QuoD is, essentially, the ultimate 'generic Indie game'. Given the range and breadth of the so-called Indie genre, this should be impossible. Nevertheless, QuoD manages it. It's like opening your library to discover a mythical creature: something that, fundamentally, should not exist.At this point, I feel the need to stress, that is not a recommendation. The fact that it such a thing exists is marvelous, the game itself, however, is therefore not. It is the ultimate testimony to the fact that a great game requires more than a full range of acceptable elements.There is a great misconception that, if you just throw together a bunch of tried and tested game mechanics, with a sufficiently pleasing 'Indy-pixel' aesthetic, and some decent music, and brief if moderately amusing story, and then polish it all up a bit, you will get at least a decent game. QuoD is this game, and it is dull. Every element of this game would prove perfectly adequate in another, better, indie title. Together, the result is far, far less than the sum of its parts.The game mechanics are generic as they come. It's like someone took the mechanics from the original Rogue, and then threw in all the standard RPG sub-mechanics that players expect today. Oh, and removed most of the challenge. Upgrades are linear (and dull), combat is simplistic (and dull), level design is randomised (and dull), items are generic (and dull). You get the picture. There is not a single idea in this game that you have not seen before, probably so many times you don't even register its presence any more. Fittingly, the game does not see fit to provide a tutorial. Perhaps it sees itself as a sort of 'Wiki-learning' game, like Minecraft. Such delusions of grandeur are utterly misplaced, but fortunately you don't need one, because it's so damn generic.The frippery is, similarly, so generic as to be barely worth noting. It's got cutesy pixel graphics. Gosh. In an Indie game. Someone phone the ♥♥♥♥ing press. I guess the execution's acceptable, but it's, like everything else about this game, utterly unremarkable. The music? Well, I guess it's got some. It's not chiptune, so maybe it loses a little bit of Indie cred there, but it's dull, repetetive, loops over and over again, and is repetetive, so I guess that's nearly as good. What there is of it is fine, and it isn't actively obnoxious for the first hour and a half, so I guess that's OK. And the game has seperate audio sliders, which is useful, when you finally get sick of it. Finally, the story. Um... Not much of that. There's a tiny opening cutscene, and, I'd guess, probably an ending cutscene. I freely admit, I couldn't be bothered to finish the game. I guess the story's adequate to explain why you're doing what you're doing, but Spec Ops it ain't.So, the result? Look, I don't know if I've got the point across yet, but OH GOD IT'S SO DULL. This is proof that it possible to find an Indie game not merely lacking in execution but in heart. It's just utterly soulless. It's like someone took Realm of the Mad God and removed the elements that made it fun. The only reasons you should buy it are as a dire warning for budding game designers, and so you can get a really rare badge for your Steam profile.I can't hate this game. It doesn't have that much personality. I just resent the hours of my life I spent playing it.			"

												Meh-game. Port from mobile devices (or game developed for them), lacking content. Very repetitive and boring. Managed to learn every possible skill i could on the first floor (opened 1 closed door, got 10 books). Very unbalanced too, large difficulty spikes on level bosses (common monsters cant even scratch you, level boss can kill you in 2-3 hits). It is not a rogue-like, its no even rogue-light. Its rogue-light wannabe.Sorry for broken english.			"

												Picked up this title as something that I could easily play on my laptop with the track pad, and saw it available for less than the price of a Starbuck's coffee.  Good game, not great.  A few questionable design choices but I've had fun bashing a few dungeons now and will be heading back for more.Pretty and readable pixel graphics, charming if somewhat out of theme music.   Difficult with the normal setting, I might try the easy setting and see if I get more out of the game.  Lots of monsters to slay, love being taunted by rats and bats!   Even more objects in the world to smash, and almost everything will provide some kind of loot.  I am curious how the loot scales up as I go deeper in the dungeon, but during the first two levels it seems very random.. maybe a little too random.			"

												The game is a turn-based RPG, as in you move 1 spot, so will the enemy (Comparable to Pokémon mystery dungeon but way better). You can play 1 out of 4 characters at a time, each with it's own special skillset and specialities, in difficulties ranging from easy to hell. The game itself is played in a 1 try for victory style meaning if your health gauge reaches 0, you're game over. Most of the achievements are also fun to hunt for and the game is speedrunnable for extra challenges.Due to the retro style, difficulty and strategy needed in the later levels and boss fights, this game is very addictive and very enjoyable to play. I'd very much recommend this game to everyone.			"

												I don't write reviews, but I love this game. If you hate addictive games, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. This game is fantastic, if you're looking for a randomly generated rogue-like go for this game. Everytime you play the game it's very different and theres more depth than it appears. My only complaints is that at certain times there are enemies that can suprise you and instantly kill you...But as long as you play smart it's fine. Maybe in the future we will see a system with maybe a save game and/or endless progression ;D 9/10 (would be 10/10 if certain enemies didn't kill you in one hit ie. freeze/death).			"

												The best way to describe this game is ""Phoned in"". This has  been one of the most cookie cutter, lazy, bland roguelikes I have ever played. I feel like there was barely any effort put into it at all and there are SO many better options for this kind of game out there.For one it has the problem of being at the whim of the RNG. ""You looked through the whole floor and found one piece of gear? Tough luck."". Also the game punishes you for looking in objects for stuff. Every object you search has a chance to spawn in a ton of enemies. All the games mechanics work against you and want you to die so it can laugh at you when you fail.A roguelike needs more the a RNG and a bunch of enemies to be interesting. This game does nothing that other games havent done before. Take the 5 bucks you would have dropped on this and get Dungeons of Dredmor, a GOOD roguelike with some actual effort put into it.			"

												It this was in early access (very early access), I'd say OK. But a full version?The graphics are very basic. The UI is horrible. There is no tutorial nor explanation of anything (I haven't understood how to use skills at all - I played for a knight and slashing always seemed like slashing, no change). The amount of content seems quite low. The pick up button doesn't work quite often, you have to mash it repeatedly, otherwise you leave things behind. There is no story, no characters background.Honestly, I think this game is an attempt to learn how to program. But an entertaining game requires more.			"

Quest of Dungeon doesn’t overcomplicate things like most dungeon crawlers tend to do, everything is straightforward and to the point: you’re in a dungeon, there’s lotsa treasure to find, rooms to explore, monsters to kill and shops to buy from.

This game does a great job of letting you set your own pace while still providing a nice challenge that doesn't take the fun out of the game.

												This is a really great game for a couple of bucks. I have only played the warrior and wizard classes though. I /always/ play melee in games, but I think either the magic user is overpowered, or the warrior is underpowered in this game. I also think money wise it's a little too easy, atleast on normal. I feel like I have an unlimited supply of gold and have no problems buying anything and everything I want in the shops. I should probably play it again on hard. Another thing that is a little upsetting is the game ends so abruptly. You're not given the option to continue or even to finish the floor you're on. Things that would make this game so much better are adding in multiplayer and making the dungeons never ending.I would also like to add that it reminded me a lot of Chocobo's Dungeon, at least the second one (I never played the first).

												I recently received this game as part of a humble bundle, and I'm wishing I had it long ago! I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's a very fun twist on a rogue-like dungeon crawler. Time only progresses when you perform an action or move, so it can be played as quickly or as slowly as need be, plenty of loot and some interesting enemies to keep you on your toes.I love how it not only stays true to the nostalgia of the graphics, but to the difficulty as well. You may cruise through 4 floors and then start to get careless and get 1 shot by running headlong into a boss. 10/10 Highly recommended for anyone who would enjoy a difficult but fun dungeon crawler. (There are lower difficulties, so I imagine it doesn't have to be this difficult, but I'm enjoying it too much to tone it down).May update the review as I log a few more hours			"

			I take a look at the indie turn based RPG Quest of Dungeons. Don't forget to like and subscribe!		

Video review above!Quest of Dungeons is by far worth the price of admission.  Having multiple characters to choose from and procedural generated weapons/dungeons give this game a TON of replayability.  If you are a fan of indie games, turn based RPG's, Rogue-likes, or just 16 bit throwbacks this game is a MUST HAVE!			"

												I was able to get this game for 50% off with a coupon from completing a badge set.  For $2.50, I have really enjoyed this game which is a modern making of a old school dungeon crawler.The graphics are 16-Bit and the music creates a nice ambiance.  The game play is simple, kill mosters, explore dungeons, find some loot, get better gear and skills, and go down to the next dungeon.  Nothing complicated at all. The game doesn't take itself seriously and it the humor throughout the game adds a nice flavor.  My favorite taunt from the monsters is ""The cake is a lie!""Just be warned, this is old school style.  I was exploring the last dungeon before I went up against the final boss when a mage froze me.  While I was frozen, a monster attacked me while the mage kept hitting me with spells.  I died and death is permanent in this game.  I've got to start all over now.			"

												Very reminiscent of older games, Quest of Dungeons is a classic dungeon crawl strategy. Even though it's very simple, it's still a lot of fun, even if you die a handful of times. The negative sides are mostly that a lot of grinding is involved, the game tries too hard to be funny at some points (where it ends up failing), and it's pretty much just Pokemon Mystery Dungeon n'avec pas des Pokemon. But despite that, I'd still give it a 7/10.			"

Features:- randomly generated dungeon floors; 6 or 7 in total, depending on difficulty- 4 playable character classes; Warrior, Assassin, Wizard & Shaman, each with their own spells- 4 difficulty modes; Easy, Normal, Hard & Hell. - a brief statistics report at the end of each game- leaderboards; for those who want to compare with other players- all of the roguelike elements; turn-based, roleplaying, permadeath, lots of items & monsters, bosses, randomly generated floors, quests, ...GameplayQoD offers about 30-60 minutes per game. It plays fast and intuitively and has catchy tunes and sound effects.Goal of the game is to get to the lowest floor (6 or 7), where you can defeat the end-boss and thus winning the game. You gain experience by killing monsters and completing quests as you progress through the floors. Mana and hitpoints (depending on difficulty level) can be regained by either ""wandering around"" (avoiding the word ""exploring"" in this context, because it's effectively possible to replenish mana and health simply by running around in already explored areas), or consuming potions or food. When having explored all of a dungeon floor, your level and equipment will be good enough to proceed to a lower floor with more difficult monsters and boss(es). Magic books can be found in chests and monster-drops, which you can read to learn a new spell. Each spell has a short explanation and is easy to memorize. Every spell has a cooldown period and mana cost. Gold is collected from monster-drops, destroying breakable objects, chests and or selling items at the shopkeeper. Equipment (weapons and armor) can be looted from monsters and bosses, found in chests or bought at the shopkeeper. Quests can be initiated by activating ""quest poles"", scattered around the floors. Basically, there are two kind of straightforward quests: ""search quests""; which require you to locate and collect an object or ""kill <name of boss> quests""; in which you'll have to find the boss' hideout and defeat him. While the overall approach of the game feels rather easy, the bosses can be tricky though... make sure you come well prepared. It's mostly the spell arsenal you possess at the moment that makes the difference between victory or defeat, this especially counts for the battle with the final boss.SummaryFun, fast, easy to learn, easy to master; therefore making QoD an excellent beginner-roguelike, no more-no less. For experienced roguelike-players, this game is simply too basic and too easy to be taken seriously into account. Even the hardest difficulty (Hell) it is fairly easy to beat.  When having achieved a perfect game (100% achievements in 18 hours), you've about had it with the game. For me at least, i can see no further challenge and/or the need to play QoD again (soon), therefore offering little, to none, replay value.My advice: get it if you want an introduction into the roguelike genre or if you're an achievement hunter and want to quickly add 18 achievements and a perfect game to your profile. If you own other roguelikes, play them or search for other ones, but definately skip this one.			"

												I think it would be a very fun game if you didn't have to start over every single time you die. I love everything else about it but that lack of saving and check points really made what would have been an amazing game into a somewhat mediocre game. But, I will give a recommendation in hopes that the developer will add this to the game.			"

												I recently received this game as part of a humble bundle, and I'm wishing I had it long ago! I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's a very fun twist on a rogue-like dungeon crawler. Time only progresses when you perform an action or move, so it can be played as quickly or as slowly as need be, plenty of loot and some interesting enemies to keep you on your toes.I love how it not only stays true to the nostalgia of the graphics, but to the difficulty as well. You may cruise through 4 floors and then start to get careless and get 1 shot by running headlong into a boss. 10/10 Highly recommended for anyone who would enjoy a difficult but fun dungeon crawler. (There are lower difficulties, so I imagine it doesn't have to be this difficult, but I'm enjoying it too much to tone it down).May update the review as I log a few more hours			"

			I take a look at the indie turn based RPG Quest of Dungeons. Don't forget to like and subscribe!		

Video review above!Quest of Dungeons is by far worth the price of admission.  Having multiple characters to choose from and procedural generated weapons/dungeons give this game a TON of replayability.  If you are a fan of indie games, turn based RPG's, Rogue-likes, or just 16 bit throwbacks this game is a MUST HAVE!			"

												Interesting game in the Rogue-like category.  7/10Overall, the game is worthy of several fun hours of play, and quite a lot of replayability.   Simple gameplay, with simple graphics, and rules with basic rogue strategies.   The downside right now as on release, is the GUI.  It could benefit greatly from an overhaul, as there is a lacking of hotkeys, along with cluttered inventory management.  Spell, and Skill selection consists of several mouseclicks to use, so setting up defenses, buffs, and attacks is a matter of 5 to 20 mouseclicks of manually selecting.    Also, was the lacking of passing time by standing still, which from a strategic POV, hinders you in battle if there is 1 square difference between you and a foe.  Even on Easy mode, there was a large gap in learning curve between dungeon levels.  Almost as if it could use a tad bit more game balancing for one or two classes.If you can get past some of the quirks, then it can lead to many hours of play.  Be warned, its a true roguelike, with perma death, so it may not be everyones cup of tea.   Its a simple battle of attrition to outlast each subsequent adventure.			"

												If you're looking for a great pick up and play RPG, this is it. Quick to the point, simplistic, intuitive controls (eventually found myself playing with a single hand: movement+attack).Don't let the comedic relief fool you, this game is unforgivingly hard. If you're a casual gamer like me who's never played a perma-death game before, be prepared to watch yourself die and try, try again! BUT THAT'S THE BEAUTY. This game is simplisticly addictive you'll find yourself playing multiple playthroughs of just one character for hours. Replayability stacks even more between the 4 classes and 4 difficulties.			"

												I recently got a 66% off coupon for this game and thought ""what the heck, I have nothing better to do with my life"", so i bought it for a little over a dollar.After playing the Binding Of Isaac i thought already knew what tricks games like this had to offer. My first time playing i chose the warrior class and spawned in a room with a vase and a sign with a skull on it, me being my curious self, decided to click the sign, it killed me instantly. I started another playthough extremely confused and i clicked the sign again, died instantly.10/10 Insta-kill death sign.Actual ReviewQuest of Dungeons is a game that doesn't require much skill to play as it is a point-and-click dungeon explorer, however, that does not mean it is an easy game nor is it a short game, the goal is to make it to the end of a certain amount of floors (seven I think?) and beat the final boss. You play the game in turns so everytime you move one square, attack or use a consumable that counts as a turn and your enemies can move or attack you in that time. On my first actual playthrough on the easy difficulty it took me about an hour and a half to get to floor 5 after exploring every single room and doing all of the quests, i had some of the best gear i could find when i went up against the boss of the floor, got cocky and didn't drink a potion, he killed me, again that was on easy the difficulty goes up to hell.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good roguelike game that allows them to just sit down, relax and click the left mouse button.TL:DR Simple concept, fun game.

												If you haven't played roguelikes before, maybe this game has something for you (albeit something that you could get in better quality somewhere else). But if you're at all familiar with roguelikes, just don't bother. This game lacks any real depth or strategy. Enemy behavior patterns are drop-dead simple and can be trivially abused (if even boss-monsters don't know how to chase you around a one-square obstruction without making mistakes and going the wrong way sometimes, expectations have to be set pretty low). Monsters don't have different speeds, or different pursuit-patterns, or even different immunities (even skeletons and slimes and golems and vampires and, yes, boss-monsters can be made to sleep with 100% success); they DO occasionally have different ranges and special-attacks, but that's it. It doesn't feel like an effort was made to have the treasure progression make sense; a few floors into the dungeon, you can sell inferior gear for thousands of gold, but the increasingly high-quality gemstones you find are still hovering between 10 and 20 apiece, which means the only reason you would pick them up is to make sure there's not another item hidden beneath them. Selection of gear could have been interesting, but this is another missed opportunity; few pieces of gear provide any stats other than the primary stat always provided by the gear-slot, meaning that choosing the best gear means just picking the highest number rather than making meaningful strategic tradeoffs. Any difficulty comes purely from the fact that some boss-monsters or special attacks can remove half of your health or more, but that's okay because if you know anything about tactics in roguelikes you don't have to let them attack you at all, if you play a ranged character and have patience.Graphically, the game delivers on everything its trailers promise. There's good variety in learnable skills, incorporating status effects and areas of effect in ways that would force you to make meaningful strategic decisions, if not for the homogeneity and simplicity of the threats you face. The music is varied and enjoyable enough and fits well with the game's themes. Overall, the game's production values feel decent for its price-- except for the deep, gaping hole where game-design and strategic challenge should be. Long story short, if you're a halfway-experienced roguelike player, you can jump into this game on its hardest difficulty, win on your first or second run, and have no reason to go back, as was my experience. With all of the noteworthy competitors in this genre, don't waste your time.			"

The turn-based gameplay will make you think about your next move and has the added benefit of not overwhelming us old farts before we have a chance to react to sinister and menacing things as they occur.  To top that off, the price is more than fair for the content being delivered, especially since you can easily pump ten plus hours into this game.  Great for casual and hardcore gamers alike, “Quest of Dungeons” is the perfect coffee break dungeon crawler.""Full Review:  http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/quest-of-dungeons/First Impressions Video:

												PLEASE DONT BUY THIS GAME AT ANY PRICE!  NOT EVEN WORTH $0.50 WHEN ON SALE!If you need to know why feel free to read on...Horrible.  Turn based RPGs may be my favorite thing ever but this....  Beat it in an hour an a half and enjoyed about the first 10-15 minutes.  I have NEVER uninstalled a game so fast (not an exaguration I've play hundreds of games and it was a first).  It is clear that ZERO effort went in to this game.  I almost never write reviews but when a game is this bad you just need to.  I will list just a few of the billion complaints I can think of.1.  There are like 8 floors and I got every skill in the game for my class (yes EVERY SKILL) by half way through THE FIRST FLOOR.  Every skill book there after was pawned off for lots of gold which I don't understand cause they are worth like 200 pieces of chicken but I turn over a rock and 3 of these books come tumbeling out.2.  Balance is non-existent.  I only played one class but with how horrible the game is won't try the others.  The shamens first skill will kill almost anything anything by itself.  Goen are the days are combining skills with other skills for cool combos cause hell I can just use Terror and they wont attack for like 7 turns!  How my severaly underleveled shamen was able to scare death (the final boss) over and over, shank him repteadly and then when he would wake up put him to sleep (probably the most combo esque thing i ever did) while I wait for terror to come off cooldown in 3 more turns is beyond me.3.  Enemies are all the same.  Almost every enemy is exactly the same.  They move the same but have different health and damage ratings.  All they do is melee.  A few guys shoot but those are the only other type and they just act the same as eachother.  I dont remember if bosses were the same as I would just ♥♥♥♥ing fear/sleep lock them (and set them on fire for fun).4.  First floor i explored everything.  2nd and 3rd I was bored and just wnated it to end but figured if I dint at leats get the items the bosses and merchents had I would have no chance.  OH HOW WRONG I WAS!  See I guess there were 8 floors in my first complaint but I honeslty don't know because I would enter a floor and leave it for the next one just a few turns later.  Sure the enemies were much more powerful then me after I did this like 3 times but I guess I can just be glad the Vampire Lords and Mummies are so afraid of me that they can't even attack.  Oh and did I mention potions?  The best health/mana restore items stack and take only 1 turn to use!  Gj almost one shotting me Death due tot he fact that I skipped 6 floors!  *sleeps then heals to full health*5.  But items are procedurelly generated like levels!  It is like borderlands!  that is cool right!?  NO!!!!!!!!  They have random stats and random names.  The only procedurale thing about them is the names vaguly remind me of the way you might put english words together and the damage values tend to be hiigher on later floors (that requires a very advanced algorithum you know!).  I did love the VERY RARE stat adjustments on items though!  Wait what?  What do you mean there is no way to tell what any of the stats do!?I could go on but honeslty I feel like if I havnt convinced you not to buy it (and if you already bought at least dont install and/or play it as it isnt even worth that) yet then you probably were going to buy it no matter what you read hear.  Cheers!			"

Quest of Dungeons is a traditional roguelike game in which the Dark Lord has stolen all the light and it is up to you to venture down into the dungeon and defeat him to reclaim it. While the premise doesn’t seem to offer anything significantly original, how well does it stack up against other recent roguelike’s and what exactly does it offer compared to others?Hope this helps detail the goods and bads of this game and helps you make the best choice you can. :)			"

If you are a veteran DCSS player,  you will end up posting a review about the developer being a ""poor designer"".Bonus points for having full controller support. Loses points for having ""music"" so repetitive I wanted to turn it off in less than 5 minutes of playing the game.			"

												Quest of Dungeons is a wonderful, incredibly simplistic and enjoyable roguelike. It doesn't do anything I'd consider incredibly original, but what it has is polished (mostly) and addictive. For the price, I'd certainly recommend it to fans of the genre.			"

												For a ROGUE style game that has been modernized I have enjoyed it quite a bit.  This is a hack and slash type adventure as opposed to a rollplaying game. I would give it 4 out of 5 stars maybe even 4.5. With the current BATA they have added a second dungeon and a random dungeon generator. One of the the things I think the maps could benifit from is secert doors. I find the ballance of the game is good for the most part the only issue I have found is that sometimes it will place a boss right at the begining of the first floor which is hard on first levelers. I also like the fact that you can encounter your non winning characters as ghosts. I hope this helps.			"

If you are looking for a quick dungeon crawl that you can knock out for a fix, then it is about the best and the humor is pretty good, too.			"

												This game is the only game i love and hate.Basically this is a rouguelike game which you play as one of the four characters and complete a dungeon with multiple floors. Sounds easy right? No. For some reason the ""easy"" difficulty is harder than most games i find difficult to play. You get two-shotted by bosses on Normal mode and the only good character is the ranged one because they can't directly attack you from afar unless they are mages or archers themselves. You spend two hours on a regular run and you probably won't finish the game in this time because you die by the bosses since a crit does like 60% of your HP for some reason- and in higher difficulties a crit would end your run.Do i reccomend this game? Yes, it's so much fun. But only if you don't mind having to start over again. Basic combat that everyone can understand sounds horrible, but it's actually not that bad as it looks on paper and fits the game very well. The graphics are very nice for a pixely game and the music really gives a nice ambience, even while it sounds so... stupid?Trust me, you will spend an hour, die, probably not play the game again for a couple of hours or even a day and do another attempt on it the next day. You will try your *ss off so hard that you will ragequit over and over again, but you still want to see that booty when you finish the game. You will get really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when you open a door and a boss shoots at you or uses magic at you and crits you, making you lose the game. But you will come back. And you will pick the archer 90% of the time since you hate the other guys being f*cking more hardcore than hardcore hardcore. You will deny your gf for sex because you you are so far playing this game and you haven't died yet...Buy it.. Buy it now.. Finish the game for us so you can save our souls..			"

												So many bad design choices piled on top of one another. It might as well roll a dice to determine how far you progress. I really wish there were other alternatives to just hitting the monsters. When you don't have spells that is all you can do and when you do have spells you run out of mana and have to just hit them. You can't run away, you can't keep them at bay unless the stars have aligned and you happen to get a spell book. Overall I would not recommend this game unless they do some serious rebalancing of the game.			"

												As much as I would love to give a positive review, because it is a fantastic game. Even just the beginning is funny. But the whole game is always about: find one thing or kill that boss.Speaking of boss... Why so hard? You need to go farm the floor after just to get a few more levels before facing the boss of the prievious floor. Why?Melee characters are weak as fuuu compared to mage and rogue. Even rogue gets super weak very fast. I managed to get floor 8 with the wizard and died of a boss which was right at the door and managed a single lucky crit. Also, I don't know for the others, I had nearly one million gold before I died, and I never had anythingt good in shop beside once or twice I got a doom key (which are kinda rare) Otherwise, I always got mana potions because the mana regen ridiculously slow.Monsters in general are relatively easy to beat other than some floors where the difficulty increase very quickly (I think of floor 5 I think with the vampires)There is too many little things that irks me. It could definenately be better. Like some others said, there are better roguelike games out there. This one is decent but do not expect too much. It is only fun once you get the twist and to waste time. Nothing else (could be a mobile game, that would be a lot better.)			"

												Quest of Dungeons lacks basic functionality that should be included in every modern roguelike.1. Wait until healedOptimal (non-speedrun) play requires you to wait until health, mana and cooldowns are restored. But since there is only a command for waiting a single turn, you have to press the Enter-key a hundred times after each battle for optimal play.2. Stop moving when encountering an enemyWhen using the mouse the character keeps moving no matter what happens. It will even try to pathfind-dance around enemies for several turns, instead of stopping.3. Auto-explore (optional)Auto-explore is a nice feature found in many modern roguelikes. It speeds up the process of searching through the last corners of every level, putting more focus on more interesting stuff (loot and tactical battles).			"

												This game doesn't even pretend to be balanced from the start. My first run I tried out the archer who can hit anything he can see while they slowly creep towards him. As soon as I figured that out, I never got hit again. The most difficult part of being an archer is finding shopkeepers to sell all your loot so your inventory isn't full anymore. Not that you need any loot, all you need is  the sleep spell, which as far as I can tell puts anything you want to sleep such that it cannot act until you kill it, which is how i beat every boss.I played again as the warrior to see what it'd be like to play something that couldn't just kill everything before taking damage. I still quickly became a god, though I had to use health potions at first. Luckily I found the warrior's version of ""sleep"" within the first 5 minutes. Only this version is an AoE shout wth a 95% success rate which paralyzes everything until you kill it. However, this time I did not succeed on my playthrough. This time I walked into a room and was promptly frozen by some random non-boss mob, I couldn't move or heal or do anything but watch it slowly kill me after hitting me several times. As far as I can tell, there is a random mob who can instantly kill you from any range no matter how strong you are. The only thing you can do is not be unlucky, or just play an archer.I didn't try the other two classes, but if they don't both have the ability to at least instantly kill everyboss for free then they are severely underpowered. If you still feel compelled to play this, probably try either the mage of the druid (though im sure the mage has something and wouldn't be surprized if the druid did all the same.)The only thing I liked about this game were the graphics. That's actually what drew me to play again, something about them I us find very appealing. Even though the gameplay is terrible, at least it's fast paced enough such that if you don't think about it it's still kinda fun. I would however suggest you move along after looking at the screen shots.			"

												This is probably the best graphical roguelike I have ever played. The controls are intuitive by default, and can be customized to one's liking (I recommend setting mouse clicks to ""attack only"" in the options menu).While the themes and enemies on each floor are static, the layouts are randomly generated and you will never encounter the same layout twice. Most enemies rely on typical run-and-melee tactics, however they can hit pretty hard if you go to a new floor unprepared.Gameplay is slick and seamless between floors.Worth your time.			"

I decided to try for the archer and I'm not winning there either so this game is certainly challenging regardless of which difficulty is chosen.The loot is definately varient too, sometimes you get poor loot and sometimes you get fantastic loot while the dungeons themselves are always different which is fantastic, you never get the same map no matter how much you play.

												The interface doesn't work properly on a modern system (greater than last decades 1080p format).   The old video/mouse draw issue that occurs when developers don't bother with fancy big budget stuff like ""Testing"" and ""QA"", whatever that is.Technical problems hammer the nail into the coffin of a low effort, derivative RPG ripoff.   It's got retro pixel graphics (art is hard, don't try!  Mediocrity will still get sales!), 2D overhead gameplay (the 1980's called, want their video gaming technology back, etc). Basically a typical low effort indy cash grab with no compelling gameplay draws.   You'd be better off playing any one of the free MMOs on Steam (and save yourself a little cash, too!).			"

												On the plus side, everything pretty much ""just works"", the basic control scheme works well with mouse or mouse+keyboard, it's well put together, there are no nasty immersion-destroying surprises anywhere. It's pretty cheap. It's a pretty small download, and launches very quickly, and uses mimimal CPU and pretty low RAM. And it works on Linux and Mac as well as Windows.On the minus side, everything else. I can't imagine why anyone would recommend this game unless they'd never played another roguelike—and if you've never played a roguelike, there are much better ones to start with, including free ones, so don't buy this one and inflict it on other people. This is basically a roguelike, minus all the things that make roguelikes fun. I'm not expecting every game to be Nethack or Zangband, but it should at least have as much depth as the original Rogue, or why waste your time?There are effectively two kinds of monsters: the ones you can kill without blinking, and the ones you can't possibly beat head-to-head, but can kill 100% of the time if you circle around an obstacle (or make a bigger circle with teleporters or stairs) healing after each blow. And, since there are no status effects and no actions besides attack and 9 skills/class that you will mostly not use, that's pretty much all there is to the tactics.As for larger strategy--well, there is none. Min/maxing your character is as impossible as it is pointless—yes, there are a ton of stats, but you can't even _see_ them, much less influence them, whatever they do is opaque and largely undiscoverable, and they don't even seem to affect the game much anyway. Exploration is straightforward, because there are no real choices—there's always exactly one path between any pair of rooms, no cycles anywhere; there are no wide vs. narrow corridors, or different kinds of entrances to deal with; the only real difference between any room and any other room that matters is whether they have something to circle around or not. I suppose there are keys, and sometimes you won't have the key you need, but it's not like the key will be somewhere interesting on the level (which would at least make it as complex as Doom…); you just have to slog your way back through the previous levels hoping one of the shopkeepers will have randomly gotten the key you want, so that's just annoying, not challenging.Beyond the basic control scheme, some things are incredibly tedious (like selling most of your inventory to a shopkeeper—mouse to the item, click, mouse to the Sell button, click, repeat 30 times). There are some keyboard shortcuts, but not for any of the parts where you'd want them.Also, the graphics aren't really ""16-bit"", except for the title screen. Yes, the tiles are the same resolution as late-80s sprites. But they aren't particularly SNES-looking, or inspired in any way. And they're just static tiles; you don't get the cheesy step animation, multi-level parallax scrolling, different-sized sprites on the same screen, palette animation, or other effects that define the 16-bit look. What it _does_ look like is one of the early tilesets for the old roguelikes—and if you want that, you can play one of those games.Also, while the game does a pretty good job keeping its resource use low, on a laptop with switchable GPUs (at least on Mac or Windows) it'll force you onto the discrete GPU and burn through battery power anyway. Not the developer's fault (I'm sure it runs just fine on a typical Intel integrated GPU, but both OS's are overzealous about switching…), but still a shame.			"

												It combines two successful genres and manages to still be a bad game. It has the monotony of bad dungeon crawlers paired with the permanent deaths of roguelikes resulting in a boring game that you will have to grind through each time you start over. It's really dull, there's no clear cut objectives or incentives to really do anything. Occasionally you'll get a quest but all the quests  I've encountered have pretty much been ""Find X room in a randomly generated map."" So, yeah, the quests are basically hide and seek, usually finding an item or killing a boss.The weapon and armor system, class and combat systems are all a joke. Just the most generic randomly generated garbage being offered to you. Whether you're a knight or a mage, the combat is still the most generic and lackluster thing ever. Like, it's really hard to find a dungeon crawler that has exceptionally boring combat as that's the case with pretty much all dungeon crawlers, but this game just feels the worst out of anything I've ever played.The end result is a game where you walk around in circles and fight random monsters. Sometimes you find stairs to go a new room to walk around in circles in. There's no incentive to do anything. You don't really change except getting slightly higher stat numbers and occasionally new abilities that don't really amount to much. The fact that this is being sold for $5 is an insult. This doesn't even feel like a game, it feels like a school project that someone didn't finish and got a D+ on. If you're a fan of dungeon crawlers don't even bother with this.			"

												Very tedious gameplay.  Getting through the game even on easy can end up being based entirely on luck, especially with the shaman and warrior classes.  It's possible to kill every monster, complete every quest, and acquire all weapons/armor along the way and still end up getting one-hit killed by bosses.  Which suggests using skills should tip the battle in your favor so you don't get critted, but if you're unlucky your skills won't hit with their special effects, and then you're hosed.The weapon/armor system is pretty stupid too.  You constantly receive ""cracked"" and ""broken"" items.  I don't actually recall seeing an adjective that implies the item is in good condition.  There's no correlation to how 'cool' the item looks and how much it helps you.  You might be wearing a blood sword one minute and find a wooden stick that's +25 damage the next.  It makes no sense at all.The differences between easy and hell modes are pretty much nonexistent.  As others have said,  you  can just outrun your enemies until you heal/gain mana/ etc.  You can also lure  enemies on  to traps, so if you're out of mana and don't want to risk being attacked, you can just lure them onto traps over and over and over again until they die.

												There seems to be a lot of games that think themselves stylish and cool when they make a ""Roguelike"" game like this....im here to tell you its not fun or interesting.  This game is as binary and dumbed down as a game can get as far as a dungeon crawler is concerned.  To me it felt more like a game you'd buy on a phone not a Steam game.  You walk your character into enemies and either they kill you or you kill them....eat what little food you have and if you are unlucky enough to stumble onto a boss room you are pretty much dead no matter what.   Theres no way to close a door or make a boss activate a trap and gain an advantage its either you are stocked up on large heals or you are dead. When i think of Roguelike games i expect difficulty but i also want experience and skill to also play a part in how well i do.  This game is almost entirely based on luck and nothing else and it irritates me that you just need to repetedly die until you get the right amount of luck for you to even have a chance of a ""good run"" to start.I was looking for a deep fun RPG roguelike and what i got was a tablet game for kids.

												The interface doesn't work properly on a modern system (greater than last decades 1080p format).   The old video/mouse draw issue that occurs when developers don't bother with fancy big budget stuff like ""Testing"" and ""QA"", whatever that is.Technical problems hammer the nail into the coffin of a low effort, derivative RPG ripoff.   It's got retro pixel graphics (art is hard, don't try!  Mediocrity will still get sales!), 2D overhead gameplay (the 1980's called, want their video gaming technology back, etc). Basically a typical low effort indy cash grab with no compelling gameplay draws.   You'd be better off playing any one of the free MMOs on Steam (and save yourself a little cash, too!).			"

												Oh man, where to begin.A very decent game I'd like to think. I started to play it a while ago and once I got another game I didn't play it for a while.I came back to it thinking I hadn't played in a while and I've now sank hours and hours into this game trying to get further and further with it, failing with the paladin, haha. I decided to try for the archer and I'm not winning there either so this game is certainly challenging regardless of which difficulty is chosen.The loot is definately varient too, sometimes you get poor loot and sometimes you get fantastic loot while the dungeons themselves are always different which is fantastic, you never get the same map no matter how much you play.

(spiders, bats skeletons, etc.)-No progression system, meaning every death results in a complete restart, with no rewards for progressing.-No mods as of yet for other recent pixel art games such as shovel knight and towerfall ascention.- No multiplayer, local or online.Final Verdict:6.6/10 The foundation of this indie game could be built upon to be something truely exceptional, but as of right now, they ran out of money or something, and it's a good game, but not a truely great one.

To be clear, there is only one dungeon and multiple quests, a more accurate title would be 'Dungeon of Quests'.  That aside this little rogue style dungeon crawler gives you the option of player one of four characters to delve deep into a hostile environment filled with monsters but also loot!The art holds the theme well but the lack of animations is a weakness for the overall product.  Monsters are varied and the simple quests drive you to explore each floor thoroughly.  Character advancement lacks depth with skills being acquired by loot drops instead of a leveling path.It's simple, straightforward, and does exactly what it sets out to do.  There are bigger more indepth games of this genre out there but the simplicity here actually makes this game fill a niche for when just a taste of a rogue like is all that's desired.			"

												I really want to like this game, but I simply can not adjust to the control scheme.  It is awkward and uncomfortable, as it forces you to use both the mouse and keyboard although it feels like you shouldn't as their functions overlap.  Good graphics, fun character choices, decent game really but I cannot get past the controls for some reason, it just never ""clicks"" and feels unnatural to me.  It all boils down to gameplay in the end.			"

												Arbitrary, lacklustre, and boring. Every floor, the mechanics are the exact same - same keys, door, quest, loot, destructible types. Every monster acts the same, can move only one tile (which makes any strategy void, as you can kite anything till your health, cooldown, mana, et cetera recharges) and uses no strategy, not even using range advantage well. There are only regular monsters which are downright boring and uninspired, and never pose a challenge (and only about 2 or 3 types per floor) and boss monsters, which are variations of the same monsters. Either you take them on and hope you have high enough equipment/stats to beat them (using a few spells when available) or you just kite them and use the health regen/cooldown system ad nauseam. That's it. That is the entire game. Nothing more. Despite the low price, I actually feel cheated out of my 2 euro's. Would definitely not recommend.			"

												The most unique ""feature"" of this generic rogue-like is that your character always starts off standing beside a sign. In normal, sane games like this, you can read the sign for basic controls and such. But in this game, clicking on the sign instantly kills you. The sign doesn't actually say anything. The game doesn't explain what happened. It isn't a brutal early lesson about examining things carefully before risking your character - there's no trap or curse on the sign, it just kills you for NO REASON. Other rogue-likes are prettier, have better interfaces and while they may be random and unforgiving, aren't STUPID like this game.			"

												I can't really say this is a bad game, but I can't say I like it either. I feel that it lacks any real character of its own; the random qoutes that the enemies say are mostly well placed, but some of them don't fit into the game at all. I found the 'The princess is in another dungeon' qoute laughable, but something like 'you should have taken the blue pill' didn't make sense. I know what it's from, but how does that coincide with this game?Another big thing was, no matter how I went about it, I was always killed by something rather stupid. Being hit by a status effect I didn't even know was on me, or be it that stupid sign at the first floor, these deathes were unjustified.If this game were to change these sort of things, and scale things better, so I don't run into over powered quest bosses on the second floor, then I'd certainly reccomend this, but as it is, I wouldn't reccomend it to any of my friends.

												Immediate problems with controls. Clicking anywhere means you run to that location, with no way of stopping it if you misclicked and a boss is coming after your booty.Keyboard controls aren't very viable for ranged characters, and it's much easier to use the mouse in this case, but you again run into the aforementioned misclicking problem.Objects like traps can't be clicked on for context menus. Though you can disarm a trap by running over it, it's more of a save roll than an actual attempt to disarm.Item drops and money are very sketchy. Most of the drops are crap, as is somewhat expected, but then at the same time, you'll get stupid overpowered items more than seems likely. Money drops in 10-40, while items start off in the 2000s range.All in all, this is the worst roguelike I've ever played. Don't waste your money. There are a handful of better ones on the steam store, most of them for the same price these days.			"

												Linux users: on my setup (fedora with gnome 3.x, noveau and bumblebee) game crashed few times, mostly during minimizing and switching between apps, but not limited to those cases.As this game tries to appear oldschool, I will review it as oldschool one. First of all, gameplay sucks. I played a lot of dungeon crawlers, and simply this one has nothing good in it. There is no character development - you will gain experience that will level you up, but you have no infuence on how it affect your hero. There are spells - a few for each character class - and some of them are overpowered, others aren't usable at all. The gameplay is too simple; what is fun in such games is finding best strategies, finding weakness in different enemies, and constant threat, but there aren't any of them. All this makes this game too easy. What is more - design should be kept fully oldschool. Although i like style everything is made, the animation of dying monsters is terrible. Imagine this: everything is made of really, really BIG pixels, yet, when monster dies, there is animation of rotating and rescaling it, showing full potential and resolution of your display. It just doesn't suit there. To sum up, if you want to play good dungeon-crawler, choose something else - good alternatives are for example Desktop Dungeons, or Dungeons of Dredmor. They will give you much more fun.			"

												27 04 14 update: With the additon of keyboard controls for ranged combat I'm changing this review to a thumbs up from a thumbs down. There's still rough edges but the game is heading in the right direction.Things are changing so fast that I've tried to reduce my review to a set of bad points and then marking them when they are fixed. This way people can see what the original release was like and what steps the dev has taken so far to rectify the situation.The game itself doesn't teach you how to play or tell you the controls.[FIXED] No manual[FIXED] You can't redefine the keyboard controlsWith keyboard you can only pickup from square you're on not around you like mouseStairs are bump to go up or down themMap gen can block rooms with stairs[FIXED] you can bump to smash pots and things, but you can't bump chests to open them or bump little grave like things that give quests or bump shopkeepers to begin trading.Have to use the mouse to examine objects in your inventory and to use them.[FIXED] Unclear where the hotspot of the pointer actually is.You have to click on items to see their stats. Tooltip would be better[FIXED] Have to use the mouse pointer for ranged combat[FIXED] When you open the minimap it obscures the middle of the screen. would be better top right cornerWhen you damage a mob, its lowered hp doesn't show on its hp bar until after it's taken its next turn Resting gives you hp and mp back but there's no rest until full option. You can hit skip a turn (enter) but that doesn't auto repeat, so you would have to spam it far too many times (I'm talking hundreds of times). The best way to get your hp and mp back after fights is to run from side to side of a dungeon over and over againAlso above means that in boss encounters you can just kite melee bosses in a square and take no damage. Giving bosses diagonal attacks would solve this but would make them a lot harder so it's probably not something you would want to do.[FIXED]  movement keys auto-repeat almost immediately which I think he's done so people can treat it as a real time game although it's turn-based. This leads to moving twice when you only wanted to move once though.			"

												complete waste of time and money.  Unless you like a game where you spend hours just moving forward and the developer then throws in an enemy that arbitrarily one-hits you, or a goblin robs you of 500+ gold when it took more than one level to even EARN that much.  Where having food or potions is meaningless because taking one just postpones the next death from blows doing more damage than is healed, and more than half of your own attacks are just dodged.  Not to mention portals that take you ALL the way to the other side of the same room.  The game is not fun, just petty.			"

												This game is boring, uninspired, and poorly thought out. I get it, it's a rogue-like/retro/classic RPG with a snarky attitude. It's also just plain bad. The original ""Rogue"" and its character based followers are superior to this game in every respect. But I'm not going to try to wax poetic about why this game stinks. Let me just give a clear list of points that illustrate, very plainly, why this game is deeply flawed.1. You and everything else have the same move speed. That means that you each move (or preform one action such as attack, open door, drink potion, etc) per turn. The problem with this system is that when you are facing a fight you know, mathematically speaking, you cannot win, you may as well just restart the game then and there. Why? Because you aren't going to be able to out damage what you're fighting and you cannot run away either. Because everything else has the same movement speed, anything that you fight will follow one space behind you... forever. They will chase you through the entire dungeon, always one space behind you (did I mention there is no actual animation in this game either. Just sprites moving along in linear motions along a grid? Yeah. Even NES RPGs had some semblance of animation, but not this ""retro"" release. But I digress) and when you stop, guess what? You're gonna get hit and die. 2. Health and Mana slowly regenerate on a per turn basis. What this means is that after you've cleared a room, you can just spam WASD (moving one space=one turn) and pace around for a little while, to get your health back. It will regenerate to full, if you are patient enough. It doesn't take long enough to be a great nuisance to do, but it's not so quick either that it's not annoying. The main issue with this though is that it completely makes the inventory system, complete with food, health and mana potions, totally useless. You don't need to drink or eat anything because you'll always just be able regain health and energy after you've completed a room. As for actually using the potions and such in combat? That too isn't really practical because anything that you're fighting that you'd need to drink a potion for is going to kick your♥♥♥♥♥regaurdless of how much you drink. That's the biggest problem in this game. You're either gauranteed success or failure the moment you walk into a room. Either way it's just as boring.3. The actual combat is really boring. For the wizard you're always going to be better off using your spells but your mana runs out. But, again, that doesn't really matter because you can just walk around for about a hundred turns (so about 20 seconds) to get all the mana and health you lost back. The knight is just awful. All you can do is hit stuff and then let it hit you, walk around, get back health, repeat.I think I've made my points very clear. There are still a few bugbears though. For example, there are bear traps scattered throughout some of the rooms. Why? No reason. The player can easily avoid them, the enemies can't knock the player into them nor can the player use them to his advantage. Why are they there? No clue, but it's just a little aspect that really shows how little thought, effort, play testing, and just plain common sense went into this game.This is an absolutely boring, cliched, uninspired game that still somehow thinks it has the right to mock the player on death (such as flashing ""Seriously?"" and ""Let's just pretend this never happened"" in red when the player dies) and ask ""leaving so soon"" when trying to quit the game. Yes, I am leaving and I will not be returning. If this were just a little flash game on Newgrounds or whatever, I'd take it as a budding game maker spreading his wings and getting his barings in. But charging actual money, no matter how little, is rediculous. Take those couple of bucks this game costs, go to a McDonalds, and get something to eat off the dollar menu. Trust me, that alone will give you far more joy and satisfaction than this game ever could.1/5, the only redeeming value is that the music is not totally♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												  I expected more from this game.  The item stats and names were pointless and stupid, respectively.  There is zero strategy involved.  Just click on things.  You really only have to manage one stat, your hp, and if you play as an assassin you don't need to worry about that either.    I played this game for 3.8 hrs, but most of it was spent staring blankly and thinking ""is this really it?""  And then I won.  I've purchased games that I regretted before, but this is the first time I felt the need to warn others off of one.			"

												The game is Random... not Rogue-Like. Rogue-like games are challenging and death comes often. This game is stupidly easy and has no business being called a rogue-like.Random creatures? Yep, the game has them. Of course, none of them are ever a threat to your character so whether they're random or all the same doesn't matter. Bosses are about the only thing that require any thought or effort (and the ones I met still never came close to killing me - they just required the use of skills).Random dungeons? Sort of. Yes, the dungeons are random, but they ALL follow the exact same pattern of hub and spokes. If you go out a 'spoke' you won't find any way to connect to the spokes next to it - except by going back to the hub.  You will NEVER find a circular route.  So, explore north, come back to the middle along the same path, explore east, come back to the middle along the same path, explore south, etc. You will NEVER find a path that connects from center to north to east back to center.  A forced path would have been better - at least that way your not spending half your time covering ground you've already covered.Gems aren't worth picking up. Their value is just too much lower than the equipment you find. If you're looking for a rogue-like.. keep looking. If you're looking for a game that requires almost no thought to stay alive.. this might be for you.			"

												This game honestly took me about 3-4 deaths to figure out that it was turn-based.  Most of the enemies aren't too bad, but bosses are much more difficult.  Spamming arrows as an archer only works for a few turns before a boss is already on you, and then you're dead in about 5-6 turns, depending on how many potions you have at your disposal.  The pixel graphics are okay, but they could be better.  Enemies are pretty standard, including bats, skeletons, and vampires.  Nothing special and there are better rogue-likes out there.			"

Upon further research I found out that the game was ported from Android and was primarily designed for that platform. Don't waste your time rogue like fans.			"

												Short lived beautiful little game.  There's an achievement for beating the game in 30 minutes.  Well I feel a little slow because it took me 2 hours or so.  Content wise the game is good for about 6 run throughs.  First run to figure out wtf you're doing.  1 run per character (4) and then a final run to try the hardest difficulty.  That last run... may be more than 1 run...Graphics are exactly what they seem like.  SNES style.Controls need a little tweaking.  The default settings can get you in trouble so be sure to look over the options if you're thinking ""oh why wouldn't they do it this way instead"" cause you can :-P and they did! sort of...Sound I actually really did enjoy the music.  The sound effects feel pulled right out of SNES as they intended but the music feels golden age PS1.Story is... well it is present... technically.  They make some jokes and it's pretty good.Overall I liked this game.  Got a few days out of it for 3$ on sale.  I'm very happy with my purchase.Sidenote: all classes are equally inferior to the assassin.			"

- Quest of Dungeons -OpinionGreat dungeon crawler! The difficulty level is high and this game will punish you if you don't take it seriously. Since it’s a rouge-like, or perma-death, you start with a new character each game. Cons/Changes id like to seeThere are only four characters. Also they should have called the assassin an archer and just added rouge in place of the assassin (just my opinion). The classic character classes are covered, but I’d like to see more. Possibly characters rewarded for beating bosses (reaching a lower floor) or a character tree for each class that unlocks the more you play. You could add strengths balanced by weaknesses to fine tune the character (basically character creation).  All in all this game is amazing, and I would have happily paid more for it. Give it a try!

												If I am to describe this game, I'd say that Quest of Dungeons is charming in its simplicity. Gameplay is turn based, very laconic and, therefore, easy to get used to, but I think that this game still has enough diversity to keep you entertained. You have four characters (actually five, but the last one is unlocked after you've beaten the game for the first time), and due to unique skills each one of them has from the start and can learn later from the books, they are all different and playable in their own way. The dungeon you are to go through has seven floors with randomly located bosses, and, of course, the final boss in the end, but it is your choice - to thoroughly explore each floor or rush through them as fast as you can. There are also locked doors and locked chests that will require one of five types of key (or even two keys at once!), but some things are designed to make your life easier - like the hidden stashes you can find by just walking through a room, or fountains that can be used once and restore your life or mana. Another classic element - merchants, who can buy treasures you find and sell you potions, keys and armor/weapons. Of course, there are minuses. One of them is the quest system - there are only two types of quest, ""find something"" or ""kill the champion version of the regular mob"", and doing them is nothing but boring. Another minus is that, for me, the game was pretty easy, even on Hell difficulty. Still, overall I found it an enjoyable little piece, and for its price I would recommend it to anyone, even to those who are not familiar with roguelite games. It's simple, it's accessible, it looks cute and it can be great for killing your time.			"

												I really like the concept of this game. It is very simple, yet it has some strategy aspects to it. After playing for a short time, the only thing I would suggest to add more replayability is to add some sort of purpose for doing these dungeons. Maybe a store to spend your total points gained at the end of completing a level/dying in a level. This could be for extra attack damage or something during your next run. Or make specific class 'mastery' systems or something similar. As of right now, it just seems pointless to run dungeons and get nothing from it except a 'score' which is just to compare with friends. I, however, do not have many friends that play these types of games, so it's just for a personal best (of sorts). This, I am not a fan of.			"

												IDK who these people are who say this game isn't roguelike. It's a turn-based dungeon crawler with permadeath, random boss encounters, and resource management. It's also stupidly fun. Not too hard if you pay attention to what you're doing. I reccomend NOT using the mouse to go to spaces because it's too easy to click on the wrong space, and there's no way to stop the autowalk (which is dumb, but easily avoided).Also? The bad guys are adorable. Less so when they're spouting off random video game references (""The cake is a lie"" - gee, never heard that one before) but I love it when they say ""Don't hurt me!"" right before I hack and slash (or magick) them to bits. <3 <3It's not a perfect game, but it's a perfectly fun game.
