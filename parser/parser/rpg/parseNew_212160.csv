												I was a player on West server that has now quit the game entirely. I have experienced the game from 1-80, and currently have a level 80 character, as long as 60-70 for most other characters. So all of what I have to say is from experience.ProsCombat is engaging and skillbased.Engine can be funny at times.ConsNexon is a terrible company.The community is full of trolls and elitists.Economy fluctuates rapidly without rhyme or reason.Pay2Win.Unbalanced classes.Early-Endgame is intimidating and unrewarding.Progression becomes incredibly difficult.  Vindictus by definition is a Korean-made Hack 'n' Slash action game, with a choice of 8 current character classes (one upcoming) that each mostly fill a niche in the game as it stands. Storywise? The game is lacking. It's apparent that the voice acting in cutscenes are terribly synced, with zero enthusiasm whatsoever. Not to mention, it barely makes sense, it's tough to relate to any of the characters, and questing/story has devolved into a way to level up faster. As far as mechanics go, the game is amazing. Early on, the game guides you along in combat, but hits a wall in skill requirement once you begin to transition into endgame (Level 60-80). This leads to a challenging, engaging experience, as you require quite a bit of skill, and knowledge of both your character and the boss in order to succeed. Example being the solo videos out there on YouTube, which are quite impressive. Vindictus currently runs on source engine, the physics can be wonky at some times, however. With such things as clipping, or bulging polygons extending throughout the map, or a monster getting launched into space for no reason whatsoever. These can lead to much hilarity. The problems in Vindictus however, are too large for me to be able to enjoy this game anymore.  First off, let's talk about your experience from beginning to end. So you start up Vindictus. 8 characters to choose from, how exciting! Can you change their genders? Though this is something that is common in most MMOs, no. Can I change my appearance? Your options in the beginning are very limited, if you want to change up the look of your character, expect to pay $20 or more on just that. Now let's discuss the balancing of the characters, and the roles they play in Vindictus. Though this topic is very short-lived. The balancing of the game is handled very haphazardly. Currently, Hurk and Kai hold the position of godtier within the game. Where everyone else is disregarded. So if you're looking for stats, choose those two. So you've chosen your character! Time to get into the game! But wait, why don't I have any money? Well, that's because Nexon decided it would be a great idea to gut the early game by preventing gold gains from 1-25. Why? To combat botters. This is concerning however, because the earliest parts of a game are usually the most important to ensure people stay around. Surely the game will pick up right? Correct, the game does end up picking up once you are able to make some money, and have gained a general bit of knowledge about your character. Sadly, this is also when Vindictus transitions into a grindfest. Your experience at this point will consist of rushing through the ""storyline"", leveling up with barely any money, until you finally hit a brick-wall -- endgame. Endgame in Vindictus is atrocious. If you're not willing to expend any real currency within the level 60-80 range, don't expect to be progressing at all, unless you're incredibly lucky with drops. This is where players frequently quit, if they haven't already in the beginning. As the game becomes frustrating and unrewarding as it attempts to milk you of your money. Upgrades are incredibly hard to come by, and risks can leave you with absolutely nothing. Only the longterm players have stuck around at this point, when the game becomes a social hub for them.  The community itself is terrible. New players on the nexon forums are frequently driven away when attempting to ask questions. Which in itself is filled with trolls, and sarcastic elitists. Don't even get me started on the ingame community. Where if you don't meet the standards of the host, you can be kicked out without hesitation. So yes, the game itself is also filled with elitist jerks. Though it's to be expected out of any game, I have not seen any community similar to Vindictus in this aspect.  Now, let's talk about Nexon. Nexon is notorious for treating its players terribly. Send in a ticket? We'll answer with an automated message then get back to you after a few months. Concern about bugs and patches? There's a chance we'll even consider reading about your concerns, and if we do, it's likely we'll do nothing about it. However, here's a poorly designed event to hopefully make you forget about all of these problems. Updates? Maybe we'll release a bit of content after half a year, of course we won't tell you anything about it. Over my time with Nexon products, I'm ashamed I've stuck around with their games for so long. If Vindictus were to be handed over to another corporation, I'd gladly come back, but the way that Nexon is handling Vindictus is slowly killing the game.TL;DR Vindictus is slowly dying. Fun for a while, but then you hit a brick wall. "

												Vindictus is a textbook example of how Nexon operates. They take a well designed game, tear out content, and set up a fiendish pay2play and pay2win system.Vindictus follows this pattern to the letter.The game itself is rather well designed. Engaging, live action, hack and slash combat is what Vindictus is all about, and the actual gameplay is pretty fun.However, as you'll notice fairly early on, this game is absurdly grindy, and super repetitive.Within all the areas, the difference between one level in a certain area and another level in the same area is the boss at the end...and that's it. You'll run the same path through the same map each time, fighting the same mobs each time, and doing the same things each time, until you reach the boss, which is usually marginally different from the last. (Though most times only marginally.)Nexon has taken great care to rip out most of the gear our friends in Korea and Europe use.In Korea and Europe, options abound for endgame gear, which greatly reduces grind.In NA, unfortuately, the only endgame gear option is ""Everlasting"" gear, which can only be obtained by finding a rare item in a raid dungeon (which you can only do 3 times per week) which has a drop rate of below 0.0000001%.(Subsequent patches have added other gear options, but Nexon has nerfed those gear options, to perpetuate the need for Everlasting gear.)Apparently, Nexon seems to think, ""If we prevent the Americans from being able to get to the endgame and ""win"" they'll play forever."" I am living proof of their ignorance.And then, as a final insult, if you do manage to get the endgame gear, against all odds, your gear is worthless unless it's enhanced. Unlike many other companies, which have moved on to more player friendly enhancment models, Nexon still clings stubbornly to the age old system that threatens to destroy your items if special ""protecting"" items are not used.In this case, those ""protecting"" items cost 25 dollars in Vindictus. 25 dollars! And what do these protecting items do?They protect your item ONCE, and are consumed regardless of success or failure. Nexon will charge you, literally, hundreds of dollars just for enhancement alone, which is practically mandatory if you want to be able to do anything against the endgame bosses.So basically, if you want to do ANYTHING in this game beyond just mindlessly leveling your characters, you'll need to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars to get anywhere.It makes me very sad, because Vindictus could have been a good game. I could have enjoyed playing Vindictus for years to come, but sadly, the evil of Nexon has corrupted yet another game...more wasted potential.In short, Vindictus is yet another soulless machine designed to suck up as much cash as it can, and drive away anyone whos pockets aren't deep enough to keep up with its demands.

												8k character limit :c. full vers here: http://pastebin.com/RTJn7VykBefore I begin, the steam version of Vindictus is the NA version of the game, which services to the NA region + Australia. There is an IP lock for a good reason. If you live elsewhere, look out for the European, Korean, Japanese or Chinese (<- no IP lock on this one!) version of the game depending on where you live. There are plenty of guides online that can help you get into any of the servers I mentioned, along with English patches.So, I’m known as Penguin. If you use the forums, or play on the West server, you might know me +hello. I don’t usually write reviews, but after seeing negative reviews only exaggerate on the negative points, I decided to write this. For the record, I started playing Vindictus on and off since open beta in 2010. Yes, scroll up and check that release date.PROS:Gameplay, gameplay and did I mention gameplay?Extremely skill-basedExtensive armor customization/Fashion simulator 2015Unique combat style for each characterAmazing graphicsAmazing soundtrackSo much free stuff from eventsGame has a learning curve; it takes EFFORT to get goodCONS:RNG, RNG, and did I mention RNG?Hourly lagBotsBadly optimizedLimited character customizationPVP is unbalancedNEUTRAL:Peer2peer systemCash shopTwo ends of the communityGrinding/FarmingGame has a niche audienceGameplay:Simply amazing. This is the main reason anyone plays Vindictus. As far as I am aware, there is no f2p mmorpg on the western market that even comes close to how fluid and enjoyable the combat system Vindictus has to offer. The game runs around a normal/smash combo system where you use left/right clicks (or j/k keys or your gamepad buttons) to control your character. Unlike your traditional mmo, there is no tab-targeting, and your quickslots are mainly for potions and consumables. I fell in love with Vindictus’ combat system 5 years ago. 5 years later, I still love it. For comparison purposes, Vindictus is like Monster Hunter or Dark Souls. Extremely skill-based:As discussed in the above post, Vindictus is a non-targetting action mmorpg. Raiding involves learning how to use your character’s survival mechanic to survive the attack patterns each boss has. Unlike many other action mmos on the market, a fraction of a second is enough to determine whether you survive or die to a boss. Something I heard from Junyoop, a relatively famous player and streamer of Vindictus KR (Mabinogi Heroes): ”in many mmos, if you play the class that has a shield without equipping the shield, it is impossible to survive. However in Vindictus, you can play the character with a shield (Fiona), and still do extremely well without equipping the shield”. As someone who mains Fiona, it’s true. You can play shieldless Fiona and survive solely with your invincibility-frameless roll, granted you have the skill. There are a few instances of sandbag bosses (Lakoria, Kraken head, Pantheum), but for the most part, facetanking raid bosses will most likely end with you dead.Extensive armor customization/Fashion simulator 2015:Need I say more? Each equipment set has an extremely unique appearance, with most equipment having three dye slots that you can customize. You can even cosplay your favorite characters from whatever game/anime/TV/movie using the armor sets and dye system available in-game [and you can acquire the look you want using ONLY in-game gold!](click here[vindictus.nexon.net] for some examples). Seriously, Vindictus can may well be fashion simulator 2015 :D.Amazing soundtrack‘nuff said. Especially raids. Samples: one twoRNG, RNG, and did I mention RNG?Probably the only real legitimate concern about the game. Loot is RNG, your damage has (slight) RNG, enhancing/enchanting your gear is RNG. Update: seal shop is here, you will be able to get your level 80 weapon within a week of raiding. In addition, Purple tier regina (Lv90) gear is dirt cheap.Badly optimizedVindictus was developed on the Source 1 engine. As a result, the game mostly runs on one core, resulting in your modern multicore processor taking performance hits (Intel runs better than AMD for this). As far as I am aware, there are no plans on moving to the newer Source 2 engine. DevCat has tried to remedy this issue by adding multicore support for raid hosts, and the function works amazingly when it does decide to work, but the multicore function is still in beta and can be buggy. PVP is unbalancedBecause Vindictus was intended to be a PvE game. PvP was only added because of popular demand. Devcat has made some modifications to PvP in an attempt to balance the characters, but it isn’t quite enough. It’s still fun though.Cash shopCosmetics, protection items, RNG boxes (don’t buy these, ever), pets, self-revives, temporary equipment, outfitters, consumables, VIP service. Nothing game-breaking here. Vindictus is F2P, how do you think it survives? I will discuss everyone’s favorite topic of “pay2win?” at the end.Two ends of the communityLike every other game, there are nice people, elitists/scumbags and the silent people who just enjoy the game. As of late, I haven’t seen many elitists nor attack requirement boats, which is really nice. The silent people who just play the game take the majority though.Grinding/Farming“This is a Korean MMO, it’s OBVIOUSLY a grindfest” …. In terms of leveling: not really, especially with how the low level content has been streamlined. Back in 2010, it took me a solid 8-10 hours to get to level 12. Now, it takes me 2 hours. Exp is no longer split between party members, and story quests give ridonkulous amounts of exp. Of course, there still exists some form of grinding, as this is an MMO, but seriously, unless you have zero tolerance for any kind of grinding, Vindictus isn’t much of a grind as you think it to be.So, is Vindictus pay2win? My answer is a big, fat NO. ”But so many of the other reviews say that Vindictus is pay2win”. Go read the comments of those reviews. No reviewer has ever brought any evidence where players MUST pull out their wallets to advance in the game. Here are a few definitions of pay2win and how Vindictus does NOT meet most/all criterion.Games that let you buy better gear or allow you to make better items then everyone else at a faster rate and then makes the game largely unbalanced even for people who have skill in the game without paying.As the saying goes, a dead DPS is no DPS. You can have God-tier gear and still die to lack of skill, AND get out-dps’d by a skilled player with moderate gear.Ability to purchase high-end gear with your walletUh no? Unless you count the 2 day temporary lv sets, which are easily nothing in comparison to what you can acquire by actually playing the game. RNG boxes? Sure, they contain “high-end” gear, but I highly advise that you stay away from them. The rates on those boxes are crap for a reason.Ability to get something/where that a non-paying player will never acquire without spending real cashOne thing. Prime outfitters. That is all, and the bonuses that come from prime outfitters have over regular outfitters (that can be obtained for free) are 200 att, 2 balance and in-town movement speed, which at end-game, is quite negligible. Otherwise, everything stat-wise a paying player can acquire is acquirable by a non-paying player.PS: I sent in 2 tickets recently, both got answered within two business days. They were not NX related.			"

												Up until Jan 20, I used to run one of the longest standing Fan Sites for this game.After the only other Fan Site owner was permanently banned over a false detection, with Nexon NA refusing to even consider unbanning her, I have decided that this game is no longer worth me investing my time in, to keep my site going. The other Fan Site owner agrees with this sentiment. And so there are no Vindictus Fan Sites left now.They have such consistent and alarming disregard for the playerbase that it is legitimately going to be what kills this game in the end. I have thousands of hours put into this game (most of it from before they got rid of the ability to launch the game directly), thousands of hours of volunteer work put into my site, and have always been willing to help anyone that asks me for information about things. What does Nexon NA think of me and people like me? That we are troublemakers that shouldn't be taken seriously or associated with (this was stated directly by a forum moderator given power by Nexon to manage the community).The EU playerbase is unfortunately going to have to deal with Nexon NA management soon, and even before the transition has fully occurred, I am told by many EU players that a significant portion of the EU playerbase has quit the game over changes NA has already forced upon EU, with no regard to the situation EU has to deal with (economic differences, primarily).If you want to find a new game to play, this is not it. Not until Nexon gets their act together and cleans up the mess the Vindictus staff have made of this game. Those of us still playing are likely only doing so due to the huge amount of time and effort we have already sunk into this game.			"

												I feel it's time to redo this review since it's been a while and I've had more time to polish my idea of Vindictus. Let's jump right in.Like I said in my previous review, Vindictus provides great combat immersion due to animations and combat mechanics. When you strike an enemy, unless it's a boss/miniboss, it's going to flinch or get knocked back. The combat feels weighted and many of your attacks feel meaningful rather than simply standing in front of a mob and pressing a few keys.The dodge mechanic is vital to your survival and makes for a good system. Each class has a nice dodging/absorbing mechanic which allows you to keep up in the fight. This adds to the weighted feeling because it means you have the opportunity to avoid damage rather than be forced to take it just because an enemy swings in your general direction. Though not completely precise, it still works wonders for the general feeling of combat.Animations and models are absolutely lovely. Nothing really feels stiff, every enemy has life to them. Devcat's animation studio is fantastic and I would love to see more beautiful animation like what they've provided with vindictus.The music in Vindictus is incredible. The boss battles, the music in towns, it all feels fitting. There's not much else to say on this matter, I love the music.Now for the reasons I can't recommend this game.Nexon. Ohhh, Nexon. Why must you be such a terrible publisher? Nexon is one of the worst MMO publishers to date, generally ignoring their userbase and not paying attention to critical issues in their games until it's too late. Their customer support is downright impossible to work with. Pray you do not get hacked, for you will be waiting on customer service for likely months, if not years.Boats are incredibly reliant on Peer to Peer connections, which can cause significant latency issues in a game about precision timing depending on the class. You could end up down and out before you even realize you got hit if you have bad latency. While multi-processing has improved on this, it is still incredibly buggy and may or may not function at all.If you're not incredibly lucky, you will never get to participate in later game content. Most people require you to have at least 16k ATT/M.ATT in order to participate in the raids of Annwyn. If you're like the commonfolk, you probably will only have about 13-14k when you're able to participate in these raids. These require you to now find methods to get stronger. Which would be fine... if not for the risk of losing everything.Let's start with the grind for better gear. On the one hand the game has lasted long enough for some good later-game gear to get cheaper. However, most of the gear you need to GET to those tough raids are... in those tough raids, incredibly rare/expensive, or require a grind that lasts for weeks. Later locations require you to run through multiple maps, sometimes back and fourth, to progress. It's similar to how it used to be, but has changed significantly. These locations are much larger and can't be navigated nearly as quickly. The main offenders of this are the Twilight Desert and Moonlight Peak.Now let's move on to enhancements/enchantments. Enhancements allow you to gain boosts to your weapons/armor up to a certain degree. You use enhancement stones in order to do this, and enhancements can be done up to 15 times. However, you risk decreasing the enhancement, resetting it, or destroying your weapon/armor as you progress up the chain. It becomes harder and harder to upgrade each time you enhance, leading you up to a point where the odds are nowhere near in your favor. You can purchase enhancement runes to protect your item from resets/damage, but that's all it does, it is no assurance you will succeed. Not only that, you must pay real currency in order to purchase this item.Now for enchantments. Enchantments can give your weapon/armor certain buffs based on the enchantment scroll you use. Enchantment scrolls are ranked in letter/number grades, with rank 8 currently being the highest. Higher ranked scrolls are harder to obtain and are also harder to use to enchant items. You're less likely to succeed with a rank A-8 scroll verses an F-C scroll. You can improve chances through the use of Brynn Elixirs, but only to certain degrees. The punishment for failure is a bit worse than that of enhancement due to the more likely chance of success. Your item either loses durability or is destroyed. Like enhancements, you can get enchantment runes to protect from failure. Same deal as before.Now I could look past this if not for the awful way they handle recovery. You can now recover your equipment through the strange traveler for the low low cost of AP. Wait, did I say low low? I meant incredibly high. Level 70+ gear is going to cost you at least 20,000+ AP if you want to recover it. If you've been levelling your skills, this should be next to impossible to do outright. So now you must go back to all those daily missions/missions you didn't do too much and grind out to get your equipment back. Or you can buy AP or wait for meditation AP. None of these options are incredibly appealing.Overall grinding is a chore, not in the least bit pleasant to do. This goes without saying for most MMOs but I feel that Vindictus has made it much worse.So suffice to say I love the game at its core. Gameplay itself is fun. Being locked out of later missions just because I can't grind/be lucky/pay money? Not so much fun. I recommend steering clear if you have issues with severe grind/sudo-""P2W"" gameplay. If you can look past these issues, then feel free to play. I just can't recommend this game.			"

												Well, here goes. I played Vindictus for years now, since the beta actually. And I'm now in the process of deleting my characters. Here's the pros and cons of this game. It might be slightly long so if you just want the short version here it is: Don't play Vindictus.Pros:- The combat system is amazing. It is, straight up, the best combat system out of any MMO I have ever played, and I played a ton. This isn't about pressing skills and waiting for the cooldown (such as WoW for instance), it's a very monster hunter-esque combat system, with dodging, good positioning, etc.- The characters all feel very different from one another, and most of them have a second weapon they can use, changing their playstyle completely, with more weapons coming for the others in the future.- This game is skill before gear. It can have a big learning curve but when you are a ""master"" of your character, you CAN outdps people with much better gear than yours, and actually ""learning"" how to play your character well feels extremely rewarding.- The boss fights (especially the raids later on) are all incredibly fun and different from one another, some can require great teamwork to beat them, but the game does not (minus a small number of raids) restrict you to party play, if you're good enough, you can solo any raids in the game which is a nice feature to test your own skill.- If you like fashion, you can be pretty creative as the game has lots of outfits/armors in it.- Nexon gives a fair number of NX items (premium items usually only buyable on the Nexon Cash shop with real money) free, with events.- Nexon also introduced a new ""airtight"" system where certain cash shop items can be sold in the ingame marketplace for gold to other players.- Basic equipment is no longer hard to get, so you will not really ever be ""gear starved"" or behind in gear.- The soundtrack of the raid battles is AMAZING. Hands down the best boss battles I ever seen in a mmo.Cons:First off, the elephant in the room. The publisher, Nexon, is absolutely terrible. Over all my gaming years, I have no seen a company worse than them. They are greedy, they do control on their forums to silence players who even give contructive criticism about the game, they ban players who talk out agaisnt them, they are absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥at replying to support tickets players send them, and to top it off they can't even offer a good gaming experience, more about that below.- The enchanting system. Basically, in this game there are ""enchant scrolls""  Enchant Scrolls are items that are used to give armor, weapons and accessories added stat bonuses and even status effects which will help the player in battles. Enchant Scrolls are given ranks, F, E, D, C, B, A, 9, 8, 7. The general rule is rank F to B scrolls are mediocre, A are okay, 9 are good, 8 are better, and 7 are the best. The catch is, those scrolls (The rank A and higher) are all extremely hard to get especially the rank 9 to 7, their drop rate is very very low, and they will only drop from ""Hero mode"" battles, or (most at least) from end game raids. The other catch is, you aren't 100% sure those scrolls you worked to get will work. The low end scrolls have a high % chance of working, but rank A's have a maximum chance of 70%, rank 9's are 50%, and 8 and 7 are only 40%. If the enchant fails, you lose your scroll, and rank 9 to 7 scrolls can DESTROY your equipment, forever. There is a 30% to 40% chance of this happening. How to counter this? You have to buy ""enchant runes"" from the Nexon Cash shop, which aren't far to being 10$ each, and what these does is protect your equipment from being destroyed. But you still lose your scroll, and your enchant is not sure to work either. Making it very hard to successfully enchant equipment, since you either lose all your work for your gear by risking to destroy it, or you pay 10$ a shot for a ""maybe"". Note that there exist some runes which gives you a 100% success chance, but those are on sale very rarely, and are basically 25$ each.- The enhancing. I wont go in in as much details on it, but by enhancing an item its weight will decrease, its stats will increase (attack for weapons and defense for armor or shields), its maximum durability will increase. The maximum enhancement level is +15, but getting it is almost impossible to do. You use ""enhancing stones"" to enhance, they are fairly easy to get, and you can enhance to +3 safetely with 100% chance. After +3, the odds of enhancing decrease at each level, and everytime it fails, you lose weapon durablity, and the enhancement level will be reset. There's ""enhancement runes"" for about 4$ each that ""protect"" your weapon from failure penalities, all the way up to +10, and the rune doesnt get used up if it succeeds but you lose the rune if the enhance fails. At +8 and higher, if your enhance fails, your weapon can be destroyed forever. And after +10, you can no longer use runes (minus the rare +11 protection rune from events and sometimes sales on the shop) to enhance. Making going over +10 very risky. But again very high rng.- The binding system. Now that we talked about enhancing and enchanting, there comes the binding system. Equipment with scrolls rank 9 to 7 on them will bind to you, and equipment higher than +8 will also bind to you. You need to buy unbind potions from the NX shop to be able to sell them to other players. Let alone trade them between your account.- There is no bank system across your characters, only ""shared storage"" which you have to buy from the NX shop.- You need to pay NX to buy better hair, underwear, some outfits, make up, beards, etc- The community, as it is, is pretty much dead and Nexon does nothing to get players in and keep them- The servers are terrible but got no upgrades in years- The game is BADLY optimized, and runs on only 1 core, even with the multicore setting. AMD users beware and Intel users dont expect a smooth 60 fps either. Especially when hosting.- The events are boring and not varied at all- The story ""is"" okay, but is heavily text based which may put lots of people off.- There are only 4 towns and everything is instanced including dungeons and raids.- The dungeons can feel extremely repetitive and mundane- The end-game is extremely repetitive and a grind fest, you're also limited to running only 1 specific raid per day. For example, if you wish to fight the boss ""Havan"" for the rare shiny ponita drop rate scrolls, you can only run his battle once a day. This is true for the rest of the raids too, only one of each a day, unless you use a ""VIP"" which lets you do... wait for it.. 2 runs a day! Yeah. It's♥♥♥♥♥♥- It gets very boring to solo. If you don't have friends who want to play this with you, stay away from this game even more.- Other than the good combat, this game has nothing good going for it. PvP exists, but it's a joke and almost no one does it anyway, some other modes are in the game but are so boring no one does them, the crafting is a chore to level up and not worth it anymore.In conclusion, I absolutely do not recommend Vindictus in the short, or long run. You may find it fun for a little while, but you will eventually fall into the things you have to pay for and the horrible rng, and if you run into issues the customer support will not help you much at all, and Nexon, as a company, is just terrible. Goodbye Vindictus, I will not miss you.			"

												I hate Nexon. I hate them with a passion. They've ruined the only online hack and slash game worth playing by treating their playerbase like absolute nuisances. They've taken down every single fan site that has supported the game and continue to ignore the pleas and criticisms of their playerbase. When I first started playing Vindictus in 2011, I fell in love with the simple but oh so satisfying gameplay. The rush you feel when you finally defeat a boss in this game is unmatched. I toiled through the early levels, farmed for gear, and prayed to RNGesus to enhance said gear. But once I hit the end-game was when Nexon really ramped up the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Gatcha upon gatcha events. Failing servers (namely Arisha release). Pompous volunteer mods banning well known community members for absurd reasons (You can go to hell Aquasol and Dealer).Now they've taken down all of the fan sites that have been maintained by players who received not a word of thanks or appreciation from Nexon for promoting their game and aiding the playerbase. I hate Nexon NA for ruining a game I loved and spent so much time on. I hate them and their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t policies and Terms of Service. With Sanitee banned and Vindictus Manual gone, I've decided that I'm tired of their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Thank you to the West players for giving me some of the most exciting moments in gaming that I've ever had, especially in a rough patch where I contemplated suicide. I'm done with this game and I warn anyone curious about this game to turn back. This game isn't worth playing anymore.			"

												Vindictus is a relatively well-made free to play MMO with a real time combat at its core. Optional pay component assist the player in levelling and customisation of their character.Where character design is concerned the game offers a detailed (and above average) character editor but remains restricted to a handful of pre-designed in look and combat abilities archetypes.In principle the game is all about instanced combat. Each instance is travelled to by the party where it can attempt to complete various primary and secondary quests as its members hack their way through legions of instance specific monsters. The whole thing takes between 15 minutes to 1 hour (at least in the early stages of the game) after which you are free to move onto a next instance (as long as it has been unlocked in story progress).Enemy AI, aside from bosses is non-existent, though boss fights are challenging and on rare occasions entertaining.There is a story attached to this offering though it should be interpreted through Far Eastern lenses (NPCs, archetypes, conversations, events are exactly what you would expect to find in modern JRPG).Vindictus is a mediocre game, one that lacks support and interest from its developer and publisher. Nexon is quick to ban players (even paying ones) for problems beyond their (players) control and the GMs remain unresponsive to their tickets leaving some stranded for weeks if not months at time and in some cases without a way to resolve the issues.All in all there are better offerings available to those interested in free to play setup as such it is my recommendation to give this one a miss.

												So you want to play Vindictus? Heres what you want to know and my personal experince/opinions.First and foremorst, while i do reccomend this game. Be wary, dont let it consume it, dont let it get to you. My total play time doesnt come from years of play, but rather months. And while a lot of it is due to afk hours (especially getting tired and just leaving the game open while i slept) thered be alot more if it counted my playtime i had on the standalone desktop version (downloaded from the site, used whenever steam wouldnt let me log on)PROS:-*TRULY* a free to play game. You honestly dont have to spend a dime if you dont want to, and thats something i loved. Almost anything can be bought with gold in game.  (The only *exception* to this is the under armor, mainly for females. No, not because i want my character to run around in skimpy underwear, but because the defult underclothes will make some armors look bad. Especially shorter skirts/shorts. Now while you dont *need* this, its something that i opted to buy on both my female characters. Thankfully Nexon is nice and offers a kinda cheap deal of $13 PERMANANT Inner armor/Hair style (choose wisely))-Really nice graphics for a free to play game. My Notebook couldnt handle the max settings, most of the time i played on lowest to push out the most fps i could get, but i have friends who can run it better, or watch videos. The game is honestly stunning, from environments to boss battles.-Fairly well learning/difficulty curve. Easy to learn, hard to master.-Fairly nice community, specially if you join up with a guild when you start, i made some friends that will always hold a place in my heart.-Nexon hosts frequent events with rewards/giveaways. Allowing you to snag $ items for free.-(Pro/Con) Easy to get into and to continue playing, lots of things to do and work towards.CONS:-Nexon.. Need i say more?-FPS problems on lower-end systems, most likely caused by server inflation and patches with new content (This is one of the reasons i took a large break and then eventually quit the game. I used to not have many problems, but after Arisha came out and Nexon started handing out items like candy, my fps dropped to basically unplayable levels (15-10 or lower). If your PC is beefy enough to handle the game well, you shouldnt have a problem, but me and my notebook wept.)-Community. Im adding this in both PROs and CONs because well, thats how people are. Ive ran into some really rude people, made my fair share of enemies, and got ripped off more then once.. But, that honestly goes for any MMO.-Boat kicking/ATT requirement. Early on, this isnt a problem. You wont notice it and it wont bother you. Later on, when you start getting to lvl 70+ people will start tagging Attack requirements onto thier boats, kicking anyone who doesnt quailify. While i understand that certain bosses may need this due to the fact that theres a high chance youll fail if your DPS isnt good enough, Its troublesome, specially if you dont spend money/grind for hours/have help.-GRINDING. This is the last, but probably one of the most important things. Unless you get help, or know how to play the market really well, youre going to have to grind for your items. This kinda goes hand and hand with the boat kicking. Boss drops sell for ALOT of gold, but are extremely rare and RNG, and thats hard to grind for if youre getting kicked all the time. Just be wary about it, find good friends, and enjoy the game.I leave it up to you if you want to play the game or not, i HIGHLY reccomend you at least download and try the game out. Dont be discouraged by the CONs, its ultimately up to you wether or not you enjoy the game. Just when you play follow this 3 golden rules.1. BE FRIENDLY AND FAIR2. JOIN A GUILD AS SOON AS YOU CAN/MAKE FRIENDS3. MOST IMPORTANTLY.. JUST HAVE FUN(P.s. You may notice the striking numbers of downvotes and negitive replies, while there is a bit of truth in all of them, the games not going to get better without new people coming into the game. With more and more people leaving or getting turned away by the bad reviews, the game is just going to become worse.. Its slowly dying. Only you can fix it, or at least try to help.)			"

IntroVindictus is a Free-to-Play game focused on real-time interactive combat. The gameplay is fast-paced with emphasis on timing and reactions compared to traditional MMO's. The developers, devCAT, accomplished this by making it dungeon based with party limits. It's a game that relies on peer-2-peer for hosting purposes.Environments+ Different environments+ Sections are randomizedEvery chapter has a different theme with several maps. Sections of the levels are randomized to prevent the game from being too repetitive. Variety of traps can be discovered in many of the levels.You end up grinding, if  you don't finish enough quests or simply want to power level the fastest way possible. Grinding is not bad until you hit level 43~ where hidden is. Hidden is the most tempting grind spot in the game for exp and will result in you neglecting some side-quests in favor of it. Characters (Classes)+ Unique playstylesThe classes stick out alot as a result of unique weapons,skill sets, and stats. Playing as for example Kai will feel dramatically different from a evie even if they both use range attacks and are not as complex as the other heros. You will find yourself trying out all of them because they got alot of varation to offer you.

Equipment/LootEquipment is not to hard to get to be useful until you get level 59+ where it becomes more of a challenge. That being said since the big payoffs are the daily raids its worth it just to login to play against epic bosses and have a lottery ticket chance at the nice items possible to drop from them.Pay to win or not?Now the question you may have is. Is it free to play or pay to win? Really I would be sort of lieing if I said that money didn't give you ridiclous advantages over others. It is far easier to upgrade your equipment and get stronger gear. As a free to play model it ranks average seeing as how gameplay wise it mostly just benefits people who party with them but at same token this game is mostly geared towards PvE so its not really that much of a concern when the heavy hitters are on your side 99% of the time.

												I was a player on West server that has now quit the game entirely. I have experienced the game from 1-80, and currently have a level 80 character, as long as 60-70 for most other characters. So all of what I have to say is from experience.ProsCombat is engaging and skillbased.Engine can be funny at times.ConsNexon is a terrible company.The community is full of trolls and elitists.Economy fluctuates rapidly without rhyme or reason.Pay2WinUnbalanced classes.Early-Endgame is intimidating and unrewarding.Progression becomes incredibly difficult.Vindictus by definition is a Korean-made Hack 'n' Slash action game, with a choice of 8 current character classes (one upcoming) that each mostly fill a niche in the game as it stands. Storywise? The game is lacking. It's apparent that the voice acting in cutscenes are terribly synced, with zero enthusiasm whatsoever. Not to mention, it barely makes sense, it's tough to relate to any of the characters, and questing/story has devolved into a way to level up faster. As far as mechanics go, the game is amazing. Early on, the game guides you along in combat, but hits a wall in skill requirement once you begin to transition into endgame (Level 60-80). This leads to a challenging, engaging experience, as you require quite a bit of skill, and knowledge of both your character and the boss in order to succeed. Example being the solo videos out there on YouTube, which are quite impressive. Vindictus currently runs on source engine, the physics can be wonky at some times, however. With such things as clipping, or bulging polygons extending throughout the map, or a monster getting launched into space for no reason whatsoever. These can lead to much hilarity. The problems in Vindictus however, are too large for me to be able to enjoy this game anymore.First off, let's talk about your experience from beginning to end. So you start up Vindictus. 8 characters to choose from, how exciting! Can you change their genders? Though this is something that is common in most MMOs, no. Can I change my appearance? Your options in the beginning are very limited, if you want to change up the look of your character, expect to pay $20 or more on just that. Now let's discuss the balancing of the characters, and the roles they play in Vindictus. Though this topic is very short-lived. The balancing of the game is handled very haphazardly. Currently, Hurk and Kai hold the position of godtier within the game. Where everyone else is disregarded. So if you're looking for stats, choose those two. So you've chosen your character! Time to get into the game! But wait, why don't I have any money? Well, that's because Nexon decided it would be a great idea to gut the early game by preventing gold gains from 1-25. Why? To combat botters. This is concerning however, because the earliest parts of a game are usually the most important to ensure people stay around. Surely the game will pick up right? Correct, the game does end up picking up once you are able to make some money, and have gained a general bit of knowledge about your character. Sadly, this is also when Vindictus transitions into a grindfest. Your experience at this point will consist of rushing through the ""storyline"", leveling up with barely any money, until you finally hit a brick-wall -- endgame. Endgame in Vindictus is atrocious. If you're not willing to expend any real currency within the level 60-80 range, don't expect to be progressing at all, unless you're incredibly lucky with drops. This is where players frequently quit, if they haven't already in the beginning. As the game becomes frustrating and unrewarding as it attempts to milk you of your money. Upgrades are incredibly hard to come by, and risks can leave you with absolutely nothing. Only the longterm players have stuck around at this point, when the game becomes a social hub for them.The community itself is terrible. New players on the nexon forums are frequently driven away when attempting to ask questions. Which in itself is filled with trolls, and sarcastic elitists. Don't even get me started on the ingame community. Where if you don't meet the standards of the host, you can be kicked out without hesitation. So yes, the game itself is also filled with elitist jerks. Though it's to be expected out of any game, I have not seen any community similar to Vindictus in this aspect.Now, let's talk about Nexon. Nexon is notorious for treating its players terribly. Send in a ticket? We'll answer with an automated message then get back to you after a few months. Concern about bugs and patches? There's a chance we'll even consider reading about your concerns, and if we do, it's likely we'll do nothing about it. However, here's a poorly designed event to hopefully make you forget about all of these problems. Updates? Maybe we'll release a bit of content after half a year, of course we won't tell you anything about it. Over my time with Nexon products, I'm ashamed I've stuck around with their games for so long. If Vindictus were to be handed over to another corporation, I'd gladly come back, but the way that Nexon is handling Vindictus is slowly killing the game.TL;DR Vindictus is slowly dying. Fun for a while, but then you hit a brick wall.i copyed AkaGengix comment because is 100% true			"

												This game was a prototype.What do I mean by that? Idea's, lots and lots of ideas. The original (Yes there have been several over the years) development team of the game had a vision of an MMO and was one of the first RPG MMO's to break with ""tab targeting"" and tradition class roles in an MMO. By all accounts they did a damn good job on that front as well. Fast paced combat with some of the most stunning visuals in an ""MMO"" at the time all while having ""most"" characters viable in group/solo play (Was balanced out later on so that all characters were viable)At this point you may be asking yourself why the negative review then? Greed. Nexon is know the world over in smaller gaming circles as one of the greediest Publishers in existance. Think of the Korean version of EA and that basically sums up the taste it leaves in most peoples mouths who've played one of their titles. Every single aspecr of the game is tied to RNG (A chance to obtain X-Y-Z) and when you want to improve a shiny new weapon/armor piece you spent well over a month to try a aquire via enhancements/enchantments you have rather HIGH odds for that shiny piece of gear to be destroyed if either fails. To protect against such a happening they have ""Microtransactions"" that can protect your items up to a certain extent.Micro being ANYTHING but as you can easily spend $300 on a single item trying to get the to the ""Halfway point"" Meaning +10 with 2 enhcantments. Alas you think you're done? Nope, still having 5 enchantment levels to go each attempt WILL destroy your gear if it fails. In 5 years of playing I had managed to make a +14 and 2 +13's. Thats it. Some 5,000+ hours of play time and a figure of money most people would be ashamed to admit.Nexon takes and takes and takes has no love for the people who give them the money to keep developing their business. On that note nexon had decided the development team was too ambitious and scaled back the scope of the project. This lead to unrest in the team causing most member of the original developers to either quit or be fired. Customer service is rarely of any use and will fight you until they legally cannot. Yes, they have done things in the past that were against multiple US/EU consumers rights and ""Fair business"" practices. Claiming that they had done nothing wrong when in fact their own ToS/EULA even states that what they had done was against their own terms.The icing on the cake as some have mentioned was the implemention of ""Community Moderators"" who in essence swear blind faith to nexon and run rampent throughout the fourms destroying what little community was left after the first year the game was released (some 100,000+ active players in that time frame down to some 5-6,000 these days IF that) dividing most of the memebers into camps of ""Eveythings fine"" and ""This game needs help"" even being civil merely discussing issues with the game/company and plausable ways for them to rectify them can result in forum bans.Last but no least, whales. Cash cows run rampent in the game with impunity. The more you spend, the more you are allowed to break the terms of service. I myself in the final days started using various hacks/scripts, posting Youtube Videos of me doing such, posting these on the forums attempting to bring all manner of attention to what players were capable of doing to the game and what was the response? A forum ban. My account itself was untouched, active and fully functional. When I inquired about my account not being banned to customer support the ticket was instantly closed, when I used an alt account to do the same (the alt account had no money spent on it and was outside of an identical IP address had no associtation with my primary account was promptly banned from the forums without reason.If you want to experiance this game do yourself a favor and play ""Black Desert Online"" many of the same people who developed Vindictus are working on BDO under their own company setting their own pace and it shows in the fact that they've made multiple millions of USD more than Vindy over a single year compared to Vind's entire life of 6 almost 7 years.TL:DR Nexowned isn't an enderaring term, avoid a graveyard of ""Good ideas blinded by greed""			"

												10% chance of rare material drop from raid boss and you only have 1/8 of that 10% chance to obtain that rare material to craft your desired item. I finally got my very first Kraken Fang after nearly 2 years o daily grinding it.Since I can't afford any high price in-game services such as VIP / VVIP / Premium Enchant Runes (for expensive enchant scrolls), I felt like totally taking a beaten by this game and I would also agreed with those people whose saying Vindictus is a ""Free To Play"" yet ""Pay To Win"".If you're new to Vindictus, I would suggest that do not critically put yourself deep into this game, you may find it's fun at first but as soon as you're hitting the end game contents, those ""FUNS"" will become ""FUNDS"" and you'll always have deal with bunch of stresses environment such as: Grinding raid bosses, not enough ATK to be on a required host boat, failure on items enhance / enchanting, and yet not mention about renowned scammers still roaming around after months/years and ready to bring miseries upon your fortunes whenever they had a chance and they're still not getting any punishments due to the inefficient and lacking of security services provided by Nexon NA.Vindictus is a good to kill time and fun hack 'n slash game with absolute beautiful graphics game -- especially female characters (y'know, it's true!) but the game is very heavy unbalanced compares to other popular Free MMORPG games.I don't hate the game, but don't like it as well. I'm still playing it casually here and there after finally saw its true nature, so better pull my legs out before I'm sinking too deep in it and I'll have to pay an even more expensive monthly value in order to keep up with this game.I'd like to bid other vindictus fellows and new players full of fortunes in game on this ending sentence.Thanks for reading my informal review comment,Former CBT - present vindictus player.

												When it comes to MMO games, it's really damn hard to find an actually decent one. Thankfully, Vindictus is one of the few that may be worth playing. Pros: -A lot of action and a pretty decent amount of customization. -Nice looking armors, weapons, and characters. -Fun and (sometimes) challenging enemies. -Pretty fluid and fast-paced combat. -Moderately decent storyline (In comparison to other MMOs) Cons: -A decent amount of the REALLY good items you need to buy with actual money, which kind of sucks. -Can occasionally be repetitive or boring at times depending on where you are in levels/story. Personally, I think this is one of the few moderately enjoyable MMOs I've played. If you want something that's more fast-paced and has a great amount of action compared to the usual MMO, this is the game for you. If you've checked the game out and don't like it, but still want a fast-paced action MMO, another game I can point you toward is Warframe, though that has some major differences in comparison to Vindictus.

												Pay no matter to my time played, as I have been playing in the EU server for 3 years now. I installed the Steam version to post a review, since speaking your mind on the forums leads to a purge.TL;DR - forced merge made us lose a lot of privileges that the new management fails to acknowledge or even reply to. Bots and gold sellers are common and staff is more worried about banning people over datamining files to access important information such as boss stats, character info, etc. Endgame is lackluster, but that's Korea's fault, they take too long to push out updates. ~~ List of stuff completely wrong with this game (and its management) - this includes changes during the merge of the EU server to the """"Global Service Platform"": ~~- Heavy inflation in the original populated NA Servers (East and West), due to constant bots and gold sellers over the course of 6 years, and no in-game features (such as TIR Coin) to lessen and potentially remove the issue.- Simple and basic features are ignored in the game, such as every single other server having a rejoin function for when you disconnect - this is something that EU had for over 2 years, and that NA only received once the merge was finalised a month ago.- 10 minute IP-lock everytime the IP is different from the previous one. It doesn't recognise the machine or even send a message to your e-mail address, yet this is considered to be for ""your safety"" even though it's a gigantic nuisance and if you're being hacked, 10 minutes will hardly ever make a difference. If you play in different places often or have a dynamic IP, you're gonna have a bad time.- The game is somewhat pay2progress, in the sense that buying NX will make you get to endgame faster. This is an issue because TIR Coin and the ability to gift everything on the depot were removed/nerfed, which provided a legal and profitable way for Nexon to solve the goldsellers and bots problem; instead, it was labelled as pay2win. I'll explain shortly why this is wrong:Rich person starts playing - doesn't have much time, but wants to reach endgame and get good gear. He sells NX/Tir Coin, providing a legal way to convert his real life cash into gold, as well as providing a service for players who can't afford their own NX.Rich person, F2P person and Nexon are happy because: Rich person saved time and got money; F2P person saved money and ""paid"" with the time he spent farming ingame; Nexon is happy because people are using a game function instead of resorting to third-party services, thus increasing their profit.- Price increase and removal of items in depot (Enchant Runes up in price, Permanent Shared Storage removed, TIR Coin removed and any attempt to bring it back was ignored by the staff under a ""we'll think about it"" copy paste message)- After 6 months of (delayed) merge and dozens of posts edited/removed on the grounds of FUD, a GM finally acknowledges that NX Selling through the depot gifting system is indeed allowed, as is this considered trading and not real world selling. However, some items can't be gifted such as unbind potions and runes, making you still have to charge your own NX Cash if you want to buy these. (99% of the items were giftable on EU)- ""Promotional Events"" disguised as extremely obvious cashgrabs, forcing people to pay 100 dollars for an avatar set, a haircut and some tattoos.- The grand majority of the staff is not competent or knowledgeable enough to understand the game and what it needs due to not playing it as regularly as they should, leaving communication between the playerbase and the staff extremely hindered.- BlackCipher, the game's security system, is extremely invasive and it might trigger on any game you might have option, due to other anti-cheat methods in these programs. Therefore, the ToS state all third-party programs are against the rules which is soooooooooooooooo reasonable when the game keeps throwing low-effort events where you have to AFK for 100 hours and not even have to play the game. To make the matters worse, the list is extremely outdated and includes programs that cannot be used to hack the game and, due to this, two important fansite creators (Sanitee and Shippuu) closed down their sites, due to Sanitee being permanently banned over a program that cannot be used to modify files in the game.The combat is great, but don't bother. You're gonna hate everything else in this game because of how incompetent the staff is at dealing with the problems in the game.			"

AS OF: July 18th, 2016         It's been almost a year since I've originally written this review and since then the game has been improved greatly. There are still issues that exist in the game that have yet to be fixed, but overall it can be a more satisfying experience than before. Before I really go into the review, I must admit I had a lot of fun playing this game. It's very unique and I've yet to see another MMO come close to the smooth combat system that Vindictus has. The game, much like any other popular MMO's, is a drug and you have this tendency to keep playing (which still happens to me sadly). However, with that said, the other aspects of this game are atrocious. The easiest way to get into things would be a pro-neutral-con chart. Please keep in mind that this is a very tentative no. I love to play this game, but I hate the sh*t I have to go through to accomplish anything.Pro Unique combat gameplay that requires timing and skill to deal the most damage (Dark Souls-esque but at 2x speed) Mechanics of the game work relatively well (Skill paths, different attacks, special attacks) Unique set of characters, each with their own play style and difficulty Full man parties against huge raid bosses are incredibly satisfying, and many of the bosses are unique and have interesting catches to them Wide variety of bosses, missions, etc. As of recent update, easier to get ""rare"" drops from bosses to craft higher level items (seal shop, higher drops) Interesting story that fits in with the Mabinogi series A multitude of content (from items, to enemies, to missions) 3 Different Seasons that are fleshed out (3rd currently being worked on) Customizing characers via in-game armor, inner armor, hair, makeup, outfits, costume armors, etc. The look of armors (all kinds and outfitters) and characters are both incredibly sexy and amazing Plenty of special events that occur often Level cap currently at 90 The game still recieves content updates, even after so long (although it does take a while) and seems that it will continue growing Due to events popping up so often with notable rewards, it is now easier to get the overpriced scrolls and getting to a high enhancement level The PR team does really well with both advertising the game and interacting with the community, especially when devs play in the servers and the community manager streaming on Twitch (plus the dude danced like Delia infront of a lot of people, he's funny)Neutral It's been a while that I've run into customer support since they've left a bad taste in my mouth over the years of terrible service. However, I've been hearing that the support has been improving as of late As trivial as the minor enemies are compared to the bosses, Season 3 seems to have somewhat fixed this due to the extreme difficulty of both the boss and the enemies Delia was just released, and is pretty fun The population of the game tends to be a bit sporadic, when good events are active or new content is relased (like areas or characters) then more people come on. When there's not much going on, the population seems to decrease for a bit until more interesting stuff is introduced People have tended to be more lenient on the damage requirements for raids. Although still a con, there are players out there that are willing to carry lower damage characters (normally within a 2k damage difference of the requirement: S2 = 18k) Sometimes it can be hard to find parties for raids. I've been having issues lately with S2 raids having no boats ready to leave, yet S1 and S3 have plenty Although the game is fairly linear (seen in Cons), Season 2 is somewhat open world in the definition that Monster Hunter is in their combat worlds Some of the outfitters kind of look out of place like the Urban Angel (which is casual modern clothes) or the Flamenco Dress (self-explanetory) considering the game is set in a fantasy world that primarly uses swords, magic, and arrows Many of the non-raid bosses are a joke and don't have much to them. It's not until much later in the game where the variety kicks in Dismantling materials for element stones can now be combined for higher tier varients of themselves, which is niceCon Everything in this game is either time or farm based (raids once a day, AP generation, expertise, path transformations) The economy of the game can be inflated at times (to incredible amounts) The characters/classes you want to choose are gender-locked The NX store (real money store) has a lot of overpriced items, and you can easily spend $50 without really realizing it. Just to customize yourself with an outfitter can cost up to $40 for the limited edition version (higher stats) or $20 for the regular version Although skill plays a role, wallet warriors can still have the upper-hand Enhancing weapons, armor, etc. requires a lot of in-game gold, materials, and the looming chance that you will blow up your weapon. The whole Enhancing scheme is soley revolved around RNG (that can be avoided up to +10 by buying in-game runes to prevent leveling down items or having them be destroyed) Enchanting items (Rank 7-9) also has the chance of blowing up your weapon, which also can be avoided by buying runes. High level scrolls in the current economy are also ridiculously priced, so you're honestly better off buying a rune to not only save the Enchant Scroll, but to save your weapon Most later game raids require extremely high damage which can be hard to obtain. This leads to a ""stagnant"" period where you have enough damage to do early raids to have some progress, but still not enough to satisfy later game raids (Season 2 raids --> 18k attack) The game itself is poorly optimized (if hosting, your FPS will go down to 30, regardless of your PC specs. Capped at 60) Once you reach level 60, the grind for XP, Gold, AP, weapons, armor, etc. becomes excruciating Unlike most other MMOs, Vindictus is very linear and involves small time combat then to a boss which tends to be filled with trivial enemies and a difficult boss Materials to craft high level items either require loads of in-game gold or a lot of farming *cough* iron ore *cough*         Vindictus overall isn't necessarily a bad game by any definition. What makes the game great is the awesome combat system combined with doing full party raids to take down these heavy hitting bosses. The problem isn't that, it's everything else surrounding the combat system. The game is very poorly optimized, and strictly relies on Peer to Peer connections; this in combination with a heavily timing based combat system is a recipe for disaster. Not only this, but at higher levels, raids (at least most raid parties) require a minimum damage requirement, which ends up being an obsurd number that is difficult to reach without heavy amounts of grinding. The game isn't necessarily a ""wallet warrior"" type of Free to Play, and is definitely playable without the use of your money; the game just makes it harder to do so, especially with the current enhancing system in place. And don't even get started on expertise, as I've spent countless hours farming pre-pre-requisite materials to spend countless hours crafting pre-requisite materials to finally craft all that into materials I need to craft armor pieces, and it only yields a few armor pieces and a few points to level up my expertise. If I have to idle craft stuff in any game, that normally isn't a good sign.TL;DRThe game is good; some of the stuff inside, not so much. If you feel inclined to play; I'd recommend that you reach level 60 and really decide if you want to continue playing, as the daily raids are available to you at that level.			"

												(Updated review point 7/31/15 at the bottom)Disclaimer: The game is good, everything else sucks a big floppy donkey♥♥♥♥♥♥ My main account and the account attached to my steam are TWO different accounts, that's why I have such a small amount of hours, regardless I have put in hundreds trying to enjoy the game with each of their characters. I reached max level and end-game on my other account and it was painful but even enjoyable.I do not recommend this game because you will experience headache server issues and lack of help from their customer support.Nexon won't help you ever. Don't expect help, expect NOTHING but unstable gameplay. Their customer support is either A: Talking to a brick wall or B: Talking to an automated bot that replies with a generic apology. Nexon and Rockstar and hand-in-hand in ♥♥♥♥♥♥ customer support.I've played this game closed beta. I played the open beta. I didn't always stick around but I came back to try new characters or to just get back into the game again. I've put in many many hours. I downloaded it from steam to keep the game updated, and boy am I glad I haven't spent any money on them because regardless of the issue they will refuse to help you no matter how small the problem. Nexon America will screw you over time and time again. I can go into my ticket history and not one single problem was resolved. They should just close the ticket website (Which is down anyways at this time) and just tell you out right that you will not get the help you want. I love this game, but with any game comes problems, and boy have I had problems. Some for example small ones where I didn't get an event item for logging in, and I understand they can't help there. Other times I have lost millions of gold in items just because their mail system didn't work this one time. I had an item from when I made an Arisha that I sent to my Evie through mail. I bought the item because it was a great quality item and it cost me 10million. For some that's not a lot but for me its hours and hours and HOURS of gameplay to get the items to make that much money.Before in the past since 2006 I have had countless problems with them and each time I sent a ticket I have been helped 0 times. Zero times have they helped rather each and every time they tell me they have reviewed my problem and they ""Can not help me with ""Enter problem here"" and we apologize for the inconvenience."" I wouldn't give a flying F**K if they would use their adequate logs to assist me in retrieving the mail lost in cyber space. No this hasn't happened in just one game but all of them. I can list 20 tickets at least where I have unresolved problems, just an apology. They refuse to help and I don't know why I expect them to. If you can accept the fact you will spend time and that spent time will disappear on command (Nexon is incredibly notorious for things going horribly wrong especially during events and updates) then enjoy the game and expect absolutely no help from them.--TL;DR--It's like a good game, but it's glitchy as f**k in alpha and there is no customer support, rather an apology center where they finger their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Not to mention everyone is always complaining of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers because they can't host a game worth♥♥♥♥♥♥ It can take months to get a reply for example being banned it took them almost two months to reply and still didn't resolve the problem. I even forgot about the ticket until I received an email for it and probably only because it was neglected for so long was an automated bot triggered to send an apology as if they actually reviewed the rusted ticket. By then he quit the game completely considering he was banned for botting... (This was a friends account who never again played). Expect no help and expect to get disconnected at ANY TIME ANYWHERE.--TL;DR version 2--It's like buying a really nice car with no insurance. It's such a good car you spent your money(time) on. You will spend a ton of money(time) on this and it only gets better as it goes on. However if anything goes wrong whether or not its your fault, too bad so sad. If you want the problem solved you will have to spend your own money(time) to get it back to normal.I forgot to mention the gas pedal likes to stop for no reason sometimes and it takes a bum off of the street five to ten tries to get it fixed. This tends to happen a lot during a nice ride down the highway when you are going to an important business meeting.Copy pasted responses from tickets I submitted:""We appreciate your patience and do sincerely apologize for any inconvenience. After carefully reviewing our logs...""""We have reviewed the situation and unfortunately, we will not be able to assist with the recovery of this mail. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.""""Thank you for contacting Nexon America Customer Support. I'm......Thank you again for your continued patience and please remember to check your mailbox periodically throughout the week.Thank you Sincerely,""(Update 7/31/15) Because I decided to try some Vindictus on a 2x exp event and some sort of early christmas event, not to mention I felt like playing some fast paced sort of game. Got on a 71 character and tried to do a 4 person Twilight Desert full run. (Twilight Desert is season 2; you finish season 1 with all quests complete you'll be around 62-67) After completing every boss, finishing story quests for some people, we had 10 minutes left and went to get the treasure chests. Right as we plan on leaving the second the timer hit ONE MINUTE it failed us and we only got 1/10th the experience we should have gotten. 0exp for bosses and we spent over 100 minutes doing it. Not to mention the couple of party goddess graces used because we were terrible. Wasted all wasted because nexon is by far the worst at managing, updating, fixing or repairing their game or servers. Oh and unless you have a perfect connection to the host you might as well give up fighting bosses. You and mobs will freeze up every 5 to 10 seconds unless your connection is god status. If you ever wanted to finish this game and complete a character, good ♥♥♥♥ing luck. You either solo because the game is nearly dead of any new players, or you attempt to play with others who you can't establish a stable connection to; losing connection all together sometimes.			"

												Nexon is greedy, items in the game can cost as much as $20 of which most require you to spend more money. Drop rates for rare matierals are unbalanced and unfair. End game progression is impossible if you play solo. You have about as much chance to be struck by lightning as you do getting comfortable in this game. And if you don't have 16k+ Attack damage (at end game) you'll be subjected to the elitist players mercy. Kicked off of boats and treated as if you don't exist. Level 1-60 are a breeze but if you're thinking of investing in this game, think again. It's utterly infested with bots spamming the chat and selling gold for real $$$, the ecomomy is ruined. and everything but the air you breathe cost $$$. Nexon sells more than just cosmetics in this game. They sell power. Buffs to your damage, drop rates, the amount of raids you can run. This is a disgrace to gaming. Oh and if you DO manage to get to level 60+ and start trying to make a decent weapon. The enhancement system Nexon has cooked up in this title has a chance to utterly and outright destroy your weapons and or armor. You could easily be left with nothing. It's this kind of system that has filtered out many new players. I love vindictus but I can't stand nexon. They make a company like EA look like Heaven.			"

												It's good, but honestly the community is dead.  I've sunk a total of 1k hours, ( Vindictus wasn't attatched to my steam account for a couple years)  been playing since closed beta.Pros:The combat system is unbeatable for physics based combat. You can look hot af, and make money in the market if you learn how to grind in certain zones.It is possible to solo almost everything.Cons: End game, weapon +15 enhance gambling is cancer. This is where you'll end up spending hella money. Imo you only need +10 anyways, which is possible without purchaing things.Content gets borring and repetitive fast, once you hit late game, there's only so many times you can do daiy raids before you have to haitus the game till next content update, which is like on a quarterly basis in a year.Despite the scathing remarks I have about it though, I reccomend anyone who ike dynamic combat systems and nice graphics to give this game a shot, its pretty damn good.

												Behold Nexon, killer of souls!Back when I played this a few years ago, people were constantly getting hacked, bots and gold sellers made up about 98% of the population, playing end-game content for literally hundreds of hours only ever got me ONE part out of about 20 required for crafting a SINGLE PIECE of end-game equipment, people would constantly boot me out of parties because I didn't have high enough stats to rush the bosses... My crowning achievement was getting a crappy Scythe to +13, and it took me literally dozens of Scythes and millions of gold worth of enhancement stones, and I couldn't take it any farther because the in-game economy crashed after a new wave of gold seller bots arrived, making enhancement stones cost dozens of times more than they had only a few days prior.I knew people who had submitted support tckets over two YEARS prior to the point where they finally got a response that summed up to ""Your ticket was just discovered as being REALLY old, so we're deleting it. Please submit a new ticket.""The gameplay is AMAZING in this game, until you reach the 60+ level range, AKA the endgame. At that point you can expect to find:   - Unblockable attacks  - Instakill attacks  - Unblockable instakill attacks  - Loot drops with chances of under 1% from raids you can only perform once per account per day  - Enemies that require enchantments and enhancements to even DAMAGE, and both of those upgrades can destroy your equipment entirely based solely on RNG, and even when they don't kill your equipment they'll still more than likely fail to do anything and just eat a hole in your gold purse  - Horrible lag from incredibly bad code  - Experience gains rivaling the speed of the receding glaciers after the end of the Ice Age  - And so much more!Meanwhile you'll wait months for updates only to find out that now your character and all your hard earned gear is utterly useless thanks to ""balance"" patches, and the new ""content"" is even harder to obtain than the last.I could go on for days with horror stories of how bad it ends up, so I'll sum it up here:Fun to play up to level 60, after which it become naught but pain and pay2win.If all of this sounds like it would entertain you, SEEK PSYCHIATRIC HELP.For everyone else? AVOID. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.			"

												I no longer recommend this game because of Nexon's unjust January 2017 perma-ban of player Sanitee.As a Vindictus fan from 2012, I have seen countless players (including myself) leave Vindictus, only to return for its unique combat. It has a medieval taste to it, your actions have weight, and it's dodge or die. The fluid combat system relies on building combos with the mouse instead of your MMO-1 through 9 keys. Gameplay relies on timing dodges and slamming combos in between.Sanitee created fansites, contest-winning art, YouTube channels, and databases FOR THE COMMUNITY. Forum moderation deletes negative threads and difficulty working with customer service creates a global sensation that the players are not cared about.P2W? More like pay to get ahead or pay to look pretty. Real cash cannot save you from end-game gear-destroying RNG. Real world currency can buy rare cosmetics to sell for in game currency to buy pro level equips. Feel free to be the cheapskate we all are, grind your gear for free, but the eye-candy cosmetics for $10 are hard to resist. It's just as enjoyable F2P.The real game is in finding your friends to stand by your side in the dungeons. The story is about humanity's war to find peace, there are movies and voice-overs, and regular updates from the Korean version. Bring a friend and you'll love it, or you'll quit and end up coming back for the Dark Souls gameplay.Nexon though? I would like to see them contact myself and the community about Sanitee's ban. Until then, this negative review stands, warning new players of your reputation.			"

												PLEASE READ MY ENTIRE POST. THERE ARE PARTS OF THIS GAME THAT I DO RECOMMENDThis game used to be great. Now its a unoptimized, lagging, 90% P2W fest.Wind the clock back a few years (to a time before it was on Steam) This game was amazing and I put easily another 200 hours into the game in addition to the hours shown on Steam.Take Dark Souls combat, speed it up by 10x and give it more depth. Add some of the most badass music, awesome enemies, and the most flashy/beautiful combat animations and graphics and you had Vindictus at its peak.Heck it was just barely grindy, it had awesome combat, every fight felt awesome, you looked awesome, you felt awesome.In fact, to this day/time I've posted this review, I still have yet to find an MMO with combat as engaging, dynamic and as action packed as Vindictus.Tera? Blade and Soul? PFFFT, not even close to the speed and fluidity of Vindictus.But now to the present. Vindictus has gone down hill, and Nexons only fked up it further with their greedy♥♥♥♥♥cashgrabbing.First off, as I've said before, the game lags like♥♥♥♥♥♥now for larger raids (it used to be so much more fluid). Only the smaller runs retain most of the fluidity.I have 55.80Mbps download speed, and 9.85Mbps upload speed with 12MS ping. I'm also running a pretty high end gaming setup, over $1k easilyAnd this game is still choppy as hell on LOW-MED settings. Not matter how badass your combat is if your frames are♥♥♥♥♥♥and everything is teleporting/choppy as fk the game will still feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥2nd off. 90% P2W. The community can be very elitist. and I mean VERY elitist.If you don't hit a certain level of attack, they will kick you out of the raiding party. Why? Because if you don't have good damage, the end game bosses take forever to kill. Why are they made to be so hard to kill? Well because Nexon wants to sell you stuff for real moneyOften times you needed to enhance your weapons to +11 atleast. And guess what. The success chance for said enhances are stupidly low.Why are they stupidly low? So Nexon can sell you items that can ""protect"" your items from being destroyed when you fail a high level enhance. AND THEY ARE ONLY 1 TIME USESIn short, if you do not spend real money on buying Nexon's items to insure your weapons (which you grinded weeks for btw), you are relying on a very unfavourable RNG system that will most likely destroy your weapon.I've asked a lot of high level players about how much they've spent on these ""protection"" items for their weapons. the majority of them have spent over 100 DOLLARS.And guess what? THEY THINK IF YOU DON'T SPEND THE MONEY YOU JUST AREN'T DEDICATED ENOUGH!Here is a direct quote from one of them said: ""If you like the game and want to get better then you should be spending money. If you're not gonna spend money that just means you aren't dedicated enough, 100 dollars means nothing if you are dedicated enough""So I'm not joking when I said a large amount of the community is elitist. Nexon is just feeding off this way of thinking, just like Konami is with Yugioh. Both communities believe that you need to spend a lot of money constantly to be good.So. finally, the question you are probably looking for: Is this game worth playing?Yes, and No.From levels 1-50 this game hella fun and I would recommend it to everyone for sure. This is a prime example of hack and slash combat done right. And you will still feel awesome when playing this game (when it doesn't lag)9-10/10 at this point. But this doesn't last too long btw, the majority of the time is still in late late gamefrom levels 50-60, the flaws start showing but this game is still decent. It gets a bit more grindy here but still a solid 8/10 when it doesn't lag60-70. the game just takes a sudden drop, and♥♥♥♥♥♥gets surpringly grindy. And with bigger raids the lag really starts to creep inI'd recommend you stop playing by the end of this point. 5-6/1070-80-90 is the grinding pay to win fest. If you don't have +11s, chances are, you're getting kicked out of every end game boat unless you meet some truly kind people.In order to excel in these levels you need to1. Have a lot of disposable income, 2. find someone willing to sell their old weapons for ingame cash (get ready to gold farm)3. get lucky as fk with the RNG system and +11 your stuff unprotected (PS: GL with that)4-5/10			"

												The thing that makes Vindictus so dissapointing is that somewhere amid the tedium and endless grind for items in the late game and the boring mindless hack n' slash of the early game areas, there's something that's actually worth playing. It's hard to recommend because anyone playing it will be forced to spend their first ten hours just mashing their mouse buttons - completely mindlessly - while killing through a slew of enemies that have about as much chance of posing a threat as a limbless toddler. Their last ten hours will be spent running the same five bosses over and over again in the hopes that they get drops decent enough to actually play more of the game before they finally quit. But it's the five to ten hours somewhere in the middle there that are worth talking about. The gameplay (when you manage to get to it) is actually great. Much /much/ better than any other action MMO I've ever played (and I've played a lot of them.) It's challenging, fast-paced, and has the highest skill-ceiling of any game of its type, including more single-player oriented games like Dark Souls. It's incredibly fun and rewarding, and completely blows games like Tera, GW2, Blade and Soul, and Dragon's Nest away. Like, its so much better that there's just genuinely no contest. It's the kind of gameplay I can't help but think other games would emulate, if the rest of Vindictus wasn't absolute trash. Getting on a boat and riding somewhere instanced (with multiple semi-long loadscreens in-between) would be bad enough; but add to that the worst difficulty curve of any game I've ever played, and there's an even more serious problem. I've seen more than one review on here talking about the game being a boringly-easy hack n' slash because they quit after five or so hours and never hit the meat of the game. Which is completely understandable considering I did too the first 2 or 3 times I ever played it. Then I'd see youtube videos of someone fighting a giant boss that actually seemed hard, and I'd think, 'wow! That looks awesome! Where the hell was that when I was playing?' Leading to a re-download. See, there are really cool bosses in Vindictus that eventually get extremely hard, but unfortunately they're all hidden behind 10+ hours of dungeons full of trash mobs that the average player could kill their way through while blindfolded. The worst part is, there's very little in-between. It's straight from too-easy trash mobs to 'THIS GUY IS GONNA WRECK YOU!!' It's like playing hours of tutorial level content, only to suddenly hit the final boss who promptly pushes your♥♥♥♥♥♥in. Ultimately though, the thing that really kills the game for me is the end-game. You're cruising along. You managed to slog your way through the boring early stuff and get to real bosses, and suddenly the game is fun. The last five or so hours have been a totally sweet boss-bonanza. You're thinking to yourself, 'wow, thank god I played through all that boring stuff to get here! This game is secretly amazing!' But there's a problem. You've started to notice something. The bosses you fight as you progress are doing more and more damage, and you're doing less and less of it in return. You're becoming a burden to any group you join because you need reviving after one hit, and barely do any damage even when playing perfectly. So the problem becomes clear. Your gear is bad - you need new stuff. Simple fix right? There's just one problem. To continue progressing with the fun parts of the game, you're looking at 20 hours of farming the same bosses over and over again. Minimum. Like, with super luck, you're looking at 20 hours. More likely is something like 60 to 80. To put it simply: this kills the game. I tried. I really did. The fun parts of the game were /so/ fun. They were enough to rekindle the enjoyment I got from playing games - something I haven't really felt since playing Demon's Souls back in 2009. But it wasn't enough. After 10 or so hours of farming, I quit, leaving numerous bosses un-battled and the game un-finished. It's really disappointing, because the festering bloated body of Vindictus hides a skeleton of gameplay that could have been truly great - were the thing placed around it not a disgusting lump of awfulness.

												It's fun, but in the long run you will be crippled if you're unwilling to spend money The combat system is honestly one of the best I've played for an MMO, even beating out melee oriented action games of the singleplayer variety. The characters have unique playstyles, stylish moves and a great degree of combat is based on player skill. Some of the boss battles are insanely fun, and the fights are engaging so you dont feel like you're just stabbing a giants toe until he keels over. One character can even use his strength to stop certain boss attacks mid-swing and enter a clash of strength if you can time it correctly. It feels pretty badass to save a party member from a potentially fatal blow and in the process hold the boss down for your other teammates to kick his♥♥♥♥♥♥inUnfortunately these attributes are hampered by the fact that end game content is severely walled off. Most of the end game raid partys which are level 80-90 will require a high amount of ATT stat (which is what attack damage is based on), to the point where if you dont upgrade your weapons, its unlikely you will break that ceiling. Although this sounds normal the problem lies hereUpgrading your gear is EXTREMELY RNG dependant. The blacksmith may weaken your items durability and reset all enhancements hes previously done on it back to 0, or just outright destroy it at higher ranks. The magician can enchant your item with special qualities, but once again this is RNG dependant and can damage your gear if it fails. But of course there is a way to prevent these outcomes: $$MONEY$$If you want any realistic chance of upgrading your rare and difficult to obtain weapon to a respectable level, you will NEED either cash shop items or a large amount of resources and attempts. Dont think for a second that other people dont use these items either, pretty much everyone you see will have at least +8 weapons on high level raids. You CAN get these items from events, but they are one use only and quite rare. They aren't guaranteed successes either, they just protect your weapon from getting damaged, so you could stockpile 4 of them from events and level milestones only to reach enhancement level 7. The game would be a 9/10 for me if it wasnt so dependant on RNG to make progress late game. You can try it up to around level 70, before the RNG kicks in too hard, but after that I wouldn't recommend it. But if you like to gamble or have a plenty of cash on hand, go for it.if you think I'm overblowing the whole RNG thing, you can check the wiki for the RNG tables yourself : http://vindictus.gamepedia.com/Item_Enhancement  But keep in mind, the upgrades are not equally spread, so going from +2 to +3 doesnt have anywhere near the same effect as going from +6 to +7TL:DR End game is a slot machine for necessary gear upgrades, and the community is on life support since black desert came out			"

You may think I mean crafting, but no. Crafting is the easy part.The real price of playing this game is your entire life. The amount of time it takes you to pray to RNG GOD for him to bless you with enough drops to afford your best 90 gear is the same amount of time it takes the average human born, to die.You will die playing this game. This game will ♥♥♥♥ you until you are sucked dry of your emotions and you become an endless farming machine, you will become a slave to NEXON and their NX prices, praying to get money to buy enchanting runes so you don't break your gear while crafting. You will spend the same amount of time getting to max level, adding +1000 dmg to your weapon by enhancing it. Did I mention, if your RNG fails you have to start all over? You do.I ♥♥♥♥ing hate this game but it keeps calling me back for more. I lay in bed and I can't sleep. My daily raids that I can run twice a day call out to me, begging me to run them, begging me to crawl endless dungeons in hope for shining gold, an enchant scroll, a piece of loot that I can finally feel good about the many years it will take to buy that endgame gear. I've sacrificed my friends and drank various blood potions to be blessed with good luck, nothing has worked. I've begged ferghus to ""Welcome me to the forge"" dozens of times. All I can do with the rest of my life is pray to God I will make some ♥♥♥♥ing money. The combat is pretty fun, though. Would reccomend, 10/10.			"

												I've played this game since CBT and it's been awesome. It is a very fast paced action oriented MMO. To be honest, I didn't pay much attention to the story as I played it like Monster Hunter. I enjoyed this game even without the story. The beginning can be very dull but it gets better later on. Having friends and guild members to mess around with in instances and raids definitely makes a difference. There won't be much players on lower level instances for the most part unless there's going to be a new character released. Expect to grind for materials for armor unless you have the cash to buy it. Disclaimer: I haven't played the game too much after season 2 arrivedPros:- Unique and fun Characters- Character skills are awesome- Each Character has a choice between two weapon types- Amazing visuals- Combat is fluid and fast- Very challenging (soloing instances, raids etc)- There's a storyline- Perverted camera at the end of each instance- No more token system- Spin to win (go play spear Lann, though you probably will get kicked from raids)Cons:- Gender locked (for those who have problems with this)- Lag/DC out of an instance (I remember the servers lagged pretty hard and everyone was trying to crash it because it wasn't getting restarted)- Grind fest- Pay to win (can buy revives and instant potions to your advantage)- Enhancing/Enchanting weapons may require you to spend real cash (not required though as it just increase the chances of success)- You have to go through the cut scene on the boat every time :/- Can't hide megaphone chatIf none of the cons bother you, check it out its an amazing game.

												Another peg in the belt of ""Why would anyone play a nexon game?""Game seemed fun gameplay-wise, but for some reason they decided to remove all gold value from items and missions for the first XX levels of the game, so as a new player you can't buy any gear, craft, buy potions, basically do anything. I guess they did it to fight gold farming bots, which doesn't seem to have done anything because I still saw gold spammers. All it did was make the bots change their farming strategy and make the new player experience awful.TL;DR: Nexon doesn't care about their customers. Nexon doesn't care about making good games. Nexon cares about making money. Do not play Nexon games.			"

												Great gameplay trapped inside a horrible game.  If you value gameplay, then play it since it is very good, but everything else about the game is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥  If your starting out get ready to have a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of fun till the mid 20s then get ready to wait for the chance to ever group within any else till 60s for the raids, as they community is not very active between those two spots.  If you can make it to 60 get ready to die a lot and do nothing in the raids till you get decent equipment from doing them a lot.  But if you can make it up there and get decent equipment then the game becames a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of fun as the raid bosses are a lot of fun with the gameplay and are the best part of the game.  Having played since the orginal NA launch and seen the game evolve I can say that if you make it up there and beat all of the raid bosses and get good equipment, get ready to wait several monthes for them to add anything new.  Also you WILL buy virtual underwear eventually since the ingame default is horrible and seeing everyone else without them makes you feel terrible.			"

												The game was pretty awesome during the first several years since (open/closed) beta. However, now the game is obviously suffering from many afflictions that a MMO goes through going past it's prime. Events are no longer entertaining or worth doing, events have been degraded to the point where it's either free consumables from cash shop, increased EXP/AP/Raid Counts etc, or cash shop sales. Typical blatant cash grabs by Nexon in the form of in-game pets or vanity sets, seriously $30 for vanity set? Being able to run the later raids especially in Season 2 requires excellent gear, most of which will be forever out of a large majority of player's reach, unless you buy gold... The inflation in this game is pretty bad but maybe not as ridiculous as other MMOs but new player's have almost no chance. Population decline.The actual gameplay revolving around 3rd person camera is actually quite good, it is very reminiscent and similar to how Ninja Gaiden operates. Overall a MMO that had great potential but is marred by Nexon's incompetence and/or greed in addition to the inevitable degenerative effects of human nature...			"

												At the beginning, this game was really good and I had a lot of fun with it. The publisher has the same mentality as the guys over at Continent of the 9th, they give no ♥♥♥♥♥ about there fanbase. I have gone into the forums and complained about the server instability issues, hackers plagued this game back in the day, dunno if it's still apparent. Knowing the publisher, probably is. I promise this wont be a story book to read. Pay 2 win cash shop, mixed with server issues and no communication from publisher to consumer. This game is actually really fun, but lacks on so much.  Blade and Soul is so much better then this, both on cash shop and servers.  Nexon, just go under financially and go away, stop ruining these games.			"

												First off, this game is great with friends. Level 1-50 is easy.  At level 50, you unlock ""Hero"" mode which makes the game harder and much more fun (if you have the gear). This game has its flaws but I don't know a game that doesn't. If you want to give this game a fair shot level to 50 and play a couple of the battles on ""Hero"" and join some raids. This will give you a pretty good idea of what to expect for end-game content.I recommend finding a good guild through the Vindictus website or in-game using the ""Search Guild"" function. You can also see if any guild is advertising with the !megaphone (purple font) as well.One of the biggest strengths of this game is the story. At first, it begins kind of slow but it really picks up towards the end. If anything, get through all of that and if you STILL don't like the game then quit. It's relatively easy to solo all the missions because of different settings. Or better yet, grab a few friends or find people in-game to complete the story together.The flaws or drawbacks is random lag spikes/fps drops, not a very vocal community (there are some bots wandering around), and high level end game content requires a lot of rare gear to participate in. Money shop is a little on the expensive side but it doesn't necessarily unbalance the game to my knowledge.Love it or hate it. Just give it a try.			"

												was fun until had a taste of the business model of nexon, you see at end game, you need to enchant and enhance your gears for a effective amount of defense and offense, the top tier level of enchantment has a success rate capped at 40%, since i was bored, i spent 80+ dollar irl money to try to put a top tier enchantment on my weapon, after failed like 6-7 time in a roll (theoretically, chance of that happening is around 5% ), i decide to quit, i know nexon need to make money from this game but 40% cap just isnt fare for the players, not to mention it's p2w in a way, and who knows what the actual ratio they have for those sort of things, i understand that if i grind long enough i can buy those enchanted gears with in game money, but i'm not that type of gamerdon’t get me wrong, the game itself was a heck load of fun, reminds me of dark souls(my fav ps3 game!) but the business model is just horrible in my opinion, not gonna bother with another game with such aspect, i strongly appreciate and enjoy business model from Path of exile and dota, truly pay to look cool, for those game, i spent money to support and enjoying them, but in vindictus, i wanted to support this game, but most of my cash ended up on enchant and enhance runes, and no matter success or not with enchanting and enhancing, i hate myself for doing that, and i don’t want to have such a feeling when i play games, so i decide to say farewell and write my first review, if you hate p2w, just play this game as a free game and never spend money other than cosmeticsalso it crashes alot, i mean for a 5 year old game this one crashes way too often, not just me(i also have alright gaming desktop, alienware x51, nothing fancy, but more than enough to run this game), a well knowing issue, could be the crappy server. fps drops for host in certain areas, which can make the whole party lag, a friend lost bunch of mats for crafting gears due to server lag, though i never had that issue, overall, i give it a ""no"", unless u truly love its art/fighting style, otherwise go try something else, make yourself happy when you play games			"

												Now, before you end up complaining about my hours and the negative review, let me just start this off with, I actually really loved and actually still do enjoy playing this game.        But, there is this little thing I like to call caring about your consumers. The Player appreciation event would've been better off being called the ""player depreciation event"". The contents they gave out during that event were not very good and not really even worth it really, plus this event happened right after an event that went completely downhill in the last few days. Several of my friends stopped playing after that even because of how big of a♥♥♥♥♥♥off it was.       Now let me tell you of this event. It was a bingo event, aka for this game, kill specific monsters on certain days, collect a number, and bingo at the end. I'm ok with  level cap for events but don't you dare put it on the last 3 days to make all the lower level people who really wanted the event rewards to be completely crushed. Because, I don't know if you know or not, but not EVERYONE pays in a free to play game, hence the ""F2P"".     Now that is not even the worst part. On the forums, you can clearly see multiple people complaining about the level cap randomly popping out of nowhere, and you can also see people who got the numbers that was currently impossible to obtain by their level be complaining to support in time. But you know what? They nitpicked and only gave it to the people who cried about it. Because you know what? After a ton of people complain about the level cap and not getting the numbers, lets not give everyone below x number the numbers. Because you know someone who isn't doing the event isn't gonna benefit from the numbers while people who were crushed can actually get what they deserve.      Now if you like hack and slashes then by all means play the game. I like it, and would like to play more. But the fact that they literally don't care about their consumers really. Their servers are pretty trash as well. So I would love to play more, but I just can no bring myself to play anything unless they figure a good way out to repay for the trashy excuses they have pulled out of their ***** and their garbage player ""appreciation"" event/events in general. They only care towards their paying players, everyone else can pretty much just♥♥♥♥♥♥off in their eyes.			"

												Before I begin I would like to say I have many more hours on an actual vindictus account and have played since beta. I would not recommend this game as there is a huge grind to get anything once you hit level 50 and the community is extremely elitist. Nexon as a company also does a terrible job maintaining the NA servers and responding to any and all tickets. The game itself is not bad but the experience is completely ruined by a poor company and a terrible community.			"

												-This is from a non-subscriber point of view-      I can agree with what most other are saying about the title. Overall, It's very fun and engaging. It allows you to have a sense of acomplishment and excitement about your character throughout the initial stages of the game. The content is very interesting if you read the dialogue, and I believe it can appleal to fast pace action fans and rpg fans alike. However, in my opinion, from lvl 30 and on is where you begin to realise your character is starting to buckle.     I myself, as a non paying player, followed several online guides related to my class in order to obtain the ""optimal"" skill levels and gear necessary for comfortable to advanced gameplay. Getting as close to these recommendations as possible, I continued to progress my character. After breezing through the first couple of chapters being able to solo all of the content on ""hard"" difficulty, I found it more and more necessary to have others in your party to be able to make any progress through higher tiers of content. This is completely understandable for ""Raid"" and other missions requiring exceptional damage output. However, the fact that I am not able to gear my character appropriately with that stats on the gear that I can OPENLY obtain, makes it extremely difficult to be of any significant value to other players who have donated personal funds to advance their character as such. Therefore, I feel it's going to take more than an average ""casually serious"" player, to be able to have any inforcing role in true end-game content. My positive recommendation would be for any player not wanting to progress seriously, or any willing to pay for a more serious, exciting end game experience. Simple as that. It's true, there are elitist jerks in the community who want to demoralize you and make you feel like less of a person through a video game. This can be said with any MMO ever released, but it's your game that this company released for free for YOU. You should be able to play it the way YOU want to. However, unless you are able to pay a premium, you will never live up to the expectation of your fellow gamer. It's very sad that a gaming community has come to this, but what can we do as players?     That being said, I will continue to play the game FOR FREE and document my experiences and how I am able to proess as a casual, non-paying player. Cheers!			"

												3000h+ edit \o/Very well-done Korean Hack n Slash MMO-RPG Co-op game. I've been playing since Closed Beta, there are ups and down such as usual lags that most of Free-to-Play games tend to have, games combat area is hosted by a player rather then Vindictus server, so connection between you and the host tend to be very important. Just to note, when they have outfits on sale for limited time only, they mean it, those things never comes back on sale except on very rare cases. (real money outfits. If its rune of some sort, high chance it will be back later on but not often.)To answer if this game is Pay To Win, I would rather say this game is more of Luck to Win. There are so many RGN (Random Generated Number?) things are there, such as 95% of raid drops, which you kinda want a good drop for money if you do not want to farm (personally I dont think Vindictus is a farming game, its a bit hard to 'farm' and time consuming compare to other mmo) However this doesnt really happen often that sometime you wont even really get anything thats worth a money untill couple month later of running every daily raids.Above RNG drop rate is to change with new sealshop update so anyone who bother to farm raids for a month can have full geared 80 set.  Enhancing (Success rate 100% -> 75% -> etc etc decrease down to 40%)Enchanting (Depends on Ranks, and your input. Almost everything thats useful enchants have 40~50% rate of success and it can blow off your equipments when not used with rune)I would say Enchancing and Enchanting is the number one reason why people come to quit this game.Infusion (Either gives you crappy♥♥♥♥♥stat or even negative stat) Ofcourse, all of above doesnt matter (enhancing/enchanting/Infusion) as much if you are not one of those 'elite' people. (..I kinda am)Characters have their own name(other then the one that you name. People call out the characters given name to defind their 'Class'), and are gender locked. I didnt really mind about Gender-locked system since I was never really bothered by 'I really wish I could play as a female/male character' All 8 Character have their personal weapons that does have very different characteristic and I suggest you try other 'class' if you do not like the one you've chosen.So far in order of release - Lann(M) - Dual Sword (Shares with Vella)/Dual Spear Fiona(F) - Hammer/Sword + Small Shield/Large Shield (Large shield is practically useless)Evie(F) - Staff / Scythe Karok(M) - Pillar/Blaster Kai(M) - Bow/Crossgun  Vella(F) - Dual Sword (Weapon is Shared with Lann)/Dual Chain Hurk(M) - Great Sword Lynn(F) - Battle GlaiveCombat system is very well done I always comes back to Vindictus due to its unique combat system thats rarely found in any other MMO RPG. Very awesome effects but carries counter side. Sometimes raid becomes messive 'Wherethefkistheboss' situation when the boss happened to be a human character size. There is an option to not show other players effect but human size monsters are still not visible when its inbetween 5,6 characters.)Because you have to time and counter/block enemy attack when required, its hard to do so with bad connection. Since servers are not provided except in 24men raids, connection between you and the host tend to be reallllllllly important. You will NOT be able to move when its a crucial movement, and attack if you are running with someone thats not able to host or in long distant area from you. Story, you will love the story compare to other mmos if you are interested in reading them. There are two story, Season One, and Season Two. Its easily explained like a quest in any MMO, where main character is asked to take A or B route. So those who take Season 1 would be considered as they have taken A route when those who take on Season 2 would be considered as they have taken B route. Which one is better? Personally I will say Season One. I just couldnt come to like of Season Two. Season One however is very very well done in my opinion, I suggest everyone to read them.There will be couple areas player come to be bored for the new players and quits mostly in that area which is around level 25 ~ 35 esh. However real game starts over level 60+, I suggest anyone that plays to take time and play up to 60 where they can start the raids. You like dress-up games? because Vindictus do a good job of it. Yea sure they do have couple outfits you have to buy in real money to enjoy your new look, but there are only maybe 3-4 outfits thats not limited time only and all of them arnt really customizable compare to the ones that you can get from in-game. They do have stats attached to them however they arnt so game changing, limited outfits does have higher stats, but personally I dont see much difference, it helps for lower ATT users to join higher req dungeons which is set by another player. (Limited time only outfits have 500+ ATT/MATT increase) Games town really have nothing to see if you are into looking for every single details. the very first town we incounter is the most populated place and people tend to hang around there, making new friends, untill they find a guild that is active and have their 'own' channel. Community is.. bad..? Im not sure honostly, since I've found my 'buddies' shortly after started playing this game. I did play around in Vindictus offcial community forum as Seanna, translating Kr stuff. But I got busy and stopped translating things. When sometime I visit the forum, it kinda shows that they arnt taking care of their forum that much. As long as you find group that you like, you probably wont really care about the rest of community.			"

												This game breaks my heart. It has the best fighting system in any free to play game i have ever seen. It is faster, more simple, more intuitive, and requires much more skill on the player's part.There are very few hot-bar skills. For the most part, you control every step, hit, and dodge. And there is an impact every time you hit something combined with realistic blood splotches, very rewarding. Also, there is a fighting style for anyone.but... To unlock the full potential of your character, you have to grind to 52 just to use all your skills. From there, you probably need to reach level cap and grind for many days more to rank these skills up to the point where you can fight effectively (i.e. Battle Respiration and Stamina Mastery. If you are a melee character and you dont have these maxed, you will have some trouble keeping up with certain bosses). But even when you have maxed all of your skills and can use your character effectively, you will be hard-pressed to get into a raid party simply because you might not have the stats necessary. So how do you get stats? You get it with very expensive and rare gear. This gear is simply unobtainable to casual players who dont want to spend money. Nexon wants their money...The game does have a saving grace, however, and this is why I love it. There are some great guilds out there that are willing to help out new players with leveling, gearing, money earning, and enjoying the game. Many powerful guilds will be willing to take under-geard folks into end-game raids for chances at loot and practice. Any active guild will, to some degree, fulfill most of Nexon's shortcomings and make the game fun (I say ""most"" because there are problems that NOBODY can fix like server issues).If you are interested in playing, find a guild and be active in it. They will treat you well and you will have a good time.(Good Guilds: Colossus/Wanton, Citadel, E S P A D A, Sweg, Peace, StormWingsv3, VforVindictus, and many more that you will discover with experience +wink)			"

												I actually would really like to give this game a thumbs up. I have a couple hundred hours in the game (probably an extra 400) before they reached out to Steam. The combat is unlike anything I've ever experienced in another game. The reason why I give this a thumbs down is the enhancement/enchantment methods that are practically required in order to access the ""end game"" content... but for starters, I'll talk about what is good about the game.TL;DR. The game is designed for you to use the cash shop in order to progress without relying on luck. However, the cash shop is so bad, it keeps away players, but since this is a free to play game, it's also the only thing keeping it alive.Well, the only 3 good things about the game...1: The combat is just.. how do I explain... the hitboxes are clean, the invulnerability dodge ticks are cleaner, character movement and enemy movement is spectacular. It's a hack and slash game that is really good at hacking and slashing with an attempt to tie in RPG elements before and after battles. I don't care much for story in games, but for this story it's interesting. The combat is the only reason why I sometimes think about coming back to this game.2: Copious amounts of customization. Hundreds of hairstyles, tattoo styles, facial customization, armor and weapon transmogrification, etc.3: Every couple of months they have an event that gives you free stuff from their shop.Now for the negatives.1: Player base. There are more people on World of Warcraft private servers than on this game for Christ's sake. I think the peak (last time I played it which was spring of 2016 was like 700 players online, and a few of them were gold-farming bots) A majority of content after around lvl 50, you'll need friends or randoms to help get through dungeons/quests. You'll  be lucky to find any, as most people are veterans and are just constantly doing end-game content.2: Store prices are insane. The few people who do buy a crapload of stuff from the store are the people basically keeping this game afloat. I'm talking about 5 bucks for a single piece of armor transmog. There is Helmet, Chest, Legs, Gloves, Boots... so we're talking 20 dollars for a full-body customization that only applies to one character. Armor and weapon enhancement/enchantment varies if you fail or not. (I'll get to that later). Character re-customization is also extremely expensive. Like I said before, the character customization is a plus for this game, but you only have access to around 10 hairstyles. The other 40+ must be bought. Same with tattoos, and underwear. I'm talking like 20 bucks just to change a hairstyle.. nothing to laugh about.3: The armor and weapon enhancement. The system goes as follows:Armor and Weapons can be ENHANCED from +0 to +15 (0 being worst, 15 being best)Armor and Weapons can be ENCHANTED using scrolls from rank F, E, D, C, B, A, 9, 8, 7. (F being worst, 7 being best)For Enhancement = first 3 levels are guaranteed. Levels 4-5, you can fail, the rank goes down by 1 and item durability decreases permanently. Levels 6-8, you can fail and the rank goes back down to 0 and item durability decreases permanently. Levels 9-15, you can fail and the item is destroyed. You can get it back, after spending a fortune. ONCE. Fail again, and you lose the item permanently.For Enchantment = rank F-A, you can fail and the scroll is destroyed, but the item loses durability. Rank 9-7, both the scroll and item are destroyed. You can get the item back (not the scroll), but again, you must pay a fortune.. ONCE.Fail again, you lose it permanently.The risk and reward for doing this is so out of balance, it's not worth playing the game. The risk being, you've just destroyed your item that you've farmed for weeks, maybe months... the reward being.. you gain minor stats.Here's where they get you though. They have these ""enhancement runes"" and ""enchantment runes"" that you can purchase to protect your item from being destroyed. If you fail, the rune is destroyed instead. You can see now how this can be quite costly. I've put 30 bucks in this game just to see all 5 of my runes get destroyed, and then my item destroyed afterwards.Now imagine being me, except do that about 6 more times. (I learned my lesson about spending money the second time I tried enhancing items... everything afterwards was free stuff from events that the game held and gave out free stuff, but I had to wait months and months just to acquire all the necessary materials) It's completely random as to who gets what they want. We have me, who has destroyed item after item trying to get the necessary stats to access end-game content... then we have a friend of mine who gets a +15 weapon on his second try. There's no skill involved. Just luck. Too much luck. That's why I can't stand this game. I love it but I hate it more than I love it. This is the main reason I decide not to get back into the game.4: Professions are just wierd. There's an NPC that can craft everything for you, the only difference between learning a profession and crafting something using the NPC is that using the profession uses less materials, and takes way longer to craft. Problem is, you will always out-progress your profession, so you are way too far ahead of your profession, causing you to either backtrack to farm materials or get rich and just buy your way through. The main problem I have with professions though, is that the higher your skill, the longer it takes to craft. At the later stages of training professions, you'll be crafting something for a solid half hour. I'm not even joking.. like literally 32 minutes of standing there waiting for you to craft some high level gloves. You'll literally have to alt+tab and like watch a couple youtube videos, meanwhile, the NPC can make it instantly.5: ""Battle Supplies Surprise."" It's an option in the cash shop to purchase a box that can give you random gear. The chance is pretty low to obtain the gear, but when you do get it, you can sell it to players for quite a bit of money. Back when this first came out, the max level in the game was level 80. The box released level 80 gear. People would buy these boxes and just rely on luck to get their level 80 items instead of farm for them. So at that point in time it was pay to win... but when they increased the max level to 90, it's not so bad. (I view it as a negative because it once represented a pay to win aspect, which imbalanced the game's marketplace)6: The discrepancy between armor tiers. From character level 1-60, you have armor sets every 4-6 levels. You're improving at a steady rate, it's nice and flows easy. After level 60, you get nothing until 70. After 70, nothing until 80. After 80, nothing until 90. What's worse is, a +10 level 60 item is just as good as a +0 level 70 item. A +10 level 70 item is as good as a +0 level 80 item. A +10 level 80 item is just as good as a +0 level 90 item. So there's no real reason to even enhance or enchant a weapon/armor piece until you reach level 90. The problem is, if you don't enhance, you'll fall behind in the quests that require level 70 and higher. You're going to have to enhance weapons at the least in order to progress steadily, or get carried by someone that's a higher level than you... so you better prepare to either lose your weapon or purchase enhancement runes from the ever so lovely cash shop.7: Optimization. If you have a potato, don't download this game. It really dumps on your CPU. Hard.8: Nexon. Horrible customer service (probably because they have only like 10 people working on the entire game) known for their cash-grab schemes.9: Pathetic excuse of a PvP system. It's buggy, laggy, and extremely imbalanced. There are only 3 classes (out of 9) that can win a fight. (For those that want to know, it's Evie, Karok and Hurk, and maybe a Lann, but only if you play like a god 100% of the time) It is perfectly clear that they only care about PvE.			"

												Vindictus is a very unique different type of MMO, considering how much i love MMO's now since i started playing this game, however only thing that buggs me is the system, Like Nexon probably one of the worst,their servers suck so bad. And the fact that stupid mail box crash glitch is still in place after a year or more is rediculous and shows how much they don't give 2 ♥♥♥♥♥ about this community and the performance but just want your money. Game sometimes crashes when i hit random reids and it's annoying because i can't get that huge xp, and having to restart my game is to uttering.But the game itself is amazing, the combat is really the best i seen on any mmo, the way they flinch after every attack and having to calculate how a boss moves or attacks. Defenitly a recommended game despite those negative features i listed above. However it is a pay2win game so you better get ready to spend some $$$. Maybe not pay 2 win in performance but defenitly pay 2 win in Appearance. But get the game and you'll be able to judge the game yourself or love it. Try it out!			"

												This is a game on the edge of greatness.The combat is unique and frankly unprecendented in the way it works for an MMO. So many MMO's claim they have good combat but it's just some version of the tired ""cooldown combat"" that WoW pioneered and everyone else either ran into the ground or at best made slightly more tolerable. This game has cooldowns I suppose but it's not just numbers and flashy effects. I played mostly as the sorceress and every spell was great. Supreme amounts of weight were behind every attack and the variety in spells was great. The other classes are almost as satisfying.But this is a Nexon game. The combat is good but other non-MMOs have better combat. And what Vindictus has can't carry the game through endless hours of grinding. I've had friends much better at tolerating it, and for some it is enough. With the right mentality it's possible to put 100's of hours into this game and enjoy it. I had fun too but the chasm was too deep for me.If you like Korean MMOs already and can tolerate all their usual garbage (grind or pay, limited time cash shop items, etc.) then you'll probably love this game. If you don't have that tolerance, run.			"

												Unfortunately, Vindictus is a game with some good mechanics and fun gameplay, but it's basically operated like a mobile IAP-based Android game. They give you a perchant chance of destroying items, even ultra-rare loot, when upgrading them, unless you buy a $25 item to prevent it.♥♥♥♥ that.			"

												pros:-fast paced combat-characters all feel fresh and unique-Free to play-Fairly enjoyable leveling process-Decent storycons-cash shop becoming more pay to win with stats on items-nexon has terrible customer service-grind grind grind-slow content updates, takes about 4-6 months a update-enhancing system is the worst-enchanting or enhancing requires money or you get lucky and risked blowing up items and destroying you characters equipment-servers are slow and constantly need fixes-Nexon customer service is awful. They do not have a line you can call and tickets can take 4+ months to get answered. I have had a ticket filed in june and not get answered till decenber.Overall I would not recomend this game due to the fact it will turn many people off once they hit the wall of end game grind and begin to understand how the cash shop effects the overall effectiveness of your character. But for the few people that are used to grinding and when I say grinding I mean doing the same content for months on end then this game will be good for you. I personally enjoyed this game when it was alive but now it has been slowly falling off and many of the players I use to play with and know are no longer playing this game.Free to play so in the end never hurts to play it and see for yourself.UPDATE: Just wanted to give an update if the game has changed at all and sadly it has not. Content still comes at a snails pace and NA servers are still a mess. The gameplay is still the main core of the game and makes it playable but the cons still weigh this title down. The main problem is how Nexon does not treat this game well, maintain, or improve it.Still does not hurt to try. Best way to find out if this game is for you is to try. Free so as long as you don't spen in the cash shop the game will cost you nothing and no harm in trying a free game.			"

												I have thousands of hours clocked into this game, way more than the amount I have on steam. This game is definately deserving of more players, but it's understandable why a lot of people quit, so I'll put down the common pros and cons.PROS-Honestly the best combat system for hack and slash on any free to play MMORPG I've ever seen.-Common events for players to help improve their gameplay and stats.-10+ different types of characters to play-A new character is released almost every year-The game gives you a training option to help improve your skill-Some events include expensive cash shop items that make it easier to get higher teir gear, but this is REALLY expensive.CONS-Dungeons of 4-8 players are run by hosts and not the servers-Royal raids of 16+ tend to be pretty laggy-Improving your stats can prove to be very annoying at the higher levels and really expensive.-Raids get very difficult around the level 80 mark, but never impossible-Characters are Gender lockedIt's easy to understand why a lot of people don't play Vindictus, or give up at higher levels; just remember that their are a lot of characters, you will eventually find the one for you.Cash Shop:The cash shop is very fair to people that don't use it. It's mainly cosmetic items and any items that help improve your stats don't reduce the in-game money cost to improve them, aside from the possible destruction of gear. There are some events that help remove the possibility of both gear and money loss, but these cash shop items are brutally expensive. There are common events as well that allow you to get cosmetic items without the need for using the cash shop, along with many other items in the cash shop.Difficulty:Starting off you will find that Vindictus is somewhat easy, but the more you progress the more you'll realise just how high of a difficulty the game can be. You will probably find bosses you think are impossible, but this can only be due to you using the wrong character, or not having the patience to learn the boss itself. I assure you that any boss can be fought with full confidence regardless of difficulty, it just takes time.Honestly worth playing, especially with the new type of events they started releasing that basically give you high grade gear for your level to help you start off and get used to the game.

												I've been playing this game for a few years at this point, and am motivated to leave this review in the wake of something that has happened in the community recently (which is why I installed the 'Steam version' to review it - because if you post anything 'negative' on channels they control they'll just delete it and ban you), though I will do my best to remain objective:Pros:*Great combat system.*Enough character/weapon types that you will probably find something you like.Cons:*Upgrading your gear usually destroys said gear (without using 'paid items').*The amount of RNG is nauseating.*'Paid' items are very expensive.*The security program the game uses (BlackCipher) is incredibly invasive in terms of what it scans and probably uses more CPU power than the actual games does. *The real 'con' of the game is that the Nexon NA staff seem to treat players/the community like 'annoyances' rather than an important part of the game. This once again was made clear very recently when a well known/helpful player that had already been falsely banned once (a improper ban that was overturned) was improperly banned again to which Nexon NA basically said, 'We've already fixed a mistake we made once, so we won't do it again.' What?? So if Nexon makes a mistake once it's 'hey we'll fix it"", but if they make a mistake twice it's, ""go pound sand'? Great system/people...That is the type of management this game has, beware.So it's worth giving a try, but not worth spending any money on.			"

												You could probably more than double my hours if you count the nexon launcher. Without leaving a super long review:The combat is great; 2017 and I still come back and play this game. Enough variety in characters and their respective mechanics. Newest raid is challenging and very rewarding to do, I wish all the content was this enjoyable, however...Progressing in this game is not easy. Lately they have been giving new players a chance to get free, high enhanced gear, but you still have to put in alot of hard work to farm gold to enchant your gear with endgame stats. You'll be re-running the same raids/battle over and over again, which is why I think the game has such a bad turnover rate for new players: current level content becomes stale before they can progress.The anticheat system is horrible and ,without getting into specific cases, has ruined alot of trust with veterans in general. Second ban is a permaban, and they won't bat an eyelash even if it was on their end. I would say to give this game a chance, but unless you have ALOT of time to farm gold, start off an old account or dump somekind of money in, prepare for a grind if you want endgame. Just try not to burn yourself out (unless you're a masochist). In the end just upgrade at your own pace and make the game enjoyable for yourself.			"

												I honestly am surprised I haven't made a review yet for this game considing how much I've played this. After getting past the boring first levels, you jump into a game of wonders filled with multiple fun events and fun bosses with the addition of a funny/intense story. I've never been in love with an MMO this much, and it was the first I've ever played. Honestly, many people hate on it and I guess I can see why, but that shouldn't stop you from trying the game. I really only have a few steam friends that have actually played the game for more than a few hours and would love to help any newcomers when available. If you do try the game, I recommend that you join the west server regardless of your area due to the fact that east server has less people and is dead for the most part (I even heard that they get less events). One of the negatives of the game I would have to say is that the game can have issues, moreso with the steam version, but if it becomes an issue using the non-steam version in the game files can be a better choice. Either way, I encourage anyone to try it out and my 1,000+ hours don't lie at all when I say I'm addicted.			"

												The hours on record does not reflect my actual game time.  I have played this game on and off for the past 6-7 years and reached end game with 6-7 different characters. I will list out the following pros and cons of the game and you can decide whether you want to try this game or not.Pros:- Looks amazing even comparing to many recently developed games- Action combat system is almost second to none- Good customization in terms of fashion- Continues to get updates from Korea (still very popular in Kr)- Raids are fun to doCons:- One of the worst publishers in terms of the following:     +Cash grab     +Very pay to win, you can instantly become the strongest player on the server as long as you pay     +Gachas... enough said     +Forcing you to install their anticheat program that is  borderline spyware (blackcipher)     +Extreme censorship on anything negative you say on their forums     +Some weird hatred on fansites and the length they go to ban the site owners - Game is dungeon based (can be a pro if you like this)- PVP is not balanced whatsoever, PVP is only done to trade wins in order to get rewards- Nexon NA- Nexon NA.. did I mention nexon NA?Bottom Line: Game itself is great, the publisher makes it unbearable.

												Game used to be amazing but up until the recent two or three years they jus stopped caring about their player base and ignoring us completely or banning us all on false accusations. I've spent about a thousand hours on this game before it popped up on steam so I hopped on to see if it had gotten any better but I was wrong. The game went from what was a semi pay to win to all out ""Give us all your money or you will not have fun""			"

												Great RPG. One of my favorite combat systems. But then Nexon had to ruin it by being Nexon. 3/10Worth downloading for a weekend of questing with friends but won't last you much longer than that. As others have mentioned, highly restricted free-to-play,  need to pay to really play the game, pay-2-win, pay-2-be-pretty, ect. And unfortunately none of these payments comes w/ customer service. You will eventually need customer service. And when you do, Nexon WONT help you. Good luck, if you decide to play this game seriously.			"

												I have played this game for 3 years, so do not pay attention to the time counter on Steam, because this was just available after the EU service migration.Vindictus has certainly one of the unique PvE combat system of all action MMORPG. Every actions such as attacks, dodge and interaction are responding the way they should do. You can not play this type of combat passively, on the contrary, you must pay attention for every actions you make. Thus this game requires your skill a lot, which is so much fun to play.Overall the semi-realism character design and level design are beautiful, which show off in the latish updates. The equipments look interesting which give you a variety of combination between various type of armor e.g. cloth, light, heavy, plate and importantly avatar sets, which is only available through NX shop or special events.Now that was the first glance of a shiny game. Of course there is a downside, a major downside to be more exact. But let me gather them bit by bit.First of all, since the Europe version (XE) is wiped, you are going to play Vindictus on North America Premiere version. This Premiere version is not equivalent to the original Korean version, for some reason. This can be see in the play mechanic of Vella where you can hold shift to go into Cross Stance and release the button to cancel the animation. Okay, this point is only understandable to Vindictus player.But it is rather disappointing to not get the full potential of the game.To be honest, this game is not PvP friendly at the beginning. Maybe there was an unbalanced time for people who enjoy PvP content, but do not get the idea of playing this game for PvP. It is not worth it and boring to be clear.The other thing is the Peer-to-Peer connection to get into raids or battle. This type of connection requires you a decent upload rate to setting up raids or battles. Consequently if you have bad internet connection then you are limited to enjoy the exciting content of the game: raids. Raid is boss battle only which require you, depends on difficulty, a lot of focus and skill. As follows, you will experience lags, stuttering and unresponsive. So it depends on your hoster, because he/she should also have a good connection to carry the party member. The downside is, if you are not fulfil the requirement of the hoster, such as low ATK or ABC (Attack Speed, Balance, Critical Hit) then he is able to kick you out of the board. And this is a disappointing feeling for player to be „left“ out.Furthermore the loading time is a thing. A feature which is still common in modern game, but the loading time in this game is literally too long! You are waiting roughly 30 seconds to board the actual battle and once you have completed it, take another 30 seconds on top of that? No, how about a random time from 1 minute to never ending battles? Not funny at all.Rather than that, searching for specific items on the marketplace can give you a random disconnection due to its loading time. Not only that, you also get disconnection in any time. No matter if you are raiding, selling, sitting, chatting or waiting for battle result. Once you get a disconnection, you are out – restart the whole game to come back.Also you get a 10 minutes IP-lock every time your IP has changed. As a result you are not able to sell or buy items, open boxes, claiming mails, which is annoying in a long term. 10 more minutes will not hinder „hacker“ to delete your precious treasure. You should know how to secure your account.Finally the major issue on this game is performance. Game performance is THE most essential thing for a good game. Vindictus is not optimized at all. You will never see the 60 fps marker in any raids or battles for a good gaming experience. No matter if you fulfil the system requirement, which is nuts, or you have access the high horse power gaming rig, you never get the 60 fps – okay except for log-in screen or facing walls. To be truth, your fps will be in the low 30 or 20 in raids/battles and crowded city, it is just the fact.This review contains game experiences so far without going in details to the publisher side Nexon Inc. Of course there are a few issues going on such as blocked country, bots and gold sellers, TirCoins, banned player, cash grab events, where you literally have to buy NX (real money) to get excellent stuff.Nexon is responsible for this game and it will surely affects your game experience as a result. So keep that in mind.This game has reached his age and it is not worth to begin with.So in a nutshell, do yourself a favour and use your limited time in something else. This game is not worth to play.tl;dr++ unique combat system (PvE base)++ competitive boss fight+ beautiful character design, level design- different game version NA Premiere ≠ KR Premiere- PvP... come on are you kidding me?-- Peer-to-Peer connection for raids and battles-- long loading time (boarding boat, searching marketplace, ending battles)-- disconnection appears randomly (another RNG feature?)-- 10 minutes IP lock--- performance is ridiculously trash			"

												One of the best Action Combat MMOs I have ever played.PROS: Good free to play game you can easily enjoy without paying money. Outstanding fast-paced combat with lots of variety, and decent graphics (back then, anyway). My friends and I played the HELL out of this game a few years ago.  What really kept us playing was the great action-based combat, and amazing amount of detail and intricacy involed with the production this game.  When we discovered this game and how great it was, we started the guild called ""V for Vindictus"" and it quickly became one of the largest guilds in the game.  Vindictus is really one of the best free to play action-based combat MMOs we have ever played.CONS: The game is a few years old now, and showing its age.  Also, my account got hacked a long time ago, so I pretty much stopped playing since then.  It is almost entirely instance-based dungeons, where you que up solo or in a group depending on the level of the dungeon, etc. you need to do.  The problem with groups is sometimes you get people from the other side of the world connecting to the game using potato-powered internet, which will then lag out the game for everyone.  My advice is to avoid pickup groups, and join a guild to group with.MORE CONS: Whats with Nexon allowing trigger-happy, power hungry forum admins that ban some of the most infuential people for Vindictus of ALL TIME? (Fan-site and gaming community leaders)? A game company that cares little to none for its customers, which is the cheap way for Nexon. That forum admin should at least be permanently banned. It seems like many recent players are saying the game is dying, which is not surprising, as it has had a pretty good run for a Nexon game.LOLWUT:  If you really like action-based combat games with depth, then I recommend you just give Vindictus a try.  Other than that, I recommend most people avoid it, or if you DO play it, don't spend any money, since Nexon has pretty much screwed over the player-base of this game.			"

 A very long review incoming, you have been warned... (no TL;DR, no potato either). Been playing for at least 3 years now (have more hours outside Steam, about 8,000+) and this is what I have to say about the game:Pros: -Great Combat System         -Can get basically everything for free in-game (mostly pay for cosmetics and the like)         -Can still be able to look good without paying for cosmetics (no seriously, don't be tempted to buy Nx, u get rewarded with cosmetic coupons upon reaching certain levels and from some events)         -Awesome looking armor sets at higher levels         -Able to solo almost everything         -Uses the party's host connection for boats/raids (Uses game server for the 24-man raids)          -Boob Physics, like, lots of boob physics         -Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can see your panti- *gets slapped* -Oh, and Iset + Succubus Queen (10/10 would stay to watch the cutscenes) Cons: -Cash Shop a tad bit overpriced          -Publisher is Nexon :/          -Free option at character customization screen is meh (it has a boob slider tho :D)          -Can get boring/repetitive (might wanna bring some friends)          -Party has a bad host (host connection is low/too laggy)? You'll have a bad time          -Heavily Instanced          -Attempting to +15 your equipment (or enchant them) can be... quite tedious          -A lot of grinding at higher levels          -RNGesus please (RNG is really low lol)          -Damn you Ferghus!!!!          -Screw you too Brynn :c           -Nexon wtf, fix your sht (no really Nexon, we need better servers and for you to optimize your game more)           -Game/Server Crashes Great game, would recommend to those intrigued to try it out and see how you like it, you might enjoy it like me, if you can get past the heavy instancing, immense grinding/farming for materials, and Nexon itself :PAnd if you're looking for a rating, guess I'll give it a 8/10 (10/10 for the boobs and would blow up their weapon again)Update #1: I've been looking at other reviews for Vindi and seeing lots of ppl with problems. If you're having start-up problems: don't run using steam, instead download the nexon launcher and run from there (copy the files instead of redownloading)Update #2: For those saying stuff like ""camera changes when attacking"", that shouldn't happen. You're supposed to have total control over your camera; don't just attack and allow your FoV to change.Update #3: Friends/Social list is bugged, so currently only way to add someone in-game is to right-click on their character or name in chat.Helpful tip #1: Able to launch on Steam but having problems connecting to the server or something? Use -tcp in the launch option.Helpful tip #2: I'd recommend using the Nexon launcher to run this game rather than from Steam, trust me on this. (The Steam launcher is buggy and wont launch the game for some people)Friendly tip #1: The game isn't yet optimized for Windows 10, details have been posted on the game's official site.Need any questions to be answered? Feel free to pm me, though I might not be able to answer some questions as I've only have been playing since Arisha's release (a few years ago) and not from the beta like most veterans.			"

												-Before I say anything, I highly recommmend installing the Nexon launcher to play ANY Nexon game rather than through Steam. I notice many people unfairly batting Vindictus as well as other Nexon games on Steam like Maplestory simply because they cannot launch and play them due to authentication problems.-While the MMO action rpg genre has seen more competition in the past years, with games like TERA, BnS, and the upcoming Black Desert, Vindictus was a show stopper at its time of release, and still holds up just fine today. From its stunning graphics, easy-to-learn/hard-to-master gameplay, wide cast of characters, dedicated (though small) community, customizable hud, and soundtrack.Unlike other games from this genre, Vindictus does not burden your keyboard and screen with endless amounts of skills, items and abilities. While there is still a hotbar for items and some skills, the combat in this game is highly combo-based, using both left and right mouse clicks to utilize light and heavy attacks. Even magic-based characters, such as Evie, Arisha, or Sylas, are not held down from the traditional mage gameplay of smashing your face on your keyboard to spam abilities, and use this system. Despite the simplified combat, each character boasts unique mechanics, abilities, and personality (some more than others) that mingle with the usual combat system to magically create a different experience for each character. It may be simple, but it certainly isn't easy. Along with hacking and slashing your foes, you will be required to dodge/block and constantly dance around bosses to avoid attacks, because if you don't, it's gonna hurt. ALOT.Vindictus, as its name hints, is pretty brutal. Just like in real life, enemies die in 1-3 hits. However, that also means you can die just as easily. Though not apparent early on, the difficulty of this game spikes HEAVILY, if you're not prepared. Vindictus's later bosses bring great urgency to your character, because soon as you start to slip, you can find yourself fighting for your life after taking 1-3 hits. Later bosses also bring unique mechanics to further keep you on your toes. Things do become easier with better gear, which is now relatively easy to attain yourself given the time and effort. Even though many people complain that this game is p2w, I wouldn't go as far to say that, despite there being microtransactions. Sure, the highest levels of enhants and enhancements require you to pay up some cash for risk blowing up your gear, but if you're lucky enough to strike gold with a rare drop or enough farming, you can earn enough gold to buy gear from someone else who's done the work of making gear for you! ^^ Personally, I only ever spent money for cosmetics and means to advertise merch to the server, but this can easily be done through the official forums, which is surprisingly active in the trading department.I'm mixed about Vindictus's story. As some may know, this game is technically a prequel of Mabinogi. For the first arc, humans and fomors are at war and humans want to kill all fomors in order to reach paradise, 'Erinn', which is the world in which Mabinogi takes place. Simple, but the story expands much farther in that, which I do not want to spoil for others. Currently, there are 3 arcs. Each main arc is a 'season', and although each have different themes, they all have a loose connection. Alone, the individual stories seem to get lost in themselves, and most definitely requires a summary to fully grasp. What interests me is that each season adds another piece to the puzzle of Vindictus's grand picture, so I'll be sure to stick around for the truest end of the game. There aren't many interesting or beloved characters in the story, but they're passable. They're like stuffed animals. They don't really have a whole much to do with, but you come to like their company as you play the game.As said before, Vindictus is brutal. Enemies, bosses, and your character all REALLY want to kill eachother, and it damn well does a good job at presenting that. Not over the top, not too friendly. It's just right.As a player who started during the advent of season 2, I say give it a try. If you can't run other MMOs and are intimidated by the screenshots, you'd be surpised that you might be able to play this one (at low settings) since this game runs on Source. The community may be small, but it is growing, and with the EU and NA server merge, the game will certainly feel more alive at the early-mid levels. Even once you're at the latest content, there's a constant flow of updates with even more content to chew on.Not to mention boob physics. "

												You could fill an olympic pool with all the mmos, free to play and otherwise, that have died since VinD came out in North America. VinD is still kicking, and there's two good reasons for that: 1) it's a great game, and 2) it has a great business model.As far as skill based action mmos, no other game is even close to over the VinD experience. This game looks better in DX9 than half the junk coming out in 2016. It plays better than anything in the genre.If you hate the cash shop in this game then you've never seen a bad cash shop. Frankly it's as benign as imaginable. If you never want to spend a dime, you sure can. But you probably should, and it will improve your experience, even if it doesn't make you stronger.Some Cons:There's no real PvP in this game (nobody plays it anyways), just competing against others to do more damage. If you have a bad connection, you're going to have a bad time. This game does not love potato PCs, or lag. The servers are held together by paperclips and glue. "

												The only MMO experience that I've actually enjoyed. (Dev's note: Look to this game for ideas for your MMO. Vindictus actually has characters and narrative with a little substance rather than a sequence of generic fedex quests. The UI is also brilliant. Game mechanics that actually get you into the fight rather than spamming macro keys.  That being said Vindictus does fall flat in a few areas. It would be far more immersive if NPC dialogue was voice acted. More/better ambient sounds wouldn't go astray either. My biggest gripe though is that the F2P micro-transactions really aren't that micro... $30 for increased inventory space? Really?  That's more than I purchase most Steam titles for.  I would be more likely to make purchases if it seemed like better value but you could easily spend a tonne of money in this game for really minor customizations. Over all though I highly recommend this to anyone new to MMOs, or to anyone who finds traditional MMOs too generic and hollow.			"

												For the positives of the game:-Fun to play if you like hack and slash.-Great graphics.-Somewhat decent storyline.For the negatives of the game:-Nexon game, so expect F2P = P2W-Really unstable server, game goes down a lot when you don't need it to.-You really need to bring friends into this game to make it enjoyable. Without friends, you're going to be going in empty for pretty much many of your dungeon runs.-Mediocre customer service/PR-Events are more of people sitting around doing nothing for ~2 hours.-Events ingame are more often just as unstable as the game itself (An event advertised at 7PM PST will most likely happen around 9PM PST)Overall, the negatives of the game really outweigh the positives of the game. But what can you expect? It's Nexon. It's a decent game to play, but if you really want to find an RPG (And I use this term very loosely for Vindictus), you're better off finding another game. I wouldn't really recommend this game to any of my friends because of the negatives of this game and the company that runs it.Edit: I will add to this, since I still do not recommend it. Vindictus is pretty much a dead game. There is little to no interaction in the game at all from other players. The only time I ever see more than one person online is either in the first 3 channels, or when an event happens. And even then, people do not interact with each other, and they go to do their own thing. The game interaction is dead, and the game itself is dead. If you want to find a game that still mimics Monster Hunter, just play Monster Hunter, this game is just a Pay to Win version of Monster Hunter.			"

												Let me just start by saying this is my favorite mmo. I've been playing Vindictus for almost 2 years and, despite having left a few times to try out other mmos (including the newer ones), I still can't find anything else like it.GameplayOut of all the other mmos I've played, I'd say Vindictus has the most entertaining and gratifying gameplay there is. Although it's not open world, it's easy enough to enter dungeons and raids via the dock without having to wait too long for other players to join. On the battlefield, you can dish out some pretty devastating combos, which look just as cool as they are powerful. Each class plays differently, so I'd recommend trying them out to get a feel for which one suits you best. Also, there isn't a trade system; if you want to trade with someone, you'll have to organize the details with them and send it through the mail. There's a marketplace too, if ""trading"" sounds like too much of a hassle, but some items may be way overpriced depending on if they're in high demand.ClassesThere are a total of 11 classes right now: 5 males and 6 females (yes, they are gender locked). Lately, it seems like they've been adding classes more frequently, so I think it's safe to say that we'll be expecting to see more in the future.CommunityThis is probably the best community I've been a part of in any game. The majority of people are quite friendly and willing to assist; I've met some pretty cool people there just by doing missions. In town, depending on what channel you're on, you may see a group of players dancing in their undies - that's normal. Basically, everyone just wants to have fun :)Other ThoughtsI see the question ""Is Vindictus dead?"" being asked a lot, and I'd say it's far from it. Sure, the community has gotten smaller because some players decided to play the newer mmos, but there's still quite a good amount of people left in Vindictus. With all of the events and updates going on, it seems like Vindictus has really been stepping up their game against the competition lately. I believe that in doing so, it'll bring more people back to the game, as well as attract new players. To be honest, there have been a handful of times that I ""quit"" the game for long periods, but there's always something that brings me back; in this case, it was the Delia update (she's awesome, by the way), so I'll probably be addicted to this game for a while...again.

												A wonderful idea, ruined by F2P cash grab mechanics in the form of extremely expensive weapon upgrades, healing potions and revive items. The grind is now quite long, and there is an almost complete lack of incentive to continue doing content that isn't top tier raid stuff for high level players, leaving the lower level group content very difficult to finish. So much potential dashed away by bad monetary practice. They also once let the servers flounder for over 3 months.			"

												Playing this game for a decent amount of time and progressing through much of the storyline, I can say that Vindictus has got to be one of the best MMO's I've ever played. For a F2P (Free to play) game, it has AMAZING graphics, alright storyline, vast areas to roam around, and the best part.....the Combat System. First of all, I'd like to say that there are seven classes to choose from, each with thier own unique ways of fighting and skills to perform. Why is it that so amazing? Because this Hack'n Slash has beautiful attack animations, skills and combos that are performed through right and left clicks, along with some button pressing on your keyboard, taking the concept of regular old ""Press to activate skill"" to an entire level. It's very easy to grasp the controls at first sight, making it an stylish, and bloody combat expereience, while other MMO's claim to boast the same things, you can most definitely expect the best combat out of Vindictus. Combat is the sole heart and soul of Vindictus. Forget everything you know about traditional MMO combat. Vindictus pushes it into real-time and amplifies it ten times. You have a regular attack and a heavy attack that can be strung together to form beautiful combos. Grabs will usually act as finishers, allowing you to smash an enemy into a wall or viciously break its back over your knee. It's this visceral brutality that makes Vindictus hard to put down.Vindictus uses Valve's Source Engine, and the result is stunning. From the tiny details of armor to the fluid animations, this is one gorgeous game to watch. Small touches, like cats and dogs scurrying about, breathe life into the city of Colhen. The same cannot always be said of the dungeons, which constantly recycle rooms from previous areas. It is not a dealbreaker, but I hope to see more variety in future updates. With the Source Engine's physics, wooden barricades can be smashed, suspended bridges can be cut and lowered, bodies crumble as they are cut down, and... certain body parts jiggle.Vindictus is truly a huge advancement in free-to-play MMOs. You'll still find a shop for purchasing or even renting outlandish outfits for real cash, but without the cut-rate gameplay and outdated graphics that most titles offer in exchange. Even with limited character-options and the lack of a sprawling world to explore, the action-packed combat of Vindictus is unrivaled in the genre.			"

												My account was randomly blocked because of some internal changes within Nexon America. The only way I can recover my account is to give them a copy of my driver's liscense for verification. I do not trust them to hold such personal information so my account remains blocked.Game is moderatly fun, super grindy though. It's a fun time killer. Raids are beyond laggy and most players AFK for free loot.Nexon America has very very bad customer support so I cannot recommend this game.			"

												One of the forerunners of action based MMO, and it's still going strong with new updates coming up. If you are looking for some good solid hack and slash MMO instead of the normal click and wait ones, then this is your game. The graphics and physics of the game are awesome, and quest/storyline is well written and engaging. The combat system is innovative and continues to entertain players with new contents. The few downsides are mostly ignorable, but game does experience constant glitches and errors from update to update. Connection is troublesome as it depends on the group leader to be the host (thus the rest of the party could lag to death, speically if you fail to dodge boss attackes on time). Personally I dislike the price of the cash items in game...despite mostly cosmetic in nature, i think some utility items such as name change coupons are too overpriced. Despite the love-hate relationship, overall, Vindictus is a solid game well made.			"

												This is a pretty game and one that annoys the crap out of me.  Every time I see it I think ""This game looks great!"" and then I download it... again and once I play it I say ""Oh yeah... that game""  then I delete it.The game is pretty, the gear is interesting but it's a ghost town.  I rarely get a group and the last time I logged in I saw 3 people in town.... Three!It's a hack and slash game, complete button pounder.  It reminds me of Zelda a little in that you can break things that drop rewards and I mean you can break practically ANYTHING!  This is fun but it gets really boring after a while.  If you really don't care for content or a challenge then this game is for you!  Otherwise it's just dull.			"

												I both recommend and condemn this game.This game is really split between the normal, small group, content and the Raids.The Solo:Superb, great, A++, give it a medal.The Small Group:If you dont have a group of friends it CAN be tedious to wait for a party, but not game-breaking.If you HAVE a small group of friends- Superb, great, A++.Raids:Just a waste of time.  You'll que up for an hour and a half, finally get into a raid, and they will all ♥♥♥♥♥ out because it's too laggy.  Most of the best gear is from these raid parts and its just a pain in the butt to do.So I'd give this game a 7/10. All of this is for the small group gameplay. The three points I wouldnt give are because of the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥raiding experience you'll have and the really drawn out and boring dialog throughout the game.			"

												Probably the most underrated MMORPG so far. It's dated free to play business model and NEXON have held this game back. The story is actually one of the best as far as MMORPGS go and the action combat is still feels unmatched more than half a decade later. Another issue it has is accessibility; some people may run into trouble running/starting the game or gearing/progressing. Honestly if the community grew and they started making better both publisher/developer decisions this game could still be a hit MMORPG.			"

												It's a bad love/hate relationship with this one. I've played longer than the 200 hours shown on Steam, but only recently attached it to my steam account. Pros: ~Incredible combat (IT'S PRETTY F**KING EPIC REALLY) that is both satisfying and polished. Boss fights feel like boss fights, ~Good BGM, and amazing character design and customization (must be willing to spend money, although now they've added coupons and stuff from RNG boxes that could help out a bit- still must grind for gold)~Babes all over (Shayla is BAE!!!)~Guild Raids are fun [if your guild is still active kudos -_- ]Cons: ~Story line is pretty bland, the NPCs are all little PNG cutouts that you click on repeatedly and feel shallow, ~Servers are crap, it doesn't matter if you have a good computer or good internet if the person hosting a raid does not or suddenly starts lagging the entire party will suffer.This game will probably NEVER be optimized.~community is dissolving, there's no need to host a party since with the new 90 gear you can be super OP and easily solo bosses (granted that you have the skill) ~Very elitist, very grindy, very repetitive (especially if you have multiple characters), and okay graphics- you MUST be willing to deal with this if you wish to get to the good end-level stuff. Gold-sellers still plague the game even now when it's dying (Looking at some of the prices on the MP will shown why). ~VERY EXPENSIVE outfits and cash-shop items ($20-30 for a single outfit??? x however many characters you have that you want to look good) and there's RNG  where there shouldn't be RNG- in the cash-shop (stupid Dyes!!! Just give me the colors I actually want!!!). ~Enhancing (super RNG) and is enchanting is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥although now you can pay money to guarantee that Righteous or Judgement ES will work. Not to mention just how punishing a failure can be. (Poof! Any and all hard work and time put into obatining an item and it's gone- Ferghus is an A-hole)~Gearing up is a must since some people will kick you off a boat if you don't meet their desired attk reqs even if you're trying to farm the mats to reach that lvl (best to have a guild or friend to help)~Cut and paste dungeons up until you get past the second season. ~No balance in PvP whatsoever, and PvP itself is almost non-existent), not much to do after raids (Ein Lacher Challenge was recently added, but that's only for the completionists and hard-core fans- still pretty fun thou)~Updates are slow as hell, and there's a general lack of events (Christmas 2014 was the best one ever, will probably remain the only good event we've ever truly had (bring back the Christmas defense mini-game from 2011 !!!!))(10/26/2016) they added the lvl 90 mats into the seal shop, but it's a bit too late for that. (Unless you're a new player/ or you don't yet have the OJ bits you couldn't previously afford- you have it SO good RN -_-) a few months ago that would have been amazing, everyone would be all over that, but now it's more of a ""meh"" addition.Despite all the new additions the game is still lacking, and it's unlikely that anything ""game-changing"" will ever be added to it.  There's a reason(s) why the playerbase is dwindling, so when people defend it saying that it's not for the casuals, or those who don't want to spend money, or those who aren't willing to ""no-life"" this game they're right. At this point in time, for any new players you're gonna want to find a good guild to help you out and maybe bring a friend or two along. As it is now, only the fanboys and those who've invested a lot of time and money into this game are keeping it afloat.			"

												Welcome to the world of Nexon, where every aspect of a game is pay2win.Before I get into the negative points, I wanna say a couple words about the good stuff:-Extremely dynamic and responsive hack and slash combat system : This is not a tab-targetting/single unit combat system. It's very unique and it's very skill-based. A fraction of a second can be the deciding factor between life and death.-Awesome physics/graphics/particles/effects/etc. : Visually appealing. That's pretty much all I have to say.- Great free2play from lvl 1 to 70. Then from 70-90 its another story.Now the bad part.... -Pay2win. Did I mention pay2win? Yea pay2win by the way: Anything ranging from EXP boosts to AP boosts (This is required to lvl up Skills) to increasing enchantment success.- Bad servers : Unstable at most times but still manageable- A lot of unfixed bugs/crashes : It gets frustrating. Most of these are reported but it seems Nexon doesn't fel like fixing them.It's a great game. Great potential.... but Nexon. I feel invested in my character and the combat system is just too great for me not to play. I just get tempted a bit too much by the p2win aspect.All in all, it's worth to play for the first 70ish levels, then it becomes a grindfest for rare loot and the p2win aspect comes into play. Play at your own risk. Very addicting if you're the type of guy with some spare change.			"

Posted: March 2
												Vindictus is a game that has been developed by devCAT and is published by Nexon... just reading this one name (Nexon of course, not devCAT) has probably made you look away already. The game has initially been released in Korea on the 21st of January 2010, whereas the North American market has only seen its release on the 13th of October 2010. If you believe that nine months later is a long time, let's not forget that the European market has discovered Vindictus on the 5th of October 2011 (so nearly a whole year later) and the Australian gamers have received this game on the 15th of November 2012 (so nearly three years after the initial release of the game in Korea).This slightly irritating bit aside, let's talk about the game itself that relies on the Source Engine produced by Valve which means that players are (supposedly) capable of interacting with their surroundings but this aspect is limited to destroying props laying around, or using them as improvised weapons. No throwing them around like you would have done so in Half-Life 2 with the Gravity Gun... and indeed I am pointing out this feature because it has been one of the major positive aspects of the Source Engine, and Half-Life 2 has exploited it amazingly in its level design whereas Vindictus simply failed to achieve the same result. Therefore, if Vindictus wanted to rely on the Source Engine to be their main selling argument... maybe, just maybe the developers should have stepped up their game to match Half-Life 2.The game offers you the ""choice"" between eleven Classes... which are also characters. It means that, if you want to play a Class, you have to accept (or barely tolerate) the fact that you're gender-locked and aspect-locked. Yes I did say ""aspect-locked"" because let's be honest, the game doesn't allow you to modify your character. If you want to play that one mountain of muscles capable of swinging a massive pillar around... it will inevitably be a beefy black man. Of course you can change the skin colour, the eyes, the eyebrows, and a few sliders for the bodyshape but all these options are severely limited and don't really allow you to deeply modify your character.The gameplay now. It is not bad at all if you love beat'm'up games such Phantasy Star Online. It relies on a simple and efficient rule : hit your enemies and do not get hit back. Oh did I say ""Phantasy Star Online""? Of course I did, because this game is composed of small levels considered as one-way missions, exploration is not something the players will have to worry about because the action plays out in corridors. The only large place you will ever find is the room of the final boss! And I hope that you love loading screens, because you will see several of them.The story, since the early days of the game where it barely existed and mattered has evolved into three Seasons but the third one remains incomplete at the moment, and the second season is much shorter than the first (a prologue, ten episodes and an epilogue versus four episodes and an epilogue). So there is something to explain all the fighting, but it quicly becomes secondary once another flaw of the game hits you in the face : it is a korean game, so it involves an unhealthy amount of grinding and a ridiculous RNG that will frustrate you eventually (I should not have to fight a single Boss thirty-two times just to get a single piece of equipment, and I confirm that I did count). And quite frankly, once you reach the third Season you won't care about the story anymore because it becomes ridiculous during the Season 2, Episode 2.But maybe you'll never get to this point mainly because the first Season of Vindictus is not fun at all, and this is a fact that few players (especially the die-hard lovers of Vincdictus) will never admit. The early missions of the game have terribly aged, and Season 2 is a smelly content that will rather make you drop the game... well, if the many bugs and glitches, plus the neverending lag don't. You see, very often you will face a boss, beat him down until his body is nothing more than a fine paste, and although his health will reach the absolute zero he won't die at all. Thus you end stuck in an instance, unable to leave, and if you dare pressing Alt+F4 to quit out of desperation you shall be rewarded with a penalty for abandoning a bugged dungeon. And what about the lag you might ask? The game relies on a small software called ProudNet to establish connections between players so even there is a server to gather everyone together, instances are actually played via peer-to-peer... which means that one guy playing with a potato-powered connection will inevitably ruin the fun of everyone else. And sometimes the server itself might simply kick you out for no reason, just because it felt like doing so, forcing you to shut down the game and relaunch it in order to log back in.Now comes the technical aspect of the game. The first time I have launched this game, I clearly remember seeing a poorly textured character because the game has auto-selected the lowest graphic settings available. So I go to the Options menu in order to rectify this little mistake, move the slider all the way to ""Maximum"" and click ""Apply""... and the game suddenly froze. Not just frozen on a frame you see, even the sound bugged out instantly and started playing the same 0.2s of an audio clip in loop as if my computer was about to experience a blue screen of death! So I press Alt+Ctrl+Suppr and properly end the process, then restart the game. Happily my settings have been saved and the game looks fantastic... but then new problems occured. Whenever I clicked a button to go to the character's creation, the sound was severely acting up, producing a loud ""clic"" that clearly cut off the soundtrack playing in the background. And once I eventually got the chance to play the game and reach the main hub after the tutorial... my FPS went from a mere 60 down to a pityful 19-21 just because of the many players present in the area. I will have you know and take in consideration that my computer is blessed with the power of an Intel i7-6700K plus a Nvidia GTX 1080, combined to 32Gb of RAM and a dedicated soundboard the Asus Xonar Phoebus. This game has been released in 2010, we are in 2017, and you are going to tell me that neither Nexon nor devCAT have fixed a massive memory leak and other performance-related issues in seven years? Nothing in my hardware justifies these massive and sudden FPS drops, plus the stuttering sound whenever there's a loading screen or an action-packed scene going on.As a matter of fact, I do not recommand this game at all to anyone. And I have not even talked about the Cash Shop that is nothing more than a glorified lotery at every level beginning at 4€ / $4 without any explaination for such high entry price, or the Enhancing & Enchanting systems that can (and often will) break your hard-earned gear regardless of its rarity (reaching the +10 is the most risky thing you will ever do in this game, just staring at it will give you cold sweat). I am not telling you to avoid this game at all cost, because it is a fun game to play... but you will have to look past all the aforementioned flaws in order to get any degree of fun out of it.			"

												I've been playing this game for a long time over the years, it's always been fun for me and friends. Many people will say the company is greedy for money and the game is boring, but the company who develops the game actually updates it with a lot of events and content, including new characters, seasonal events, and player appreciation events as well as beginner events for new players. While people may say it's very pay 2 win, most paid things are cosmetic and only help a bit like a pet or maybe some quick health potions, most paid things still won't beat good old skill though. Paying can give you some small advantages however that has virtually no effect on other players as the game is PvE based, so don't worry about someone else paying affecting you. My only problem is the early game can lack a little bit, but the later game is great, the longer you play the better it gets (and the bosses get hella bigger too) So if i'm to recommend this game, i'd say grab a couple friends, sit down and enjoy it however you want,  learn some skills, play some events, and remember, the more you play the better it gets. Have fun.			"

												I played this game on EAST server for few hundered hrs since 2012. (been quitting and returning). So I've seen how this game was, has been going and how it is now.While I like the non target battles and exciting background music and all, this game is NOT NEWBIE FRIENDLY AT ALL.Like most other rpg games, ""everything starts from max lvl (90)."" But way to get there from scratch is total nightmare.DO NOT START unless u have a friend who is already playing this game that can support you otherwise you'll have to cover it with insane grinding. Not many people playing the early stages so if you start fresh you'll mostly play solo or need to get help from higher level players. Not much chance to earn golds before level 60 and equipment inflation price starts from lvl 70 so hopefully you get lucky loots in between and earn some 'enchant scrolls' which can get you few million golds to cover the equipment prices.For level 70+ dungeons you'll need to enhance/enchant your equipments but both processes are heavily dependant on random chances (can destroy your equipments if you fail). If you don't want to destory ur items, you'll have to buy ""runes"" with cash that prevents destruction when enchant/enhance fails.lvl 80 equipments are so expensive (10~20million golds PER PIECE / 1 weapon + 5 armors) that people try to skip that and get lvl 90 equipments which are cheaper; which means you'll have to risk enhancing/enchanting your lvl70 gear even more (and possilbly destroy) to advance to higher lvl dungeons or keep grinding the same dungeon over and over for lvl 70-90 section.(you must enhance otherwise your ATT will be too low and people won't accept you to thier party)If you complain/wonder about such inflated prices of high lvl stuff, horde of old users will rush to you shivering their fat chins and preaching about supply/demand. Well, the sad truth is that this game was once overrun by so many BOTs that spammed billions worth of golds/items with hacks. Most of bots are now banned but spammed gold remains (and people also buy golds from gold trading websites) + there aren't any end game content that makes users to spend chunk of gold DIRECTLY. Therefore those golds keep cycling amongst high lvl users inflating item prices more and more.What is even more sad is that old users are actually promoting these bubbles and justify it saying ""well, you can earn hundred millions if u get lucky"" = join-the-league-or-gtfo logic. Result? no new players, same people everyday, not enough matchings for dungeons.... yay! :DThere are no devs in this game. Every single patches, policies and events come from KR HQ and they don't approve much changes unless theres some serious bugs/errors. What NA team do here is just translate -> test -> deploy and they are so good at that job that whenever there is a major patch, people suffer from bugs/random disconnection/client crashes.Plus your feedback is completely ignored becuase NA team don't have any power to change anything. (Feedback forum is just there to look good)			"

												have played the game since 2009 if i remember that far back correctly. the combat system is the best ive ever seen and wish other companys would use it so that it wasnt wasted on this absolutely **** company nexon NA. they do not care in the slightest about their playerbase they are just animals they farm cash from for cosmetics. used to play every day with my friends until they released an update that introduced a bug that would ban you randomly and my friend got banned along with thousands of other players. yet sadly it took them roughly 6+ months to unban people and by that time most of them didnt even want to play anymore. its one of the most fun and unique games you will ever play but sadly, its very buggy and the company dosnt give a damn and there is barely anyone playing anymore. i love this game to death but i cant say it would be worth a new players time. great game worst company on the planet ill rank them one higher than EA even.

												As much as I play solo (and honestly I prefer it that way), past level 60 you're going to need help on the raids. While they are entirely possible to solo, they can be fustrating to learn, and extra hands makes the game A LOT easier. Thankfully easy mode is a thing, and despite the lesser drops from bosses on it, if you're like me and enjoy solo play, its a life saver.I still find this game fun, and even more fun since I've fallen in love with Arisha, but if you plan on picking this game up expect a lot of solo play, or if you can, get a friend to play with you.Just be prepared to grind for materials if you want to do end game raids because people can be pretty elitest			"

												Might be wondering why .2 hrs of gameplay is writing a bad review. Well, it's because upon completing its download and logging on I discovered that my account had been permantley banned. Yes. Brand new account, apparentley banned for life.  Well, this is weird, maybe ill try to get ahold of the support team and see whats up. Alas, tis nexon whom i must pry support from. IE: its impossible. They have NO way of contacting them for support directly, have to go to the game site to send a ticket. Annoying, but i do all the neccissary work anyway. Get an email a couple hours later, they want 2 FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION, yes, they want my Drivers Liscense AND another form of ID just to check on the status of my account. Which is weird, as i have a nexon account and have played serveral other games, still can. Needless to say thats insane and i did not comply, dunno if it's rampant phishing or if someone really got into their network. Someone should figure this out, tho, as i cannot contact nexon directly and let them know that their affiliates are trying to do this.			"

												Discredit all under 100 hours reviews. I'm aware of 500,000+ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ flaws this game has to offer. THIS IS FREE TO PLAY KOREAN MMOdo not play unless you feel like enduring the grindI hated this game until I hit 60 in season 1 (endgame) and then I continued playing it, still hated it. I kept playing for some reason, polished my skill a little, and as I got better the game became more fun, having one of the best combat systems/boss fights/classes(characters) than most games to date. It is rewarding if you dump a lot of time into it, if you're looking to display skill and experience in an mmo this game is almost perfect for it.This game is pay to win, but you can succeed without spending a dime(still should probly spend like 5$ every once in a while on megaphones to sell loot). They do have events that cater to the community and help you out every couple of months, its pretty nice. this game has so many problems, glitches and bugs If I went through them all I would be writing a trilogy novel, some lotr tier♥♥♥♥♥♥ So I won't, i'll just say don't play this game unless you value unique high quality combat and boss fights enough to look past a mountain of garbage.tl;dr this game is like eating a 10 layered cake of♥♥♥♥♥♥and dirt, but in the middle layer there's a chocolate you've never tasted before thats either amazing or just another chocolate to you.

												No customer service. Extremely unstable, unpredictable game. Barely even seems compatible with Windows 8.1 or Windows 10. Great combat, beautiful graphics, and would be fun, but it's useless on a horribly managed game. Support will LITERALLY take years to answer tickets just to say ""sorry we can't help you"" when often it's their own mistakes they can't help you with. (Such as banning people who they falsly identify as hackers while bots, hackers and gold sellers swarm the game.) In the end if you can deal with this it's a fun game but in the end it's also Nexon.			"

												I love this game but there are problems that hinder this game. Warframe does a better job at handling farmable items, where in Vindictus it's next to impossible.1. By the time you hit level 60 you will start to feel that the game is a freaking grindfest. GRIND GRIND GRIND GRIND GRIND GRIND. But even if you do grind you're still not going to get the items you need to have in order to even do anything. Might as well waste your in game money on a weapon or armor piece in the maarkeplace for like 990,000,000 gold. ( I literally saw an item like this on the marketplace). 2. Farming is so damn tedious you will feel so bored just doing the same stuff over and over again for hours on end. and then when you finally get the damn item you need, GUESS WHAT!? You need 10 more of them because screw you. This seriously feels like farming for Proof of Concords from the silver knights at Anor Londo.3. Your weapons blow the hell up or have a decrease in durability when you upgrade them over +3. Oh but even worse is when it resets the enhancement level back to 0. making all of your hard work for nothing. Wasting your damn time trying to enhance the weapon.4. Booses are rediculous. They have terrible hitboxes, you can't move out of there way unless you're 50 million miles away from them because there whole damn body becomes a hitbox. early on this gets really annoying. Especially when your facing the Kobolds, Yetis, or even worse the Goblins and Gremlins at the Formorian base. You will be so annoyed when they hit you a million times over and die over and over. Having to restart the mission over because of some stupid hit. 5. the items in the game are wayyyyyyyy to expensive. 990,000,000 for a single item. ARE YOU SERIOUS!!! Nobody has that type of money unless you're a botter, or you buy dye ampoules all day and selling them on the marketplace. 6. you can get kicked out of raid if you dont have good damage. if youre not over 16k in damage you're getting kicked the hell out of the boat because you didn't spend enough money enhancing your weapon or armor. and trying to get the best gear so you can have fun. 7. Costumes in the cash shop costs 20 freaking dollars. and for limited ones which look exactly the same it will cost you double that. you can also buy runes to make sure your weapons don't break at all or reset, or buy enhcant runes so your weapon doesn't become a piece a  crap.Edit: So I was really frustrated as hell while writing this review. So after I came back to my senses I realized some of the points are sort of wrong and just straight stupid and I could make them much better and much more coherent, but I'm to lazy to even do it.

												The combat and gameplay are freaking amazing. You even have to time your potion drinking in order to get the full benefit of the potion.When you get hit, it's your fault, everything is dodgable for every character. (although it is definitely harder for some classes)Or it's because of lag...Before it was on steam, I probably had 800+ hours.I had 5 classes at level 70.This game inspired me to study to make my own game.Because I have yet to find anything close to the gameplay.The closes thing so far was the Dark Souls series, but it's combat is relatively slow compared to Vindictus.I don't recommend this game because of the community you have to endure to play it.So many trolls and elitists.You HAVE to sell things on the forums to make money to get better gear.And you NEED better gear in order to get into better raids that drop better items.It becomes very pay2win in the end game.The servers suck. So when your party leader disconnects from a daily raid, it can ruin your entire run for that day.And it happens often.But if you are into game design and you like cool mechanics on bosses you should definitely check out some of them.Here's a list I recommend if you choose to try the game.Area > Dungeon > Boss-Ruins of Sanctity > Hidden > Giant Spider-Ainle > Shadowed by Darkness > The Blood Lord-Hoarfrost Depths > Irukul > Irukul-Fomorian Base > The Giant > Titan-Sewers > The Dark, Dank Sewers > Thor-Ortel Castle > Alghan the Golem > Alghan-Ortel Castle > The Central Garden > Ingkells-Catacombes > Avatar of Destruction > Glas Ghaibhleann-Albey > Betrayal > Controlled Black Hammer-Albey > The Evil One > Lionotus-Albey > Colru the Golem > Colru (easily one of the coolest fights if no trolls are on your team. 8-man raid gets split up into 4 groups of 2 to fight 4 parts of Colru, it's pretty awesome)-Heide > Earthborn Seal > Siglint-Heide > Fostborn Seal > Beokros-Heide > Timeless Rage > ElchulusAlthough all the Heide dragons have basically the same movesets and different skins, they each have their own different mechanics you need to work around to defeat them.And there's the Kraken, similar to Colru, but the team gets split up into 5 group, Not really split up physically, but everyone has their own Kraken limb to concentrate on, or the whole ship gets crushed and everyone dies. Which is pretty neat. "

												TL:DR - Introducing Vindictus: Brought to you by Nexon. A company that lures players with FREE to play games             but eventually you'll give into temptation and spend a ton of money -cough Pay2win-             NOT for fun. If you want to have fun, I suggest you play something else and stay away from NEXON. First we have to pick a class/character to start, 9/10 players would ignore the big black guy. Let's pick a girl, while we're at it, why not make her look attractive and sexy. (Definitely not trying to hit on guys online)Let's start with character customization, you pay for your hair and underwears, Deal with it. 10/10 would enlarge boobs to maximum. The more pixels you have, the better.Let's play the game now, level 1 to level 40. Basic training and learning the foundation of your character's move sets and skills, do the same maps over and over again and you finally do some quest to get transformation.(You're very likely to play by yourself until level 60)Now level 40-60, you've learnt how to kill mobs in a few clicks of the mouse and bosses are re-models of every single mob you see and they're either bigger or have different colours.The real challenge lies in raiding, like any MMORPG would lead you to.             I LIED.The real challenge is within the community.Most of you would quit before level 30 realizing how boring grinding can be. Otherwise, allow yourself to beintroduced to the community, visit channel 1 for all the emotional dramas.Embrace yourself to:Poverty - buy some gold, buy some nx, empty your wallet and credit card, what is life? vindi is life.Bragging - 400 titles! such is life, +15 level 80 items, majestic as osama bin laden. Bombing raid bosses with dem DEEPS.Envy - What OP players have is what you want, what you want is what leads you to poverty.Autism - Learn to deal with people that are autistic, you cannot learn from anywhere else better.Cancer - What you get if you can't deal with autism.Harrassment - Bad at something? Said something wrong? Did nothing? You get it no matter what you do.Depression - What you get when you finished the game and realized how much time and money you've spent.Anger - Proudly brought to you by Nexon, sponsored by pay2win players and trolls. Back to raids, attack requirement boats, isolated from raid parties, no invites? Congraulations you have hit the dead end of Vindictus. At this point, it's time to pluck your money out of your wallet and shove it up Nexon's butt hole.-Buy some AP -Buy some gachapon boxes-Buy some runes to enhance and enchant-Buy some gold while you're at it, everyone knows you're poorLevel 60-85, you grind between repetitive dungeons and raid bosses in order to gear up and do newcontents. At this point, you should be asking yourself, what's the meaning of all this grind?We all have fun in the games we play, we all want the strongest items in game and want to be known for achieving and looking fabulous. If you don't think you've had enough of that, enjoy wasting moretime and money refining your character that'll eventually make yourself ask the same question above.Otherwise congraulations, you've finished the game. Regrets... too late. Literally a dungeon's name that warned youbefore Level 60 contents where you may resort to spending money.10/10 recommending 12-16 year old players, autistic rustled jimmies and cancerous trolls.

												I really enjoyed the time that I put in on this game. It was the first MMORPG that I ever played. The armors and weapons are all very unique and cool. The character customization was fantastic, especially considering that there are set classes. They do a wonderful job of separating veteran players from newbies. Definitely worth a try.			"

												typical Nexon game, full of bugs that ruin the experience, i've been trying to play most of the day and your game keeps crashing on me for what looks like no reason and it doesn't give me much faith that Nexon once again cares about quality for the customer. If Nexon would move away from the 10-30 day timer on items it would be a miracle because it's just so aparent that you don't care about the quality of game that you put out, only that bottoms lines are met and money is in people pockets. 4/10, try it but don't expect anything that would be considered developer quality of any stretch of the imagination.

												As a person who frantically searched for a good hack and slash MMO I thought I had finally found a slice of heaven in Vindictus. It's very interactive and requires you to be attentive and think on your feet in fights, lest your enemies best you. Additionally, the character design and physics engine are quite unique for a free-to-play game.Unfortunately, there are several things keeping Vindictus from being a good MMO; the pay-to-win feature being in first place. To elaborate a bit, the first thing that comes to my mind is the 'inner armor' feature, where your character can be fitted with customizable undergarments that is worn under the armor. Your character is fitted with defult inner armor, but the nicest way to move on with this review, is to state that if you don't want to look like an idiot, you must purchase nexon points to buy new armor to look less foolish in the armors you pick up in the game. Inner armor is only the beginning, players can purchase 'temporary armor' which allows for any level player to rent a set of high-level armor for about 7 days, for nearly a real dollar each day, as well as items that can selected in a random lottery (purchaseable of course!) that are not necessarily usable by your character, but that also can not be sold in the in-game trading post. Finally for this topic, there are also 'bound' items; which are items that get locked to your character and make them unsellable in the marketplace or trading post. To unbind these, you must then purchase from the game store, potion stacks that may or may not have enough per stack, to unbind your item and make it sellable.  Which brings me to my next problem with Vindictus: ingame money system.The ingame money system in this game is absolutely in shambles. There does not seem to be any rhyme, reason or hierarchy for items which may be put up for sale. I have, on more than one occassion, found something as simple as cloth for sale for around 1k gold, and something that's difficult to pick up or find, on sale for 400 gold. If I check the market the next day, the cloth may have gone down to 200 gold, and the rarer item could inflate up to 3k in gold. It doesn't seem Nexon is setting any rules for these items to be sold at a minimum or maximum price, resulting in player prices that are unheard of, be they high or low. This means when you get to higher levels, paying for armor past level 54 is nearly impossible as armor inflates from around 24k per piece to 1-2 million quite quickly and weapons are even higher in price. The burden becomes real when you realize you're exchanging around 70k in gold for repairs and health potions. Not to mention that the pay rate between NPC sale rates and user marketplace rates have a very significant gap.Making money is out of the question for your first 15-20 levels; and that is no exaggeration. Nexon actually released a patch that prevented players below a certain level from gaining monetary rewards in dungeons, and to impress upon this, I would like to add that Vindictus is completely instanced; there are no open world opportunities. Now you may pick items up in a dungeon that could sell for money, but nothing noteable enough to allow you to upgrade things such as armor or weapons. Making money in later dungeons is a bit easier, but often requires quite a bit of trickery or repeat trips, which can ocassionally be fun I admit, but becomes cumbersome after the first few times you attempt it. Be that as it may, it's still very difficult to save enough money for crafting or purchasing new armor or weapons as you get higher in level, which makes doing dungeons, and more importantly raids, where the majority of your money comes from at higher levels, very difficult. In some cases, after completing a raid a certain amount of times, you completely stop gaining money from it.Speaking to dungeons, or more specifically, speaking to raids requires quite a good internet connection as you carry anywhere from 4-8 players on your back. It's often hard to find raids to join that do not require you to be well-equipped, well-backed by your internet and beginner friendly for those unfamiliar with the way they work. Additionally, Nexon does not seem to have stable enough servers for large party raids requiring 16-24 people, which can halt a player's progression completely. Rather than being stable, the player-to-server ratio is very ill-managed.Now I could go into the many other and much smaller issues that Vindictus has, such as the abismal drop rate for rare items, which is comparable to squeezing a diamond from a squirrel's behind, the stat fluxuation between armor and weapons from one level to the next, the chance meter for enhancements which fails about 70% of the time, the lack of character updates and gender locking, or even the fact that Nexon tries to make up for these issues by running events which can leave the user with a lot of useless and unsellable items to take up precious inventory space, but I think I've said enough.All of these problems, which are serious drawbacks for players who really want to enjoy the game, can be put aside to a certain degree and the game, especially when played with a good team, can be distracting and immersive in the level of fun it creates. That being said, these problems together whether they're big or small seem to be the result of a mis-managed product that eventually becomes more of an expensive toy that repeatedly breaks and requires money to fix, than a free-to-play immersive fantasy game for people to enjoy together.

												I didn't pay a single cent for this game, so I cannot complain too much. Maybe that's because I haven't reached a point yet where it's nearly impossible to do good without buying items, like most Free to Play (Pay to Win) games are. For now I am going to say ""no, I don't recommend this game,"" mainly because I am willing to see if it will get better the more I play, but not expecting too much.As stated many times by other users, the gameplay can be boring and repetitive. I do get slight enjoyment out of slashing enemies, and some of the bosses are moderately fun, but overall the levels, A.I., story, and the world in general seem mediocre. I found myself clicking through most of what the characters were saying, and constantly wishing there was more to do (exploration, for one).This is one of those games that is often painful to play for long periods of time, but also strangely (and uncomfortably) addictive.

												Vindctus has been one of few action RPG that allows pretty much crisp battle (excluding bugs) and entertaining character customization. However, the fact that such fantastic experience awaiting for new palyers is rather contained in ugly Nexon logo says more than it needs to be. Although varied play style is magnificant and suits probably most of players but it should be recognized that there are too many classes that intefere each other; especially when the cooperative gameplay regards dealing damage at most, the roles seem to be vague relative to killing enemies faster enough to satisfy the party. although combat is very fast-paced, it begs to force players to take in some Nexon cashes to improve--a typical Nexon ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t #1. By means I don't suggest player skill is important, but there's clear barrier between investment of ""real effort"" and imporvement of player skills. The way that player's attack has to surpass defense of target enemy is not-so new idea, but the way game pushes or forces you to obtain the higest number-available pretty much relies on enchantment of the weapon and armors. Enchantments DO cost alot while you also has to buy enchantment scrolls that grant special attributes. (Funny you ask, I still don't understand the point of scrolls having 7-day expiration date.As few reviewers suggested, the stories are quite enjoyable other than delivering pancakes to literally 5 meters away from quest giver, or some relying on rare-drops such as xxxx's hearts. Overall, stories are okay until you end up having to fight against raid bosses that are limited to once a day. This came to be a great problem for our friend group because the fact we all sucked as♥♥♥♥♥♥resulted in deliberation of the game. I honestly don't understand why the story suddenly has to put a giant barrier by forcing players to be part of raid group that require practice and understanding instead of asking higher-level players to clear. There's no clear balance between making game harder to play and making game difficult to enjoy.Third of all, as I have observed, any PvE oriented games are not suited for PvP  with few expecptions. Vindictus is one of horrid PvP gameplay sprouted from enjoyable PvE atmosphere lik a damned cancer tumor.There are many pros and errors but it's definitely one of those games you might want to try. After all, taking a bite of this juicy-action packed game does make good appeal to players. However, once the juice is all dried out, there's no real reason to continue chewing on the world-class flavor of Nexon. Whether you want to continue or not is totally up to your taste buds.			"

												PRO:Great graphicsFast-pacedCON:Requires to spend real money to show more skinToo many Chinese players using VPNShady people with picky requirements for raidsConstant server delaysCustomer support doesn't exist (Unless you spend over $100)Long review:This game is Pay-to-Win (P2W), if you don't have enough attack or magic attack to filfull the requirement, you'll get kicked from the party, and the horrible peer-to-peer connection. The game is slowly dying, due to the people's desire for inner armors for female characters, Nexon wanting you to spend real money, power hungry people, and Nexon's horrible, horrible game server and customer service (Since when did they have customer service?), you'll get lagged every minute or so randomly. Once you get yourself from level 1 to level 60 (Or 70), big boy raids are here. There are boats that wants party members to have the defense and/or attack required to get the raid go smooth as drinking an Iced Strawberry Brandy, but that's like last year or so, not sure how it is now. Not many people hosting raid boats now a days. Even when you do get in a raid boat, you just hope the host's connection is good or you'll be getting bad lag from the host itself, since it's Peer-to-Peer connections, not directly from the server. People can leave the party whenever if you're hosting if you have bad connections with them. You'll mostly be connected with people with three bars of connection (Most of the players are from China).There is false advertisement when choosing a character to play as. Hot character showing lots of skins? Nope, you get a white overall instead of showing lots of skins. You'll be starting out with an inner armor that can only be changed by purchasing new hot inner armor with real money for $10 permanently, around half price for 30 days. Don't like the basic hair you can only choose when starting off? Better give them money to change it, around $8 for permanent or around half for 30 days. It's almost ""Freemium"" tier.Nexon wants you to spend NX for item shop badly. For say, you have a +5 equipment and want to go +6, but you fail regardless with the gamble of enhancing and goes back down by 1 level each. Got to +7? Want to +9? Hope you have enough material and money to afford the cost of the rank resets. The success rate for enhancement is extremely bad. There's a better solution to use protection rune to protect your equipment from losing it's enhancement. but for a cost of real money. And it's pricy for one protection rune, save money and your sanity (Not really) by buying a bundle of 5 for a pricy discount. There's also ""avatars"" that looks nice for characters, but for $20, it does add addtional minor stats too. Everything is expensive in the game with real money.People are too ""power hungry"" for stats, so they would spend real money to just be the strongest, but no knowledge of how to play the game itself. Ever since Nexon released the Ability point capsule that gives 1000 points, people really can't play the game from what I'm seeing. They have the attack and defense, but the execution is terrible. It's almost like, all talk but no show. Even an experienced player that has low attack and low defense can beat raids.Nexon's customer service horrible. There was a Q&A long time ago, not sure if people can find it again, saying they will answer your ""ticket"" if you spend enough NX on them. Not paying NX means they won't answer back from whatever you submitted to them. The server is usually lagging for some reason. They don't work on weekends either. Overall, it's bad. Nexon fanboys will try to deny the harsh reality of what they're doing to them.			"

												I played this game around for two years. Although I am in dormant stage with this game since I reached lvl90, I come back to play whenever there are new events, story or when I miss combat.These are pros and cons from my perspectiveSummaryDefinitely worth playing. Higer lvl you reach, funner it gets. Awesome combat and graphics, but limited conents. Not completely pay to win, if you do care about cosmetic 20$ of investment would be worth it. Good game to play once a while.pros1. Awesome combat/ graphics- Probably only reason why I still play this game once a while.- Style of combat is very different from other MMORPG games. It is not just spaming your mouse or pressing your key boards. You actually need to be skillful and thoughtful in order to play this game.2. Good cosmetic. - I know there are other games that has more cosmetic options but I think this game has pretty good varieties of outfit.3. Many different characters. -  Many different characters and their fighting styles are all different which make it very interesting to play each one. (but cons are each class ialready has fixed gender)Cons1. Closed world- You can only fight when you move into dungeons, no monsters around normal town. Very limited space and towns. (Although more towns are coming so hopefully they will expend their world)2. Limited contents- There is nothing much to do other than combat.3. High PC prerequisites- If you do not have good graphic cards or good internet, it is not worth playing4.Cash system- Not completely pay to win. But ofcourse cash helps game in cosmetic way or help people to lvl  up faster or protect your weapons from exploding when you are trying to upgrade. Again, this is optional though, if you do not buy into game company's trick you can be still as strong and look good as people who pay, it just takes longer. But I have to admit, that some money spent definately help. I would say around 20$ is enough to get all you need for game (for inner armor and hair+make up)			"

												Let me be longwinded for a moment. You know that magical little title that everyone ranted and raved about once you got past the dificulty curve. Darksouls. Well this game is a lot like that. No seriously there is a surprising amount of storytelling in Vindictus. Really. Story. Chances are you'll play it for the gorgeous characters, fantastic armor, killer weapons, and ultra fast gameplay with spectacular skills. Look far enough into it and there is a rich untold story under the surface. Granted it's told a bit hamfistedly for most of it, there are some really killer moments and design choices that tell a story. The Mystery of Anile, the goddess, Ingkells, Tieve, Gwyn all memorable moments/characters. Each with there own stories.  Does this mean you should be looking for deep storyline? Until you get to around level 60 nothing really clicks. It's an unfortunate twist in the game, that requires time to get into the story aspect. While the rest of the game is really good, the story doesn't pick up to easily 20 or so hours in. It isn't, bad until then. It just isn't great. It's sort of there. Which again is the argument that was the end of games like ff13. Yet here the gameplay is good enough to keep me coming to the point where the story reaches a crecendo. Season two is fast off the heels of S1 and tells another deep and rich storyline if you're willing to look. Yet the best is yet to come with s3 coming up fast. Tomorrow no lessAs far as gameplay, assuming you maintain a stable framerate on a reasonable computer it's phenominal if a bit repetative. I recomend leveling two characters, one primary, and one durdle. It will keep you from getting bored of a given characters parameters before you start being able to seriously tweek the play style. Granted around level 40 the skills get VERY diverse and interesting.Graphics: Well crank up the settings and be in for a pleasent surprise. It's quite pretty.Story: While it starts rocky and somewhat confused, it gets really good!Gameplay: Amazing, get a good computer and enjoy.Character customization: pretty good, though could use some more options.Replayability: I'm biased, I have 600 hours...

												I played this back when it was only in the Nexon client, but I got bored and left. I went back after I saw it in steam, and remembered why I left. It's an OK game. If you're looking for a dark souls  like game but with the level difficulty and design lowered down extremely this is your game. You basically go to a area via boat go to path killing everything, trying to go to the boss killing everything, and killing the boss. You dodge to get out of the way and heavy wepons feel heavy. It is quite boring after a week though TBH.			"

												I played this way back when in 2011, and came back recently. I got back into the west coast server and was astounded on how much Vindictus decayed.This game suffers from the WOW syndrome to an insane degree. The majority of the fanbase is very high level and you will rarely meet low level characters which leaves you with very little to work with.You will have problems finding a party if you are a low level, and level 20 is considered very low level.You will have problems finding people to do the main-quest-madatory raid with if you are low level.So the game refuses to work with you unless you're high level and the amount of grind makes it not worth it. After all, why should someone invest so much time to even get to work with others on a regular basis? To work this hard to get into a community that has no guarantee to be welcoming or even good.The game itself is good but the community is so lopsided that newcomers might as well not bother.			"

												It's a free MMO with the visceral hack and slash combat system of a paid one.  The game is a lot more skill based than it is stat based, meaning you HAVE to dodge attacks, time yours well and not stand there like a moron soaking up damage like in WoW.  This MMO is anything but traditional, in both good and bad respects, the good being the aforementioned combat and the fact that you don't have to sink hours a day into the game to get stuff done.  The downside is, there's no huge world to explore, just a small hub you return to in order to recieve and complete quests.  The combat is done entirely instance-based, and much of those instances need to be repeated, so repetition WILL be there.  Finally, most machines will struggle over the ham-fisted optimisation and some players who prefer to solo their MMOs won't get very far without rolling with a party, so I highly reccomend you go into this with friends.  It's a good game though, and you've got nothing to lose in trying it.			"

												Try it. Judge it your self. The Game doesn't really pick up till you're lvl 80'ish, so you won't get an accurate description of the game from comments alone. Many people who quit either quit to early to really experience vindictus or quit because this game is ""pay to win"". The only reason this game would be pay to win is if you buy gold (which is against vindictus rules) so the game it self does not implement a pay to win system, how about runes you might ask... there's events for that. Vindictus does alot of events that gives away free runes. How about vip? vip does nothing more than add stats that is barely noticable at end game content, +100 att or so when my att is 23-24k. VVIP? adds goddess graces which is totally not needed if you're in a party and or have a guild. In my opinion you can consider lvl 1-59 (Fairly easy to reach) the tutorial for this game. lvl 60 the introduction to ""real raids"". lvl 70 the grind of getting to end game. However I suggest not judging the game until you reach at least lvl 80 at this point since most of the content unlocks at lvl 80.			"

 DON'T PLAY VINDICTUSI've never written a negative review but I couldn't resist. One of the best game I've ever played died. I was playing the game since beta but the company is really bad and destroys the game. Actually the game is destroyed. Shortly saying: DON'T PLAY VINDICTUS.So it started when I was trying to enter the game but I couldn't because they switched it to new launcher (a second for less than a year) and they wanted to recreate my account (again). They did that because European and American servers merged into one. After 40 minute of trying to ""recreate"" my account I found that my character are gone... yes GONE, forever! I tryed to contact support but the site gave an error after trying to submit a ticket. After an hour of trying to find information I read something what made me so angry. Before merging and ""recreating"" the account I supposed to agree with new ToU and the before 16 February 2017. It is funny because I was on vacation for a month in Dubai and didn't know about this ""ultimatum"". Anyways I'm done with the game.			"

												Was an awesome game and it still is, but nowadays all you have are people that are op.

												Vindictus makes hack and slash games look old. Back when it came out it was not as easy and wasn't quite what people were looking for in a game. I believe the game has been dying but the devs pump out new things to get people to play, sadly the incentives are not good enough for me to keep playing.This game could use more social interaction.

Reason for those things to watch out for is because Vindictus has a nickname Lagdictus meaning lag all over the place over all I recommend this game to pretty much anyone looking for a good game to play its free to play but pay to look good.

												TL;DR - Improvements abound from back when. Not without flaws, this is a definate play for anyone who likes action combat! Bring a friend!After a long time of playing this game I can finally say that recently, I've found that they have had their ups and downs, but I whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone who wants a free, fun game to play with some hard core action combat!- Cash shop items from revives to EXP boosts can now be purchased with AP (Skill points) which only requires that you play to earn.- The grind is very VERY reduced from it's old standard, making it much easier and more enjoyable to level up and reach the end game. They've done well in reducing it.- All characters are fun and have their own distinct playstyles. Choose the character you want, some are easier than others, but all are fun! Play this with a friend and have a blast, or play alone, even raiding can be done alone with ease now, thanks to a new ""Easy"" mode they added. If you can't find a party for a raid, you can run it Solo on easy and SMASH the boss and move forward with your quests! Or, bring some friends and smash it on higher difficulties for more loot and experience.If I were to take a step out and personally say something here, I prefer Vindictus over Tera. I do NOT PVP in either game, but I don't play either for that. I prefer the PVE (Monster killing) in Vindictus simply because the combat has more weight and meat to it. You can feel (Especially with bass) each strike.I highly recommend Vindictus now. It's fun, it's free, and there's nothing against trying it! It feels that the developers are honestly trying to adhere to the market of today, and it's something I really appreciate.If you want a score.8/10 Really fun, great with friends, SMASH EVERYTING			"

												I've been playing Vindictus for many years even before I started using steam and was an active player until the past year. The game itself is very unique and can't be found nowhere in regards to game play, graphics, and story line but those specification in the game also can be the issues that make any player stop playing. This will be a long post.Perspective of 2016's game play:UPSIDE:- story updates have been chugging along (finally) with new content and outfits from eastern servers- smooth combat play and realistic physics, where you can affect objects inside the dungeon- server lag is occasional/rare- beautiful avatar and outfit customization - beautiful and creative combat and weapons for classes and boss monstersDOWNSIDE:- very dependent on gaming specs and internet strength for hosting, limiting players that can host, not to mention sacrificing high graphics for a smoother game play- tons of glitches and bugs visual-wise- too small of a community for my comfort- limited color options when dying outfits and choosing hair- despite having new updates, the time in between is very predictable and slow just to make enough money in a few months only to spend it and do it over again- events and prizes in between updates feels repetitive with recycled items- making money in the game is very dependent on RNG, not to mention losing money- almost after every update, there will be glitches and lag with maintenance when the game is online- certain features of the game that gets a revamp seems obsolete and/or not making sense, including the recently added class specific chat, broken friends list search/offline display, marketplace previews, and screenshot mode- a sense of community is very rare in-game, with little benefits of being in a guild and little participation in pvp and seige- there are few guides outside of the game making it harder to run dungeons with newer players (god knows if a dungeon is completed if half the party have end game gear but don't have good stats or know how to dodge)- the NX cash item shop is very pricey and a good portion use or have used NX in some point in the game- poor customer service overall, whether it is with tickets being delayed and forgotten, little compensation, or completing a request which never was done- there has been a recent controversy of banning active players for no good reason and other mistakes of mass suspending groups of people in the pastIn the end of the day, if someone wants to give this game a try, by all means I would recommend playing it just to experience the novelty of the combat, but in the long run the amount of time and money being put into this game will be determined by how motivated you are into playing this game.

If you have friends with you the game becomes 1000% better and some of the higher level bosses are easier now to (not by difficukty but because you now have 1-3 extra swords attacking it) I HIGHLY recmomend to anyone who likes fast paced JRPGs if thats not really your thing well its free might as well give it a go! NOTE: this is not Pay2Win there are microtransactions but its only for cosmetic stuff and you can usally get that stuff free through the near constant events just check the main website at nexon to see whats going on!TL;DR games good, better with friends			"

												Okay, so I downloaded this game with an open mind. I max leveled in tera online and got bored so I was on the prowl for a new MMO to play, and some friends introduced me to vindictus. After downloading the game, I tried to launch it and it crashed. Over. And over. And over again. The launcher REFUSED to work, let alone let me create an account. The little times it did work, it would give me error 500 everytime I would try to log in. I spent an HOUR constantly fighting with the launcher to let me log in and finally I got into the game. When I got into the game I was INSTANTLY reminded of rusty hearts. There are ""classes"" but instead of being called archer or lancer, they have actual names. I decided to go with the big sword dude, and was instantly thrown into the game. I was going through the tutorial mission and doing just fine, actually kinda liking the game now cause it had a pretty fun combat system. Well guess what. The game glitched and I got thrown out of the map and had to skip the tutorial mission before I was ready because I couldnt figure out how to restart the tutorial. So I had to begin the game before I knew things properly. Figuring out how to do missions was simple enough BUT OH MY GOD THE ♥♥♥♥ING MENUS.THIS GAME IS MENU CITY. I still dont understand what half the menus do, and I still have not figured out how to accept specific quests or do specific things. THERE ARE SO MANY GOD DAMN MENUS IN THIS GAME ITS RIDICULOUS. I spent a good 30 minutes fighting with the menus to see what everything does and it still ♥♥♥♥ing confuses me. I don't know how skills work, and it seems like they require gold? or ap? I dont know. I was constantly annoyed by how many menus there were and how they just intruded on everything. HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥THE NPCS IN THIS GAME ARE ANNOYING. I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SKIP TALKING TO NPCS AT ALL AND IT TAKES 400 YEARS TO LOAD EACH CHARACTERS DIALOUGE. I'm serious every time another npc decides it wants to talk it literally takes a loading screen, and the loading screen is a small little spining circle at the bottom of the textbox. This loading takes FOREVER. The character creation in this game sucks. Plain and simple. Half bad haircuts and bad body maker, half pay to win. You literally have to buy the hair. Yeah.  Gameplay gets boring and repetitive VERY FAST. with the dungeons just being rusty hearts. 4/10 really bad rusty hearts rip off.			"

												Played about an hour, absolutely terrible game.  Buggy and glitchy.  Nothing of what the trailers and description live up to what the game actually plays like.  I maxed out every graphical setting and even forced some things from my own desktop control panel.  Nothing of this game is worth the time, even F2P.  Very dissapointed in the way this game works and runs, even on a high end machine.  As for the dodging and combat, you just hit space when you see a enemy hammering down on you and well even if you are standing there, you will dodge it.  Every time you hit an enemy the screen pauses for a .1 of a second, which was clearly intended.  Not worth playing at all, create something new DEVS, just swallow and move on.			"

												I am recommending this, but it still has certain problems to it.I have played Vindictus far more off steam than on steam, and I can say with certainty that this game has potential. The combat was always something I had been looking for ───── more than just hitting a hotkey and waiting for the player to do the work, also known as not needing ""skill"" at all.Even the graphics are quite beautiful.But, what takes away from it is Nexon. I don't agree that the community is bad, the people I've met are quite nice. But, Nexon, they don't fix any issues you report. It really takes away from the game when you have a problem and the company couldn't care less.I've also seen people say this is a pay to win, and it definitely is not. True, there are items, pets, accessories, etc., that you can buy to add to the game. But, do you have to pay to really enjoy the game? No. No, you do not.All in all, I think it's worth checking out.			"

												Let me start out with a positive, the combat in the game is pretty cool.  Sadly, that is the only good thing I can say about this game.Between the freezing, drop in response of the game (input from controler or keyboard/mouse to the time your avatar takes an action), the combat can be very challenging and frustrating.  Trying to upgrade items that cost you millions in game currency runs the risk of destroying the item, which is very easy to do.  You can buy items from their microtransactoin store to reduce the risk of destroying items, however because of the severe greed of Nexon, you can easily spend hundreds of real dollars to do this.As a free to play game goes, I would never recommend this to anyone.  The currency store is very pricy, and they have time limits on items that other games are a once purchased items such as storage.			"

Sometimes the game is boring as hell, like when you are leveling up or grinding for armour or a weapon. The enhancing is the worst part of the game. DAMN YOU FERGHUS!

												If I remember correctly, this game is the reason I downloaded steam, and sure enough it was worth it, for a while. My play time may be deceiving, because the majority of it came shortly after I downloaded Vindictus.First off, the characters are all unique both in appearance and feeling, as well as gameplay. Great. The gameplay itself is much more satisfying than any other MMORPG I've ever played. The way you position your character, the multitude of different combos you utilize by threading both attacks and spells together literally blew my my mind with every drop of gnoll blood I splatted upon the cold, cursed ground.I love the combat mechanics in this game, and I always will-But the story is simply lackluster. It's hard to explain, because the story is there and there's really nothing wrong with it, but its execution is just bad. I'm not sure if there is a single character model for any of the NPCs in the game. The fact that you never see commander so-and-so fight ANYONE, or general whats-her-face kill ANYBODY, or any of these supporting characters DO ANYTHING, it makes you feel alone, and that makes for a very weak story.The story also suffers from sheer repetition in each level. Go through these ruins, kill these dogs, repeat. Same ruins, same dogs, repeat. OH WAIT A BO- aaaaaand it's just a big dog with a similar attack pattern abusable by anyone with half a brain.Okay new area. Icy tunnels. Goblins. Bigger goblin. Repeat. Tunnels. Goblins. Bigger Goblin. Repeat.Mind-numbing.I like this game, I really do, and I would recommend it to anyone, especially because it's free.But in summary this game is a testament as to why you cant make a game great with gameplay alone.

												Not going to lie. This game looked promising at first. The prologue was great and the combat system was also pretty good. However, everything changes as soon as you finish the prologue. The UI becomes extremely cluttered with ridiculous things like facebook like buttons and other useless things. Not only that but after the prologue the game becomes extremely laggy. Also the mouse cursor is off when trying to click on buttons in any menu. You have to click below the button for it to register the click. I would not recommend playing this game unless you don't care about those things. I'm sure if I had played the game for longer then I may have looked past all of those things eventually, but I didn't want to put in the effort nor time.Overall rating: 5/10			"

												This has to be in one of my most favorite MMOs of all time, ive played Vindictus a lot more off-steam than on steam and what i can say is that one of it's greatest strengths is it actually improves a lot and often through updates and patches even so many years after release. To be honest, i was very disapointed in vindictus when it first launched, and about just as disapointed a year later, but when i did come back to it this summer, i felt like everything i've ever wanted in an MMO was now a part of this game.Pros: -Amazing Combat System , arguibly the best feature of the game.-Decent customization system for character and gear.-Lots of fun characters(classes) , most with 2 weapons (completely different playstyles usually).-The more you learn and the further you get, it will only intrigue you more rather than bore you like most MMOs.-Good Trademarket/auction house-Good events, rewards, freebies, etc.-Most stuff you pay for is either small boosts to exp and drop rates or just cosmetics. (unless you count the temporary mid lvl (50-60) you can buy , which you can also get from redeployment packages for free.-Absolutely BEAUTIFUL visuals, graphics, animations, characters, mobs, etc.-Lots of rich characters and stories and information to be learnt if interested (more of a con for me).Cons:-Lots and i mean LOTS of some what annoying text/chat bubbles from characters.-to level up quests are practically neccesary (that includes a lot of side quests)-The most Frowned upon part (that i havnt personally had much of an issue with) is that dungeons and instances are peer to peer connection.-Price difference of good mid-high level equips to great mid-high level equips to end-game equips is quite noticeable.-Requires some what of an actual graphic card and processor (not saying high end or even mid-tier, but you cant expect to play on an intel hd graphics or a very outdated low-end graphic card and get good frames).-underwear/underarmor sticks out of some armors and the defaults are plain white tights that can only be replaced by other under garments for real money (per character).Overall: this game might have been less fun in comparison to similar games like dragon nest, c9, diablo, etc in its earlier days, but now it outclasses them in certain different ways. i simply hope they make end game gear more approachable, let more ppl from more regions play the game, and with an actual server sided hosting system. but some of these things might just be too much to ask for. Well at least untill black desert comes out (if it's as good as the hype) this will be my goto and favorite MMO.			"

												I want to recommend this game, I really do. I didnt get very far though, only to level 20 or so. The last time I played it was around a year ago, too.The main part of the game is the hack-and-slash segments with a little bit of exploring thrown in, but the fighting gets very repetitive. The stages are just recycled. They were too lazy to even change the layout most of the times. All they did was put the enemies in new spots. Leveling was very grindy. When you found a weapon better than the one you were using at the moment, you were lucky. I kept a lvl 8 or 10 weapon until I stopped playing. The fastest way to get better gear was to use the market.And now the part that turned me off the most;  account pin code. When you first started the game, you were prompted to make a pin code, so as to not have someone log into your account and delete all of your characters and stuff. The thing is though, you forget that code, forget your chances of ever playing on those characters again. I didnt bother to contact support though, seeing as how that I didnt really have a desire to play the game again.Overall, the game is good. It is just the company that ruined it. It had a very good design and a very poor execution. Like I mentioned at the top, I didnt get very far. I just couldnt push myself to grind through the repetitive levels over and over and over just to find something that had +5 damage over my current weapon.			"

												Vindictus asks; What are you willing to put up with to play a game totally unlike any other MMO out there? The gameplay is fast, fun, and has that perfect 'easy to learn, hard to master' feel to it. Grouping up with other people to take down a behemoth of a boss is one of those can't miss moments. With that said, the other aspects of the game are pretty terrible. Lag is ever present, even on high end PCs. DC's are (at least for me) near constant. Nexon's support is mediocre at the best of times. A lot of late game content is locked behind item mall purchases. This list could go on for much longer but I'll stop it now.I played Vindictus years ago and enjoyed the hell out of it. Dropped due to above reasons and came back to see if at least the preformance bugs were handled only to be disappointed. It is free to download though so give it a shot, see if it works, and enjoy what you can out of it.			"

												Until I played this game I gave very little consideration to Free to Play MMOs. Normally they are so pay to win it hurts. However Vindictus has turned out to be one of my all time favorite games I think I have ever played. It has definately come a long ways since I started playing it.The graphics are nice considering this game only runs on DX9. If you enjoy a more linear game progression then this would would be great for you. The dev team still add new content every few months and there is always community events, especially during holidays.This is a very solid game and is definately worth at least checking out.			"

												I loved this game when I played it regularly. I have since moved on to play other games but I loved the combat and gameplay in vindictus. The costumes and customization was among my favorite in any game I've played and having pets was of course a bonus. I would play this off and on if only the community and the game economy didn't die.			"

												As you can see, I have 268 hours into this game( another 500+ without steam)... My account was banned because I called out a GM about their looting system being all buggy at the release of dragons. In the chat logs I had received a Tear drop but I never got it in my Inventory nor did I get it in my mailbox. After I brought this to the GM's attention, I logged out and logged back in (or tried to) to only see that my account was banned. Upon FINALLY getting a reply from Nexon, I was told that my account was banned due to breaking the User agreement. When I asked them about what I ""broke"", my alt account (the one I made to put in the ticket) was banned also. So you tell me... is Nexon really a company you want to spend your time on?			"

												Alright, so heres some of my opinions on this game.This game is extremely fun for me. Its hard to stop, I enjoy MMOs with ACTUAL combats and good PVPs and some bad♥♥♥♥♥monsters that make you wanna hate them, love them or just wanna destroy them over and over. Vindictus maybe a P2P or Pay to look sexy but its not about how you look, its about how strong and having the right stuff and know your jobs. There are some bad parts about this game that I must protest about. Steam makes the game extremely laggy and crashes shoter than 30 minutes or a hour. Please fix that♥♥♥♥♥♥ I had to move to Nexon due to the numerous lags. Hosting is terrible when playing through Steam and just makes gameplay not fun and extremely frusting.I love Vindictus. Its the first MMOs (Besides Blade and Soul and Mabinogi. Sorry for my misspelling.) thats gotten me hooked into it and just want to play more and more. Nonstop. I love testing my strength, I love challeging others, I love showing off the most kick♥♥♥♥♥weapons I have in this game.  If you like fighting big♥♥♥♥♥monsters, hot female bosses and booming your weapon by enchacing 200,000 times then this is your game. But hey thats my opinion on this game. Lets see what you can do and how well you fight to become the master of battles.Now some cons I want to speak about- Nexon is not great w/ customer service. I wouldn't buy anything from them if I was you.- DevCat.... ehhhh Good music tho but♥♥♥♥♥♥man...-Too much money to buy 100,000 NX or higher. At least set up some discounts xDOh and some other pros-Good ol' jiggle physics-Kick♥♥♥♥♥armour-Cute pets but I don't usually buy them-Furries. I don't know if you like furries but there ya go.. Furries... but only men are furries.. not the women..HAVE FUN! "

												Ok, to be straight up - I was unable to play the game itself. I spent the 8 hours or so to down load it and when I went to play it, had to make an account with Nexxon. I did so or at least tried to. It has been over 24 hours and I still have not recieved the email verification code. I cannot even contact customer support to speak with them over it.So, this game fails because the company is less than remotely even giving a crap about its players or future players.			"

												All I can say is the combat system can be fun and the story is alright. But that's about it.The game is plagued by gold sellers which has in turn caused an incredibly inflated economy on trade materials revolving around the crafting/enhance system. When you can buy 100million gold for $13 and then buy all the trade materials off the market place...yeah...I've already earned close to 1million gold by just selling trade materials and haven't even reached level 15. Some trade goods go for about 100,000g each, while some weapons and gear sell for about 1,000g.On top of that, this game runs like trash. It's an unopimitized heap of trash. HUGE framerate spikes. Stuttering from anywhere about 10fps to 40fps in an area as you simply stand there...makes no sense and is incredibly frustrating.On top of it all, the dungeons and enemies can become incredibly bland and boring as there is very little to zero variety.

												Has the best combat system I've ever seen. Constantly adding more combat mechanics to learn for both your characters and bosses/raids. Lots of events. More armor customization than most games. Could really use better servers. I've put enough hours into this game to be level 500 (if that were a thing) but I'm just now getting it on steam. Vindictus would get a nearly perfect score from me if they just had better servers and a slightly better uptime.			"

												I only merged my Nexon account with Steam so I can use my Steam Wallet, so this isn't some prematurely written review. I have a reasonable amount of experience with the game (4 characters over 75 and many above 50). With that being said I'll start with the pros, or what made it attractive FOR ME. The combat is simply amazing. It's fast paced yet fluid and responsive, versitile yet easy to learn. The reason why I stuck with the game for so long was because I wanted to try out every character's skills (with my favorite being Lann). You will rarely find a game with combat as action packed as Vindictus. Although it is instance based, Vindictus does a good job of making sure that the environment does not get too bland. Doungeons are has enough differences that you will never feel like you're just doing the same level again (with very little exceptions). This is achieved with difference in themes, maps (of course), traps (and not too many of them), and interactive elements. Now, the factors that made me quit.The story. It's pretty engaging and interesting... if it's your first time playing it. It follows the genderless and universal hero formula as all other one-path MMORPG storyline. No (interesting) sidequests to explorer, no extra content. The whole game is just sending you from place to place and instance to instance. The fact that you can buy almost everything with NX. If you've played old school Maplestory, you'd know about Nexon's mistake (or not since they probably milked those whales dry). In Vindictus, Nexon applies the same principle. You can buy almost anything in the game as long as you have the NX. From potions and revives to skill points and endgame gear. Yes, it is a skill based game, but think about it... being able to heal to full hp almost instantly, reviving without penalty, and all the damage boost. When I bought my first skill capsule (skill points), I thought to myself... ""wow all those hours wasted grinding dailys was kind of pointless."" I immediately lost a bit of passion for this game. Overally, for me, it's worth the first playthrough. It's something to pick up during your one week break and then let go as soon as something better comes up. "

If you play this game, chances are you'll eventually lose your account through false bans or hacking due to Nexon's incompetence and no mistake of your own, and they will absolutely do nothing to remedy their mistakes. They have zero respect for their users and make zero effort to listen to the game's community. The game is is sadly dying due to these behaviors, so please don't bother with it or at the very least, don't waste your money on it.			"

If there were places to explore aside from dungeons and just bashing enemies I think I would love it.. but again, that's just me. Aside from that, this is an amazing game.			"

												Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this game. It's a lot of fun and an excellent game, but publisher Nexon NA ruins it. If you play this game, chances are you'll eventually lose your account through false bans or hacking due to Nexon's incompetence and no mistake of your own, and they will absolutely do nothing to remedy their mistakes. They have zero respect for their users and make zero effort to listen to the game's community. The game is is sadly dying due to these behaviors, so please don't bother with it or at the very least, don't waste your money on it.			"

												I only merged my Nexon account with Steam so I can use my Steam Wallet, so this isn't some prematurely written review. I have a reasonable amount of experience with the game (4 characters over 75 and many above 50). With that being said I'll start with the pros, or what made it attractive FOR ME. The combat is simply amazing. It's fast paced yet fluid and responsive, versitile yet easy to learn. The reason why I stuck with the game for so long was because I wanted to try out every character's skills (with my favorite being Lann). You will rarely find a game with combat as action packed as Vindictus. Although it is instance based, Vindictus does a good job of making sure that the environment does not get too bland. Doungeons are has enough differences that you will never feel like you're just doing the same level again (with very little exceptions). This is achieved with difference in themes, maps (of course), traps (and not too many of them), and interactive elements. Now, the factors that made me quit.The story. It's pretty engaging and interesting... if it's your first time playing it. It follows the genderless and universal hero formula as all other one-path MMORPG storyline. No (interesting) sidequests to explorer, no extra content. The whole game is just sending you from place to place and instance to instance. The fact that you can buy almost everything with NX. If you've played old school Maplestory, you'd know about Nexon's mistake (or not since they probably milked those whales dry). In Vindictus, Nexon applies the same principle. You can buy almost anything in the game as long as you have the NX. From potions and revives to skill points and endgame gear. Yes, it is a skill based game, but think about it... being able to heal to full hp almost instantly, reviving without penalty, and all the damage boost. When I bought my first skill capsule (skill points), I thought to myself... ""wow all those hours wasted grinding dailys was kind of pointless."" I immediately lost a bit of passion for this game. Overally, for me, it's worth the first playthrough. It's something to pick up during your one week break and then let go as soon as something better comes up. "

												All I can say is the combat system can be fun and the story is alright. But that's about it.The game is plagued by gold sellers which has in turn caused an incredibly inflated economy on trade materials revolving around the crafting/enhance system. When you can buy 100million gold for $13 and then buy all the trade materials off the market place...yeah...I've already earned close to 1million gold by just selling trade materials and haven't even reached level 15. Some trade goods go for about 100,000g each, while some weapons and gear sell for about 1,000g.On top of that, this game runs like trash. It's an unopimitized heap of trash. HUGE framerate spikes. Stuttering from anywhere about 10fps to 40fps in an area as you simply stand there...makes no sense and is incredibly frustrating.On top of it all, the dungeons and enemies can become incredibly bland and boring as there is very little to zero variety. In the end, the combat system is the only thing it has going for it.			"

												My review For Vindictus? Great game.Should you play it? Hell no.Why?Problem #1: Servers suck and since Nexon doesnt give a♥♥♥♥♥♥they wont fix them(Probably the biggest thing holding this game back)Problem #2: Elitist community. (No im not one of them but it pisses me off to see it happen)To elaborate on the problems. #1 figure it out. Describes itself.#  The community wont change because the fact is likely 95% of the new people to try this game give the ♥♥♥♥ up because its hard as hell to play a game when you try to join/start a boat and are required to restart game BECAUSE THE SERVERS SUCK♥♥♥♥♥♥ No constant flow of new player means no new community and the new players who do end up sticking to the game just end up joining the Elitist community to get kicked and shunned from boats because they dont have the acceptable gear to do that raid even when the ""Acceptable"" gear is only obtainable FROM said raid. The community expects you to buy all your gear so you can do the runs to get the gear you just finished buying. For what? to gear your other chars? What about your main? Only way your getting anywhere is if your hooked up with a guild of Elitists that see you can play the game decent but just lack gear and at that point will carry you through the raids most of them can do solo to begin with.Dont really need to go into depth on the game and the various other issues it has because every game has its normal flaws that people dislike but i mean not everything should be easy.

												First, I played several hours prior to the arrival of this game on steam. It is a good and enjoyable game without a doubt. The gameplay is nice, the progression too, graphics are nice and all. So, why no reccommend it? Easy to say. Nexon have little to none support. you spend money in the game, you might or might not get what comes with it, what you will surely get is no answer from their part. Good features - Great gameplay, varies depending on the character and weapon type. - Graphics are nice. - Music isn't bad, not great but it's enjoyable. - Story is brought in a more Japanesse way, which isn't bad, but don't expect big cinematics as the story is more textual.Bad features - Customer support is a myth (I heard that a few people could get an answer from their part, but I never got any) - Real money spent in the game might end up split into two different pool of currency making you unable to buy the stuff you put money in for. (That is if you get some in-game currency for that hardly gained real money) - Servers are often buggy and/or down - There is a lot of connection issue known with this game.  - Hacking is a common ground around Nexon account (or so it seems, I actually got my main character's gear stolen, but I used a not-too-secure password, otherwise this point is more about what I've read on the community forums of Nexon at the time I tried to get my money back for a purchase that they did not give what was paid for). Verdict : It is a game to try, but never to invest real money in.			"

												This game makes me want to rip the skin off my face and eat it.... Pretty sure that would be more fun and better use of my time than it is.Now that we've got that out of the way.....I played this game a lot before it was on steam, I had no money at the time and a friend that loved it to death.He got me playing it to pass the time, as I had nothing better to do and and my aforementioned activity had not yet occurred to me, I went for it.At first glance the game seems alright, a nice cast of characters, a mediocre customization menu, the game doesn't look too shabby graphically, and it was free.Then I started walking.... The animation was smooth, so smooth in fact that I seemed to be sliding my feet along the ground, only moving about half as fast as my animation suggested I should be.. So I turned and ran to the left and I glided along in a way that could almost be compared to a cat trying to gain traction on a recently waxed floor, I mean I did turn, just not in the way one might expect a human to move across dirt and grass.I got to a combat section and because thought to myself ""This is where the game will redeem itself!!"" but I was Let down by this as well! It's by no means awful, but in my eyes it was typical, it didn't do anything I hadn't seen before and the execution of the system didn't wow me either, It lacked polish.That's when things started getting weird, suddenly I noticed that my character's physics would randomly spaz out while I was standing still, parts of her armor and/or body would jolt around like a kid who's had too much sugar. And I would randomly become stuck at odd angles against terrain during combatLets move on from all of that though.I feel like I should mention a few more things that struck me as odd... There are more loading screens in this game than you can shake a stick at. You wanna go to the docks where you access the missions? Loading screen! You wanna start a mission? Loading screen, which then leaves you on a tiny dock with a boat on it. You wanna start the mission for real this time? Loading screen!!!!! Just when you think that's all of 'em done, you kill a few baddies and walk a little ways... LOADING SCREEN!!!! I think you get the picture... The camera controls are shockingly sluggish for an ARPG.They call it an MMO, it's not an MMO it's a Co-Op multiplayer ARPG with a giant chat room where you can find up to 4 players to run missions with you.You need to use real money for most of the cool looking stuff.TLDR: The game claims to be things it isn't. It's not an awful game it's just a huge let down.If you like the concept of this game play Warframe, or nearly any other ARPG instead. (I mention Warframe only because it's similar to this game)If you think this review is unfair, feel free to dislike it. We're all entitled to our own opinions.P.S. Shortly before writing this I redownloaded the game on steam and nothing has changed.			"

A free to play game should be easily accessable and run smoothly on almost all current generation computers but this one wasted it's time and money on hack sheilds that are, at the time that this review is being written, are currently failing across all servers.

												If you are into action-based MMO's - then this is your kind of game. The one you'll be stuck on for hours on end. As always, here is a pros and cons list from my experience so far.PROS:- Tons of characters to choose from, all whom of which have their own skillset- Returning players are able to obtain very powerful weapons and armor that last for 30 daysCONS:- Gender is based on character you choose (ex. if you want to use a dual blade character, its male only)- As of playing to level 10, the questlines and story seem rather linear- From what I have seen, expereince is only gained after completing quests, rather than gaining experience for anything you do (however the tradeoff seems to be effective so far)			"

 Amazing game! ^^  Epic graphics, beautiful characters, difficult bosses, and speedy gameplay ^^ I can spend hours on a game like this, no-sweat. xD Yet, there are a few problems: Armor and weapons are very expensive, and farming can take hours. Rare drops tend to fall from enimies, even less, these days, and weapons tend to ""boom"", due to high-leveled enhancements, without protection. Though this game has its ups and downs, overall, if you put in the time and effort, you're sure to have an awesome experience ^^			"

												Been playing this game on and off for 3 years now. Here is what i have to say:Game itself is fantastic and actually fairly challenging to master. Many people have mentioned the sharp learning curve in raids, and I won't deny it does take effort, time and practice to get used to each boss, but in my honest opinion that's what makes this game unique and awesome. It is not a simple brainless point and click adventure like most other MMOs out there but actually takes quite a bit of skills to play well. You actually feel good after beating something. This is one of those games that defense is not that important once you can master it. In a nutshell, raids/raid bosses are where this game is mostly at. You do raids, gather seal of braveries and craft lv70 gears which would allow you to join those silly attack boats in Season 2. Acquiring 12 seals a day is perhaps the most efficient way to get gears up to speed, so you can have enough stats to do kraken and lakoria for their drops. You can choose to farm, but that is imho very time consuming and not worth the return you'd get. Instead, play 1-2 hours a day with a guild, run the raids of your choices + lakoria and kraken (mandatory, they are easy raids with valuable drops) and grab all the seals on all the characters you can.Since I mentioned characters, let's just say some characters are more powerful than the others. Certain character in this game has been pretty bad since 2011 and is still pretty bad lel. (aka that male character everyone thought was so cool holding 2 swords and looked like he would decimate everythng in this game but turned out he was the one who always got decimated for making 1 mistake huehuehue), and certain characters are a lot harder to gear up to the attack boat requirements. What I recommend is to roll one of these characters as your first character for now (in order of most recommended to least: hurk/arisha - kai - vella - lynn - Karok/evie/Fiona) and wait for the dual-sword character buff coming (test server in KR for now). The ones I listed are pretty fun as they are actually, and should keep you busy for a long time. So, to fully enjoy this game, I recommend:1). Spending enough to make a good weapon that can bring you up to 15-16k attack. How good the weapon has to be is up to you. I'd say to do end game lv80 dungeons, a +10 lv70 nighthawk is perhaps the best option for most people before they get hold of a lv80 weapon. They are good cheap weapons and very easy to make. Doing this is to join all these stupid S2 attack requirement boats.2). Have a decent computer to be able to run this game at 60fps in DX8. Otherwise you will not get the most out of it. Hardware from 2011/2012 is more than capable of this. Recommend an intel processor because this game hates AMD processor. OPTIONAL: if you choose to host 8-man dungeon, make sure your internet is at least 2mbps upload, in addition to meeting the 2012 pc requirement. 3). Overlook the bad things Nexon does, and take full advantage of good things they do.What I mean by this is that we all know how Nexon works as a company if you have played any of their games, and you can QQ as loud as you can, but every now and then they do some events and all that which are actually good for the players, and you don't wanna miss those just because how much personal grudge you hold against them. Things like giveaway, events etc. are for us, and we need to get all of them. Meanwhile get on forum and QQ/vent all you want when something goes wrong, because some of these issues have been there for YEARS and still not completely fixed. Cough cough server hamsters etc. 4). Avoid rolling a dual sword character as your first character for the reason I have described above. 5). Avoid too much farming for reason I described above.6). Focus on the gameplay and raid boss fights. Treat it as an action game and work on how you can improve and do better.			"

												Vindictus has been dead for quite some time now, the cash shop is atrocious, typical nexon events include 1% chances in gacha of getting a rare item and rewarded for afking events. There is zero customer support what so ever, the servers are very unstable and always have been.Dont get me wrong, the gameplay itself is fantastic and one of a kind but everything else has completely ruined the experience for me. Gold farming bots have been taking over vindictus since the release date and has destroyed the economy of most items making it so players just spend their own money to get top tier items without actually putting in the grind to earn it themselves.End game content is alright, your forced to buy enchant runes that fail/blow up at a 40% chance on top tier scrolls, dungeons hardly exist anymore and if you find one they are most likely with an attack requirement(19k-21k atk) which some new players who haven't spent any real money most likely will not be able to join.░░░░░░░░░░░█▀▀░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░▄▀▀▀▀░░░░░█▄▄░░░░░░░░░░█░█░░░░░░░░░░▐░░░░░░░░░▐▐░░░░░░░░░▄░▐░░░░░░░░░█░░░░░░░░▄▀▀░▐░░░░░░░▄▀░░░░░░░░▐░▄▄▀░░░░░░▄▀░░░▐░░░░░█▄▀░▐░░░░░░░█░░░▐░░░░░░░░▄░█░░░░░░░░█▄░░▀▄░░░░▄▀▐░█░░░░░░░░█▐▀▀▀░▀▀▀▀░░▐░█░░░░░░░▐█▐▄░░▀░░░░░░▐░█▄▄░░░░░░▀▀░▄  Vindictus░▐▄▄▄▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░			"

												Alright, so this is a revisit of my old review because I feel like I was way too hard on the game.Now, lets talk about Vindictus.Vindictus is an F2P MMO made by the infamous Nexon gaming company.You take on the roll of one of many classes, following the story of a mercenary (you) who is on the hunt to figure out why the fomors are attacking the humans.GameplayFrom a purely gameplay standpoint, the game is great. The combat is quite possibly the most fun combat system out of any mmo I've played (dating back to early WoW). It's all about timing and using your abilities to exploit your enemy and their weaknesses.It can get a little hard later on as end-game content heavily relies on your spending real life cash to upgrade your weapons. Some people have spent upward of $500 just to upgrade a set of items ingame.You were warned.Artistic stylings/Graphics/Designs/Story developmentIn all fairness, they have a decent story going on. I'll summarize the story in a spoiler at the end of this section so if you don't want to see it, don't scroll over the black bars.Character design is a major part of the game for many people. While there are events to get free innerwear and/or cosmetic outfits (that do give slight bonuses), it requires you to spend real money. Almost everything ""fun"" costs you real money.A typical set of standard clothes can cost you $10-$30 depending on where you live.The graphics and the cleanliness of your hud, character icons, etc. are all really well done.The game is pleasing to the eyes, and you can adjust the settings for these to either be ultra-highres or dumbed down to the point that a toaster oven could play it.As for the story, I'd love to see where they are going with it. You currently follow the life of your mercenary who helps the mercenary outpost find out why the fomors are attacking. Eventually, you join the Royal academy in Rocheste.Things then take a turn for the worst. Along your crusade to stop the fomors, you find out that your friend is actually the Oracle. The fomors are fighting you because if your Oracle finds her powers, the fomors die.The fomors want to use the Oracle to kill the humans.Race wars, basically.Then, upon the return of the Oracle, you lose your memory. All your friends who died, people you meet, etc.Everyone forgets you and you forget them. However, time is reverted but the casualties are there.Now, you are a pirate. You go out, do missions, and along the way you find the ""spirit stone"" (I think).One problem, it's a human and her brother Milo betrays you after she sacrifices herself to save her brother.Now, you forget everything AGAIN.You head out with your mercenary group to protect Rocheste against the attack of one giant fomor, Muir, who you literally ride up the Rocheste castle and attempt to kill in a battle of epic proportions.Why I wouldn't reccommend this game.I know what you're thinking ""this doesn't sound so bad, so far it's been mostly good parts about the game in this review"".Well, buckle up because here's where I throw you a curveball.Nexon is terrible.Absolutely trash.They force you to use a launcher that not only slows the game and is prone to memory leaks, but they use an ""anti-cheat"" that can ban you for literally anything. Itunes, your own antivirus calling Nexon Anti-Cheat a virus, or that time you forgot to turn your Razer macros off.Aside from that, you're not allowed to help new players.At all.People used to make guides and youtube videos for the noobies but as of recently, Nexon will ban you from both their forums and the steam forums (RIP Morgianna). Nexon is like the Nazis of gaming, if you don't like when they randomly decide to slap you in the face then that's too bad because they'll ban you before you say anything they don't like.Aside from that, all the major aspects of this game will require you to spend real cash on items that are way too damn overpriced. Maybe it's just NexonNA, I don't know.In order to do end-game or high level content, you need to upgrade your weapons and abilities. It's not an option.After upgrading something (excluding abilities) three times, your item has a change to PERMANENTLY BREAK.Meaning your item is gone forever and is only retrievable by spending more AP than physically possible to get in the game (meaning you'd need to BUY CAPSULES TO GET IT BACK).THE BIGGEST POINT OF ALL RIGHT HERE BECAUSE I'M STILL DUMBFOUNDED OVER THIS.Here's a story that should tell you just how Nexon cares about you.Max level GM (Game-Manager AKA Nexon Employee) gets on the game.No items, no innerwear, stock Karok.They go to Channel 1, the main channel where everyone is spamming gold sites and where most people hang out.They drop ""premium bath soap"" in the hotsprings.""But what's wrong with that?""What's wrong with it is the fact that I followed him from the Inn of Colhen - where there were 4 bots spamming gold sites for free Nexon cash and gold - all the way to the hotsprings where there was one person (level 82) spamming the Megaphone channel (people all over the game in all channels can see that chat at all times) with - you guessed it - A GOLD SITE LINK...Nexon legitamitly doesn't care. They would rather slow your game, damage your computer, and ban you for helping a new player rather than ban gold spammers and bots that flood their servers.*As of writing this, the guy spamming megaphone chat with a gold site still exists. Three months later.( •᷄ὤ•᷅)？			"

Product received for free
												It's been almost four years. Four years of endless raids, failed enhancements, countless revives, and $10 hair. Vindictus is a great game, don't get me wrong. The combat system is like no other; it's not just a point-and-click adventure, it's a time-based, active style of playing. There is plenty of stuff to do as well, such as improving your expertise, building and getting the best gear, getting 500+ titles, helping out your guildmates, waiting for the Korean updates to come to NA, dressing up your female characters ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), spending millions on dyes for your armor and outfits because you need to have that ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣ, destroying your weapon while attempting to get +15 and crying afterward, and more! There are currently 11 classes (some of which have alternate weapon choices), which makes for a variety of playing styles. If you ever get bored, just make an alt! Although the character creator is not as advanced as BDO's or other MMOs, you can still have fun with it, and make your characters really ♥♥♥♥ing fat, like really huge, it's funny (and I'm terrible.).If you enjoy being a meat shield, then you will like Fiona.If you love K-Pop, than you will looooooove Sylas.If you like shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥from far away because you are a pansy, then you will like Kai.If you like having two swords because one is not enough for you, then you will like Lann.If you don't like Lann because he's a dude, then you will like Vella.If you love big breasted women with magical swords, then you will like Arisha.If you are into big, meaty, dark, muscular men, then you will love Karok.If you like barely-legal girls, then you will adore Lynn.If you are into girls, and magic, and by extension magic girls, then you will dig Evie.If you like dudes that need phallic compensation, then you will enjoy Hurk.If you like striping in your combat, then you will like Delia.Overall this game is really fun, especially with friends, and also a huge waste of time; it's great! Oh and the bots actually help the economy stay stable, go figure!			"

												Now, I've played a lot of MMO's over the past 8 years or so, mostly fantasy RPGs. Within the past 2 it has been surprisingly hard to find a solid contender for the ""Action RPG"", as I thought they would become more popular. I've been seeing nothing but, attempt, after attempt, of companies trying to produce an action oriented combat system, all but a select few falling very short of what I would consider polished, and functional. I played in the original release of Vindictus up until Evie was released, and picked it back up shortly after Kai was released.  The beginning was rough, with few characters, and the mission limits, with a token system that forced players to pay actual money to play more than a couple missions a day. However, now that stuff is gone, and what I see, and experience is a truly thought out, polished, and challenging combat system, that cannot be found in any other MMO out there. It is on par, and in some cases better than single player, full price fantasy RPGs. However, there are still major draw backs that prevent me from recommending it to everyone.  One; the way the game is set up, it forces players to go through one of the longest, and cruelest, grinds of any game I've ever played. By having all of the cool, and unique adventures restricted now, but not last March, to being level 50 or over. Many new players go in to try out this cool game, but are forced to drag themselves through repetitive areas, and a story that no-one is going to read,(Trust me, I tried), just to get to maps that are unique, and drastically more polished parts of the game. It's like giving someone a game, and saying, ""These first 50 levels are just a test, to see if you're worthy of the good stuff"". On a positive note, those forced 50 levels are fantastic practice, so you aren't likely to be terrible on your first major raid. I just don't understand the decision to increase the level restriction for the big raids in Malina.  Two; even though it has been said numerous times, the utter lack of choice a player has when making a character without paying a little for a hair style, or inner. It's brilliant business wise, I understand, but character customization is  huge factor to an increasingly large amount of MMO players. The simple lack of variety in new characters is a huge turn off, and a reason I can't give this game a perfect pass. Now, I've spent well over a few hundred dollars on this game, simply because I love it, and I'm invested into the characters I've spent over 500 hours with. When it comes down to it, there is a large audience that will give this game a shot and dwindle away shortly after reaching level 20 or so, since there isn't much to do, very few will continue on to actually play the ""game"".  In the end, Vindictus is a game that gives players an unparalleled action RPG experience, it may take a long time to dive into, but once you've past your ""test"", you'll likely never find another FREE* MMO that gives you a truly ambitious, and thrilling combat experience.

												Nice hack and slash game but very repetitive. Fun battle system. Sometimes glitchy. Season two dungeons are much better then season ones, and that's where I felt the game play really stood out.  One of the laybirinth dungeons is really soul sucking, it's one where you kick a little golden ball to damage enemies. Don't bother with it unless you have to. You will cry. Your party members will cry. No one has fun. =cHeres a tip:For extra money in the marketplace near the begining of the game, sell your mana dusts. You might not need them for awhile because the equipment you get at the start will not be worth enchanting. Take advantage of the steady marketplace price for a decent supply of money. use this money to help with quests or save up for exspensive equipment later on.			"

												It's technically an MMO, but it plays like a multiplayer action game.This interesting hybrid of gameplay styles works wonderfully.In addition, Vindictus is compatible with xbox 360 controllers, and works quite well with them during dungeons. You'll still want a keyboard and mouse handy for the town areas and for typing and UI selections though.I find it difficult to enjoy most MMO titles, but this one really feels like you're playing an action title. The gameplay is fast paced and action oriented. Dungeons are initially doable solo, but eventually the difficulty ramps up too high for that.Thankfully, joining random groups is simple and streamlined. Quest and mission objectives are usually very straightforward and areas are fairly linear for the most part, so teaming up and working together with other players is rarely a chore or hassle.The story is a bit on the weak side, but the gameplay is the star of the show, and it shines brightly.

												I absolutely adore this game. My boyfriend got me into it just last year and even though there aren't too many people who play it these days (I think most of them migrated to TERA Online or Guild Wars 2) if you have one or two friends who play it's a really great experience to do battle quests with them and form a guild with your characters and things like that. About the new character, Lynn... I love the way she skips around in town (default animation) but her fighting animations are very glitchy and as soon as I went for a smash attack my game crashed. I'm not speaking for everyone when I say this, but I'd recommend picking one of the other classes for now, at least until she's been properly patched.That being said, definitely try this one out if you love the fantasy MMO genre and nice, clean graphics.

												Please, for the love everything that's good in this world, do not attempt to play this game and haves hopes of having a good time. It has become a cesspool of pay-to-win, arrogant imbeciles who have very large egos because they already have end-game gear and you don't, despite long months of straight work to get where you've gotten with your character. On top of that, this game is jam-packed full of bugs that are to blame from both the publisher, Nexon and the developer DevCat. Both would rather punish players instead of fixing whatever bugs may be present. I'm personally not sure how I invested so much time into this game. The gameplay itself is just about the only good thing about this game. Unfortunately, that's just not enough to make this game good as a whole. I would really like to see completely new management from the publisher's staff. I'd like to see a complete overhaul of bug fixes and things in the category. I would also LOVE to see stable servers and a rewrite of some of the internal coding of this game. One of the things this game has going for it is the blatant and shameless sexuality that it promotes. That's one reason it does semi-well, due to the inner armors (underwear) that you can purshase for your character. Basically, what I'm trying to say is: ""Just don't waste your time on this game."" If you decide to play it, then just don't expect much. This game is designed to take a very long time to obtain items, whether they be weapons or armor, and it's also designed to nearly force you to spend money on it in order to protect your gear from potential failed enhancements or enchants, both of which can destroy your items. Anyway, I'll end this review.  That's it.			"

												Definitely a reccomendation for anyone who likes an MMORPG, but to prove it to you, let's give you a list of pros and cons- at least in my opinion of what are pros and cons. Pros: -The action is both fast paced and slow depending on which you prefer.-The actions in the trailer, the fighting? Exactly how you fight in game, but not as cool as in game. Odd, right? -The weapons are amazing looking as well as pets and everything else you obtain.-Wicked cool story line that has emotion, but also envokes you to play more- because you can't move forward until you beat missions. But that's not even a con, it's like watching a movie, gotta watch earlier parts to get the ending. -Lets you choose your own path for the story. Which way you lean, and how you want to fight yourself. -Amazing graphics.-Allows you to do raids, and work with a team for missions- Very helpful. -Did I mention the action was flippin' AMAZING? -If you say ""Eh, I don't wanna play for a while."" when you get pack, they give you stuff to say ""PLS PLAY AGAIN"" permanent epic weapons that aren't really rare, but sure look cool and are probably a step up from your old weapons, however it takes I believe 3 months of vacay from the game to get it. Now to the CONS: -Some stuff you have to pay for, but that's not too big a deal.-There are gaps in levels, where you have to grind to a certain level to move forward. -At times, it's very hard to play, sometimes the story won't finish until you repeat certain missions to even unlock the next place. -Limited weapons for your ""class"", don't get me wrong, it's nice to have weapons only your class can wield, but.. there's just not much variety, you get probably 3 weapons to choose from every 10-20 levels and at times it makes the choosing of appearance and how you wish to look for parties and what not rather dull. If they had more styles of weapons for your class, different shapes for them, more in general, it would improve the ""fun-ness"" of the game and make people more easily willing to play with more given choices. It's an amazing game, definitely worth playing. I have 275 hours logged into it and more are sure to come, but unless you want to play the game for a long time, and get involved with its story- it might not be for you. Keep that in mind. Other than that, a really enjoyable game, and free to play? Well, damn, sign me up! Oh wait, I already am.See you in Vindictus my friends! Battle on.			"

												Ever wanted to be truly rewarded for your skill in a game? How about some action, RPG, and a whole lotta hack'n'slash? Vindictus is that game. Taking place thousands of years before the fantasy life MMORPG, Mabinogi, another Nexon title -- this game is definitely not about picking wool off a sheep or raising crops on a field. This is the most simple yet highly complex Action MMORPG out right now.Many have tried to emulate this style of MMO but Vindictus had laid forth a tyrant of an action game. Running on Valve's Source engine, the detail level of this game is simply gorgeous, the physics are top-notch (hilarious rag doll physics included), and monster AI will prove to give you a run for your golds at higher difficulties. Vindictus is mainly a dungeon crawling Action MMORPG with hub to dungeon travel via Story /Quest Boards and some stages may look repetitive and they are but as you keep playing, you'll find many other things to do. Welcome to the Vindictus where skill matters..			"

Unlike Traditional MMO's this one doesn't have you mashing skill buttons and waiting on cooldowns you actaully have to position your charecter and dodge and work together. There is no holy trinity every charecter has different skills that help them survive. All bosses are pretty much different and have certain ways you must go about defeating them. I would recommend it for all of my friends.			"

												The game it's self is great. I left the game last time because the drop rates were completely outragious. I was stuck with S1 E8 weapons for the longest time. I don't think I ever got around it. I left at around S2 E2, due to the fact that I was still using S1 E8 equipment and I was always getting kicked out of rooms because I never was able to find drops that would assist my self to raise my attack. But of course, Nexon games will always be like this. I decided to give it another whirl to see if there is anything to change my perspective. But I doubt it.But in all seriousness, 1/200 chance to get a rare drop on a raid we can only do once a day, then after that we need 5 of those to make a single rare equip. Complete bull. If this game is still like this, my answer is to just not download the game.			"

But Nexon really makes it hard to even enjoy the game without buying anything. Your character will look like♥♥♥♥♥♥until you buy a inner armor package, and the really nice outer armors are basically impossible to permanently own unless you buy.  Features within the game itself sometimes are lessened in quality because of course, you did not buy anything. It just really get frustrating after a while.

												I can't say I recommend this game, and it hurts to say that. Not only is the game as infested with bugs as a wooden house built over a termite mound, but the community is as spiteful as they come. Then again, that's nohing new from Nexon at all is it? To top it all of, when the new update came around, now when i even try to load up the game, I'm greeted by a lovely ""Cannot Connect To Server"" message, so I cant show people just how bad it is. Waste of time, and an even bigger waste of space on my computer.			"

												I really and truly want to give this game a positive review, but I simply cannot bring myself to.To start, Vindictus is an MMORPG and Hack n' Slash game that really misses the MMO portion of its genre. It has features of one, like a global marketplace and raids and the sort, but it stops there. There are only two cities in the entire game and a field that seperates them with little activity in either one. Aside from queing for battles, there isn't much to do in the locations, there's crafting and quest givers that can provide some interesting dialouge, but it stops there. Honestly, this isn't too much of a problem compared to the more pressing problems I have with the game.Gameplay is very solid, however, the skill tree for each of the playable characters is very diverese as each character is allowed to use two different weapons in their class; such as a mage who can choose to use a scythe or a staff or a tank that can use either a pillar or cestus as a weapon. Each provide their own strengths and weaknesses in their own regard and I found it enjoyable learning the combos and intricacies of each weapon and skill. Unfortunately, the pros for the game stop at the gameplay. The largest problem I have with the game is the developer; for those that don't know, Nexon is a very greedy company. The in-game store offers a range of items that either change the cosmetic appearance or provide a game breaking and pay-to-win experiance like buying items that buff your stats to paying to allow yourself to do more raids, it's downright criminal. The downfall of this also comes into the heafty price they ask for literally EVERYTHING. Just to change the hairstyle of your character (as you can only choose about 5 when you first start, then have to pay, seperately, for the additional 20 Nexon expects you to buy) runs you about $7. Want to change your clothes? $10. Want to be able to do more daily raids? $10. Another serious problem with Nexon is their support for the game. While the branches of Nexon in various other areas of the world like in Europe or Asia recieve timely patches to the game that actually provide new content like new characters, new locations, new raids, etc. The Nexon supporting this version, Nexon NA, is the about the most incompetent company I have seen. Instead of working on updates that the community has been begging for, they keep making new events that act as little mini-games or side missions you can do that, SURPRISE, you have to pay real money in order to even finish, and sometimes even participate in.Probably the largest problem I have with the game, despite how dreadful the company is, is the absoltuely absurd grind that you have to do at high levels. The main story lasts from levels 1-60, which is not that bad and you may end up being overleveled for some missions you must do, but after you finish the main story comes the real pain. From 60, the level cap is 80, and you can obtain the best weapons and armor in the game, but in order to do this requires you to not only grind many, many hours away hoping you get the materials required to make a weapon or piece of armor, but to withstand the god awful drop rate that about every item has. The drop table is about as bad as the enhancing and upgrading system in the game. To make matters worse, in order to even get the item you need, you have to grind raids. Remember what I said about how greedy Nexon was? Well you can only run the raids you need about 3 times or so a day, so if you really want those materials, you better pull out your wallet because grinding that raid is gonna cost you extra.Honestly, I really want to recommend this game to everyone, but unless this game gets taken over by a more respectable and competent company, I simply can't.

												*sighs*as of 6-17-2014 I can no longer recoemend Vindictus.Nexon's greed and Devcats incompentence is slowly but steadly driving the game into the dirt.Firstly, there is the removeal of the jumping mechanic. Granted it was poorly implemented to begin with, but instead of opting to fix it, the instead removed it, and sunsquently reworked all of seaon 2, map lay out and enemys, to compenstate for the player no longer being able to jump.Secondly, they actually removed the option to run season 2 from levels 8-49. Because high level players where farming them for Seals (needed to buy high end mats) and AP (needed to rank up skills, some of which need 2 or 3k per rank and you at best, getting 250) so again, instead of fixing the issue, they just removed a chunk of the game. Then there what Nexon it self is doing, since Devcat isn't the only one ruining this thing.The cash shop is starting to lean toward a 'pay2win' model, granted, it's still a LONG way from that, but it's starting down that road, from the overpriced pets who grant extra, and rather potentant effects like buffs or mining ore for you, to the laughably over priced Enchantment, and Enhancement Runes that are pretty much required to be usefull in the 70-80 tier content, The 'events' are pretty much ONLY for lining Nexon pockets with money, with what ever free items being little more then the cheapest items in the cash shop, while what ever good items that are attatched are only attainable vai 'random item' boxes you buy from the cash shop, with a rather horrible chance of actually getting the event item, as you'd probably expect.Speaking of the RNG, It's horrible here. Drop rates have always been bad in this game, but pretty much any equipment worth using level 60 and up requires AT LEAST one ultra rare mateiral drop, per piece, and I don't mean 'I've been farming for a week and finally got one' rare, I mean 'this raid has been out for a year, I've been running it daily, still haven't gotten the drop I need' rare. Sadly, I'm not exagerating ether. The RNG ties into the final issue I want to mention. the price of things. The amount of gold you need to cercumvent the drop rates is prohibitive to every one who isn't willing to risk getting ripped off to buy gold. the Seal Shop, which sells the ultra rare mateirs you need, is suppossed to combat the drop rate issue, but it really just added to the grind problem, with some taking anywhere from 5 days, to more then a month of JUST Seal farming to get. (12 seals per day, 1 seal per raid run, 1 victory per raid a day)The actual gameplay it self is still fun, but Nexon effectively destoryed what ever potental it had utterly through greed and imcompatence. The game is dieing, and at this point, I say let it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I've been playing it since the open beta 2 years agoVindictus is an action based MMO the centers on instances, and TRUE SKILL when fighting bosses. to win you need to learn a bosses tells and openings, you gear, even maxed out, only makes up about 10%, at best, of your odds of winning, the rest is on you, the player.armor and weapons must be made by gathering matierals from bosses anf raid bosses, with the only short cut being the auction house, and even then all gear has a level and skill requirement, even the stuff in the cash shops weapon/armor packs, which are filled with imporved gear, you can make on your own with out spending a dime.the cash shop it self is mostly about convienace, potions, graces and invintory space will likely be the bulk of your purchices, along with some avatar items to make you character look better.all in all, it is a good game that deserves more attention then its gotten, and despite what Tera says, Vindictus IS the first true action MMO			"

												I loved the combat for this game. Even after I stopped playing i would look at other games and their combat systems, for example Tera online, and complain about how the combat was so slow/ clunky/ unresponsive compaired to Vindictus. I did enjoyed my time in the game so I'd say try the game for the combat and if you aren't hooked after that leave because it's not gonna get any better.Pros:Graphics were great for an older f2p game.Combat was super funCons: (Personal opinion)Grinding- I have no love for grinding, especially when you grind for everything, grind for quest items, finally get those. then you need to do specific mission tasks, ex. kill final boss with a jar, to get the mission bar to 100% which finally lets you get to the next mission, which you can't do because you are to low level, you grind up, you can do the mission but can't kill the boss because he insta kills/ does alot of damage to you and you do little to no damage to him, so you grind some more.....so yeaRepetative instances- with this much grinding I would at least like to see something different this time around.....secondary weapons- I thought the chain hooks were a cool mechanic, like your party needs to work together to beat a boss, but vindictus became more of a ""boost my stat, I solo everything"" kinda game. Makes grinding alone even more boring.Company- Nexon, nuf said.			"

												This game, uhh, is pretty good. My friends say I've gone overboard with my playtime( 90 hours in 2 weeks) but I say I haven't reached my full potential. To be honest, my 'final form' would rouse about 70 hours a week. I haven't done all I can to reduce delays, such as restroom usage, food intake, hydration and sun exposure, however with little effort I can go from a total loser to pathetic ♥♥♥♥ing trash. I'm already using a♥♥♥♥♥♥bucket ( Instead of taking time going to the restroom I just sit on a bucket and♥♥♥♥♥♥in it, hence ♥♥♥♥♥♥bucket') so there's not a lot more I can do with that, I have 3 years of a supply of food and drink in my fridge next to my 'battle station' and I even have a skylight so I can inadvertantly get exposure to sunlight/ vitamin D! All in all this game is a  Wasted Life/10, would buy again and waste life for again			"

												First of all, i come from the beta days. Back when there was only 3 characters and Evie still swung around her staff as a melee weapon (which is funny cause her doppelganger in the labyrinth still does this).  There are now 9 characters, each with very different styles of play, VERY pretty and powerful skills and while it can get a tad repetitive it's still enjoyable. While i do not support Nexon, i support this game. It's pay2lookgood, not pay2win. You can do everything you need to without paying a cent which is what free2play games are supposed to be. Granted progress may be slower than what you ""could"" be getting but that's just how F2P games stay afloat. They take advantage of impatience and what people want which depending on your stance may be a good or bad thing. Regardless, if people didn't want to throw money at these things, they wouldn't exist. Fact of the matter is, people want to play games but they don't want to spend money on them, which is another reason why F2P games are so popular.Now for the meat.The game itself is entertaining, dialog is nice and funny if a little dodgy in the translations every once in a while. The season 1 story gets interesting at around level 30-40ish and i found myself losing even more hours to it as i went back to discover more and i haven't played much of the second season yet.You level fairly quickly in the beginning and I only really noticed a big slow down at around 40-50. Which isn't bad considering you get most of your characters main skills at around 30, so you have a good idea of their capabilities and play style. The combat itself is similar to a Dynasty Warriors game, which you use heavy movement and large attacks to damage enemies that come at you in small groups of up to i think 10 at once in some areas.Missions consist of an instance for your party, which for normal missions is a max of 4 people. Later on, you find larger raid boss missions that can have anywhere from 6 people all the way to 20+ The big boss battles are fun and are easy once you know what their attacks are and how they will react to yours. I am also under the assumption that every mission in the game is solo-able if you are just that good, i however am not. I can play just about everything in season 1 by myself but need a decent party for the big raid bosses.The community from what i've seen isn't as trolly and elietest as some might say, whether they used to be or not i have no idea but i've not come across very many distasteful people in the times i've played. I also play on the West server, due to my understanding of it being strictly the U.S server, while the East server is Europe's. I have at least 100 hours if not a bit more, as i don't play as often as i used to but i have two characters 60+ and others in their 40's-50's. The anime-esc visuals are quite pretty and the game can get quite fan-servicey which is also a love or hate type of deal. I personally love being able to look good and even some of the full armor sets look very good on either gender. Character creation is somewhat limited as you pick a pre-determined character but get to mess around with them a bit. Changing hair, height, size of various body aspects, tattoos and skin color, as well as their underwear which ""can"" consist of skimpy outfits but there are non skimpy options as well.Lastly, i am not an MMO person. I don't typically like the styles they use and i don't really play the ones i like most of the time. But Vindictus is one of those games i enjoy and still come back to and it's loads better when you play and level with friends. I don't think it's the best game out there cause it's sure as hell not but it's free so it's something you don't have to devote time and money to if you don't want to. That being said, some of the money options are very helpful, and a couple of them are rather dumb but it doesn't hurt the experience much at all. It's free, you don't need to spend any money to do what everyone else can do. Just play it for a while, get to around level 20 and then decide if it's worth your time or not.			"

												Ever wanted to be truly rewarded for your skill in a game? How about some action, RPG, and a whole lotta hack'n'slash? Vindictus is that game. Taking place thousands of years before the fantasy life MMORPG, Mabinogi, another Nexon title -- this game is definitely not about picking wool off a sheep or raising crops on a field. This is the most simple yet highly complex Action MMORPG out right now.Many have tried to emulate this style of MMO but Vindictus had laid forth a tyrant of an action game. Running on Valve's Source engine, the detail level of this game is simply gorgeous, the physics are top-notch (hilarious rag doll physics included), and monster AI will prove to give you a run for your golds at higher difficulties. Vindictus is mainly a dungeon crawling Action MMORPG with hub to dungeon travel via Story /Quest Boards and some stages may look repetitive and they are but as you keep playing, you'll find many other things to do. Welcome to the Vindictus where skill matters..			"

												Definitely a reccomendation for anyone who likes an MMORPG, but to prove it to you, let's give you a list of pros and cons- at least in my opinion of what are pros and cons. Pros: -The action is both fast paced and slow depending on which you prefer.-The actions in the trailer, the fighting? Exactly how you fight in game, but not as cool as in game. Odd, right? -The weapons are amazing looking as well as pets and everything else you obtain.-Wicked cool story line that has emotion, but also envokes you to play more- because you can't move forward until you beat missions. But that's not even a con, it's like watching a movie, gotta watch earlier parts to get the ending. -Lets you choose your own path for the story. Which way you lean, and how you want to fight yourself. -Amazing graphics.-Allows you to do raids, and work with a team for missions- Very helpful. -Did I mention the action was flippin' AMAZING? -If you say ""Eh, I don't wanna play for a while."" when you get pack, they give you stuff to say ""PLS PLAY AGAIN"" permanent epic weapons that aren't really rare, but sure look cool and are probably a step up from your old weapons, however it takes I believe 3 months of vacay from the game to get it. Now to the CONS: -Some stuff you have to pay for, but that's not too big a deal.-There are gaps in levels, where you have to grind to a certain level to move forward. -At times, it's very hard to play, sometimes the story won't finish until you repeat certain missions to even unlock the next place. -Limited weapons for your ""class"", don't get me wrong, it's nice to have weapons only your class can wield, but.. there's just not much variety, you get probably 3 weapons to choose from every 10-20 levels and at times it makes the choosing of appearance and how you wish to look for parties and what not rather dull. If they had more styles of weapons for your class, different shapes for them, more in general, it would improve the ""fun-ness"" of the game and make people more easily willing to play with more given choices. It's an amazing game, definitely worth playing. I have 275 hours logged into it and more are sure to come, but unless you want to play the game for a long time, and get involved with its story- it might not be for you. Keep that in mind. Other than that, a really enjoyable game, and free to play? Well, damn, sign me up! Oh wait, I already am.See you in Vindictus my friends! Battle on.			"

Unlike Traditional MMO's this one doesn't have you mashing skill buttons and waiting on cooldowns you actaully have to position your charecter and dodge and work together. There is no holy trinity every charecter has different skills that help them survive. All bosses are pretty much different and have certain ways you must go about defeating them.

												This has to be one of my favorite games of all times. I love the combat, classess, bosses, armor and how diverse you can make your character look. The only problem is it's owned by Nexon who has a terriable reputation for not taking care of problems. For instance the servers are pretty bad right now with lag and disconnects happening when trying to board boats and sometimes when you're just in town. Slowly but surely they seem to be fixing the servers but it has been taking WAYYY to long and they are losing a lot of players because of it. This game has SOOO much potentional if Nexon would just fix the problems quickly and listen to their community!! Overall I love this game dispite the problems I would recommend giving this a try cause it really is an awesome game!			"

												A great rpg game. While it is not what I originally expected (openworld mmorpg), I thoroughly enjoy this game. It is by no means, Pay 2 Win in which the only way to get to endgame is by paying for weapons and xp boosts. I am a playing this game spending no money what so ever. The wonderful thing about this game is the marketplace which makes playing for free possible. By going into the levels or battle quests, you can aquire goods and materials which you can sell on the market. I was able to make a million gold (ingame currency) by just doing quests, some grinding, and aquiring uncommon and rare materials which I won't use and selling them. It's a great process which might get old if you get bored easily. I do not so it's fine. You pay in this game for xp boosts which is a given as well as cosmetic options which are totally up to you.The second thing I enjoy about this game is the diversity of armor and gear to wear and use. A long time mmorpg gamer, I cringed constantly of the ""battle armor"" my female characters were subjected  to. Why couldn't I have a badass, fully armored female knight or soldier? Here in Vindictus, you can. The armors are practical and look good in my view. Of course there are some sexy and fetish-like outfits for both genders but for the most part they are tamed by most standards, *cough cough* TERA. Anyway, I highly recommend this game since you won't lose a thing, this game is free 2 play in the most beautiful sense and a worth a look.			"

Posted: September 22, 2015
												Edit: I have tried to include all of the different aspects of the game in here, so if there is something that you look for specifically in a game, then you can look through the categories to find what stands out to you.If you like to play games for just the mechanics and gameplay itself, then this is the game for you, as it doesn't really attempt to do anything other than master those two aspects. I think that the best way to review this game is to review everything individually, as because it's so focused around one aspect you can see the short-comings of the game more clearly... so here goes.Combat/Fighting/Action_Score - 9.5/10 I rate this a almost perfect score because I believe that Vindictus still has the best combat system of any action MMO that I have ever played. It is quick, deadly and punishing, and reminds me alot of Dark Souls with a bit more flashiness and speed. Where the combat is flawed is tied into the gameplay, as it eventually becomes less enjoyable when you have to participate in an extreme amount of grinding 70+; however, the repetitiveness I will review in more depth below.Mechanics/Movement/Dodging_Score - 9/10 I feel like this piece of the game needs a separate review from the combat, because it is about the controls and flow more than the actual combat itself. This game is designed extremely well to fit a player's skill level, and isn't a game that relies on equipment (even though it's a very apparent factor when doing raids later on). It doesn't take a long time to get good at dodging and movement as you fight multiple hard-hitting bosses that you are pretty much required to dodge. The only downside of the mechanics is that no matter how good you've become you will need to reach certain gear requirements late game regardless of your skill level, as many of the raids late game require you to have a certain ATTK requirement. This became quite frustrating for me when I had to grind for hours to get enough gold for new equipment, only to join the raids, upon which I witness players who didn't seem like they had really grasped the dodging mechanic.Graphics/Optimization/Requirements_Score - 8/10 This is another strong area for the game, as the game is optimized very well to allow people to play even on low-end computers with smooth fps. The graphics themselves are good too, and it doesn't take a beefy graphics card too make it look pretty sexy. To go a little deeper I would say that I thought that the textures were really good on max settings, and the meshes for different objects were decent too. I gave this category an 8/10 simply because the graphics are good, but nowhere near perfect.Characters/Appearance/Custimization_Score - 7/10 The characters on this game are very beautifully made and are extremely good looking ( males and females -.O). There are two reasons why I rated this category as low as I did. The first - most major reason - is that the characters/classes are all gender locked, so right off the bat you will not be able to pick which gender you are if you like to play a certain style of class, and even though this doesn't really bother me too much, alot of people feel like this is a critical part of customization. The other - more minor reason - is that to really customize your character, you will have to spend NX. This is minor because it's pretty much the main purpose of NX aside from bonuses, making this game - for the most part - not Pay2Win, although it does suck that if you do not spend money they hook you up with this silly♥♥♥♥♥inner armor (underwear) that ruins the look of a majority of armors in the game. A way that I'm guessing they wanted to counter this fault is by creating the AP Shop, where you can buy inner amor and hair coupons that last 30 days; however, they cost over 1k AP , which is too much for someone who hasn't already maxed their skills to pay for a 30 day coupon.Cash Shop/NX/Avatar Shop_Score - 6/10 As you may have noticed the categories are in a descending order, and I will continue like this until I get to the worst parts of the game. The cash shop on Vindictus (The Supply Depot) is slightly better than I see in most games. As I said before, this game isn't really Pay2Win, and this is the case because the things you buy in the Supply Depot are really nice bonuses to have, but the flow of the game is not affected or hindered if you choose not to purchase anything from the Supply Depot. The other shop that they have is the Avatar Shop, and it is a bit more dissapointing then the more basic Supply Depot. This is also because of how NX works in this game. There is prepaid NX, which you get from cards that you buy at the store (also the best to have), and then there is NX credit, which is a purchase that you make online with a credit card. There are certain thing in the Avatar Shop you can only buy with NX prepaid, as there are no restrictions on the prepaid NX that you buy from the store, and there is on NX credit.Mercenaries/NPCs/Story_Score - 4/10 The story in this game - in short - is a snooze. I think that if you're looking for a game with a really good story then you should perhaps look elsewhere, as this game will not sastify you. For me I honestly really enjoyed the stories of the mercenaries you get when you pick your first character more than I enjoyed the different seasons' stories. I would have loved to see the stories of the mercenaries continued throughout the main quest; however, the main fault is that the game is just too focused on it's action to worry about anything else. The action is the very base of this game, and if you like action then this is a good game for you, but what the devs did was take the action of the game, and then they slapped all of this mediocre content around that base so that they could make it a better game. While this is respectable, they clearly rushed the story to fit the fast pace gameplay, which really didn't work. I read through all of the dialouge in the first chapter and then I just starting clicking through it because I had lost interest.Community/Players/Guilds_Score - 4/10 To test the community I made several different characters and joined in some basic guilds by simply asking in chat. I'm not going to name any guilds in particular because I wouldn't want to hurt their rep, but there was only 2 guilds I found where the players weren't rude. This is of course all based off of my experience so it is a very rough estimate, and because of this I'm gonna say there is maybe a 50/50 chance you end up in a good guild when you start off. The best thing to do is to find a guild that you like that will accept alts, and stick with them on your multitude of characters. Finding that guild... that may prove challenging.Now for the worst...Grinding/Mobs/Repetitiveness_Score - 2/10 This is for me the worst part of the game. If there is even a small part of you that doesn't enjoy repetitiveness, you may want to consider something else. The only thing that makes this flaw of the game less severe is that it really isn't the biggest part of the game. Get rid of the Dark Souls-esque combat and you have a game that has generic mobs that you will need to grind for hours for better equipment, in order to meet ATTK requirements. I also noticed that later on in the game, even when mobs look slightly different, they still look almost exactly the same. For those of you that have already played Vindictus, the reason why this is so low is because I don't include bosses in this category, because I feel like bosses needed to be separated from mobs because of the quality difference. Bosses are part of my review of the gameplay and mechanics because of the fact that they are part of what makes this game great, and they deserve to be separated from the mobs. If at first you don't think something like the mobs or Batte Quests are repetitive, wait til you must grind them for hours on end.Overall Score - 6.2/10 "

												This game becomes pay-to-win after level 50 or 60. There aren't enough people playing to put together a party of 2 let alone a party of 6 to 8 required for many of the raid bosses (which are required to beat in order to progress). This pushes players to go solo* which isn't realistically possible unless you spend real money on Goddess Graces (revive your self when you die) and Merc healing pots. I didn't mind spending money on things like inner armor (under wear), more storage, extra character slots etc. But I refuse to pay to progress.The developers have come up with some of the laziest boss designs I've seen in a while. Far too many bosses in this game have adds. Remember how cheap Capra Demon felt in Dark Souls - not really challenging once the dogs were gone? This developer decided to take that cheapness to a whole new level with dozens of bosses that have a dozen adds or more, some of them continually respawn through out the boss fights. The developer also decided to toss in a few bosses (like Thor) that can one shot kill any character. Lazy!The servers are ridiculously slow, and the game is buggy. Wait an hour to get a small team together for a raid just to have the server eject everyone from the party and toss all the characters back in town.It's a shame because the first 3 or 4 locations in the game are pretty good. They're realistically solo-able, even on harder difficulty settings, if you learn the boss move sets and timing. There are enough new people playing these early levels (that haven't quit yet) that getting a team together for a raid doesn't take an eternity.  Then the game turns to crap around Hoarfrost Depths so most new players just quit, leaving anyone with a desire to continue faced with waiting hours or paying to solo.*The developer is falsely claiming that this game is single-player on the Steam store page.

												Ok, so the first and most important thing to say would be THE NETWORKING IS HORRIBLE. At some points the game is not even playable due to the massive amount of lag. There are also a lot of glitches that im some cases will end your dungeon runs.All that aside it is a very good game and is very fun to play. The game is all dungeons and is very skill based. If you want to progress solo you need to have good mechanical skills and be ready to die many times in the later dungeons (damn that polar bear). There are also lots of fun events constantly being released and from what I can tell the game gets updates often enough that there will always be something to do.I cannot recommend this game, however, since it has HORRIBLE networking. The lag is awful and needs to be fixed.			"

												Before you start reading this review asking yourself why I put a thumbs down allow me to explain.I have a pretty average understanding to the point of level design, quest collaboration and in game smoothness. Now, the graphics and gameplay are both above an average MMO's standards, the combat and combo system is incredibly innovative. The quests are a hassle as expected from any MMO. The game has some lag jitter here and there it's not small but at the same time not huge. I got lazy halfway through this review because I don't like this game. This game is extremely well done, dont get me wrong and put me into saying that I'm new to it and don't know what I'm doing. I've played a year ago and a year after that day I see no change. The game seems dead, really low population, and gameplay that repeats itself so much that you want to smash your brains out. I would say if you have a high tolerance go right ahead. 4/10 IGNotGood			"

												JUST SAY NONexon = No No No Never againThis game is p2w.  Even if you p2w, the RNG will♥♥♥♥♥♥you like you were in prison.If you want to make money without paying you have to be blessed by the RNG gods or play 5-8 hours a day doing all the daily raids for drops, trying to craft and sell armor, and farming for rare drops.I have more than 16 hours on record;  I have played this horrible game for about four years.I have spent at least $500 trying to improve my characters and get that ""15k att"" requirement for raids.If you manage to get past the first few levels in the beginning...there is little reward for you.Most people in this game are going to be be selfish and elitist.This game would be so much better if Nexon could restrain itself from mugging and screwing its players if they want to win at this game.Pros:The art and combat is beautiful and engaging.Cons: They want your money and your soul.Community is mostly horrible selfish elitists.The servers are unstable.The customer service is horrible.You can't get anywhere without paying someone or working your♥♥♥♥♥off so hard you don't have (fun) one anymore.

												The game it's self is great. I left the game last time because the drop rates were completely outragious. I was stuck with S1 E8 weapons for the longest time. I don't think I ever got around it. I left at around S2 E2, due to the fact that I was still using S1 E8 equipment and I was always getting kicked out of rooms because I never was able to find drops that would assist my self to raise my attack. But of course, Nexon games will always be like this. I decided to give it another whirl to see if there is anything to change my perspective. But I doubt it.But in all seriousness, 1/200 chance to get a rare drop on a raid we can only do once a day, then after that we need 5 of those to make a single rare equip. Complete bull. If this game is still like this, my answer is to just not download the game.			"

Sadly, all those featuresget overshadowed by one thing...Nexus is a major cash ♥♥♥♥♥.I know games have to make money, yes. But Nexon really makes it hard to even enjoy the game without buying anything. Your character will look like♥♥♥♥♥♥until you buy a inner armor package, and the really nice outer armors are basically impossible to permanently own unless you buy.  Features within the game itself sometimes are lessened in quality because of course, you did not buy anything. It just really get frustrating after a while.

												I really love this game, and it might not say I've played for long but I did play it before it was on Steam. This game is very good for a free game, but there's a bit of a learning curve when you get into it. Some of the controls can be finnicky, and the way you use things isn't always clear, but I really do reccomend it. I love to play this with friends, running through a mission, destroying everything in our path. For a free game, the graphics are great, with only a few glitches and texture arrows. Finding loot is very satisfying and destroying a boss is one of the most fun things this game has to offer. You should try it out, and find the class the best suits you.			"

Posted: June 30, 2014
												I really and truly want to give this game a positive review, but I simply cannot bring myself to.To start, Vindictus is an MMORPG and Hack n' Slash game that really misses the MMO portion of its genre. It has features of one, like a global marketplace and raids and the sort, but it stops there. There are only two cities in the entire game and a field that seperates them with little activity in either one. Aside from queing for battles, there isn't much to do in the locations, there's crafting and quest givers that can provide some interesting dialouge, but it stops there. Honestly, this isn't too much of a problem compared to the more pressing problems I have with the game.Gameplay is very solid, however, the skill tree for each of the playable characters is very diverese as each character is allowed to use two different weapons in their class; such as a mage who can choose to use a scythe or a staff or a tank that can use either a pillar or cestus as a weapon. Each provide their own strengths and weaknesses in their own regard and I found it enjoyable learning the combos and intricacies of each weapon and skill. Unfortunately, the pros for the game stop at the gameplay. The largest problem I have with the game is the developer; for those that don't know, Nexon is a very greedy company. The in-game store offers a range of items that either change the cosmetic appearance or provide a game breaking and pay-to-win experiance like buying items that buff your stats to paying to allow yourself to do more raids, it's downright criminal. The downfall of this also comes into the heafty price they ask for literally EVERYTHING. Just to change the hairstyle of your character (as you can only choose about 5 when you first start, then have to pay, seperately, for the additional 20 Nexon expects you to buy) runs you about $7. Want to change your clothes? $10. Want to be able to do more daily raids? $10. Another serious problem with Nexon is their support for the game. While the branches of Nexon in various other areas of the world like in Europe or Asia recieve timely patches to the game that actually provide new content like new characters, new locations, new raids, etc. The Nexon supporting this version, Nexon NA, is the about the most incompetent company I have seen. Instead of working on updates that the community has been begging for, they keep making new events that act as little mini-games or side missions you can do that, SURPRISE, you have to pay real money in order to even finish, and sometimes even participate in.Probably the largest problem I have with the game, despite how dreadful the company is, is the absoltuely absurd grind that you have to do at high levels. The main story lasts from levels 1-60, which is not that bad and you may end up being overleveled for some missions you must do, but after you finish the main story comes the real pain. From 60, the level cap is 80, and you can obtain the best weapons and armor in the game, but in order to do this requires you to not only grind many, many hours away hoping you get the materials required to make a weapon or piece of armor, but to withstand the god awful drop rate that about every item has. The drop table is about as bad as the enhancing and upgrading system in the game. To make matters worse, in order to even get the item you need, you have to grind raids. Remember what I said about how greedy Nexon was? Well you can only run the raids you need about 3 times or so a day, so if you really want those materials, you better pull out your wallet because grinding that raid is gonna cost you extra.Honestly, I really want to recommend this game to everyone, but unless this game gets taken over by a more respectable and competent company, I simply can't.

												*sighs*as of 6-17-2014 I can no longer recoemend Vindictus.Nexon's greed and Devcats incompentence is slowly but steadly driving the game into the dirt.Firstly, there is the removeal of the jumping mechanic. Granted it was poorly implemented to begin with, but instead of opting to fix it, the instead removed it, and sunsquently reworked all of seaon 2, map lay out and enemys, to compenstate for the player no longer being able to jump.Secondly, they actually removed the option to run season 2 from levels 8-49. Because high level players where farming them for Seals (needed to buy high end mats) and AP (needed to rank up skills, some of which need 2 or 3k per rank and you at best, getting 250) so again, instead of fixing the issue, they just removed a chunk of the game. Then there what Nexon it self is doing, since Devcat isn't the only one ruining this thing.The cash shop is starting to lean toward a 'pay2win' model, granted, it's still a LONG way from that, but it's starting down that road, from the overpriced pets who grant extra, and rather potentant effects like buffs or mining ore for you, to the laughably over priced Enchantment, and Enhancement Runes that are pretty much required to be usefull in the 70-80 tier content, The 'events' are pretty much ONLY for lining Nexon pockets with money, with what ever free items being little more then the cheapest items in the cash shop, while what ever good items that are attatched are only attainable vai 'random item' boxes you buy from the cash shop, with a rather horrible chance of actually getting the event item, as you'd probably expect.Speaking of the RNG, It's horrible here. Drop rates have always been bad in this game, but pretty much any equipment worth using level 60 and up requires AT LEAST one ultra rare mateiral drop, per piece, and I don't mean 'I've been farming for a week and finally got one' rare, I mean 'this raid has been out for a year, I've been running it daily, still haven't gotten the drop I need' rare. Sadly, I'm not exagerating ether. The RNG ties into the final issue I want to mention. the price of things. The amount of gold you need to cercumvent the drop rates is prohibitive to every one who isn't willing to risk getting ripped off to buy gold. the Seal Shop, which sells the ultra rare mateirs you need, is suppossed to combat the drop rate issue, but it really just added to the grind problem, with some taking anywhere from 5 days, to more then a month of JUST Seal farming to get. (12 seals per day, 1 seal per raid run, 1 victory per raid a day)The actual gameplay it self is still fun, but Nexon effectively destoryed what ever potental it had utterly through greed and imcompatence. The game is dieing, and at this point, I say let it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I've been playing it since the open beta 2 years agoVindictus is an action based MMO the centers on instances, and TRUE SKILL when fighting bosses. to win you need to learn a bosses tells and openings, you gear, even maxed out, only makes up about 10%, at best, of your odds of winning, the rest is on you, the player.armor and weapons must be made by gathering matierals from bosses anf raid bosses, with the only short cut being the auction house, and even then all gear has a level and skill requirement, even the stuff in the cash shops weapon/armor packs, which are filled with imporved gear, you can make on your own with out spending a dime.the cash shop it self is mostly about convienace, potions, graces and invintory space will likely be the bulk of your purchices, along with some avatar items to make you character look better.all in all, it is a good game that deserves more attention then its gotten, and despite what Tera says, Vindictus IS the first true action MMO			"

												Horrible servers. Lag is terrible. Servers disconnect you, freeze, and crash your computer very often. The game is borderline pay-to-win. I honestly would not recommend this game to anyone. Even with all those shortcomings I still play the game. It is fun in the very early mornings 1am-7am when their servers actually work as they are supposed to. If Nexon could fix their server issues then I would recommend this game to anyone. Since they are the worst servers of any online game I have ever played (free to play or otherwise) I will not recommend this game to any new players. When you can clear a dungeon in two minutes and it takes another 5 minutes just for the server to recognize that you have completed the mission IT'S NOT WORTH THE TIME!!!			"

												(This review comes from an experienced player wih multiple lvl60+ characters, most of my time with the game (and a lot of the actual enjoyment I got from the game) coming from before the game was released on steam)Used to be a fun hack and slash mmorpg, one of the very few. It is still fun on the surface, but end game is massively pay2win and ultimately just not fun.You'll see hundreds of reviews here saying mostly the same thing, but let me tell you about Nexon instead.Nexon does not give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about you or me, only money. They don't care about customer service, and tickets have taken up to a month to get a response in my own experience. They ignore all feedback their playerbase gives and somehow end up breaking the game more with each patch.Nexon do not deserve your time, bandwith, or money. Jump into vindictus if you want a few hours of fun, but it will get stale fast, and do not give them your money.If Vindictus was made by a different company with better business practices, I might be singing a different tune.

												This game, uhh, is pretty good. My friends say I've gone overboard with my playtime( 90 hours in 2 weeks) but I say I haven't reached my full potential. To be honest, my 'final form' would rouse about 70 hours a week. I haven't done all I can to reduce delays, such as restroom usage, food intake, hydration and sun exposure, however with little effort I can go from a total loser to pathetic ♥♥♥♥ing trash. I'm already using a♥♥♥♥♥♥bucket ( Instead of taking time going to the restroom I just sit on a bucket and♥♥♥♥♥♥in it, hence ♥♥♥♥♥♥bucket') so there's not a lot more I can do with that, I have 3 years of a supply of food and drink in my fridge next to my 'battle station' and I even have a skylight so I can inadvertantly get exposure to sunlight/ vitamin D! All in all this game is a  Wasted Life/10, would buy again and waste life for again			"

												The only thing I have to say about this game: It's okay.Honestly, I'm not the most experienced person on the game, but I can see one thing that Nexon had brought back in yet another game; Pay2Win. There's level 85's tricked out with all their fancy clothes, and if you spend maybe 10 minutes on the game you can pretty much say that it's impossible to get even close to 85 without countless hours of grinding.. And grinding... and more grinding. Once you get past level 30, a good 45 minutes of grinding will get you maybe 2-3 levels at most. (60+ = 1 hour for a level. Roughly.) There's some good DPS classes, such as the twin swords or glaive, and there's a lot of other variety to choose from (such as a battle pillar or scythe/staff), and their damage really depends on the weapon, in my perspective. So, for appearance of the game. You'll start off with a fairly good selection of characters. You've got your classic shield and sword, some big tank guy with a hulky piece o' wood, twin swords, archer, etc. This is where the game can get decieving. You'll start out seeing these characters in pretty bada** clothing, girls lookin' finnnnneeee, but when you enter the game, guess what? You've got some boots, some pants, and a sweater with a hood. *Wonderful.* Get past the fact you won't get some good looking clothes until level 30-ish, and you're good. Right? No. Your weapon, let's use a spellsword for example, is made of wood and you won't get anything that'll get a second glance until level 50 or so(speaking from opinion and experience). This spellsword does a tidbit of damage, and unless you really want to start making some damage, you're going to need to resort to your mana and/or secondary weapon. On a different note, the graphics of the game are pretty good, considering it is an MMO. It ran smoothly on my craptop, which is a $300 piece of, well, crap. The first levels, or missions, get EXTREMELY repititive. You've got about 4 different rooms in the first area place thingy-magij, and they're just placed in a different order every time you play. Yeah, sure, it takes about 40 minutes of solid gameplay to get through everything, and that's not counting the leveling up you need to do between missions. Congratulations, you've got through the first area! Onto the next one. Hoarfrost Hollow? Icy, a little better in map interaction. Wait; Ainle is next. Hoarfrost.. (*insert snickering 12-year-olds-here*) Ok, seriously, the maps and graphics are great, considering what this game is. Overall 6/10. Not bad, but it could use work, and Nexon needs to stoP MAKING PAY2WIN. PLEASE, NEXON.			"

												It's really disapointing, honestly.  The story is nothing to write home about, some of the characters are interesting, the questing is rather dull (and heavily RNG'd on the Side Quests) but my biggest problem in this game comes from the insane difficulty spikes in higher level content.I'm fine with tough fights.  I love a challenging encounter.  A fight with a boss that can one shot anyone, hit half the arena (and not even as a special attack, that's just one of many) with no possible angle of attack where you can't get annihilated by a random attack with a 0.5 second tell.  God help you if you ever lag.You can suggest that I'm bad at games if you want, but the real reason for this is actually quite brilliant.  This Nexon game allows you to buy 'Extra Lives', so making the end game raid fights as punishing as possible is 'good' game design.I love this game's combat system.  It flows nicely, it's entertaining and the animation/sound effects really sells the strength of the hits.  It's only a shame that such a good game was given to Nexon to monitize.  This game system with a better publisher would have been amazing.As it stands, if you want to romp around and just kill some grunts with a good combat system, it's good for that.  It's almost got a Dynasty Warriors feel to it, depending on the character you pick.  However, when you get to the late game there won't be anything for you but brutally punishing 'Raid' battles that stand between you and continuing the story.  I don't mean one or two, by the way.  The last DOZEN quests of Season 1 contain at least 9 Raids.  Hope you have a lot of friends, or like waiting for people to join your party so you can keep playing the game.Fun for a quick romp, but look elsewhere if you want anything of substance.			"

												Pros: Plenty of character customization, combat is good and stylish, Character models and armor look goodCons: Environments are definitely second to the characters in detail, poor community, gets stale quickly, PvP is a joke, Feels very small in scale due to the fact that there is only lobbies and instances nothing else, story is entirely forgettable, lots of server issues, and P2WSo to explain a bit, I have put a fair amount of time into this game (1000+ hrs) so it is most definitely something i know what im talking about. It has good looking characters with plenty of customization and there really isnt another online game with combat like it, but thats the extent of its good. The game story is completely forgettable and you will be spending most of the time attempting to skip it when speaking with an NPC, voice acting for cut scenes is C grade at a stretch. The whole lobby/dungeon system and no open world really makes it feel confined and serves to simply diminish the feeling of there being any real content. Youll run the same runs with the same scenery over and over and over and over, itd be one thing if you could explorer a vast and beautiful world but you cant, it doesnt exist outside your small towns. Speaking of the environments they are rather poorly made, they get the job done but in contrast to the characters they look like crap until you get to certain parts of Season 2 but still very dull in appearance and not much life to them. Once you reach endgame its going to be a 6 month if youre lucky grind but more than likely years of grinding to get endgame gear due to extremely low drop rates which by the time you get it will be outdated anyway. You will be forced to spend money and find less than admirable ways to acquire the gear for you to be considered relevant (lots of P2W in Vindi). On that topic you will also find yourself in a community with a rather heavy elitist attitude to it, many are not newbie friendly and if you dont have endgame gear will get kicked frequently from boats later in the game which increases the difficulty of getting endgame gear even more. PvP is an absolute joke and was shackled on later in the games life and it shows as there is little reason to actually do it outside of it being forced in order to get certain items. This game has lots of potential, and the combat is great, but nexon has not done anything to really keep the player outside of plenty of TnA. The servers also have lots of issues and you will disconnect and lag ALOT. Once you reach that pinnacle of endgame gear and such there will be nothing left but to chat in lobby 1 and wait for the new raids with the ""better"" gear which wont come till they increase the level cap so there are large expanses with new content but only side grades of gear with different aesthetics.

												This game pretty much has been designed to scam player of real life money. Do yourself a favor and go play something else like Path of Exile instead. A much better free to play model where the publisher doesn't try to scam you for every penny you have.The fail / success rates for weapons and armor in this game is total a scam. You can do everything right and even pay for runes to protect such things and it will still break and fail multiple times in a row. Trust me, you'll have better luck at the Vegas Casinos so go give your money to someone else instead. PASS on this.			"

												First of all, i come from the beta days. Back when there was only 3 characters and Evie still swung around her staff as a melee weapon (which is funny cause her doppelganger in the labyrinth still does this).  There are now 9 characters, each with very different styles of play, VERY pretty and powerful skills and while it can get a tad repetitive it's still enjoyable. While i do not support Nexon, i support this game. It's pay2lookgood, not pay2win. You can do everything you need to without paying a cent which is what free2play games are supposed to be. Granted progress may be slower than what you ""could"" be getting but that's just how F2P games stay afloat. They take advantage of impatience and what people want which depending on your stance may be a good or bad thing. Regardless, if people didn't want to throw money at these things, they wouldn't exist. Fact of the matter is, people want to play games but they don't want to spend money on them, which is another reason why F2P games are so popular.Now for the meat.The game itself is entertaining, dialog is nice and funny if a little dodgy in the translations every once in a while. The season 1 story gets interesting at around level 30-40ish and i found myself losing even more hours to it as i went back to discover more and i haven't played much of the second season yet.You level fairly quickly in the beginning and I only really noticed a big slow down at around 40-50. Which isn't bad considering you get most of your characters main skills at around 30, so you have a good idea of their capabilities and play style. The combat itself is similar to a Dynasty Warriors game, which you use heavy movement and large attacks to damage enemies that come at you in small groups of up to i think 10 at once in some areas.Missions consist of an instance for your party, which for normal missions is a max of 4 people. Later on, you find larger raid boss missions that can have anywhere from 6 people all the way to 20+ The big boss battles are fun and are easy once you know what their attacks are and how they will react to yours. I am also under the assumption that every mission in the game is solo-able if you are just that good, i however am not. I can play just about everything in season 1 by myself but need a decent party for the big raid bosses.The community from what i've seen isn't as trolly and elietest as some might say, whether they used to be or not i have no idea but i've not come across very many distasteful people in the times i've played. I also play on the West server, due to my understanding of it being strictly the U.S server, while the East server is Europe's. I have at least 100 hours if not a bit more, as i don't play as often as i used to but i have two characters 60+ and others in their 40's-50's. The anime-esc visuals are quite pretty and the game can get quite fan-servicey which is also a love or hate type of deal. I personally love being able to look good and even some of the full armor sets look very good on either gender. Character creation is somewhat limited as you pick a pre-determined character but get to mess around with them a bit. Changing hair, height, size of various body aspects, tattoos and skin color, as well as their underwear which ""can"" consist of skimpy outfits but there are non skimpy options as well.Lastly, i am not an MMO person. I don't typically like the styles they use and i don't really play the ones i like most of the time. But Vindictus is one of those games i enjoy and still come back to and it's loads better when you play and level with friends. I don't think it's the best game out there cause it's sure as hell not but it's free so it's something you don't have to devote time and money to if you don't want to. That being said, some of the money options are very helpful, and a couple of them are rather dumb but it doesn't hurt the experience much at all. It's free, you don't need to spend any money to do what everyone else can do. Just play it for a while, get to around level 20 and then decide if it's worth your time or not.			"

												This is an MMO with most of the standard stuff... Cash shop (not pay2win), grind walls, lots of people, nice guys,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bags, and all of the rest in between. BUT this game comes with the BEST action combat I've ever played! There are games I've payed for that don't come close to this level of awesome. The graphics are actually really good for a game with Dx9 and built on the source engine. The bosses are creative and sometimes irritatingly difficult (but then you just bring a bud and wipe the floor with'em).PvP? Couldn't tell ya how it is because I don't like to fight people on games like this... so I don't and it doesn't hinder the gaming experience on bit.The music is good too and gets you pumped for fightsThen there are the wide variety of classes to choose from. At the moment there is a character for nearly every playstyle. The only one they don't have is one that uses stealth as their primary form of defence.The only down side I see to this game is the RNG is aweful and can ruin your character by destroying the only weapon you own and leaving you with no money left. You sometimes have to have extreme luck for that NOT to happen. Good thing about that is you only have to worry about it during the late end game stuff.			"

												It's a great game, with a variety set of classes for you to choose and play from! The dungeons and party raids are one of the best features imo, and a lot of cooperation is involved for certain dungeons that you need to clear.The only downside, which may also be increasing the 'Mixed' reviews is that many of the raids are repetitive. It's still your usual P2W game if you want to get good gear and weapons, plus the waiting times in certain lobbies can seriously be a time spender ...  Regardless, I'd still say it's worth a try. :P			"

												I've been casually playing this game on and off for several years (since the removal of the limited boarding system), and I have to agree with most of the top reviews: Nexon is a pretty bad company. Joining Steam has opened up the game to a much bigger and diverse gaming community, and I definitely appreciate the presence of new Steam players hopping on. Here are some pros & cons.Pros:+ Excellent artistic style in characters, environment, boss fights, armor, and [most] cash shop outfits.+ Incredible boss fight music+ Thrilling gameplay that involves maneuvering around boss movements. [My FAVORITE aspect of this game!]+ Break off system that gives boss hunting a new meaning+ Very unique differences between each starting character's play style+ Breaking armor and revealing [cash-purchased] inner armor is mucho sexy.+ Community still has very nice people near the start of the game. Just very hard to find.+ Paladin & Dark Knight transformations are very epic to pull out in times of need.+ Dynamic environment - Barrels, crates, and other things break when struck or thrown.+ Erotic inner armor designs. (Con: They all cost money to permanently own.)+ Coloring armors and outfits. (Con: Costs money, again... & many people just make their armors look ridiculous with neon bright colors that step out of the game's original art style.)+ In-game marketplace is very dynamic (Con: takes weeks of waiting on selling at highs and buying at lows = ridiculous amount of time investment)+ Nice movesets and combos that give different versatility during combat.Cons:- They released a Sword Art Online Kirito outfit that still has a bug with the coat flapping and humping your leg. People who paid $35 for this outfit can't even put this thing on due to comments from other players. It seems that they are planning on moving on and ignoring this issue. (FINALLY fixed after more than a year!*)- Plenty of elitists.- Very buggy game. Lots of issues. Not very stable.- Lag becomes a big issue when timing precise and accurate dodge mechanics. The system does not give you the benefit of the doubt when you've begin a dodge but computer skips several frames of it.- Enhancement & Enchanting systems are batshit silly. Don't even try it. (see other reviews)- Outfit and armor appendages clip through the insides a lot, but may not irritate some players.- Someone is always looking at your equipment to make sure they are better than you. Then they act very happy on boats when they see that they've got no competition in racking up damage dealt to the boss. (Results screen shows top damage)- Paladin & Dark Knight path levels take forever to level up. It becomes dismissed when a player finds out how much time it requires to reach the 2nd transformation.- Event exclusive items are mostly, if not all, timed crap. No joy in getting them. - When dying or coloring things in the Avatar shop, the light does NOT match the actual environment. Very possible to select an offset color that only looks good under strong light.- Community is filled with many naive people. Immature. Often sides with guild members and friends in ganging up and bullying other players.- Players who have been treated unfairly by Nexon customer service and pathetic compensation are left to fade away with no recognition of the event by other players.- The server screws everyone when an event attracts waves of Vindictus players to come back. Especially the quest dialogue reveals that it has a loading time. (Seriously... this is such an inefficient way of processing game information.)- Very limited end game armor options. All end game armors cost too much money and are excluded to only those that can grind enough money to get it. (again, ridiculous time investment that does not reward actual amount of time spent. depends on RNG -- with very low odds of getting rare drops)- ... This can keep going. The cons are abysmal.I hope this gives good info for what players will possibly deal with when picking this game up. It's one of those games that I can only play with a single friend or two. It is definitely not a game I can recommend to most people. I can only continue to play this game by myself (and sometimes with a friend) because it is ultimately a very lonely experience for someone who is casual but still loves certain parts of this game.After reading a few of the top reviews: Hiding armors and other enjoyable features for cash shop promotions? Seriously? No love given, no support received.			"

												This is a very polished, super fun co-op hack-n-slash ""instance based"" MMO in the vein of Phantasy Star Online. There's your common area/hub, you accept missions, set up/join a party (or solo) and head off into closed levels where you proceed to beat the snot out of a ton of enemies. And the brawling is really fun. Nice variety of character classes (unfortunately gender locked; statistically, there have to be a TON of dudes playing as hot girls), and all have different fighting styles, and the Source-powered destruction adds a lot to the fights. It's super fun!It's all Free to Play, from what I have seen. All the actual content - the story, the missions, the sidequests, etc. - is attainable. Some is gonna need some grinding, but it's alleviated by the multiplayer, as are most monotonous tasks in games. It's all f2p  except for cosmetic items, as it should be. But they ARE pricey, and they unfortunately have options for 7-day and 30-day rentals, which seem more reasonably priced. But to get the permanent options, it's gonna be pricey. It's a good game, and it's worth spending some money on -- DevCat made a really cool game, and they deserve to be compensated for their work. But man, this model is harsh. I'm talking $8 for a SHIRT or PAIR of pants, permanently. Woof. Still, whatever, that's easy to avoid. Just play with a bland character, and enjoy the actual mission content. Then buy something rarely. Be responsible with your money (keep a ceiling in mind, and don't go past it) and you'll totally enjoy this game if you enjoy beating up fantasy creatures with buddies. Vindictus is a rad game, but Nexon needs to work on their payment models for future games. Recommended overall though.			"

												This is a very polished, super fun co-op hack-n-slash ""instance based"" MMO in the vein of Phantasy Star Online. There's your common area/hub, you accept missions, set up/join a party (or solo) and head off into closed levels where you proceed to beat the snot out of a ton of enemies. And the brawling is really fun. Nice variety of character classes (unfortunately gender locked; statistically, there have to be a TON of dudes playing as hot girls), and all have different fighting styles, and the Source-powered destruction adds a lot to the fights. It's super fun!It's all Free to Play, from what I have seen. All the actual content - the story, the missions, the sidequests, etc. - is attainable. Some is gonna need some grinding, but it's alleviated by the multiplayer, as are most monotonous tasks in games. It's all f2p  except for cosmetic items, as it should be. But they ARE pricey, and they unfortunately have options for 7-day and 30-day rentals, which seem more reasonably priced. But to get the permanent options, it's gonna be pricey. It's a good game, and it's worth spending some money on -- DevCat made a really cool game, and they deserve to be compensated for their work. But man, this model is harsh. I'm talking $8 for a SHIRT or PAIR of pants, permanently. Woof. Still, whatever, that's easy to avoid. Just play with a bland character, and enjoy the actual mission content. Then buy something rarely. Be responsible with your money (keep a ceiling in mind, and don't go past it) and you'll totally enjoy this game if you enjoy beating up fantasy creatures with buddies. Vindictus is a rad game, but Nexon needs to work on their payment models for future games. Recommended overall though.			"

												It's a great game, with a variety set of classes for you to choose and play from! The dungeons and party raids are one of the best features imo, and a lot of cooperation is involved for certain dungeons that you need to clear.The only downside, which may also be increasing the 'Mixed' reviews is that many of the raids are repetitive. It's still your usual P2W game if you want to get good gear and weapons, plus the waiting times in certain lobbies can seriously be a time spender ...  Regardless, I'd still say it's worth a try. :P			"

												You know how TERA calls itself ""the first true action MMO""? Vindictus does it better, and it's been around longer.Combat is purely action-based, so much so that it feels more like God of War than World of Warcraft. It's tons of fun to slaughter hordes of enemies, and absurdly satisfying to take down the tough boss at the end of the dungeon. You can do all this by yourself, or party up with strangers or friends for a co-op experience.This game is very skill-based, and while upgrading your in-game gear and abilities matters, the person who does the most damage to a boss usually depends on who knows the boss's attack patterns best. And with enough skill and patience, you could even defeat a nightmarish raid boss all by yourself! It's not EASY, but it's certainly doable.But if you're going to play this game, I have one piece of advice for you: enhance and enchant your gear with caution. If you go too high (past +8 enhancement or Rank 9 enchants), your gear might break.			"

												A free-to-play hack & slash MMO which focuses heavily on PvE/co-op content rather than PvP. Combat mechanics are solid and rewarding, the issues are: chinky-looking characters with typical flamboyant anime equipment and an inability to choose your character class's gender, i.e. all magic-users are Korean girls.

												     If you're tired of WOW hotkey type combat, this is probably the game you're looking for. The combat system alone makes the game worth playing, it's actually a shame you don't see this type of combo system in MMO's very often, as this makes it alot more interesting. It's very addicting, and you'll be spending days late game trying to catch those elusive raid drops. However, as with many Nexon games it survives off of microtransactions, as paying for certain aesthetics and even some game changing items are in the game, this being one of it's major flaws. It IS possible to get through the game without spending a penny, just very difficult.      The exp gain rate is okay compared to most MMOs, only getting truly painful up in your 65-80 level range. But by the time you're level 70, getting to 80 isn't always on your mind and it's best to just ease into the level. Overall it's a VERY good game despite it's flaws, yet every game has flaws of it's own.			"

												Played this game when it was still pretty new. Still think it's awesome til this day. However there's two things I really have a hate for and it made me completely stop playing it:1-Cash Shop: not really a problem if you don't intend to buy things with real money but if you do, cash items are quite expensive for it's price. I blame NEXON like we all should xD2-High level raids: You'll know what this is once you get into the endgame stuff. This game gets really fun once you pass a certain level. Once you get into the higher levels however, you'll see people making parties with demands meaning they'll kick you out if you don't meet their standards. This happens way too much.This game tends to be a grind fest because of the very low drop rates of rare items but I still had fun grinding.Try this game out if you want something new than a general mmorpg. But if you want to make this game a hardcore hobby (like I did), I highly recommend joining a guild or make trustworthy and awesome friends.			"

The Game is playable by yourself until season three where you need others to help you.They're lots of events that can help you gear up and the Supply Depot (REAL MONEY SHOP) has lots of great stuff, but for a price(an expensive price).So i recommend doing Season 1 & 2 and if you love it try to find someone to play with you so you can experience season 3.But besides that either have disposable money or play something else.

												You shouldn't invest your time into this game. Many of the players that are still here can't leave because of time investment, money investment or friends. Not to say you shouldn't play this game if you have friends on it, just saying you shouldn't invest too much. Another reason the population is so low is because of false ban accusations by black cipher which has banned multiple innocent accounts and heavily invested players, so you could also get banned for having a non-harmful program running in the background. Vindictus is just like a crazy girlfriend, you better focus on her or she'll cut your♥♥♥♥♥♥off :).You have 2 chances. If you get falsey banned once and get it repealed, that's a strike against your account. If it happens again, you're perma banned regardless if it was legit or not. They don't care, they just want to be right and they refuse to change their policy on this and have now killed all fansites and many of my friends :D. I'm just sitting here patiently waiting to see if they do the same to me, since I'm a whale.The game is best known for its combat style and ""dress up simulator"" graphics aren't too bad for an old game either.Since the game is instance based this game relies on the player base to host parties to run missions. Frames (fps) are almost nonexistent here(maybe overexaggerated, but never fully 60fps). It's an old game and they don't do much to make the game run better on official servers.Aside from that, as a new player it is hard to gear up unless you have help from friends, dedicate alot of time or spend nx. If you don't mind the struggle then this is no big deal to you. I think with some heavy spending, it took me a month to hit ""end game"" gear. Aside from spending, farming for gold was difficult unless I had alot of time on my hands. Maybe 3hours+ for raids and farmable missions. Even then, it's all rng. Especially the part about getting banned :).The management for NA version of this game isn't looked to kindly by the community really. The management team doesn't seem to really care about anything relative to the game other than bug fixes and sales.Many of the players that do spend money on this game (and I mean like a hefty amount) have expressed their displeasure with how sales have been with this game. Each and every sale (mainly gachas) they have done nothing but just make the experience worse and not worth your money.At this point, to me, it just feels like they're milking the game as much as they can before it dies. For me I don't want to spend money only to see the game die sooner than necessary. Many of the days I'm on this game, I wonder if even we'll have everything that Korea's server has one day. But that won't happen because they change up alot of the things with the sales that korean's get in outfitter shop while we're stuck with a gacha. Then they tell us that ""oh, but this is how the koreans did it"" When it's clear BS. That's just one example that I could think of.As a player, having these kinds of occurences and views towards them...I wouldn't want anyone to be a part of that. A company that provides a service but doesn't really care if you're satisfied with the experience. Basically polite scamming and sometimes actual scamming with some of the sales they do. With all the feedback they've been given, they don't do anything really to fix it or please the people that pay or the casual people that do spend every now and then.Side note: I'm a collector, so I like to have multiple vanity and costumes that the game has to offer (only the ones I like). I started late so I didn't have everything from the beginning. I requested for them to bring back SQ as many other people seemed to have wanted too. They did. Another thing I really wanted for them to bring back was elchulus wings. They brought it back in a black friday gacha and nothing to exchange with so it was all rng. I rolled them, got costumes I already had so I had to throw them on alts, characters I don't even play. Wasted about $800 trying to get it on 2 different characters. Because they decided to limit the boxes to 10 purchases a day per account. Even having excess amount of outfitters they would not exchange them for the wings I had so desperately wanted and attempted to pay for. Which is something that REALLY set me off. Now I will forever hate nexon because of this experience.			"

												Worth a play through. Not like any MMORPG I've played in a long time. Every action is as you do. You want to punch, left click. You want to punch with the other fist, right click. What? Combine the two with a left left right? Go ahead. Of course there are the skills you can set on your character that'll help further your journey. I must warn you, when you first play, the first level you have to do will be nothing like the rest of the game. I say it starts to get really good when you sail to the other island for their missions. Don't know what I'm talking about? Give it a try.			"

												One of the better action combat games available at the time of this post, only rivaled by Tera and Black Desert Online.  Some downsides include the fact that its published by the infamous Nexon and many quality of life items are pretty much blocked by the pay to win aspect.  End Game equipment has recently gotten easier to obtain, though not by much as the top tier items are very hard to obtain and create for the min/maxers out there.  If you have the wallet, i would recomend the game.  Free to play, itll be a good first time experience but patches that are fruitful are skim.  If you are looking to invest a small ammount of money, i would go with Black Desert Online instead to just Buy to Play.			"

												Before we begin, I implore you to go to the VindictusManual website and read everything that is there to see, and understand the scope of these issues.Alright. Here it goes.I've played Vindictus off and on for the last few years- And while I have many things to say about the combat system, community resources, and lack of community driven additions to the game, (to give players a place to show off all that amazing gear they've acquired, or simply create a group of friends to enjoy the game with-) it'll have to wait for another review.Vindictus is managed by a company called Nexon, a company infamous for a lack of care for it's communities. Over the last couple years, Nexon North America has never ceased it's tireless crusade against it's OWN playerbase. Demonizing and attacking playermade sites and online resources, banning any players that act irregularly on their anti-hack system, regardless of the fact that the bloody thing detects things like RUNESCAPE and OTHER NEXON GAMES AS POTENTIAL HACKS. Boom. Autoban.The people running the community forum are simply put: Cowards. They lack the ability to deal with a community that at one point, was growing. They ban anyone that posts a complaint, attempts to find redemption for daring to use another program while playing their game. Hundreds of dollars down the drain.The frightening part about that isn't that Vindictus players are losing hundreds of dollars when they're banned. The concerning part is WHY they have spent hundreds of dollars on the game. Vindictus, like most of their games allows you to purchase in game benefits that drive your character forward through progression, and I'm not talking level progression, I'm talking combat benefits and dozens of automatic revives on the spot to let you solo any content if you just have enough real-life cash to pay for it. You can purchase entire sets of end-game gear from the in game shot, and the gear enchancement system at the endgame content is so bloody toxic, considering you need to roll a dice 15 times, and if it fails 1/15 of those times, you must start from scratch and find a new piece of gear for that slot. I believe this isn't healthy for the game, and diminishes the rewards and prestige that might accompany actual success in game. If you're truly interested in playing Vindictus, or as it's known in the east 'Mabinogi Heroes' then be sure to do so on another server. Nexon has never cared for it's playerbase, and likely never will. It's worth a shot, but if I've turned off even one of you, then I find this a success.			"

												This is a TL;DR pros and cons list for the lazy. Everyone else, the full review is below.NOTE: My hours on Steam are about a quarter or less of the hours I have on this game.PROS:-Decent graphics-Interesting art style-Unique character and world design-INCREDIBLE combat system-Interesting story and characters-Wealth of content-Decent endgame-No game impacting microtransactionsCONS:-Poor customer support-Could be optimized better-Limited character customization-Huge learning curve into lategameFULL REVIEW: After playing Vindictus for 5 years, I think I'm qualified for this review. Vindictus is a hack-and-slash MMO made by Nexon. Normally, the Nexon part would put me off (despite the fact I also played Combat Arms for many years). But with Vindictus, they managed to achieve something special. As far as massively multiplayer games go, it is a unique experience. The engine is quite unlike any other MMO I've played. The graphics are polished and nice to look at, and the controls are simple and intuitive. This is helped along by the absolutely wonderful combat system, which plays more like Devil May Cry than a simple MMO. The amount of content is enough to keep any junkie going for a long time, with 10 different classes, a long, mostly well written story with multiple over-arching plots, and a thriving, pleasant community. The aesthetic is unique among fantasy games as well, being more akin to 17th century Europe rather than an over the top fantasy world with sprawling glass skyscrapers and whatnot. The design in the characters and weapons/armour is less flashy, and more functional (with exceptions, of course). The cutscenes are few and far in between, which is fine by me. They are clunky and don't fit particularly well. The voice acting isn't stellar, either. Outside of cutscenes, none of the characters ever actually appear in game. Instead, when interacting with characters, a drawn portrait of them greets you. This is another unique aspect of the game that I enjoy. Their face changes depending on what mood they're in, and they look like believable people. Over all, Vindictus is a wonderful and unique experience that has stayed strong over the years, and will continue to do so.			"

The game obviously looks great, and gameplay is easy to get the hang of.Once Kai is released, there'll be five characters to choose from, and each one has their own strengths.If you've ever played Mabinogi, you'll want to play this game to get your unanswered questions. If you've never played Mabinogi, know that this game holds the events that take place previous to that one, and if you're interested in learning more after finishing this then you should give Mabinogi a try.

It wont send the activation email and after a half hour i finally got it to send a reactivation email and i did it but when i try to sign in it says I cant use this email because its linked with steam... OF COURSE ITS LINKED WITH STEAM! THATS WHERE I DOWNLOADED THE GAME! Waste of time. Its a shame because it looks like it would be a fun game...			"

												The game play and graphics are pretty amazing. I really enjoy the staory line as well. A negative aspect is that their servers tend to boot you off, a lot of conectivity issues especially when they have events. For a free game it is worth playing. You just have to anticipate connection issues.			"

												Possibly the best combat system in any game I have ever played in my entire life. It is incredibly fair, requires skill, and is combo based. (COMBO BASED! HOW COOL IS THAT? PRETTY DARN COOL!) The combat has lots of meat to the action, and it does a great job of translating every swing of your chosen weapon, into a satisfying collision with your enemies. It's unforgiving, so be prepared to actually think while playing.			"

												Tired of falling asleep while playing your favorite MMO? Craving action packed combat? Tired of kill ten rats and bread crumb quests? PLAY THIS GAME! Each character comes equipped with dozens of awesome attack skill combos that continue to give me warm fuzzy feelings of epic awesomeness every time I use them.I recommend you don't go into this game expecting an MMO, though, because it's really more of an epic co-op monster-fighting game of awesomeness... With awesome epicness.Also, Nexon is a horrible, horrible company that is doing everything in its power to make this game unfun. But if you can ignore the cash shop, ignore the uninspired special events and ignore your inability to progress through the leveling grind and the gear grind (as a result of ignoring the cash shop), you can actually enjoy this game for what it should have been and still kind of is under all the Nexon-crap, that being, a really fun and extremely epic action-combat monster-pummeling boss-battling epic fighting game of epicness!

Also with the many games on the market now have such a long winded and boring intro before you're are left to your own device is completely insulting and pointless as I got bored and uninstalled. Could be a great game for many.

If you've never played Mabinogi, know that this game holds the events that take place previous to that one, and if you're interested in learning more after finishing this then you should give Mabinogi a try.

												Vindictus is a very fun game but you need to be prepared for what you are getting yourself into.  This is an action MMO and probably the best of its kind.  There is no real world to explore and not a whole lot to do outside of dungeon crawling.  Also, be prepared for a very heavy grind and long farming sessions.  Also the company that runs the game kind of blows.  Also, the community is just so-so.  There are a lot of elitists in this game.  A lot. But the game itself really isn't terrible at all and if you're a fan of Blade & Soul, Tera or any other action MMO you'll feel right at home.  But keep in mind that this game is very challenging and if you want to do any of the higher end-game content, you'll either have to spend hundreds of dollars in the cash shop or farm til your eyes bleed.  The amount of customization is great in this game and you can make your character look amazing, but again, it all comes down to how much money you want to throw into the cash shop.  The game isn't pay-to-win, however, and there's plenty of opportunity for glory to those who work hard enough.  Just enjoy the ride and find a nice guild to call home.  Know what you're getting into ahead of time and there won't be any surprises.			"

Before this game I had a life, a family, 2 beautiful children, and an 8 figure job, but I still felt a hole in my heart.As my wife was sucking my♥♥♥♥♥♥I browsed steam for a new game to purchase when I realized that I was so rich I had bought everygame on steam. At that point I want to the peasent free2play section where I saw Vindictus. I downloaded that game in seconds with my Google Fiber connection and booted it up, I was instantly hooked. I could pay ridiculous amounts of money to have custom hairstyles and outfits... And best of all, IT WAS REAL MONEY!!!! Finally I had a use for that no good paper♥♥♥♥♥♥that I had so much of. Within the first 10 minutes I managed to spend $3000 on runes to enchant my weapon from a nice gent named Ferghus, in which failed many times and I had to buy more, but that was fine for me since I'm just ♥♥♥♥ing loaded. This spending habit continued for a few months and before I knew it I was 300 pounds, divorced, and not a penny to my name. But all of that was just fine since I had a +15 weapon and +10 Tut/Arm armor on a toshiba labtop that  ran Vindictus at 15fps. I spend my days on the street of NY city begging for money so I can buy more Karma Coin cards. Great Game.			"

												The game's model promotes investing cash into gear to stay ahead of the curve just to meet requirements needed to even beat the content. Attack vs skill had more of a balance in the long ago past but the scale definitely favours your stats these days. The bosses have become closer to punching bags than enemies with little fulfillment outside the worthless e-peen of damage rankings in end results. I will still recommend it if you find a nice group of friends to play with since the game can also be a good social experience within guilds. And while it's harder to play casually, the option is still there (might get kicked for low stats). It will depend on what type of person you are and what you want. My funnest times were yelling at random people while wearing shorts and a bunny hat, and that's a successful casual experience in my book. Maybe yours will be to have powerful gear for your battles, but try not to get too caught up in it.			"

												This game is super fun. With their somewhat varied character selection, you can try out many classes on Vindictus that fit your gamestyle. It's only up to the 80's in levels right now, however there is tons of content to try out. Although, if you want the best out of the game right away, you will end up spending some NX. Not only that, but from about level 30-50, the leveling goes by slowly. Don't be discouraged though! Once the raid bosses come into play, the real fun begins. This game is well developed and the quality is amazing. I definitely recommend it.			"

												I've spent almost 6 hours just trying to get this game to run. As soon as I fixed one launching error, another would pop up. I reinstalled the game twice and even after I had checked the file integrity immediatly after installing, it said there were issues. So I had to go through the game's files and delete random .avi files and rewrite dates in text files to be current. After finally getting into the main menu and excited to start playing, I can't even connect to a server. I tried all of the whopping 3 servers to try to play and none worked. The game looks fun to mess about with until you get to the endgame grind, but with the overwhelming amount of flaws with just launching and entering the game, coupled with many other people's frustrations with customer service (which you will be bound to run in to eventually) and game design revolving around in-game purchases, I can't recommend it in the least.

												In much the same way that Just Cause 2 could be ""loosely based on"" Don Quixote, Vindictus (or Mabinogi: Heroes for you non-Americans) is loosely based on the Mabinogion, a set of Welsh mythology. This interpretation is centered around Korean anime people in either chain-mail lingerie or pots-and-pans armor wielding giant battle-scythes and tree trunks: so basically, everything you'd expect from 14th century pre-Christian Celtic folklore.In this version, Pwyll is named ""Lann"", Pryderi is ""Kai"", Rhiannon is ""Evie"", Branwen is ""Fiona"", and Bendigeidfran is ""Karok"". Instead of the original episodic tales that feature the relationships between characters, their romances, conflicts, struggles and occasional deus ex machina magic, you just grind for levels, pay microtransactions and commit a lot of animal cruelty to dog people, vampires, blood jellies, golems and dragons. Also, they wiped my character a few months ago, so ♥♥♥♥ Nexon.Overall: 4/5			"

												Yes, the grind is real (once you hit level 60 or so).Yes, it has horrible, horrible RNG if you want to upgrade equipment to over +5.Yes, it has a rather expensive cash shop which you will probably end up using if you want to make your character wear something other than extremely obtrusive long-johns for underwear.Yes, there's a buttload of quest dialogue to skip through.Yes, the bosses can be brutally difficult.Yes, you need a good host or multiplayer is going to suck.Yes, NEXON. Unfortunately.Yet, despite all these cons, I don't really regret the time I've spent playing this game. The base gameplay is essentially AAA action game combat, which for an MMO, is just straight up outstanding. If you like the combat and enjoy the satisfaction of gathering up materials to make cool armor and weapons, then this will probably hit the right spots for you.I mean, you might as well try it, since it's free.

												Right now I would not recomend this game, the lag (yes in 2015) makes the game very frustrating. Almost always in town equiping items, getting mail, starting a quest are constant lag and  timing out entirely. On peek times and weekends just connecting to the game is impossible. After that the gameplay is nice graphics are fantastic although the inner armor is a bit of a money grab. The story is pretty lame and this is not open wold so if your going for that not so much.

												I've probably clocked a thousand hours on this game before I started playing on steam (and a lot more recently if Steam let me log in multiple accounts). Don't let the RPG tag deceive you. Vindictus is not like any other MMORPG: It's a hack and slash dungeon crawler that's extremely fast paced. If you're coming to this game expecting an open-world point-and-click, then you'll be disappointed. The first 60 levels are quite easy but fairly boring to play through. Most dungeons can be soloed. Two of the episodes are simply reskins of the previous ones -- a prevalent problem that dissuades many from continuing. Once you reach level 60 is where all the action begins, where the raid bosses are. You face Titan, Thor, Glas Ghaibhleann: titanic monsters that can two-shot you if you're not quick on your feet (or fingers!). All of those bosses you see in pictures are straight from screenshots, unlike cinematic clips that most rpgs put on their cover. The game, however, requires a lot of commitment to reach end-game. So find a guild, play with friends, and enjoy the game!			"

												Rare that you will find an MMO that plays remotely simmilar to this. Controls and Feels like Dynasty Warriors. Great to play in co-op with freinds. Beware of a few things: it uses a Class System with limited character customisation. You will have to leap past an initial pay-wall and buy a dazzel-em dead pack if you want a fully customized character. In fact just straight up beware of all the DLC, it's a free to play game and DLC costs a boatload, and much of  the actually useful stuff is upright temporary.And Also beware of the fact that the game's graphical, lighting, and gameplay quality will amp up as you progress through the game, and won't really begin to shine until halfway through season 1 of the game when you enter Rocheste. Nearly all the gameplay balances came in the form of Character updates, and the early levels have not been overhauled yet (but apparently character and armor textures are about to be updated to higher res, so you have something to look forwards to).Otherwise, it's a great game that is worth a shot. And might just help tide you over till Black Dessert comes out.			"

Until you get to lvl 60+ it's a real grind... After that and 70+ is when the game starts getting fun.			"

												Spent money on this game then got randomly banned for ""hacking"" when I did nothing of the sort. Made a support ticket over a month ago requesting help and I haven't received any response at all. Their live support is a joke, only open for a few hours a week and you still don't get anybody to answer you. So now I've invested money into a game I can't even play. Moral of the story is, don't bother with any nexon games unless you like being robbed. Will never play any of their games ever again!			"

												Great game I love every bit of it. But buying NX should be a little cheaper so more people are willing to buy. This should also add more support to the game. Id like for this game to get more support. server lag is a big issue for this game and its the most annoying. I give this game two thumbs up but i feel if you lower the price for NX more people will be willing to spend money in the game. That will give Nexon to put more money into the game for better support. Great game to play with friends very fun! EDIT:This game needs a lot of support and Nexon NEEDs to stop being greedy and lower the price for NX and polish the game up more. the lag is bad the slow♥♥♥♥♥loading when talking to NPC is terrible when you wanna quick read threw it and the small glitches have got to go. this game can be so good Nexon. You guys have something amazing but I can see the obvious greed for 100 bucks for 100k NX. No game should have you spend 100 bucks for anything the max for NX should be 60 or 75 bucks.Still a fun game tho!			"

												Surprised the game hasnt been shutdown yet. Basicly starting out, you will most likely never find a player to leveling with during the early stages. (only time you will see is during a revamp/new character release lol) The simple spamming and grinding in the SAME damn map design, just putting you in different starting locations (as ud expect from an asian grind-2-die dungeon-mmo) REPITITIVE. Everything is instance so dont expect for open world crap. you and most people will hop off the game before reaching endgame because the grind will not be worth it as a solo-player. Community is basicly dead as this point, just slightly hanging in there before the game shuts down (lol). Oh yeah dont forget about the hefty price cash shop that can easily help you level, just SPEND money = Nxowned. And to the white knights that try to defend it, they know the game is grind fest + RNG hell + small community that can barely hold its own. So yeah choose your poison. only thing id say is that the Gameplay + character design + armor's were great, but now the game is at a state that if it were to be shut down now, No one would of noticed lmaoTl;dr Grind hell + Rng Hell + solo-play until u get to endgame (why bother hyping up endgame, when the core leveling is bland out♥♥♥♥♥♥) "

												Played the game for a bit, then logged in after a few days of not playing to get a message saying my account has been permanently banned. Didn't do anything, Nexon support didn't help. Don't play this if you want to get to a level higher than 9.On the bright side, combat is fun, character models are great. Obligatory jiggle physics (which sometimes causes clipping with some inner armors).Then again, 90% of the customization is locked off through a paywall. I suppose that isn't too bad since it's just cosmetic, but I'm that kinda person that loves customization so having that stuff locked off is a real killer.			"

												Alright, lemme get something straight. I love Vindictus and the sequel, Mabinogi (Which I might cover in a future review). They're great games, I play them for hours at a time, mostly on the NXLauncher. However, with the god-awful customer support I see constantly, and the recent issues with the Nexon Game Launcher, I can't even play this game any more. I've been looking through the net for possible solutions to it, but none work or have clear steps for what I should do. I cannot even log in through Steam now, and the NXLauncher isn't working either. It's a shame, I loved this game and played off and on with delight; now it's just a burden attempting to try and load up. AAAnyway, let's move past my personal complaints and get specific.-PRO-+Great Quality and Graphics+Plenty of Hackin' and Slashin'+Lots of Characters to try out with their own playstyle and weapons-CON--Customer support is garbage, you see plenty of reports on that everywhere related to NEXON-Character Creation at start is also trash; limited options force you to eventually buy Karma Koin to get those needed hairstyle changes and dye-Not much else to do other than Combat. You can cook and make clothes, but it's not really worth it when you can just go and buy what you want in the MarketPlace ingameOverall, I'd say 5/10. I wouldn't reccomend it to too many people, but it suited me just fine while I could still play it.Do let me know if I missed something good or bad; I would gladly edit and put it here.			"

Posted: August 8, 2014
												Vindictus is a hack n slash type game with a rich story (if you like reading through long text scenes). First off: If you're looking for a F2P MMO that you don't want to put money into: Turn away. Right now. Pros:The game itself is fun when you're playing with a group of friends and helping eachother out.The gameplay is very fun, ""open combat"" (no targeting, free roam fighting) Think of something like Kingdom Hearts combat in a sense. With the lack of a lock on system, which isn't really needed for this type of game.(As of now) There are a nice diverse set of characters to play, and it is fun to try out each character for different styles of gameplay.The leveling is very guided and easy to do, just follow the story and you'll pretty much level up from 1 to end game in at least a month or so of moderate play. If you play nothing but this game you could get to end game content within a few days.Cons:Hosting is a very rare ability which very few people can handle.This game runs on only ONE core. The more cores you have, the possibly less stability you'll have with the game.Duo cores run this game like gods. (If you have around 3 to 3.5 Ghz)The community in this game can be very unforgiving. Elite-ists make it hard for new players to enjoy the game (with ""boat restrictions"" requiring people to have a set amount of stats to join them). The community sets the bar high for most end game content, making it hard for new players to enjoy all the game as to offer, and learn how to play the game/fight, in terms of big raids and fights.--(Refering also to the comment above) The game requires a lot of ""luck"" and ""time"" to be able to play end game content. Even though now it is easy to meet bare minimum requirements with a certain Level 70 set, it is still hard to find accepting people. (Also the cap at the time of this review is level 80. Plans to raise the level cap are in the air apparently.)End game equipment is very hard to obtain, because the drops needed for End game equipment are very rare. When these do end up dropping, the more wise decision is to sell it (for casual play that is). It is not impossible, but it is very time consuming and tedious to collect all of the neccesarry materials for end game items.--(Follow up) ""End"" end game equipment, items previous to the ""now"" end game equipment, is actually obtainable through literally just playing the game. These ""end"" end game equipments are helpful in meeting newer boat requirements but are also tedious to work towards (Ex: Apoc sets you need ""Blue tears"" to make 3 out of 5 parts of the set. The tear can be bought in a ""seal shop"" for roughly 334 seals. To get these seals you need to run one-a-day raids. You can obtain up to 12 seals a day. If you dedicate yourself, you can get one tear after 28 days of straight raids. If you have no luck in buying a tear, or if you never get a drop to use toward the set, that is 84 days of Raid grinding for a Level 70 set. Brutal sounding, right?)Overall, after my four or five years of playing this game (since release) I'd have to say:If you're looking to play with a group of friends diligently, this is a good game to play.If you're looking for a game to casually play by yourself, it could be fun at first, and then very frustrating toward end game.If you're looking for a game to play hardcore in and out, prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥for the hardships you may encounter. Find a guild to join or something.If you want to just play this game because you think it looks good, Don't stick to it you might get disappointed by end game community.SEASON 3 UPDATE:Season 3 has made the game much more forgiving, but not to the point of handing you the game. It is much easier for players to build end game gear without making impossible leaps of luck. Rare materials are easily accessible through the revamped Seal Shop and it is much easier to make the gears needed to progress through the game.This does not mean you will not hit a point where spending money will never be a need. This game still, almost requires, some amount of money to be put into it. How much you spend is really up to you.			"

												This game is fun, at first, but you need to understand this game is pay to play (not pay to win).So for starters.This game is fantastic at the start, your char and moves feel great and monster and environments are interesting. However, as you get to endgame the game violently shifts to pay to live...  Meaning, you will have to spend real money on health pots, goddess graces, and other items to keep you alive because if you attempt to to use the free itmes you will get hit, and when you get hit you will lose more hp than you would of gained drinking the potion.Additionally, you will need a beefy computer and internet connection to host games because this game is Peer to Peer connections ... meaning Lag is an issue.  Combat at endgame is all about twitch combat and if your connection sucks you will be eating the ground before you know it.There is no function support for this game.  Meaning Nexon the publisher and Devcat the developer both suck at their jobs and do not respond to support tickets. Endgame hurts ... Ive been paying for years and have only gotten about 10 endgame gear drops ... so you have to grind and sell items on the Market Place to make money to buy the rare drops.You need stupidly high dps for endgame as bosses have a defense limit you have to break or you will be doing effectivly no dps ... so this leads to elitiest boats.There is no balance in the game.  I have a Hammer Fiona ... I do stupidly low dps in endgame because thats just how things work now .... I refuse to switch because I love hammers and unless Devcat rebalances the clas or adds new abilities thats the way it goes.Kai's are OP as all getout ... their mobility and ranged dps means they can avoid most boss spam and continue high dps, so if you are looking for a fun class ... they are your money ticket.There are in game purchases ... and they are overpiced.They key to surviving in this game is 2 things... find good friends and a good social guild.... you need to have fun or this game will rub you the wrong way hard.

When I started it up, I was surprised that there was NO launcher, and an actual TITLE SCREEN! A TITLE SCREEN ON A FREE TO PLAY GAME! WHAT? THATS CRAZ- anyways, yes, the game has a title screen. I began to play and after a while I began to notice the extreme lack of money grabbing♥♥♥♥♥♥other FREE 2 PLAY games tend to throw at you. Ive played for about 5 hours and have only seen two offers to buy things with real money, and that was on a whole different page within a page. I honestly think this could be one of my favorite free to play games that Ive played in a while.Overall, a very good and challenging game.For a free to play, worth it.- Hey, this is an edit... about two minutes after I finished typing all of that.What makes this game good? Ill tell yah~One: Very little screen clutter (you know, all that♥♥♥♥♥♥most MMOs have, yah, this game has little to none at some points)Two: ITS NOT PAY TO WIN - Rejoice!Three: If I said it's good, and its an MMO, it must be good...

												Im not going to go into detail on what is, or what isn't bad, but heres my two cents. The game isn't perfect far from it, but it is F2P and though some say its pay 2 win it isnt completly true you can go in with weaker gear than people with pay 2 win and still do the bosses I find gear isn't as important as your ability to actually time your dodges and attacks. Granted if you have better gear you'll kill the bosses faster, but over all it depends more or less on your actual skill than gear. Gear to me on this game is more cosmetics.			"

												This is not the most feature heavy MMO to ever be released, but it's a shining example of a game that props itself up on its fun and engaging gameplay alone. Players seeking a social experience or persistent world won't find much to like here, but anyone in the market for an exciting action game with high-fidelity graphics should certainly give Vindictus a shot. The game's free-to-play model is executed fairly well, though there is still the very real potential for players to ""pay to win"" as the cash shop does offer such items. Any flaws aside, however, you should play this game - at least to try it out. It's free, after all.			"

												This game.. Where should I begin. I've been playing Vindictus since early beta and I've loved it since. The ""hack-n-slash"" combat that people generally expect isn't what Vindictus offers. It offers a much more immerse type of combat. Every class has its' own unique gameplay.I'd give Vindictus a 8/10, not a perfect 10 because of the amount of luck needed if you want to get a high-enhanced weapon. If you've already played enough to see how the enhancing system works, I'm sure you know what I mean. Also, it's a very ""pay2win"" style game. Extra items that are sold for real money, and usually give you a pretty big advantage over other palyers that don't spend money. Such as more items, exp, etc.			"

												pretty rad if you like to play an mmo where most players (if you run into any) have already capped and treat you like garbage because you havent hit lvl 90, ghost town? nope try ghost world....gameplay is ok i do feel full controller would be nice so i dont have to take my hands off, look down away from the boss, find the key, press it, look up and find out im already dead.i dont like how i have to spend tons of cash on extras. (hey nexon how about imply a cheap month to month member system like runescape and make players spend ap on extras)this game has sucked my life away though. i spend most of my free time playing it, which is weird because i have an xbone and fh3 to get back to...it is addicting i'll give it thatbut there are improvements to be made if they want their players back because as it sits the community is dead and the more that quit will cause it to die faster and thats xp,ap,time and irl cash wasted.i suggest making improvements; big ones at that, improve advertising of said improvements, raise lvl cap and remove the need to spend actual money anytime you want something cool, imply a member system (you already have vip but make it so it lasts longer and makes it so you can spend gold or ap on outfits,weapons,etc.)make a larger map instead of the two cities you can walk into and the two other towns you can travel to. people like large scale free roam. bring back your community and maybe this game will be more than halfway decent.freebies are not always enough.i do however reccomend this game if you like grinders.

												Top tier combat, you just have to have patience because it requires some grinding.If you're familiar with Korean games at all you will know exactly what I mean by grinding. That being said, the combat in this is so fun that it's really not that bad. This game's main problem is the metagame around being the ""best"", good reflexes will only get you so far. Eventually you will have to risk your gear, sanity, and perhaps even your wallet to stay ahead of the curve, and it may come across as a little cruel.			"

												Vindictus plays like a multiplayer God of War. It allows for solo play, if you're skilled enough, but definitely has a game for groups as well. Boss enemies have a higher HP pool the more players are in your group, and some characters (Evie, the caster, in particular) do much better with team support. All in all, it is a surprisingly fun addition to the ""MMO"" game, from Nexon.			"

There is tons of content, great story driven action and grinding isn't an issue with different play modes for every instance. Oh and it's completely free!			"

It is an amazing FREE TO PLAY game that offers so much and shows that it cares, that it puts tons of effort into festivals and special events that make you feel like your part of a real community of heros that can join together to demolish hundreds of foes.

Guild system is non-existent. It is there but there are no real benefits that adds to gameplay or mechanics.PVE is the main focus of the game but still has a PVP system thats broken and unfinished. People take PVE in this game seriously so beware. Just wait for black desert instead of wasting your time with this. Atleast that wont be published by nexon. :)			"

												    Let me start off with one of my most common comment about this game, ""Vindictus, is like playing a 60 dollar RPG game, but you can use the 60 dollars for asthetics"". I've played this game since it was in closed beta, and I still remember the old days playing with my old group, dungeon crawling, figuring out how to strategize against bosses, and continously scream at Blood Lord. This game is a great MMO, especially for the crowds that are trying to get into them. I say this especially because there are other MMOs that people try to get into and absolutely lose faith in them afterwards. They usually fall under 3 major causes, difficulty, complexity, and graphics.     Difficulty is pretty straight forward, and some games completely screw over the player. By trying to constantly challenge the player at the beginning of the game, players will eventually lose faith and stop. Making a game too easy, will also make the game less appealing. Vindictus finds a nice way to easily situate the player, get them used to their characters, and begin to show them their true potential through skills like Gliding Fury, Counter Attack, Clash, or Cross Stance/Cut.    Complexity is really how complex the gameplay can be. You don't want a game that makes everything too simple to the player. A constant click click click, and you beat the game, is really not the best way to allure players.  On the other extreme, people don't want a game that will have them alternating several keys at once in order to just attack. In games such as vindictus, it's imperial to make sure the player is having fun, not always on edge because he/she is constantly panicking during ""basic"" fights. Vindictus is basic enough to keep a player at attention, and at the same time is complex and very fun. Nothing makes me happier than to grab a kobold or gnoll and slaying them in multiple fashions.     Graphics is one of the most debated topics in my time of playing games. One one side, it's great to have good graphics because it makes it seem realistic and provides a surreal environment. On the other hand, you don't one graphic or else only those with high definition graphic cards could play it. Vindictus is a perfect example of games who found an equilibrium, as the realistic models and stunning graphics make it seem all too real to be true.     Vindictus overall is a great game, and I hope that it gets as much love as I have for it. It may have it's flaws but it does make up for it in several departments. One major concern is always the Nexon Depot, as you can buy things using real life money. However all of that is trivial, and does not get in the way of you beating the game, unlike other games that require you to spend 5 dollars to unlock their membership mode. I say yet again, it's like a 60 dollar MMO, but free.			"

												Ok, so I just recently got this game on steam, but I've been playing it for over two years now.This game has some very addicting combat mechanics, which are very fast paced later on in the game. There are many character types to choose from, each offering a different playstyle. Along with great gameplay, this game also offers good graphics, and a somewhat destructable environment which u can take to your advantage during some enemy encounters. With that said however this game does have its drawbacks. The majority of the player base is focused towards the later part of the game, which would be fine, but this leaves those at earlier stages left to fend forthemselves, making progrssion lonely, and boring at times. Once you do get to the later parts of the game you soon realise that attaining certain armor and weapons almost impposible as extremely poor drop rates, and insanely high prices means only a lucky few will aquire said items. But don't be discouraged, because even with deacent gear, and sharpened skills you can still play and enjoy every aspect of this game.To conclude, this game certainly isnt perfect, however, if you find a good guild and make some new friends, you will have a great time slashing and bashing monesters and look good doing it. The gameplay will keep you coming back, and there will always be more improvements to make to the characters you play.If your at least curious about this game I highly recomend you try it, you might be pleasantly surprised. I'll see you in there. :) "

												Please note: As it may say 0.5 hours on my steam account. I played this game through the nexon site. This was way before Vindictus went on steam :3.I loved this game...when it first came out. It was absolutley amazing. And the community was awesome. Everyone worked as a team. The grinding was was not tedious.THE COMBAT WAS SO AMAZING! Every move was precise and the physics were just out standing.  .And I say this because every battle was different. The crafting was also worth the time. All and all back then...I would have giving it a 9/10.Fast Forward today.No, I can not reccomend this game. I decided to get back into it and see whats changed. And to be honest...it sucks.I got spammed with bots and people weren't very nice anymore. NO one worked as a team in my experience. This game had a lot of potential. And I feel like some of it..isnt there anymore. Combat is still decent. But what annoys me is the damage indicators... That really annoys me. Because before. You hit an enemy and it's like.. Damn, I must've hit him hard. And made you wanna hit this enemy more. Now with damage indicators its like... 20 damage... Well damn. I dont feel that immersed anymore. And the list goes on and on.MY verdict...You can play this game. But...In my opinion, its not really worth the time and effort			"

Every class plays completly differently. They have their own weapons and weapon styles and they look nothing alike so you know what class everyone is playing.

												I reached a point where I find myself looking to the free-to-play mmo's for a source of entertainment. This is how I came across Vindictus.It's looks like it should be a fine, top of the line mmo; but with one flaw that breaks the game before the player actually starts. It was made by Nexon.Yes, the same Nexon that made the buggy as hell, hacker-infested Combat Arms.I decided to move past this, thinking Nexon got their act together, and decided to try the game for myself. I installed the game, and was met by not one, but seven launcher crashes in a row. On attempt number eight., I was faced with a long♥♥♥♥♥background instalation that made me think the game crashed again. Attempt number nine actually got me into the game, but as I tried to connect to the server, the game crashed entirely. Three more attempts just to get into the game resulted in the same crash. Hell, even a personal friend with a recently updated PC even crashed as much as I did trying to get in.Take my word for it, the game is not worth the amount of time it will take just to start the bloody launcher.

												Unless you like playing a single player game with an MMO grind, I would not recommend this to anyone who likes games for the community.Vindictus' Achilles' heel is its match-making system. This game is a lobby game that provides a market, PVE, and PVP, yet you can't join other people's PVE stages in-session like Warframe and you're not even allowed to do something productive as your PVE party forms like in Dungeon Fighter Online. In Vindictus, as you form your party, you are confined in an instanced area that provides nothing productive other than a punching dummy, a general vendor, and a mailbox. You end up getting people who don't want to form parties hence people who can't get parties. For comparision, imagine being forced to do nothing in WoW as you queue up: you can't work on professions, browse the auction house, go do other quests, or even travel. How often would the WoW's community queue with such an absurd confinement? Warframe was pretty shallow when I played it and DFO Internaltional was shutdown, yet they at least didn't waste your time as you queued for parties.			"

												I find that what really matters about this game is the fact that you can just sit around at a campfire, relax, and just forget about all the harshness of the dreaded Nexon service, all the harshness of the high level ""18K att"" boats.  Sometimes people don't see the true value of this game, how it mimics real life and turns it into something that goes on everyone's screen.  There wouldn't be time for worrying if relaxing was the main point.  But no, everyone strives to become the best at everything in this game, it's a simple human quality.I'll go right into the main value of this game.  It is the idea of wanting to become stronger, and fighting enemies that are massive and may never be defeated.  It is the simple risk of always being on the brink of death, yet always coming back by the use of a phoenix feather, that drives us to keep on fighting.  We upgrade our equipment and wail in the painful days of grinding dungeons for that one enchant scroll.  And when we have maxed out our character, it seems as if there is no purpose after that, seeing as the low levels hold a bias against the high levels and vice versa.  We want to help others, but it seems as if the low levels deny us that permission.  We always constantly want everything, to max out to +15, all of that stuff.     All in all, hack and slashing is extremely entertaining to partake in, but in the end it's just going to lead up to the feared question of ""what should I do next?"".   The main plotline of this game is to fight for the hope of achieveing ""Utopia"" for ridding the fomors of the human land.  Since the goddess has forsaken all humans, and they are left to fight, this makes it seem as if all hope is lost.  This game teaches a great lesson such that Utopia will never be achieved from playing this game.  It is for the purpose of escaping from reality, but this game will always make you feel empty once you reach level 60+.  The game becomes hell in a way, as all there is to do is raid and / or help others that are lower level.  The main point of the game becomes a game of chance and the need for gold.  But the lesson of this game, in my own words, is to teach the player that sometimes sitting at a simple campfire and having friends to converse with is the best Utopia even when in a time of needing the best equipment and armor.

The level cap is currently 70, but can be reached in a week or less if you know what you're doing.EXP is the same high rate as always, but the game is becoming more ""pay to win"" each patch.

												This game really caught my eye for one reason.  It was actually Free to Play, unlike every other MMO known to mankind.  The only things you actually have to pay for aren't necessary for completion of the game.  I haven't actually paid for anything yet in the game.  There's also offers to earn NX, the ingame currency.  So, if you want, you could complete the entire game without touching your wallet.  The gameplay is simple, yet addictive.  While some runs may need to be repeated to reach the next level(and unlock the next quest), the boss battles can be challenging, and good fun.  Along with these are ""Oaths of Honor"", which are small challenges to make the run more difficult(Example, complete the quest under a set time, or use no potions).  You can jump into battle with one of the six characters in the game.  Do you want to charge in swords-a-blazing?  Snipe your foes with a longbow?  Crush everyone with a Cestus?  The choice is yours.Anyway, I hope this review has helped you decide on this game(And hopefully, I got it accurate xD).			"

												Beautiful game. Amazing storyline. Creative monsters. Prelude to my second favorite game made by Nexon.This game has the most beautiful artwork and concepts of armor I have ever seen. Each character is crafted as their own. While the facial features might be the same for all characters, it really doesn't matter when you can personalize any way you want from skin tone to make-up to even under armor. The characters move so in tune with their weapons nothing seems unnatural.The storyline is fantastic, especially because this is all a prelude to Nexon's Mabinogi. This game is much more serious than Mabinogi and it certainly gives you a break from the care-free enviroment of it, which is sometimes nice. The storyline I can keep track of pretty well with easy to remember names and (regretably) a very small map with 2 towns, one you are in 90% of the time. The monsters are your usual monsters, but with a little twist and have such amazing graphics and design to them. Gnolls are transformed and given clever names, ranks, titles and even abilities and stray from your usual dog-man creature. Nexon really nailed it on this one when it comes to 3D monster art.As I said before, this game leads up to Nexon's Mabinogi (which is another great game by them). This clears up some of the plot to Mabinogi and this is all around a good plot on it's own.This game is absolutely perfect for a gamer who loves running dungeons with an amazing looking character. If you aren't downloading this now, you should.			"

												The game is actually not too bad. The only problem is that, in my opinion, the dungeons repeat quite a bit. Granted each time you go in, there are certian circumstances you must meet in order to properly ""win"" but really, it's still the same instance. So that can get tedious. Otherwise it's pretty decent. The combat is action packed. I've not done any PVP in this game, but based on the way characters work in regard to attacks, movment, and defence, I'd imagine the PvP being pretty nuts; as in in your face and action packed. Even with the repetition, I'd still recommend this game. If for no other reason to try it at the very least.			"

												More boring than it advertises itself to be.Generally, I've played alot of MMOs and this isn't really that bad. It DOES take alot of grinding though, but not too much. You will get swamped in sidequests if you DARE talk to any npcs outside of your main quest.Many things in the game aren't told/hinted about, which was kinda of annoying. Nobody wants to spend 20 minutes of wiki reading to realize you need to go to a new town in order to learn how to make weapons, although the stations to craft the weapon are in the first town you go in.Fluid combat, decent graphics, hefty rewards for staying loyal.Non-generic bosses (mostly), annoying drop rates, grinding.XP doesn't come too slowly, which is a good thing.Every class is arguably balanced.Overally it's a good game, as long as you're used to grinding.

												Great game, I love it!  Vindictus is very well balanced, and not even slightly pay-to-win.  Though the economy is a bit difficult to wrap your brain around at first, but just take a look at a guide or two and it's easy as pie to get LOTS of money REALLY fast.Gameplay is simple, yet satisfying in a way; though you will have to go on the occasional grind for mission completion.  Good leveling system and unique skills to unlock, it's really easy to figure out and play.  I'd definitely encourage anyone to play this game!Edit:  It has come to my attention that I am not nearly as experienced enough in this game as I thought I was.  The above description really only applies until some of the later levels (about lvl 60), and the economy begins to  crash on you:  weapons and equipment are over priced, not enough people are selling/buying resources to craft higher level equipment for cheaper, way too much grinding, and whatnot until you have to result to using real money to progress through the game.Basically, this game is only worth playing if you like grinding and probably giving up later in the game.  Fun at first, not so much later.			"

												This game really caught my eye for one reason.  It was actually Free to Play, unlike every other MMO known to mankind.  The only things you actually have to pay for aren't necessary for completion of the game.  I haven't actually paid for anything yet in the game.  There's also offers to earn NX, the ingame currency.  So, if you want, you could complete the entire game without touching your wallet.  The gameplay is simple, yet addictive.  While some runs may need to be repeated to reach the next level(and unlock the next quest), the boss battles can be challenging, and good fun.  Along with these are ""Oaths of Honor"", which are small challenges to make the run more difficult(Example, complete the quest under a set time, or use no potions).  You can jump into battle with one of the six characters in the game.  Do you want to charge in swords-a-blazing?  Snipe your foes with a longbow?  Crush everyone with a Cestus?  The choice is yours.Anyway, I hope this review has helped you decide on this game(And hopefully, I got it accurate xD).			"

												Wow, I remember this one from years ago.  It has one of the most fully-developed physics engines of any MMO I've ever seen.  The four characters (I remember when it was only three, and it may be five soon) all played very differently and honestly, the only one I couldn't really get into playing was Lann (the dual swordsman).  Lastly, a very good story for an MMO.I feel that its only major flaw is that it's of the hub-and-mission style of MMOs - probably done so they can ensure the physics engine is handled correctly.  However, that flaw is tremendous in a scenario where the 'hub' is an actual area where the players gather, because the lag gets horrendous.Unfortunately this is one of those games that's marred by the company that holds it - Nexon.  Nexon has NO idea how to deal with any kind of customer support and is notorious for pay-to-win problems.  The latter doesn't actually rear its head NEARLY as much as it did in DFO, but there are still shades of it.Overall, my bad experiences with Nexon are the main thing preventing me from recommending this.

												Beautiful game. Amazing storyline. Creative monsters. Prelude to my second favorite game made by Nexon.This game has the most beautiful artwork and concepts of armor I have ever seen. Each character is crafted as their own. While the facial features might be the same for all characters, it really doesn't matter when you can personalize any way you want from skin tone to make-up to even under armor. The characters move so in tune with their weapons nothing seems unnatural.The storyline is fantastic, especially because this is all a prelude to Nexon's Mabinogi. This game is much more serious than Mabinogi and it certainly gives you a break from the care-free enviroment of it, which is sometimes nice.

												7/10As far as gameplay goes, it has the most unique and fluid combat system of any MMO that I have played. The battle system trumps C9, and even Black Desert; a 2016 'modern' game. There are a wide variety of genderlocked characters and playstyles to suit your needs. Learning your character is very fun, and encouraged. The game definitely supports your progress of learning the best way to play your character; especially in the Season 3 content which forces you to learn how to dodge and take less hits. Near endgame, it does get very grindy if you want better gear to do the endgame content, but level-wise, doing story content brings your character level approximately five levels under the cap. The story itself is terrible, but it has gotten slightly better with Season 3.Despite being an older game, I would say the graphics hold up to many modern games that have come out these past few years. There are many glitches in the game however, and the voice acting is terrible. Be ready to listen to the characters screech at each other when your party members don't esc the cutscenes.Now, the cash shop. I have seen many MANY people saying that Vindictus is a pay to win game, all over the forums and the comments of anything Vindictus ever posts. And I invite you to explain to me why you say this is a pay to win game. Nexon will literally throw free NX items at you like candy; especially merc pots and blessings. Events give enhancement runes and enchant runes. They've even given out free cosmetics and pets in the past. The only items that are pay to win in the game are the battle boxes, which if lucky, will give you a rare grade weapon material or weapon. Keep in mind that you need five of these rare grade materials in order to build a weapon. Also, if you want anything worthwhile from these boxes, you'll either have to be lucky or buy A LOT of these to even get anything good. Unless you're telling me that you're going to buy and spam merc pots in raids, I don't see this game being pay to win in any way. Learn your character and get good at the game. Gameplay is highly dependent on skill, and most of the items in the cash shop are for cosmetic purposes only or for giving you small benefits when enhancing/enchanting weapons.Now here's the bad. The company that owns it: Nexon. They are notorious for their complete lack of customer service and communication to the players. It has gotten better over the years, but it is still nowhere where it should be. If you play, expect to be hit with a few days of lag and bad servers before Nexon gets around to fixing it. Some bugs have been around for years and are STILL around. If something in the game breaks after an update, don't expect it to be fixed. New content gets released maybe five times a year. In between those long periods, events happen, but many of them are RNG or grind based events that serve little purpose to keeping you in the game. As of this review, the community is basically dead. These past few weeks, i've seen the board empty of raids, and have found it hard to gather enough people to even do raids when I am hosting missions. Now, keep in mind that this game is HIGHLY community based. Yes, if you're really good, you could solo everything if you wanted to. But most people can't solo and/or host, and need to rely on others for help. Which is why the decline in the community is so bad for the health of the game. It's a shame, since this game has so much potential and it's being run into the ground by an incompetent company. The only thing that keeps me coming back to this game are the updates and my friends that play. Other than that, Nexon provides you with no incentive to keep playing, which causes the death of a wonderful game due to sheer laziness on their part.			"

												I reached a point where I find myself looking to the free-to-play mmo's for a source of entertainment. This is how I came across Vindictus.It's looks like it should be a fine, top of the line mmo; but with one flaw that breaks the game before the player actually starts. It was made by Nexon.Yes, the same Nexon that made the buggy as hell, hacker-infested Combat Arms.I decided to move past this, thinking Nexon got their act together, and decided to try the game for myself. I installed the game, and was met by not one, but seven launcher crashes in a row. On attempt number eight., I was faced with a long♥♥♥♥♥background instalation that made me think the game crashed again. Attempt number nine actually got me into the game, but as I tried to connect to the server, the game crashed entirely. Three more attempts just to get into the game resulted in the same crash. Hell, even a personal friend with a recently updated PC even crashed as much as I did trying to get in.Take my word for it, the game is not worth the amount of time it will take just to start the bloody launcher.

												I played this game before it was even on steam. This game takes aspects from two of my favorite genres. It has skills and classes from a typical MMORPG, but then in the combat it takes on aspects of a live-action MOBA (non-rts) style. I would highly recommend this to both casual and hardcore gamers due to its high  potential and tactics when fighting harder enemies. The beginning of the games is slow though, enemies are easy, no one has any troubles, and typically it feels like a grind-fest. However once you get further in the game and get a more in depth touch, you really get engaged in the fast paced, high action, and VERY difficult boss fights.			"

												Overall, Vindictus was a decent game. The freedom it gave you was limited. For example, the Megaman inspired stage system got somewhat repetitive. It turns out that it's necessary to play the same level 4, 5, 6, and sometimes up to 10 times simply to gain bigger amounts of EXP. To put it simply, it's a fun game after level 50, and that level takes repetition of the SAME stages, OVER and OVER! Uninteresting for 95% of the time I put into it.			"

I have no idea how it is these days as it has been a couple years since I last played.I don't have much playtime in the game shown because it disconnects me a couple of minutes after logging in, ever since the steam release (I played it before then).Oh, also Nexon is basically stupid and terrible, I reccomend never giving them money.

												I have been waiting for the right time to leave my review and because of RECENT CONTROVERSIES, today is the day I do it.The good: CombatEasily the best out of every MMORPG, nothing comes close. Graphics.Pretty good graphics considering its age. At one point, the lighting/reflections in this game was the best I've seen. In fact, it rivalled AAA titles back in ~2010 when DX11 was uncommon. Music.Music is great, some of the best instrumentals I've heard. When I quit this game, I'll be listening to the OST into the far future for sure. Reasonably bugfree.Bug fixes may a take a while, but they eventually arrive.The bad: FPS and Client/Server instability.It is impossible to have a solid 60 FPS and the game crashes for no reason. Optimization is urgently needed but that appears to be low priority. The crashes are few and far between, but it is worth mentioning. The anticheat software is unreliable as proven by the abundancy of bots and for some reason it occassionally uses all of your CPU. Nexon NA.Official forums are heavily moderated. Seemingly normal posts get deleted because of ""FUD"" (fear, uncertainty and doubt). The definition of this appears to depend on the weather. I heard the anticheat software can trigger false positives, which means players can get permanently banned for no reason. Somewhat pay2win/pay2progress.You can obtain almost everything for free if you grind enough, but real money helps a lot. The game has high upkeep if you want some of the nicer things such as hair and extra inventory space.So, after about 10000 hours I'll probably play in a different region, quit Vindictus or quit MMORPGs entirely. At the end of the day, the game is good if you want to bash some monsters into the ground. But is the combat good enough to make people stay? Give it a shot, I somehow played this game for 10000 hours while hating it the entire time.			"

I recently tried it on steam and logged into my old account  and was bored instantly. There is absolutely no endgame even after years of my inactivity I thought they surely added something new. Nope. The game is purely a money grab. Nothng new, looks the same and works the same for 4 years now. There is absolutely no incentive to level a character as there is nothing to do once you reach level 70.			"

												This game is actually one of the Better MMORPGs I have played in all my years of PC gaming. From the astonishing graphics, to the fairly good optimization, to the story itself, it is a great game. Oh, and those animations? Amazing. Plus, at level 12, the Evie class gains the ability to use a scythe, which scythe-using classes are always a plus in games for me. There is, however, fairly bad population lag if you have and old CPU, but that's really nothing if you play on a less populated channel. I'd give this game a solid 9/10 rating, and highly recommemd it to anyone interested in True-Action, Dungeon-Crawler MMORPGs.			"

												It's basically a hack and slash in the source engine. Sounds fun, but fails in a lot of areas.+Nice Graphics+Decent Combat Controls+Easy to learn combos-No real LODs for models. Instead everyone on the server looks like they're wear monk robes while they load for some reason.-Terrible, semi-unskippable text dialogue everywhere.-Little to no weapon variety. Your character usually has 1-2 weapon types they can ever use. Every weapon of that type is only an upgrade to the last, with no specialized versions.-Character customization is insanely overpriced. $30 for digital clothes alone. -You rent in game items for real money when you can't afford the permanent versions. Even when renting the prices are rarely under $7 for a week.-Ads for you to purchase in-game items everywhere.-Absolutely no exploration at all. You never really get to go anywhere. Just tiny town with 4 buildings, to a boat, to a series of rooms where you hit things until they die.-Assets are overused for enemies and levels, making the whole thing feel very lazily made.The only reason I play this is because I can't get my friends to play anything else yet.

												Let me tell you a story of how it all went down... I was able to jump, from that point on I gave the game a 20/10 but then out of no where my character needed a wheel chair, this mofo couldn't jump no more, he had no hops, I was upset. Then out in the distance I saw Shrek he came to me and whispered in my ear "" I know why you can't jump anymore "" with an evil lookin' grin. My whole body shivered. I was afraid but happy at the same time... to think that Shrek did this to me, out of everyone, I should be glad. Right? Yeah. Oh yeah, back to the game. They got rid of my hops, wait no that was shrek. Uh... It's a very fun game that should be played with friends, sure you have to grind here and there but it's worth it? I mean gee when don't you grind an mmo. Anyway, Nexon is butt, but! This game is good, not nexon, but the game. Got it? Try it. ~Senpai			"

												This game isn't just repetitious, but also gets boring fast. A typical pay to win kind of deal. It's really a gamble on trying to get  decent gear or items to sell to make gold. The influx of this game blows goats and it gets frustrating if an enchant or enhancement fails. You're taking chances on a game that's really just a cash cow. It's addicting at first, seeing how I dumped so many hours into it but I just want to give up again. Waiting around with your thumb up your♥♥♥♥♥for a raid to start or even trying to continue the storyline. You might as  well try Elsword or Dragon Nest if you want a fast-paced game where you have better luck.			"

												This MMORPG is yet another great example of the free-to-play niche. The game is stunning, full of vibrant charm inspired by Korean-Japanese culture and European middle ages. What you have here is a massive package of free content. The game let's you pick three different fully fleshed out playstyles from the hard hitting sophisticated art of magic and alchemy to the brutally accurate archer.  There are tons of missions to partake in, a load of different weapons and armors with impressivly great design to choose from as well. A fully realized upgrade and leveling system is also present. The combat is real time and stylishly brutal! The music is also great! If you like RPGs then this game is more than standard fare. Try it out if you're interested, it's extremely fun and free! You've got nothing to lose!			"

												This game is many funs. I invested a total of $5.00 USD in order to profit from my Level 89 Paladin character. My level 56 Mage is in progress to becoming a Legendary Eagle Conjuring Necromancer. Once completed, I will obtain the Clairvoyance ability to restore peace to all the realms and understanding of the magicks. Ancient scriptures speak of a hidden power. Within this sandwich, many years of potato famine have unfolded into a crypt of secret paper that lead to the traffic cone of freedom after I forgot to turn my pizza maker into the one who seeks the holder of the vault.

												pretty rad if you like to play an mmo where most players (if you run into any) have already capped and treat you like garbage because you havent hit lvl 90, ghost town? nope try ghost world....gameplay is ok i do feel full controller would be nice so i dont have to take my hands off, look down away from the boss, find the key, press it, look up and find out im already dead.i dont like how i have to spend tons of cash on extras. (hey nexon how about imply a cheap month to month member system like runescape and make players spend ap on extras)this game has sucked my life away though. i spend most of my free time playing it, which is weird because i have an xbone and fh3 to get back to...it is addicting i'll give it thatbut there are improvements to be made if they want their players back because as it sits the community is dead and the more that quit will cause it to die faster and thats xp,ap,time and irl cash wasted.i suggest making improvements; big ones at that, improve advertising of said improvements, raise lvl cap and remove the need to spend actual money anytime you want something cool, imply a member system (you already have vip but make it so it lasts longer and makes it so you can spend gold or ap on outfits,weapons,etc.)make a larger map instead of the two cities you can walk into and the two other towns you can travel to. people like large scale free roam. bring back your community and maybe this game will be more than halfway decent.freebies are not always enough.i do however reccomend this game if you like grinders.

												The story was mildly intriguing, but it was disappointing that I did not get to fight side-by-side with any of the important NPCs. Instead, the reality of this world is left to be told via text and unanimated 2D pictures of the NPCs. And the dialogue is not good enough to jump off the screen on its own.The combat mechanics are tolerable, but the difficulty was laughably easy. However, it was not the lack of difficulty that annoyed me most about the dungeons but the bland, monotonous layouts of the environments -- and every dungeon is a single, closed path. There is no heart nor soul to the world, and it all feels impersonal and empty.But, I did have a little fun regardless of all the boringness. I've just no interest in continuing to play it further.

												I've played Vindictus since the start of OBT. I've played the game for many hours throughout these few years, and I must say that this game is by far the most addictive game I've ever come across with. With that said, here are my pros and cons.Pros:Hack and Slash - This game is unique in game-play with it's hack and slash mechanics. I have played many hack and slash games, and I can say none of them compete well with Vindictus. It's battle system has kept me playing for years. It's combos gave me a rush of dopamine from the get-go. I got hooked, and it felt good. Character Diversity - Each character has it's unique play-style. Currently, you can play as 8 characters. Lann, Fiona, Evie, Karok, Kai, Vella, Hurk, Lynn, and soon Arisha. Each character is unique in battle. Even while Vella and Lann share the same weapon (Twin Swords), they feel very much different from one another. I've tried each character, and can see similarities among them, but they stand out on their own.The Abundance of Channels - Each Server has a total of 200 channels. Whether you want to interact, or play alone, channels provide a spot for everyone. The Story - The story is beautiful. I will not explain it, I don't like giving story spoilers. I will say, this game would be an amazing anime.Cons:RNG - Of course, this will be my first con to list. The RNG (Random Number Generator) of this game is very broken. You want to gear up, and enhance as best as you can? Gear enhancement can be very, very risky. After +6, you will risk the enhancement to 0, and after +8, you risk breaking.Some people have a lot of luck, and could possibly go from +0 to +15 in one go, but that's extremely rare.A lot of players resort to buying NX to buy Enhancement Runes to protect their arsenal.Over all, the RNG seems really unfair to everyone.Drop Rate - This goes along with the RNG. The drop rate sucks in this game, even with VIP, or VVIP services (which range from 10$ to 20$ a month) most of the drops end up being garbage.Server Stability - (Peer to Peer) - More times than not, I stay away from 24-man raids, and leave boats where the host only has 1 bar. Peer to Peer works great in Korea, but face it... North America is much more vast than South Korea.Bots - This game is infested with bots. These bots also inflate the economy, making things harder to earn.Depot Shop/Avatar Shop Pricing - The prices tend to be high up there. Though, you do not have to buy anything from these shops, people prefer to buy to look good, or gear up better. The game can have it's ugly pay2win moments.Recycled Dungeons - Perilous Ruins, Ruins of Sanctity, and Hilder Forest are the same maps. After a while, everything looks familiar, and dull. Prairie Entrance and Fomorian Base are purposely the same location. (Fobellow Prairie). That includes Ainle, and The Catacombs. (Night time, and Day time)Community - The community of this game can either be amazingly awesome, or terribly annoying.It ranges from down to earth people who actually play this game, to sorry people who try to tell you how to play the game, and act like they are a better person than you based on their numbers. Though, this is in every game, it's something one must learn to endure in MMORPGs.My Rating:Gameplay: 8/10Story: 8/10Server Stability: 5/10Community: 4/10Dungeons: 6/10Premium Shops: 6/10Overall Rating: 6/10.NOTE: Despite of my review and rating, I recommend this game. You should try it for yourself before you make any conclusions.			"

												I never got to play the game because of the poorly implemented authentication system. Had to creat a separate Nexon account, which would not work because for some reason it required a 'second pin'. Followed the online process, got an email to reset the PIN, but it would not reset. Added my Facebook account for additonal verificaion, but that wasn't good enough. Spent over an hour just trying to get into the game and finally gave up in frustration because I figured that - if this is how they designed the gateway into the game, what in teh world is the actual game going to be like?  Not worth any more of my time, so I uininstalled it.			"

												A pretty solid hack-and-slash MMO. It plays out a bit like a cross between Diablo and a slightly toned-down Monster Hunter. Decent number of classes/characters, combat's pretty satisfying, and it definitely has one of the fairest Free-to-Play systems I've seen outside of Valve titles. Unfortunately, the upgrade trees are a little lackluster (you'll have unlocked every skill after just a few hours if you try to, leaving only fairly minor statistical improvements), the game does have a bit of a lag problem when there's a group of enemies on screen, and while the boss fights are definitely a highlight, the cannon fodder enemies and environments don't have as much diversity as I would have liked (you'll be wandering through the same areas and slaying a lot of the same basic creatures in between boss encounters). Overall, though, it's one of the better F2P games on Steam and definitely worth a look for fans of the genre.			"

I have no idea when exactly that was, and at this point, I don't care.What I do care about, as that I return to being banned.What?Unless I am missing the memo that inactive profiles are banned, this is absurd.I have no memory of this game except grinding the first region, as I never got strong enough to get past it, and then leaving. I return to THIS?Thanks.(Also, I am sure I have more than .3 hours on Vindictus, as I use to play with a friend, and he has 107 hours. I am sure I atleast have 40 hours.)			"

												I absolutely love the action combat of this game because it requires precision and strategic approach to most of the Hero Mode bosses/raids but allows you to just spam click your way through everything else for the fun Hack 'n Slash aspecs of this genre.  Dodging attacks is pretty easy for most classes but some are unlucky in not having any invincibility frames in their dodge when wielding certain weapons but for the most part all mobs/bosses give plenty of tell-tale signs of which kind of attack is coming.     There are many different kinds of weapons that have very different play styles and most of the gender locked classes can wield two types, which are unchangable during missions but can be freely swapped everywhere else.  Many different types of enchantable gear to upgrade your characters with [jewelry, standard armor pieces, costume parts with stat boost, etc] but &^$%, Forge Upgrading your armor/weapons past +6 is aggravating, and forget about +10 and higher unless you're filthy rich.     To be honest though, as much as I love this game, I find it very rage inducing due to these few reasons:  Dodging and attacking, Equipment Random Number Generator and Enchanting.  The dodging and attacking around bosses can be really fun but sometimes a few mistakes will cost you an expensive self rez item, especially if you don't want to wait 24 hours to refight the special/raid boss for a chance of a high valued drop.  Other times you'll find that team mates will kite a bosses incoming attack haphazardly which makes the whole 'unlucky positioning' a regular thing unless you just try to dodge everything, whether aimed at you or not, causing the overall fight to take longer.  The random number generator for upgrading/finding quality gear is standardly unfair unless you spend real-life money to prevent your gear from being destroyed on failed attempts.  The same can be said about finding and using the Enchantment Scrolls which makes having optimally Enchanted-Enhanced Weapons, Armor and Jewelry an annoyingly difficult and arduous task to complete.  Overall though its a game I've enjoyed plenty for extended periods of time and after long breaks as well.  I highly recommend giving it a few plays.			"

												Put in well over 4,000 hours off Steam and only a bit of time on Steam. I played since Open Beta and it showed a ton of promise. But now this game is just horrible. Nexon has a way with taking a great game (MapleStory, Combat Arms, Mabinogi) and just ruining it with their incompetence and greed.I gave up on this game and Nexon as a whole. I will never give them another cent of my money or play anymore of their games.They don't give a damn about their customers and they implement game breaking updates that make longtime players like myself quit and new players quit within a few hours.Fu** Nexon.

												This game used to be great, fun, addictive, but the compagny has turned really greedy, and now to be quite honest, the game isn't what it used to be. It has become very, VERY, boring. But for a free to play game it's still fun and I would give it a try, what can you loose?			"

												I always come crawling back to this game... I am an avid Vindictus player. I play on and off and have started since the beta with only Lann, Evie, and Fiona. The game has undergone a lot of changes but the core is the same. Of course there are some pay 2 win elements but that doesn't hurt the game in my opinion. The visuals, music, and gameplay are all still top notch for such an old game and for anyone looking to play an mmorpg with friends you should definitely try this one out! (Also note the majority of the population is at end game)			"

												(Steam Review)Nearing 200hrs of on and off gametime. This is your standard hack n slash BUT, the combat is by far the greatest any game may have. Every frame, movement, hitbox, phases are incredibly smooth and is what keeps this game alive (aside from the cosmetics which actually keeps it alive). If you're going to be an on and off again player I highly recommend putting a couple of points into Meditation. Although the time reduction may seem minimal it will definitely stack up over time. I haven't done the exact math on this but, there have been times where I've logged in and seen a nice chunk of AP waiting to be used. Pros: Free to play, progress at a steady pace, NOT A CONSTANT MOB GRIND (like Maplestory), Incredible combat mechanics, characters feel unique and have their own playstyles. Characters can be almost completely customized (free) down to their eyes, body sizes, etc... The solo combat outweighs the Cons but only by a slim margin. It doesn't matter what class you pick, the best class changes often with little changes put out. The new updates have made it so the game runs perfectly smooth on my PC where in the pass it has not.Cons of the game: Dungeons will feel very repetitive (I'm only lvl67 atm, doing Season 1 battle quests). The only fun moments are when I finally get to the boss or am in a raid. Player base is extremely low, you can indeed pay to win but I don't think it's neccessary, LACK of permanent cosmetic events, butchered Raids (I hardly see anyone doing the 20+man raids nowadays with their new system, I used to be able to que up and the notifier would actually pop up and tell me to join). LOCKED gender classes so everyone of ie: Kai class will be males.If Nexon put out more events for lower level players/new players the game would be able to get more traffic. The playerbase needs to increase to help the game out more than anything at the moment.			"

												The game uses a ""hub"" system. Combat is instanced in small (and incredibly repetitive) areas. Content is recycled for about 20 levels all the way up to level cap, meaning for every twenty levels of play you're killing the same stuff, but recolored, in the same areas, either forward, or backward. Classes are varied, but they are also gender-locked. Some classes have a lot of similarity, but they simply created a female version because thongs sell better than boxers (no joke, females are basically barbie dolls to dress up). Content is plentiful, but experiencing and unlocking this content is a nightmare. You are expected to run the same dungeons over and over, and when you're not doing that, you're reading (or skipping) long, tedious storylines that you are only able to skip one dialogue sentence at a time (how long can your index finger or thumb mash on those buttons before they're just sore?).This means that even when they have Bonus EXP events, you will actually out-level the content that you're in. You are REQUIRED to play a lot of missions twice or more in order to fully ""complete"" the requirements to unlock the next mission. There are at least THREE LAYERS of restrictions on content, either ""Completion"" points, ""storyline"" completion or ""character level"". These three restrictions can be infuriating to deal with, since the majority of the content in the game (the normal story missions) can literally be completed in a matter of minutes.I am not joking when I say you will spend more time talking (reading text) to NPCs than you will actually doing missions. You will have to talk to one, two, three, four or more NPCs to learn about a particular mission, and then it will only take you about two minutes SOLO to complete said mission. Only exception to this is Raid Bosses. They are the only fun element in Vindictus, but if you play in a full party (there is no level restrictions, you can get hard carried in these raids) then you can normally get away with dancing in a corner doing nothing while your allies whipe the boss in several minutes.Another problem with this game is the business model. They've tried to be as fair as possible, but in the end what they've come up with is a system that heavily rewards paying users by giving them more exp, more loot, better loot, better consumables (potions you can drink while laying on the ground), more teamplay items (revive tokens etc) and just overall a better experience.Being a free player in Vindictus is tedious, tiresome and not necessarily rewarding. To be a free player you need to spend dozens of hours preparing for the next section of the game either by crafting, buying/selling on the market or collecting mats from dungeons. This process is incredibly time-consuming, and does not feel rewarding. Finally acquiring that ""next level"" set of armor is only the first part of the puzzle. You will craft items in random (and disquesting) colors so if you care even a little bit what you look like then you'll be obligated to proceed to the next part of the process which is customizing the color.If you do not buy things with real money you will literally be spending millions of gold (3.5mil approx for one color) to get the specific colors that you want. If you don't mind wasting time (and gold) you can roll for random colors for signifigantly less, but normally you will get hard clashing colors, desaturated colors, or poop brown. A lot of the time there is one item in the set that simply does NOT roll the same colors as the rest of the outfit, so you will have a clashing color no matter how much time and effort you spend rolling. Best bet is to farm gold to buy dyes directly from players. Unless you're fine with spending $3 to randomly get a color from six possibilities. Yeah, you read that right. $3 to gamble colors. That's Vindictus.The other things you can buy through the real-money store is essentially wigs and underwear. There is a ""depot"" that contains pets, consumables etc. and if you plan to be a serious Vindictus player then you simply can't get away with NOT buying from the depot.Casual players will want their characters to look decent, so they will likely want a wig and some underwear. $10 a piece. Why? Because breast physics and buttcracks. If you use the default, you'll have an ugly white cotton undershirt and shorts. Basically all the armor sets are designed WITHOUT these inner-armors in mind, so they will stick out like a sore thumb.With all of these things listed above I simply will not recommend this game to anybody, ever. The business model is awful and punishes free players in almost every possible way. The pacing of the game is incredibly inconsistent and painful (literally, my finger & thumb go numb when I play for more than 30 minutes) and the story is your typical Eastern Anime-themed ""Oh noes I'm a diety but because I'm a helpless girl I need every strong man to save me from stupid situations"" and frankly it drove me nuts. You're a member of a mercenary group and the amount of petty squabbles, incompetent recruits (and generals) and whatnot is just appalling. It's hard to believe that these people even know which end of the sword to carry.Don't bother with Vindictus. When it first came out it was basically the first Western MMO to play like this, but now we have different games that do the same thing in a much more fair and reasonable fashion (Tera, for example). This game will try your patience, hurt your fingers, frustrate you when it should be entertaining you. Unless you're a horny teenage boy or girl that likes looking up skirts, avoid like the plague.

												Vindictus is a fun game, but sadly its deteriorated into a pay2win game with horrible customer service. The game has been steadily losing population for the last year and Nexon doesn't feel like fixing the game since that doesn't bring in money. They are more focused on releasing Inner Armor for the females so people can clothe their waifus in bikinis. There is nothing in the game for low levels and grouping with your peers at low levels is basically non existant. What end game they have is a grind fest, and by that I mean it takes weeks to get a certain piece you need to improve your gear, and there is a good chance you will lose that piece of gear in the process. Don't waste your time, stay away from this game.			"

												Although Nexon's ""Mabinogi"" MMORPG title has more of an original and unique feel to it, Vindictus has its ups and downs. I adore all of the games that Nexon makes, especially that of Mabinogi and Maplestory. I have put a lot of hours into Vindictus and was a beta tester for the game.Throughout the years I have come to the conclusion that this game is for the type of people who want hack n' slash ability and yearn for a-lot of carnage. The online servers have a few bugs but other than that, people who enjoy totally annihilating your opponent and/or having fun with friends, it's a good idea to try this game out. Totes fun.			"

												pretty rad if you like to play an mmo where most players (if you run into any) have already capped and treat you like garbage because you havent hit lvl 90, ghost town? nope try ghost world....gameplay is ok i do feel full controller would be nice so i dont have to take my hands off, look down away from the boss, find the key, press it, look up and find out im already dead.i dont like how i have to spend tons of cash on extras. (hey nexon how about imply a cheap month to month member system like runescape and make players spend ap on extras)this game has sucked my life away though. i spend most of my free time playing it, which is weird because i have an xbone and fh3 to get back to...it is addicting i'll give it thatbut there are improvements to be made if they want their players back because as it sits the community is dead and the more that quit will cause it to die faster and thats xp,ap,time and irl cash wasted.i suggest making improvements; big ones at that, improve advertising of said improvements, raise lvl cap and remove the need to spend actual money anytime you want something cool, imply a member system (you already have vip but make it so it lasts longer and makes it so you can spend gold or ap on outfits,weapons,etc.)make a larger map instead of the two cities you can walk into and the two other towns you can travel to. people like large scale free roam. bring back your community and maybe this game will be more than halfway decent.freebies are not always enough.i do however reccomend this game if you like grinders.

												I cannot believe how long I have spent playing this game but getting back into it, it's good and it's a different kind of MMO. It's quite honestly the best MMO to get if you want an online version of, for example purproses, Devil May Cry. The classes are genderlocked so that's a shame but then every Korean MMO is. Anyways this game is fun for a bit but the crafting and economy is a pain in the butt to deal with. But the last time I've played this game was back in 2007 so maybe it's changed I'm not so sure. Anyways the game does a good job of making you feel like a total badass towards Endgame and it's fun going on the huge and complicated raid bosses. Overall I'd say it's a solid 8/10			"

												The story was mildly intriguing, but it was disappointing that I did not get to fight side-by-side with any of the important NPCs. Instead, the reality of this world is left to be told via text and unanimated 2D pictures of the NPCs. And the dialogue is not good enough to jump off the screen on its own.The combat mechanics are tolerable, but the difficulty was laughably easy. However, it was not the lack of difficulty that annoyed me most about the dungeons but the bland, monotonous layouts of the environments -- and every dungeon is a single, closed path. There is no heart nor soul to the world, and it all feels impersonal and empty.But, I did have a little fun regardless of all the boringness. I've just no interest in continuing to play it further.

												It has all the elements that should theoretically make it a blast to play, and yet the early game is incredibly dull and repetitive that I have yet to get deep into it enough to find out whether the lategame is any better.Also, the game's netcode is garbage and everyone you play with in public games is either going to be from Brazil or leave their microphone on at all times, so expect to never play a public game with decent latency, and prepare to mute everyone you meet.So much for multiplayer.

												Ok, on my preveious Steam account I've played this game for a quite a while and really, I dont exactly not recommend this game, only thing is that there are way better games out there for you to get. This game has big bosses and pretty good graphics for a f2p mmo. Thing is that it's not what you may think it is. If you're looking for a game where you can farm currency and not be totally outmatched by people who pay, this game doesn't exactly fit that bill. You better expect to grind for all raw materials, armor, and weapons. Another thing is that this game isn't a casual game, in order to succeed in this game you better be prepared to do overtime; otherwise the unimmersive story will eventually bore you. This game is not even close to being an RPG, the story is dull and the game didnt focus on anything but combat. The combo based hack and slash combat is fast paced and fluid, but there is only one race and the classes are simply put, ""Gun, magic, or melee weapon?"" This game does have a lot of things that make it unique and worthwhile, but when you look at the whole picture, this game isn't worth your time. If you want mindless dungeon massacres and random big bosses, then this is the game for you. If you want detailed story and lore you can immerse yourself into. If you want to play wheather you have 20 minutes or 2 hours. If you want to RP with people and have a variety of races and classes that really make you think on how you play. To you I say avoid this game and play a real MMORPG.			"

												Vindictus is a fun game, but sadly its deteriorated into a pay2win game with horrible customer service. The game has been steadily losing population for the last year and Nexon doesn't feel like fixing the game since that doesn't bring in money. They are more focused on releasing Inner Armor for the females so people can clothe their waifus in bikinis. There is nothing in the game for low levels and grouping with your peers at low levels is basically non existant. What end game they have is a grind fest, and by that I mean it takes weeks to get a certain piece you need to improve your gear, and there is a good chance you will lose that piece of gear in the process. Don't waste your time, stay away from this game.			"

												The game uses a ""hub"" system. Combat is instanced in small (and incredibly repetitive) areas. Content is recycled for about 20 levels all the way up to level cap, meaning for every twenty levels of play you're killing the same stuff, but recolored, in the same areas, either forward, or backward. Classes are varied, but they are also gender-locked. Some classes have a lot of similarity, but they simply created a female version because thongs sell better than boxers (no joke, females are basically barbie dolls to dress up). Content is plentiful, but experiencing and unlocking this content is a nightmare. You are expected to run the same dungeons over and over, and when you're not doing that, you're reading (or skipping) long, tedious storylines that you are only able to skip one dialogue sentence at a time (how long can your index finger or thumb mash on those buttons before they're just sore?).This means that even when they have Bonus EXP events, you will actually out-level the content that you're in. You are REQUIRED to play a lot of missions twice or more in order to fully ""complete"" the requirements to unlock the next mission. There are at least THREE LAYERS of restrictions on content, either ""Completion"" points, ""storyline"" completion or ""character level"". These three restrictions can be infuriating to deal with, since the majority of the content in the game (the normal story missions) can literally be completed in a matter of minutes.I am not joking when I say you will spend more time talking (reading text) to NPCs than you will actually doing missions. You will have to talk to one, two, three, four or more NPCs to learn about a particular mission, and then it will only take you about two minutes SOLO to complete said mission. Only exception to this is Raid Bosses. They are the only fun element in Vindictus, but if you play in a full party (there is no level restrictions, you can get hard carried in these raids) then you can normally get away with dancing in a corner doing nothing while your allies whipe the boss in several minutes.Another problem with this game is the business model. They've tried to be as fair as possible, but in the end what they've come up with is a system that heavily rewards paying users by giving them more exp, more loot, better loot, better consumables (potions you can drink while laying on the ground), more teamplay items (revive tokens etc) and just overall a better experience.Being a free player in Vindictus is tedious, tiresome and not necessarily rewarding. To be a free player you need to spend dozens of hours preparing for the next section of the game either by crafting, buying/selling on the market or collecting mats from dungeons. This process is incredibly time-consuming, and does not feel rewarding. Finally acquiring that ""next level"" set of armor is only the first part of the puzzle. You will craft items in random (and disquesting) colors so if you care even a little bit what you look like then you'll be obligated to proceed to the next part of the process which is customizing the color.If you do not buy things with real money you will literally be spending millions of gold (3.5mil approx for one color) to get the specific colors that you want. If you don't mind wasting time (and gold) you can roll for random colors for signifigantly less, but normally you will get hard clashing colors, desaturated colors, or poop brown. A lot of the time there is one item in the set that simply does NOT roll the same colors as the rest of the outfit, so you will have a clashing color no matter how much time and effort you spend rolling. Best bet is to farm gold to buy dyes directly from players. Unless you're fine with spending $3 to randomly get a color from six possibilities. Yeah, you read that right. $3 to gamble colors. That's Vindictus.The other things you can buy through the real-money store is essentially wigs and underwear. There is a ""depot"" that contains pets, consumables etc. and if you plan to be a serious Vindictus player then you simply can't get away with NOT buying from the depot.Casual players will want their characters to look decent, so they will likely want a wig and some underwear. $10 a piece. Why? Because breast physics and buttcracks. If you use the default, you'll have an ugly white cotton undershirt and shorts. Basically all the armor sets are designed WITHOUT these inner-armors in mind, so they will stick out like a sore thumb.With all of these things listed above I simply will not recommend this game to anybody, ever. The business model is awful and punishes free players in almost every possible way. The pacing of the game is incredibly inconsistent and painful (literally, my finger & thumb go numb when I play for more than 30 minutes) and the story is your typical Eastern Anime-themed ""Oh noes I'm a diety but because I'm a helpless girl I need every strong man to save me from stupid situations"" and frankly it drove me nuts. You're a member of a mercenary group and the amount of petty squabbles, incompetent recruits (and generals) and whatnot is just appalling. It's hard to believe that these people even know which end of the sword to carry.Don't bother with Vindictus. When it first came out it was basically the first Western MMO to play like this, but now we have different games that do the same thing in a much more fair and reasonable fashion (Tera, for example). This game will try your patience, hurt your fingers, frustrate you when it should be entertaining you. Unless you're a horny teenage boy or girl that likes looking up skirts, avoid like the plague.

												I tried to enjoy Vindictus. Honestly I'm not sure there's anything wrong with it, mechanically. There's a diverse range of classes, lots of enemies to beat up, nice artwork, amusing physics. I just found it very boring. It made me want to play a cooperative Devil May Cry, but no such thing exists. The individual levels are very samey, the music is forgettable. The weapons are cool, though. I would certainly recommend it before other Nexon games, but that's not saying much.			"

You just hit a brick wall if you don't want to spend money for upgrading what gear ( because if you dont you will just break your gear and gg have fun farming that♥♥♥♥♥♥again.) long story short if you want a good game just go look some where else. Yes the combat is pretty neat with all the different classes gender locked or not but the end game is just and endless cycle of lifeless grinding.			"

												Vindictus is an action beat em up developed by devcat and published by Nexon. The game launched around five or so years back and has been filling with content since.   The Game had small peaks in popularity but it honestly deserves much better than others let it on to be.  This game is however not without faults but if you can live without them you can probably see yourself right at home with this game. GraphicalThe graphics of Vindictus are pretty nice and have aged well despite it being 2016, game is limited to directX 9.0 and textures are pretty clean. Character models are very impressive and there are a wide variety of monster models and armor sets. For a free to play game this does not disapoint.  Sound	The sound effects are pretty good but the lack of ability to turn off fanfares can be kind of annoying, the options menu does not seem to allow me to turn off or adjust the volume of the game. I had to resort to windows audio mixer but whatever.   General Gameplay	Gameplay for vindictus is very thrilling, even the lower levels you'll find yourself having loads of fun completely destroying enemies later on the challenge really picks up in the mid game.  45+ is when I started having to play more conservatively.  They give you three bags I personally struggled to maintain item space with three and ended up buying bag space which costed real money. It really all depends how much you value holding onto your items.  Progression	Progression in the game has really changed from launch you wont be repeating quests anytime soon as the game will give you a smooth ride to 60+.   As you level up and complete battles you will gain AP this works similar to mabinogi if you have played the game.  You will spend AP to rank skills up starting from Rank F going to Rank 1.  Some skills only go upto certain ranks.    Gear progession is something I can only speak from my way upto level 60, you are greeted with a ton of variety I believe this is due to the games original cap. There is a huge lacking in items to buy off the market board making your only option as to grind the bosses for the materials which really does boil down to RNG.  It will probably take you a few hours to get the set you want. Players are more than willing to run too, I play on the east server and have had tons of players jump in on the fun slaughtering the boss over and over.   This has made it very bareable for me. Combat When you begin the game you will be greeted to a character selection screen, each character has thier own traits and abilites. Characters range from fast attackers, to bursty or half magic/half melee mages.   the variety has something for everyone even grapplers will feel at home. There is a very hack and slash feeling to the game.  Combos are generated by left and right mouse clicks.  Left being your general melee and right being your smash attack. you will perform combos based on number of left clicks combined with right click.  Some combos have extra conditions.You are given secondary weapon choices ranging from hooks to spears to bombs all used with the F key, you can only have one with you and each has its own function. Later into the game around level 40 you'll be given the ability to go either ""Paladin"" or ""Dark knight""  Each with thier own perks but both very benefiting on all characters so no choice is wrong.  Thoughts on the cash shop	The Cash shop is pretty pricey but not completely overpowering as I thought it would be, you gain some stats from cosmetics but they are only a very tiny fraction of stats that only shadows your armor.  I feel like storage space prices are a bit ridiculous(13-USD) as I feel the perm bags are the correct choice over rental bags. This can be daunting and make you feel like you are limited to playing one character if you don't make a whole lot of income to shell out.(Again this is based on perspective some people are good at managing their inventory space.)  There are gatcha and plenty of cosmetics to choose from if you really like the look.  I feel like the armor in the game looks amazing so it really does not matter if you choose to take cosmetic or not.   Again nothing overpowering but really too expensive. Story The story is very good for an free to play title, the characters are actually memorable and quirky I can't beleive that is actaully fun to read as you progress.  The plot is nothing too special however and you'll find that aspect to be pretty dull and just plain silly as you level further. The neat characters do seem to damper outside of the starting village.  I didn't have the same level of awe with the characters in the castle city as I did in the small mercenary camp.  Despite this, its still mildy interesting and actually gives the gameplay meaning.  It's executed very well.  Is vindictus worth playing?	I would say its worth playing, it has hours of content. Bosses are fun and engaging and all stay unuiqe into the endgame. Character progression is good and there are tons of playstyles. Story has great characters and the game can be enjoyed solo or with a group of friends. The game really has come a long way from launch. It has no fatigue system or anything that punishes people for wanting to actually play the game.  It's hack and slash with a great curve of difficulty.   Should you play this?  Yes, yes, absolutely yes...  Free to play games are generally not this good.			"

												Vindictus is a free to play third person Action MMORPG.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.   There is PVP, but it is not worth playing.  Brutal action combat using Mouse/Keyboard or Controllers.   Pick any hero from 10 choices, each with a different choice of weapons and attacks.  Heroes are gender locked, you can change the costmetic appearances of the hero you choose.  Combat is mainly using left and right attack buttons in certain orders while dodging/ blocking / countering attacks from enemy using Standard movement. Travel to  Instanced dungeons with up to 3 players, with 3 difficulties.  Level cap is 90.  Check the wiki and guides for info how to play and maybe find players in forum. CONS:- Very low population of new players. - Very hard to find people to play quests with.- Very repetitive PVE.- The camera system is a little clunky using Mouse / keyboard.Try it, if you like Action Combat games.For more info:

												★★★☆☆Vindictus is not an MMO, open world, or even a Diablo style world.  In fact, there is no world.  Its closer to L4D or MMO-dungeons, and only has a small hub town for a lobby, in place of a basic menu.  The gameplay in the linear, instanced, 4 player coop missions, is realtime action based beatemup button mashing, akin to Devil May Cry or God of War.  + Graphic Style+ Destructible objects+ Effective quest arrow+ Slowmo mission finish+ Opens with a story cutscene+ Built with the Steam's Source engine+ Pickup corpses and objects to throw at enemies+ Smooth UI that you can easily drag around to customize+ The only mage class of all time to have meaningful cast times+- Rooms where you talk to NPCs+- Can't jump, but space does a dodge/dash+- Button mashy beatemup gameplay.  LLLLRx9999+- Free2play, but practically all character customization and vanity items cost real money - Harsh loading screens- Weird launcher process- Graphic & audio stuttering- No 'audio in background' option- Text boxes sometimes auto skip?- Classes are locked to premade characters- Launching a mission is painfully over complicated- Playerbase split between servers, most seemingly on East- The lobby zone is split into channels, seemingly at random- Menus automatically open when walking near certain objects, this is stupidly disruptive to gameplay, just give a button prompt			"

												A great game made by the worst MMO company in the History of online gaming called Nexon whom I will refer to as Shixon in this review.   Save yourself the trouble, and do not play this game it's a waste of time and money.Problems*#1.   If the vast skies were scrolls and the endless oceans were ink, I could not write enough bad things about any Shixon run game, this game is no exception.*#2Servers are absolutely horrible.   You wll get disconnected, you will lag, you will not be able to play the game properly no matter what server you are on.   The community has complained to Shixon about this, but it seems like they are unwilling to upgrade their 56k dialup internet connection.*#3Bots.   As with any Shixon made game, bots are a problem.   Not only do the millions of them that ruin this game cause severe server lag, but they also destroy the economy and other areas of the games completely.   Right when you first start playing the game on Channel 1, you'll be greated by Bots standing right in the middle of town trying to steal your credit card information by selling gold for cash.   Shixon has been unable to catch these bots even though they stand right in the middle of town yelling to everyone.   DO you think it's safe to give your credit card information to hackers?    Shixons lack of action against these bots shows that Vindictus is also a risk to your financial information and identity.   You might spend $100 on your credit card on premium items only to have some hacker spend $10,000 on your credit card for a vacation to another country.*#4Shixon.   This argueably should always be the first problem anyone mentions when reviewing a game made by this company.   This is the worst online gaming MMO company that has ever been formed.   *#5Poorly thought out events, drunk moderaters is the only explanation.    Imagine that you played the game for a year or so, we all know how these MMO's work.   You play the game and work hard to get your high level gear which can take MONTHS on this game.   The day you get your high level gear you realize that Shixon has decided to run an event which practicly gives new players the same gear you have, and for free.   What do you get for being a  level 85 player who contributed to the game since the start?   20 healing potions.   Yes this really did just happen.   Typical Shixon.*#6Unoptimized engine.   You can have a 5 GHZ (Turbo) 8 Core liquid cooled AMD 9590/Nvidia 660TI/OC and the game will still find random ways to stutter despite the fact that I can play newer games like Wolfenstein the New order on max everything at 1080P without a stutter or hitch.   This is due to a poorly optimized engine that does not use multiple cores what so ever at any point in time during playing.   Intel Cpus are better for this game due to the pathetic level of coding since Intel Cpu's are usually rated better on single threaded applications.The Good.This can be summed up in one paragraph, at the core this is a great action hack n slash game.   You'll play this game and say wow this is really great, this guy reviewing it must be crazy.    Then you'll keep playing the game and realize everything I said was true a month down the road and you'll instantly wish you had the last month of your life back.  Save yourself the trouble my friends, friends don't let friends play Vindictus.   "

												Vindictus a game I've played in the past and continue to return in hopes of its improvement, only to be upset time and time again.The game has great potential, but appears to be lacking in many aspects that make it a game I would recommend. My highest characters are nearing their 50s, and I've gotten that far with 3 different characters. This is entirely based off of my experience and the experience of others I have played with. I have participated in some endgame content such as dragon raids, which I found to be fun even though I died a lot, but I will not be covering that in this review.Combat ++ Physics++ Classic Hack and Slash+ ""Greater"" Raids offer unique gameplay not seen as much in the Story+- Fun w/ killing your friends via the environment+- Spear Throw friend/foe (does no damage to friend)+- Fluid and seamless depending on your specs, server, settings- ""Greater"" Raids require 16 players to start- Repetitive use of Skills- Becomes more repetitive the higher your levelGameplay++ Limitless amount of AP (skill points) to spec every skill+ Gold is an easily obtainable resource+ Quests sometimes chain through completion (Doing one dungeon sometimes completes two quests)- Storage is Limited unless you pay and a lot of resources are necessary for quests/crafting- Linear Environment/Dungeons- Linear Quest Line- Linear Way to Kill Bosses - 1 Strategy is usually the most effective and used above all other strategies- Bosses an enemies do not vary much every 10 levels- Repeating the same dungeon more than twice - becomes more repetitve at higher levels- As you level drop rates on items for quests become lower- Upgrading is high risk or extremely expensive (RNG)UI+ Titles- Cannot View channel location of friends via friend list- Cannot View location of friends on the minimap- Cannot Search for Unadded Friends in Friend Menu- Emotes are hidden need to be googled- Marketplace/Guild Search appear to be quite slow and may be using Internet Explorer- Inactive Guilds die, leadership is not transferredCash Shop+ Some of the greatest quality and entertaining costumes and goodies excessible in the RPG world+- Nexon makes money primarily from costumes and so it appears to have become the focus of the game+- Almost every second patch has a new costume+- Wealth of a player shines, people will take their time to oggle you- Players more interested in costumes than the actual gameplay- Overpriced AND Restricted relative to other RPGs (common in many Nexon games)- A bum is still a bum if they enter this game, the costumes and cash shop content are promoted so much that many active players end up buying it and new players or those that cannot afford it feel pressured or distaste.Other+ Controls are fair, supporting 3 modes+- You use the same armor/weapon for most of the game- Bugs take years to fix- Sound quality is average- Music is repetitive- Monster cries, screams repetitiveLast thoughts:This is a game you want to play with friends, preferrably join a guild or create one for the exp boost when you party together. This game a lot of perks to group play, but is not as rewarding to solo players.			"

												All this game has to offer is the amazing combat gameplay. Other then that your gonna get a bad pay to win game with the worst drop rate system ever and its one of those games where you have to actually spend money to get anywhere. The servers are almost always laggy and the game it self isn't all that well optimized for party hosters. As for the community, you have a better chance of finding a much better one in North Korea.

												Great MMO game. You need a pretty good system to play it on anything above medium settings unless they optimized it more since I played. It is a high action type fighting game. The combos will take some getting use if that is not something you are accustom to. The game is played mainly in instances where you can go solo or as a group. Everything else is mainly MMO stuff. Get better gear, buy cosmetic items in store, pets, etc, etc. It has a lot to offer of which I am not going to list here. It is free to play so try it out and see if it is something you can enjoy. Sooo....enjoy the battle. :)			"

												It's filled with sexualized female armours, unrefined enemies, and a user interface that's too large and complex for any new user to really wrap their head around without some practice. It's also the only MMO I've seen in which there seems to be too much story. The exposition is pointless and redundant, with multiple characters continuously repeating the same points in a few different sentences when only one would have sufficed. I wish I could get around these things, but that plus the lack of any good female armours that don't expose more of your skin than the base underwear does is just the last nail in the coffin for me.The game is free, at least.EDIT: I've literally been sent litanties of messages on here calling me ""an SJW"" as of late, and seemingly, it stems from this review. Your tears are delicious.			"

												While I really do enjoy the mechanics and everything about the game, the amount of latency that I receieved (as well as most players) really ruined it for me. It would take minutes to load dialogue sometimes, PvP (almost nonexistant as it was) was impossible with the lag, ect. Good game, bad servers.			"

When i need to dodge i shouldent have to wait 3 seconds after an atytack to do so putting me into a vanurable spot infront of a boss.The bosses are fun and some what challenging (in the start from where i got to)  but other than that, the combat is pretty bad for my liking.

												The action's really fun, each character is unique and play really smoothly (Latency not included). Gameplay aside, the game is way too grindy, and the community is pretty terrible. Also it's dying. Not to mention that it's hosted by one of the worst publishers I've ever had the displeasure of giving my money to. Every time I buy nx I feel like I need to take a cold shower and rethink my life. Every bit of content they release is 90% focused on milking it's dying community for more money (which is funding the development of maplestory 2, which is a horror story for another time), and 10% for the sake of shoveling out new content. tl;dr: Don't play this game if you value your time and money in any way shape or form.

												Quick Summary: Vindictus for PVE grinding only. Classes are imbalanced and heavily gear dependent in PVP. Grinding involves RNG drops, meaning that you might have to do an instance many times to get what you want. Enchantment system is pure RNG, with chance to downgrade your enchancement level once you go past +10. Cash Shop items can prevent this. Endgame PVE revolves around Raids, where you have to get meet certain DPS benchmarks to even be considered for boats.Did i also mention overpriced cosmetics and pervy underwear?Lag and recent Optimization quirks will make you rage sometime. WTB Lynn buffs.In the meantime I'm heading off to play Black Desert Online which is like the Sandplot MMO version of Vindictus only without (p2W) enchancement cash shop items and with an added addition of Open World pvp and GvG.

												Short version: I want my life back please.Long version: When playing alone, it's an alright game that you can easily sink 10-20 hours in. The real fun comes in when you bring in long term friends (either from the ones you meet in-game or in real life) that help you kick♥♥♥♥♥at the higher levels. It's frustrating at times, and it may take a lot of motivation for some (including me) to reach the end-game, but overall, it's a reasonably fun game.			"

												Gameplay is very sparce, meaning you rarely have to think about what you're doing.  Just pick a character and wail on some enemies.  You do not coop with other characters often, either.  You actually only talk to other people in this game when you're in the lobby area.  Otherwise, you're in a localized level, an instance of your own.  I was actually unable to find anyone to coop missions with me and eventually gave up looking for people.That said, the graphics are great, and character creation is kind of awesome... at least when you play a female character.

												Some backstory: I've played since the closed beta days and have read *many* posts of current and former employees and others.Nexon NA is headed up by some of the most nationalistic and racist Koreans on the face of this Earth. The absolute hatred and disgust they show towards anyone not like them is quickly and readily apparent. The executives are truly abhorrent human beings.There's nothing really much else to say. Vindictus is doomed to be a sour experience for you from the infectous touch of Nexon NA. If the gameplay looks appealing, try to find a guest pass for Black Desert Online--the gameplay is very similar and will scratch the same itch for most people, and has a lot more to offer overall.

												Terrible U.I. combined with obnoxious dialogue from the characters. I dislike how interacting with vendors works as they simply pop-up when you're near them instead of you being able to choose to speak with them. Chat spammers you can't ignore because you can use buy ""Megaphones"" that can't be blocked unless you mute the person speaking which at that point is meaningless. There's a lot of important settings missing such as a volume control for ambient sounds and NPCs. This is important because when you start up the game you're placed on the main menu which has incrediably loud roaring wind, then once you're past that onto selecting a character there's another incrediably loud narrator speaking giving discriptions of characters who you're also unable to quiet down. The only way to sell items for gold is through a global market place, no selling to NPC vendors which is another terrible flaw in the game. It only serves to keep newer, lower level players down while the rich get richer. The gameplay itself is quite fun, so I still reccomend trying out the game. I'd also reccomend using a controller, it certainly improved my experience.			"

												I had spent (I believe) thousands of hours on this game and I very much recommend it. Especially if you enjoy instance-based mmos opposed to open-world, and prefer running raids to grinding.They made it recently easy to get good equipment easily and reaching the end-game's become rather fast - though I believe that's what leads to the game becoming easily boring, because the end-game is pretty much just running a couple of stuff all over without the immersion an open-world would offer. This game is therefore best enjoyed if you're tagging along a handful of friends (instead of pugs). Unlike most of the mmos you don't run here a ""balanced party"", all characters/""classes"" can ""carry"" and aren't dependant on other players/""classes"". The content's being updated here and there and I find the game worthy of returning to on occasions. I don't see this game much as of a 24/7 material, rather something you return to when you need a break. I've been enjoying the newest bosses' fights as usually it tends to be something fresh.+ recommended for the story, high character customization (lots of items), actiony and fun combat, a bit of challenge if you play solo- problems are mainly bad optimization even with good hw (I gave up and play it on lower resolution for stable fps), frustration because of possible latency problems if you don't host raids, probably a lower immersion unlike open-world games, not very large player base (publicly hosted raids usually aren't many - on EU at least)			"

												It's free, it's fun, it looks good and the action is great, but i think i need a little more time to write a proper review :-DUntil then you have enough time to try it yourself, if you don't like it delet it, but try more than just one character and weapon, the are so different. Some work better than others, at level 12 you get the second weapon if the character has one.			"

												I had spent (I believe) thousands of hours on this game and I very much recommend it. Especially if you enjoy instance-based mmos opposed to open-world, and prefer running raids to grinding.They made it recently easy to get good equipment easily and reaching the end-game's become rather fast - though I believe that's what leads to the game becoming easily boring, because the end-game is pretty much just running a couple of stuff all over without the immersion an open-world would offer. This game is therefore best enjoyed if you're tagging along a handful of friends (instead of pugs). Unlike most of the mmos you don't run here a ""balanced party"", all characters/""classes"" can ""carry"" and aren't dependant on other players/""classes"". The content's being updated here and there and I find the game worthy of returning to on occasions. I don't see this game much as of a 24/7 material, rather something you return to when you need a break. I've been enjoying the newest bosses' fights as usually it tends to be something fresh.+ recommended for the story, high character customization (lots of items), actiony and fun combat, a bit of challenge if you play solo- problems are mainly bad optimization even with good hw (I gave up and play it on lower resolution for stable fps), frustration because of possible latency problems if you don't host raids, probably a lower immersion unlike open-world games, not very large player base (publicly hosted raids usually aren't many - on EU at least)			"

I can't get the first real mission to launch at all. It freezes every time. I lowered all graphics settings ect. to no avail. Its a shame.

Then they just didnt release any content for such a long time that everyone ended up leaving.

												The game is great.  I love the fast action reaction based gameplay, very fun.However..The game is unplayable with lag ~20-30% of the time.It's blatently obvious why too - hackers.Hackers and botters.Botting hackers.Check the god damned boats, naked lvl 30+ lanns insta-killing teleporting speedhacking on every boat.I've reported it several times, uploaded two videos of it on youtube.One copy-paste response from support.Do not support this game, bail now or don't start playing.Economy and server stability are both dominated by the botting hackers, ruins the game.I'd say it's not that bad, and in my opinion.. botters actually help the market for new players because it makes things available at a lower price.  But it ♥♥♥♥s higher level players in terms of farming, and it ♥♥♥♥♥ all over the chest of the server stability.How does nexon not have better detection/prevention?I mean I know there's bots in like.. world of warcraft right?  I imagine every game could have a bot designed for it, with minimal detection risk by adding non 100% optimal pathing, randomized routes etc etc to make it look human.But blatant insane hacking letting you one shot kill ANYTHING while naked?  Speed hacking? These things shouldn't be in the game first of all.. secondly they should be EXTREMELY easy to detect and ban the accounts/IPs.Wtf Nexon.			"

												For a F2P game, the quality is there.  The art assets look good.  The audio sets the right mood in and out of combat.  The battle sounds are sharp and visceral.  The VFX are satisfying and match up well with the animations and action.  It's a very satisfying adventure/brawler with similar gameplay traits that I enjoyed in Oni, Street Fighter, Drakan and Beyond Good and Evil.  The only downside I can see is the overwhelming number of what seem to be side-quests that you can't abandon/drop.  But otherwise, the sotrytelling is decent, concise but with enough depth to saticfy lore hounds.  The best part is that the cash shop is NOT pay to win, but like Guild Wars 2 is strictly convenience and cosmetic.  Good choice.			"

												Vindictus is a fun, fast-paced hack and slash MMO. You choose a character from 5 or 6 different ""classes"" and immediately venture into the prologue. After the prologue is complete, you can then customise your character. Yes, some of the aesthetic customisations cost real money, but so far I am yet to say this game is ""pay to win"". The story is interesting (if you actually bother to read the dialog) and you can craft items and sell them on an auction house. I really enjoy the combat in this game. The layout of each class has a primary weapon/s and then a secondary throwing weapon. There are lots of different items in ""battles"" that you can pick up and throw at enemies as well. There are Australian servers too, which is also a big plus. It is quite an easy game to pick up if you are an MMO fan. Best of all, it is free to play and well worth the download.			"

												If you're an mmo addict or just a fan of the previous MMO, Mabinogi, you may like this, but we are talking about Nexon, the same company that lost the contract on DFO the one game that was just as good as Mabinogi before letting it deteriorate.And purely because Nexon has allowed Vindictus to fall through the cracks like all of the other games they have, I do not recommend it. And before anyone thinks I'm just hating, I'm not. I played mabinogi for 5 years before leaving, after the hackers tore it up. After Nexon took too long to deal with it....			"

												Well folks it is that time a year again another sale. So you have the privilege to be humored by another one of my famous game recommendations. Awwwww Vindictus this game starts off with a very Games of Thrones feeling in the sense, that  it is not frowned upon to have an intimate relationship with a giant spider or other monsterous creatures, or as in Game of Thrones with your own family members. Once out of the tutorial you find yourself in a small sea port village which will now forever be your home. This town is similar to Animal Farm in the sense that animals for the most part run the economy of the game. Gentleman if you invite your lady friend to join you on this epic journey that is Vindictus keep an eye out for the pigs, because they are the womanizers and will steal your lady right from you! ALSO THINK OF A COOL MOTTO. If you don't have one don't play, because you need to start off each new quest/adventure with a laugh and if you can't provide that, then stick to solitaire!			"

												I’ve been experimenting with the MMO genre lately. Most games I tried would procure a couple hours of fun after which I would quit. The reason for this: I felt like I was wasting my time. Contrarily to popular belief, Video games don’t usually give me that feeling. I needed something better than your typical MMORPG with a failed plot and little replay value. I needed a game that felt... I don’t know, like more than just a game. I found it. If the title didn’t give it away, I’m talking about Vindictus. Vindictus is an MMO that combines your typical RPG experience with a hack n slash feel, impressive visuals, lush and varied environments, a good story and an insane replay value only to name a few aspects. The community is amazing and the huge 18 player team battles with make this game seem unreal. In short, Vindictus is exactly what I was looking for. Vindictus is more than just a game.Vindictus runs on Valve’s source engine. Nexon (the studio behind the game) probably picked this engine to allow extreme interaction between the player and the world. Past games like Half-Life 2 and Portal can testify to the awesomeness of this engine. Needless to say Nexon made a great choice. Contrarily to most online multiplayer games, the world behind Vindictus actually feels alive. Picking up, throwing and smashing objects around feels perfect. When I throw a wooden barrel into the ocean, the barrel sinks then resurfaces and floats. IT DOESN’T DISAPPEAR. The physics engine is out of this world.The story is interesting enough. There are a couple cut scenes coupled with dialogue that may or may not entice you to read more of it. I have to say that the dialogue is actually pretty good and I often find myself wondering what’s going to happen. This is one of the rare aspects that Vindictus does not excel in. Moving on to the online part of the game, it‘s crazy how fun this game is to play with friends. Before starting it, I suggest you find 2 or 3 friends and start it all together, because all 3 of you will have a blast. Everything in this game can be done in teams, and as I said earlier the big team battles against seemingly invincible bosses are something you will be talking about in the morning.    Earlier I mentioned the environments. They’re epic. I mean really epic. You go from fighting vampires in a pillaged town to fighting mummies on desert dunes only to end up with reapers in a dark crypt. Jungles, deserted plains, tropical islands, ancient ruins; this game has it all. The monsters themselves have amazing sprites that could easily be compared to a triple A game such as Skyrim. Each mission ends with a boss fight, usually a great boss fight. Beating bosses is easy once you understand their attack pattern, at least early on. All you Sword Art Online fans will feel right at home, but let’s not get into that.    Now I think it’s time we talk about the combat. There are about 8 different characters in Vindictus, each one having a unique and interesting combat style. Whether you want to shoot from a distance, cast fireballs, or leap into the fray with a giant pillar, there’s a combat style for you. My first character was Vella. A girl that dual wields either swords or chain blades. The former allows you to slice n dice from close range while the latter allows you to rip through enemies from far away. Every character has 2 weapons like this. Considering this, we can safely confirm that you can fight through this game in 16 different ways. I used twin blades with Vella. Once you’ve chosen a weapon. You can unlock abilities both passive and active as you progress through the game. For instance, when you start playing, the shift button activates a dash. Level up enough and you can unlock the Slipaway ability, letting you jump back while cutting anyone around you for some very handsome damage. Double tapping shift will activate this and pressing it a third time will throw in a dash to the combo. Very useful for escapes, making Vella an agile fighter if need be (extremely useful against bosses). Other abilities, such as Cross Cut will let you run right through an enemy attack if timed perfectly.Character customization is always important in an RPG. Vindictus once again makes me drool with insane skins and armour, making this dark themed, possibly depressing concept into something quite enjoyable to look at. This being said, many decorative aspects of the game require that you pay, but its player versus monster nature makes these things not an issue.There is PVP, although you will have to play for a while before experiencing it. All I can say for now is that I have noticed a rock paper scissor effect between certain characters. If you’re looking for a PVP heavy game, Vindictus is not what you’re looking for.Continuing on a sour note, you need a computer with dedicated graphics and a broadband internet connection to pull this game off. Or else the lag will probably kill it for you. Reflecting on this, anyone who doesn’t have dedicated graphics should probably not be on Steam, although you can play Vindictus without a Steam account. I haven’t covered everything, because that would take forever, but I feel as I’ve given you enough that you can decide whether or not to give this game a shot. Good luck!           "

The mere fact that they asked me a question repulsed me, so I ordered the security guards to shoot them with their guns.

												I defintely recommend this game if you like infinite dungeon crawling, epic action-y fighting, and fine tuned character skill development! Vindictus caught my attention because of it's physics system, as you can pick up objects in your environment and throw them at enemies, or pick up enemies themselves in some cases and throw -them-! Almost everything and anything can be picked up and used as a weapon (no exaggeration there), and in the hands of a capible warrior, even a BROOM becomes the doom of some poor monster! You won't be disappointed in the dungeons themselves, as traversing destructible environments, traps, and finding secret treasures will keep you excited (until you realize that the dungeon batches are pretty much copy-paste) and the enemies know and use this environment to their advantage (archers will shoot the supports to bridges to make you fall, enemies will attack destructible pillars to make them fall on you, etc). The game is made with the Source Engine, so it really hits home how diverse this software can be when used in game development (it surprized me that a company could use the SE like this)!Each dungeon has a ""batch"" of levels that look the same pretty much every time, and the enemies in these batches are pretty much copy-paste but with different colors and sizes. That's kind of the story with most MMORPGS, but in most cases you won't notice as you're mowing down a crowd of them with your sword, spells, arrows, or large blugeoning instrument of your choice. The monsters are pretty much straight forward in most cases, but the bosses are a big highlight of this game. Most of the time they're massive, deadly, and faster than you are. If you don't keep on your toes, dodge, and attack at the right moments, then you're toast. It's intense and epic when going against those bosses! Unlike other Free-To-Play games, Vindictus has a VERY in-depth character skill system, where AP (Action Points) are used to level certain skills and in-game gold is used to buy new skills (no real money required at all). While choosing a class confines you to what kind of skills you can unlock, that's where the confinement ends. From there, you can level skills at your choosing, and really define your character. You'll just have to see for yourself just how many passive and active skills you can level up, because I can't list them all! To go against these tough enemies, you gotta have the right gear. Vidictus has a fully-fledged Market and Crafting system for just that. Crafting is pretty straight-forward (ingredients + other stuff= Product), but the Marketplace is really polished to serve the players the best it can. I can't quite remember how it's done, but the Market will make sure that no one can buy-up all of a certain item and resell it at an outragious price, so it makes sure that everything is balanced and fair (just like in a real economy). Making gold in dungeons is really well-balanced, and if you look under every pot and destroy everything in sight, gold will start falling out of the cracks! If you're really economically-minded, then making your first million in this game should be a breeze. Of course, there are options to buy weapons, gold, and other bonuses within the game with REAL money, but it's all completely optional. What's better, is that some of these items are given away to the player periodically by the game itself (holidays, special event prizes, etc) but will usually expire quickly. The fact that you can have access to these items occasionally, however, is pretty generous (if not a marketing ploy to get us to buy something). However, again, it's completely optional. I've played this game for a long while, had tons of fun, and not spent a dime!It's a Koren-made game, so there are some cultural references that you might not get if you're from another country, but the story and life of this game world will keep you chuckling, while at the same time drawing you deeper into mythos. You won't be disappointed if you're a gamer who values a great storyline as well as great gameplay mechanics!BIG recommendation from me! This game rocks!			"

												Best combat in any game marketed as an MMO I've ever experienced. Too bad it's managed by Nexon. Certainly worth a few months of your time, but remember the golden rule: NEVER spend money on Korean MMOs.			"

												I’ve been experimenting with the MMO genre lately. Most games I tried would procure a couple hours of fun after which I would quit. The reason for this: I felt like I was wasting my time. Contrarily to popular belief, Video games don’t usually give me that feeling. I needed something better than your typical MMORPG with a failed plot and little replay value. I needed a game that felt... I don’t know, like more than just a game. I found it. If the title didn’t give it away, I’m talking about Vindictus. Vindictus is an MMO that combines your typical RPG experience with a hack n slash feel, impressive visuals, lush and varied environments, a good story and an insane replay value only to name a few aspects. The community is amazing and the huge 18 player team battles with make this game seem unreal. In short, Vindictus is exactly what I was looking for. Vindictus is more than just a game.Vindictus runs on Valve’s source engine. Nexon (the studio behind the game) probably picked this engine to allow extreme interaction between the player and the world. Past games like Half-Life 2 and Portal can testify to the awesomeness of this engine. Needless to say Nexon made a great choice. Contrarily to most online multiplayer games, the world behind Vindictus actually feels alive. Picking up, throwing and smashing objects around feels perfect. When I throw a wooden barrel into the ocean, the barrel sinks then resurfaces and floats. IT DOESN’T DISAPPEAR. The physics engine is out of this world.The story is interesting enough. There are a couple cut scenes coupled with dialogue that may or may not entice you to read more of it. I have to say that the dialogue is actually pretty good and I often find myself wondering what’s going to happen. This is one of the rare aspects that Vindictus does not excel in. Moving on to the online part of the game, it‘s crazy how fun this game is to play with friends. Before starting it, I suggest you find 2 or 3 friends and start it all together, because all 3 of you will have a blast. Everything in this game can be done in teams, and as I said earlier the big team battles against seemingly invincible bosses are something you will be talking about in the morning.    Earlier I mentioned the environments. They’re epic. I mean really epic. You go from fighting vampires in a pillaged town to fighting mummies on desert dunes only to end up with reapers in a dark crypt. Jungles, deserted plains, tropical islands, ancient ruins; this game has it all. The monsters themselves have amazing sprites that could easily be compared to a triple A game such as Skyrim. Each mission ends with a boss fight, usually a great boss fight. Beating bosses is easy once you understand their attack pattern, at least early on. All you Sword Art Online fans will feel right at home, but let’s not get into that.    Now I think it’s time we talk about the combat. There are about 8 different characters in Vindictus, each one having a unique and interesting combat style. Whether you want to shoot from a distance, cast fireballs, or leap into the fray with a giant pillar, there’s a combat style for you. My first character was Vella. A girl that dual wields either swords or chain blades. The former allows you to slice n dice from close range while the latter allows you to rip through enemies from far away. Every character has 2 weapons like this. Considering this, we can safely confirm that you can fight through this game in 16 different ways. I used twin blades with Vella. Once you’ve chosen a weapon. You can unlock abilities both passive and active as you progress through the game. For instance, when you start playing, the shift button activates a dash. Level up enough and you can unlock the Slipaway ability, letting you jump back while cutting anyone around you for some very handsome damage. Double tapping shift will activate this and pressing it a third time will throw in a dash to the combo. Very useful for escapes, making Vella an agile fighter if need be (extremely useful against bosses). Other abilities, such as Cross Cut will let you run right through an enemy attack if timed perfectly.Character customization is always important in an RPG. Vindictus once again makes me drool with insane skins and armour, making this dark themed, possibly depressing concept into something quite enjoyable to look at. This being said, many decorative aspects of the game require that you pay, but its player versus monster nature makes these things not an issue.There is PVP, although you will have to play for a while before experiencing it. All I can say for now is that I have noticed a rock paper scissor effect between certain characters. If you’re looking for a PVP heavy game, Vindictus is not what you’re looking for.Continuing on a sour note, you need a computer with dedicated graphics and a broadband internet connection to pull this game off. Or else the lag will probably kill it for you. Reflecting on this, anyone who doesn’t have dedicated graphics should probably not be on Steam, although you can play Vindictus without a Steam account. I haven’t covered everything, because that would take forever, but I feel as I’ve given you enough that you can decide whether or not to give this game a shot. Good luck!           "

												The game just feels wrong. It has a Guild Wars combat system, but the controls feel clunky at best. The game needs a bit more polishing.

												I defintely recommend this game if you like infinite dungeon crawling, epic action-y fighting, and fine tuned character skill development! Vindictus caught my attention because of it's physics system, as you can pick up objects in your environment and throw them at enemies, or pick up enemies themselves in some cases and throw -them-! Almost everything and anything can be picked up and used as a weapon (no exaggeration there), and in the hands of a capible warrior, even a BROOM becomes the doom of some poor monster! You won't be disappointed in the dungeons themselves, as traversing destructible environments, traps, and finding secret treasures will keep you excited (until you realize that the dungeon batches are pretty much copy-paste) and the enemies know and use this environment to their advantage (archers will shoot the supports to bridges to make you fall, enemies will attack destructible pillars to make them fall on you, etc). The game is made with the Source Engine, so it really hits home how diverse this software can be when used in game development (it surprized me that a company could use the SE like this)!Each dungeon has a ""batch"" of levels that look the same pretty much every time, and the enemies in these batches are pretty much copy-paste but with different colors and sizes. That's kind of the story with most MMORPGS, but in most cases you won't notice as you're mowing down a crowd of them with your sword, spells, arrows, or large blugeoning instrument of your choice. The monsters are pretty much straight forward in most cases, but the bosses are a big highlight of this game. Most of the time they're massive, deadly, and faster than you are. If you don't keep on your toes, dodge, and attack at the right moments, then you're toast. It's intense and epic when going against those bosses! Unlike other Free-To-Play games, Vindictus has a VERY in-depth character skill system, where AP (Action Points) are used to level certain skills and in-game gold is used to buy new skills (no real money required at all). While choosing a class confines you to what kind of skills you can unlock, that's where the confinement ends. From there, you can level skills at your choosing, and really define your character. You'll just have to see for yourself just how many passive and active skills you can level up, because I can't list them all! To go against these tough enemies, you gotta have the right gear. Vidictus has a fully-fledged Market and Crafting system for just that. Crafting is pretty straight-forward (ingredients + other stuff= Product), but the Marketplace is really polished to serve the players the best it can. I can't quite remember how it's done, but the Market will make sure that no one can buy-up all of a certain item and resell it at an outragious price, so it makes sure that everything is balanced and fair (just like in a real economy). Making gold in dungeons is really well-balanced, and if you look under every pot and destroy everything in sight, gold will start falling out of the cracks! If you're really economically-minded, then making your first million in this game should be a breeze. Of course, there are options to buy weapons, gold, and other bonuses within the game with REAL money, but it's all completely optional. What's better, is that some of these items are given away to the player periodically by the game itself (holidays, special event prizes, etc) but will usually expire quickly. The fact that you can have access to these items occasionally, however, is pretty generous (if not a marketing ploy to get us to buy something). However, again, it's completely optional. I've played this game for a long while, had tons of fun, and not spent a dime!It's a Koren-made game, so there are some cultural references that you might not get if you're from another country, but the story and life of this game world will keep you chuckling, while at the same time drawing you deeper into mythos. You won't be disappointed if you're a gamer who values a great storyline as well as great gameplay mechanics!BIG recommendation from me! This game rocks!			"

												First of all, you need a decent computer to be able to enjoy this game, maybe more than decent. Second, the game is Free-to-play!!!The graphics are wonderful, (even though it's been quite a while since its first release). Gameplay is detailed, deep, sophisticated yet simple enough for any newcomer to easily learn and adjust. The story is pretty interesting, nothing too breath-taking, but a good story nonetheless (Still in progress on my end).6 different characters to choose from, all gender locked, but each being very unique and specialized for certain gamestyles. Each character has 2 unique classes that doesn't require the player to be limited to choosing one of the two. The player can level up both of the character classes with no penalties whatsoever(aside from spending the gold they earn from quests).The characters can be easily customized without overdoing the options of what can be done(face/nose/cheeks/chin/etc), but the downside is that the variety of the customizations are limited unless a purchase(with real money) was made to be given access to the extra variety. This doesn't mean the player must do make a purchase, it's simply a choice of how far will the player go to give their character ""the look"" that they are going for. Only the customization variety is limited including equipment color changes, no equipment is limited exclusively to pay-to-get. Any item someone has, you can obtain through luck, determination, and having the materials needed to craft the item in game.Overall, great game, and even what's even better is that it's FREE! Wonderful game to experience, it isn't bug free, no game is. The boss fights are intense and sometimes call for having a group to help deal with it. Game difficulty can also be adjusted before each quest(at the docks/questboard). Chances are you won't regret trying this game out.			"

												Brutal. Elegant. Over-Powered. Those are the three words I would choose to describe this amazing game. There is nothing more satisfying than grabbing some random object lying around and proceeding to throw down on a room full of baddies with nothing more than a piece of pottery and your winning smile. When you're finished decimating the basic mobs with stone-ware, you can grab your primary weapon and wipe out a wave of middle-management in a flash. Vindictus is co-developed and published by Valve, Nexon, and Neko. I consider it T for Teen or PEGI 16.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The action is the main thing that makes this game fun and complex. The attacks look as though there is force put in to it, and it shows when they hit an enemy, with a satisfying crunch, thud, or smack.Other parts that make it good, is the stable player turnover rate, community, look, and hardware inclusivity: The game has different towns/cities that cater to the different level tiers. This keeps newcomers (and the server) from drowning in a sea of Lv. 50-100 players that have been there since opening day. The game has been slowing down in growth since opening, but such is the life of MMOs. It still has new players joining in, so please don't be too discouraged by the amount of old vs. new players.Every player I've met through the game is either behaves professionally (which can get annoying for all involved if you just want to kick a Fomor around and they're already at the end of the stage) or they are there to have fun and sometimes you will wind up in a Gnoll-kicking fest that finishes with a new addition to your friend list.If you didn't look at the trailers, or you just glanced over them, look again. That is how this free game looks. I am not kidding. It looks like that. All the enviroments, be it ruins like the pyramids in ""The Mummy"" or jungles like Skull Island from the newer King Kong film, it's there and it's pretty and scary as all get out.By hardware inclusivity, I mean that the settings on this game allow for a fairly wide demographic of players to run the game well. I have played this game on a laptop. It ran on low and fast settings, but it ran without lag. I have seen it on high, where it doesn't play on my laptop. but it looks great. It still looks good, but it's like PS2 high end graphics vs. PS3 high end graphics. There is a difference.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Alright, I've covered the good points, the charming smile of the game. Now it's time to inspect the sweaty, shirt-staining armpit.There are four major bad points to this game: The waiting/dedication, the crashes, the customer support, and the character creation.Waiting kills a fast-paced action game like swimming backwards kills a shark. It's confusing and no one knows quite what happened, but the shark is sure as heck dead. Action games, especially well-made ones, are filled with inertia. Having a long wait time to enter the game, I can be okay with that. I don't particularly like staring at a screen and having to focus on what I'm not doing or what I could be doing, but I'm okay with it at the start-up. Having a long wait time inbetween NPC interactions, or travelling between two connected zones? That's a problem. And this waiting creates another issue, dedication requirement. You need to set aside time for this game, nothing less than an hour to feel any kind of worth for the long loading times. And that's a sensation that drives me away.The crashes come out of nowhere and are as violent as they are fast. I've had the game crash in the middle of town, after pressing ""start game"", while in a boss fight, while in an empty dungeon, while entering the game proper, etc. All that time waiting and loading and BAM. You're out faster than you can say Vindictus. I am not sure if this is a common occurence to players everywhere, but it has consistently happened to me regardless of internet strength.The customer service is terrible. If you report these crashes, you don't get a response and sometimes the support site itself is down, giving you only an email address to throw your plaintive cries towards. Any response to customer dissatisfaction is to throw in-game baubles, sweet loot, or exp boosters. It might have a bit more sentiment attached if Nexon didn't shell out these packages like a drunk guy shelling out dollar bills at an exotic dance club, giving you all these things if you were kicked off the game for no reason, or you haven't been back in a while, like most people who get frustrated with a frequently crashing game. It feels at best like a bad Oprah therapy session, where you're still depressed, but now you have a brand new Toyota. At its worst, it feels like hush money or a desperate plea to give the game just one more chance.The character creation looks really expansive until you realize that most of the options are hidden behind the glass wall of pay-to-win. All the buyables in the game are limited to cosmetics and boosters, but the game dangles them in front of you straight from the get-go. And, as in all of Nexon's games, the class choices are fairly varied, but you can't change gender in any of them. Luckily, there have been baby steps towards fixing this, namely by making two seperate classes that are basically the same (Lan and Vella as examples).~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In summary, though it has some fairly major bad points, the game is still free, and if you can get it to work, it's insanely fun. For a similar, but not as flawed experience, check out Dragon Nest, which I consider the E10+ (or PEGI 12) version of Vindictus.			"

												I have to be honest. My initial thoughts of this game were pretty negative.  There are some things that I do not like about the game, but the positives far outway the negatives.  I'll start with the negatives. I'm not a fan of the way the story progression is set up. It's like a flashback to an old school RPG before character animations and voice acting was implemented.  I don't like having to read the dialogue from a tiny box next to a portrait of an anime character.  It can be pretty boring... which is why I have almost no idea what the storyline is about. It just doesn't keep my attention, so I end up skipping a lot of the dialogue.  Also, the character customization is extremely basic.  I expected quite a bit more, but was disappointed. It is possible to get better hair cuts, costumes, dyes, and armor, but it will cost you quite a bit of real life money. Needless to say, I'm not interested in paying money for in game underwear.  Lastly, I don't much care for the way the quests are set up.  It's not open world, which is kind of lame, so questing is different in this game. Each battle (this is what the quests/missions are called in game) is like a mini-dungeon that is replayable. It's replayable because each battle has a list of achievement-like side quests.  These reward you with gold and experience when you complete them.  So this is a completionists worst nightmare, or wet dream... I could see an argument for both.  None of the battles are too tough, even on hard mode, to finish alone, but the raids require a little more muscle.  So the positives.  The game looks decent enough. The graphics aren't spectacular, but they did a good job on the characters' looks. Especially the female characters. They look pretty damn great. The female characters' costumes would fit perfectly into every nerdy teenage boy's hentai fantasy.  The combat is pretty cool.  It took a little getting used to initially, but once I got it down, I liked it. It's a little big buggy at times when it comes to the dodging and parrying against enemies, but still a lot of fun. It sort of reminds me of Dynasty Warriors back in the day.  You know, before they made 57 remakes.  Overall, it is a pretty fun game. Definitely worth trying if you're even a little bit interested. Plus, its free. How the hell can you pass up trying a free game?  GET THIS GAME.			"

												Best combat in any game marketed as an MMO I've ever experienced. Too bad it's managed by Nexon. Certainly worth a few months of your time, but remember the golden rule: NEVER spend money on Korean MMOs.			"

												i like the game, but the intro is kind of stupid. I don't like the whole go into the market but the market is just a picture with more pictures.  If it were an open world game that would be great. but it feels small. the character creation is very lack luster. I love the combat, but it gets dull. Graphics are pretty good but i think that's the highest compliment i can give in this review. the armours are confusing, like usually you get more armour as you level up and it makes you feel awesome, with this you can get armour off the bat in the trading post. There's no level system i think so it gets more weird. crafting is weird too, you get different coloured armor each time? wtf? anyway, I don't get the gaining of weapons either. usually like i said, you have a few weapons you can't use because you don't have the level for it, but i think most of the weapons you just have to buy them. I'm also the kind of guy who thinks games that are too japanese-y or anime'ish sucks and is quite annoying. I really hate the stupid cheesy child like actions and it just really bothers me. I want a mature game that has nice armour, nice weapons, good graphics good gameplay, open world, no pictures when i go into a damn market, the npcs are not pictures either. so far my only hope is black desert but that's korean so of course every character is gonna look like every single asian person out there that has been plastically altered. and the hair is really weird too i have never seen so much glowing things before. and most of the character animations looks like it came straight out of power rangers. game is not optimized either, i have a pretty beefy pc and the game just kind of sucks with using what is given it. OH also, the freaking hair styles and♥♥♥♥♥♥you have to buy? wtf? i don't want my character to look like a ♥♥♥♥ing girly dude, so i have to buy hair styles. okay, sometimes that's fine, but what am i supposed to do with a character that looks like 12 years old but has the hair style of someone more mature? seriously, and the kai character is freaking cool because i love archery and archers are my favourite, it's by far my favourite class but why do i have to look like a mix of aragorn and some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag. ending comment:good combat, okay graphicsbut confusing game and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ character models and really stupid animations and over all just confusing and annoying game. not open world so it feels super small like c9 but c9's combat is far more enjoyable than vindictus. I wouldn't play this game unless i had seriously no other game to play than this. i mean like, i could have the most boring game out there and i would play that. or maybe not that far but. yeah. i really don't understand why asian people are so obbessed with teens and childish bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ grow the ♥♥♥♥ up and make a mature game. and if it's not asian devs then seriously get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together.

												Pros:-variety of characters: each character plays very differently-character customizability: character creation and in-game items-combat system is very fluid-graphics have held up nicely over the years-boss battles actually feel like boss battlesCons:-repetitive enviroments for 1st season-lots of grinding (levels 1-60 go by pretty fast; 60+ starts getting grindy)-game can be pay-to-win(e.g. AP being sold in the cash shop)overall the game can be pretty fun.

												Vindictus is a game sort of like Warframe if you've played the game, you would already know the feel of a third person action RPG. While Warframe is set in the future, Vindictus is set in medieval times. It has a varierty of characters for different people with different tastes, there's a tank named Karok who can protect his team and also has a decent amount of burst damage, a mage named Evie who can both do insane damage with a scythe & offensive magic while also helping the team with buffs and revives, then for those who prefer a mix of both defensive and offensive there's Fiona, a wielder of sword and shield who can block the enemy's attacks and send forth her own counter attacks to deal out decent burst damage, then comes Kai, an archer who prefers kiting the enemy rather than going ham who wields both rapidfire Crossbow like gun, and a slower but more hard hitting bow which can be transformed in the middle of combat from a longbow to a shortbow whether you need better fire rate or more range and can find the enemy's weakpoint and use it to temporarily stun them and deal bonus damage. Then there is Lann and Vella, while both wield dual swords, Lann can wield dual spears, while Vella can wield dual Chainblades (the damn thing has HUGE range) and both can offer different skills while still offer speedy gameplay. Finally there is Hurk, the beserker, he focuses on constant AOE while also using skills to attack endlessly, ignore CC, restore health, and if you have good timing, you can even deflect the boss's attacks and counter attack to CC the boss and deal huge damage. Now some of you may be thinking of the community, but don't fret the community is both funny and helpful by helping new players finish missions which would normally be too difficult to overcome. While others may be too lazy to bother leveling up at such a slow pace, do not even worry about it. You'll get into mid game faster than you will think. The only problem I've had with this game is the constant upgrading of gear and finding the right build paths to maximize overall effctiveness throughout the game as well as the rather ludicrous pricing on premium items as well as the 2x exp VIP bonuses. Overall, I've had a lot of fun in this game and I recommend this for anyone who likes RPG's and can deal with a slow start for a faster paced and challenging mid-late game where personal player skills will be tested.

												If you're an mmo addict or just a fan of the previous MMO, Mabinogi, you may like this, but we are talking about Nexon, the same company that lost the contract on DFO the one game that was just as good as Mabinogi before letting it deteriorate.And purely because Nexon has allowed Vindictus to fall through the cracks like all of the other games they have, I do not recommend it. And before anyone thinks I'm just hating, I'm not. I played mabinogi for 5 years before leaving, after the hackers tore it up. After Nexon took too long to deal with it....			"

												Only played long enough to get to level 3, the game looks GREAT, it really does. But i was immediately put off by a couple of things.Cons: Story Progression is done in a way most MMORPG players are not used to, as in the dialogue boxes and chat with npc's is very different from a traditional MMORPG. This is a detail that i think the veteran MMO players would find slightly frustrating, but maybe they would have the patience to let it grow on them. I however, found it very off putting.Some weapons / classes are only available to certain genders. You pick a base character / hero at the very beginning, and you can tweak them later as far as physical appearance is concerned, and your name of course. But all of them use only one type of weapon, so if you want to use a glaive for instance, you are FORCED to play as a female character. Or if you want to use a great sword, you are FORCED to play a male character. Again, this may not matter for some, but to me  as a Veteran MMORPG player again this was off putting. I havn't even made it past character creation and my freedom is already being restricted? Not a good development choice.Character creation is a bit lacking, there are some features that you can only use by acquiring items from the in game cash shop, and other features are just badly implimented (The sliders for fat/muscle imparticular feel bad / inaccurate)Pros: The game looks beautifulCombat seems pretty fluid			"

The only problem and reason i cant reccommend this to anyone now is mainly because game progression is blocked by massive paywalls, massive grindwalls, and bugs that are major do not get fixed. Up untill the end of season 1 i would have reccommended this game. But since then it has done nothing but plummet into the ""do not play"" zone of video games.			"

												I have to be honest. My initial thoughts of this game were pretty negative.  There are some things that I do not like about the game, but the positives far outway the negatives.  I'll start with the negatives. I'm not a fan of the way the story progression is set up. It's like a flashback to an old school RPG before character animations and voice acting was implemented.  I don't like having to read the dialogue from a tiny box next to a portrait of an anime character.  It can be pretty boring... which is why I have almost no idea what the storyline is about. It just doesn't keep my attention, so I end up skipping a lot of the dialogue.  Also, the character customization is extremely basic.  I expected quite a bit more, but was disappointed. It is possible to get better hair cuts, costumes, dyes, and armor, but it will cost you quite a bit of real life money. Needless to say, I'm not interested in paying money for in game underwear.  Lastly, I don't much care for the way the quests are set up.  It's not open world, which is kind of lame, so questing is different in this game. Each battle (this is what the quests/missions are called in game) is like a mini-dungeon that is replayable. It's replayable because each battle has a list of achievement-like side quests.  These reward you with gold and experience when you complete them.  So this is a completionists worst nightmare, or wet dream... I could see an argument for both.  None of the battles are too tough, even on hard mode, to finish alone, but the raids require a little more muscle.  So the positives.  The game looks decent enough. The graphics aren't spectacular, but they did a good job on the characters' looks. Especially the female characters. They look pretty damn great. The female characters' costumes would fit perfectly into every nerdy teenage boy's hentai fantasy.  The combat is pretty cool.  It took a little getting used to initially, but once I got it down, I liked it. It's a little big buggy at times when it comes to the dodging and parrying against enemies, but still a lot of fun. It sort of reminds me of Dynasty Warriors back in the day.  You know, before they made 57 remakes.  Overall, it is a pretty fun game. Definitely worth trying if you're even a little bit interested. Plus, its free. How the hell can you pass up trying a free game?  GET THIS GAME.			"

												Edit:I might have found a slight workaround for my issue, if you have Vindictus installed go to were it is installed, and create a shortcut from Vindictus.exe (its an application) put the shortcut on the desktop and it SHOULD hopefully work outThe game doesn't work on Windows 8/8,1, or at least for me it doesn't Internet Explorer for windows 8/8.1 already has Adobe Flash Player installedFor some reason the normal Nexon Launcher and the Steam Launcherscan't actually trace this, so they give script errors (for steam)or a unknown network error (for Nexon Launcher)Yet it works 100% fine on windows 7 and below...Oh also Nexon sucks, they are 100% terrible and should be knownas 1 of the worst companies to exsistCome on Korea, get it together (Nexon is a korean company)			"

												Pros:-variety of characters: each character plays very differently-character customizability: character creation and in-game items-combat system is very fluid-graphics have held up nicely over the years-boss battles actually feel like boss battlesCons:-repetitive enviroments for 1st season-lots of grinding (levels 1-60 go by pretty fast; 60+ starts getting grindy)-game can be pay-to-win(e.g. AP being sold in the cash shop)overall the game can be pretty fun.

												Has a great fighting style and easy to follow questline. Definitely recommended if you're willing to slash through dungeons. Some parts of the game may get repetitive but it's all in good fun. Not as P2W as most Nexon games are, eg. Maplestory. - 10 year Maplestory Veteran			"

												My previous review was negative and it remains negative for anyone having the annoying ""BlackCipher"" glitch while using Windows 10. For people like me, I had to revert my Windows back to 8.1 to play, and I know that this sounds insane just to play 1 game. The only reason I did this was I had very high hopes for this game. Was it worth it? Well you probably know the answer to that just by the rating of this review. This game has a lot to offer and I am barely so far scratching the surface for this game. This game feels like a game I would be willing to pay retail price for, but of course it is free. The number one question people always ask though is ""Is it P2W?"" My answer to this is no. The only thing I would recommend paying for is the .99 starter pack for it is one hell of a deal and makes low level leveling easier if you are by yourself. Other then that you can pay for cosmetics and let me just say the cosemetics range from really scimpy or cute to full blown f*cking awesome! So unless you want to pay for some of the costumes this game is fair and balanced in combat. Combat is awesome because I have never met a game where you can just grab a enemy and use the enviroment to kill him. These kills range from Sparta kicking some one of a cliff to body slamming them on a pile of rubble. Think of this game as a beat them up with very hard but rewarding boss fights. The only thing I could say that has been annoying so far is the random bots who stand in town and advertise their account stealing websites. Do not trust these sights because they just hijack your account. These bots are always being activley banned, but not quick enough. Other then that this game is a blast and there is NO reason you shouldn't give it a try! Also last thing is this game is optimized REALLY well. I don't have the best computer but I still get 60FPS on medium graphics, Have fun!Edit: Radi boss waiting times are stupid long. I know this isn't the games fault, but it still sucks.			"

												Idk what's going on, but I can't recommend this game just based on the problems I am having with it. Im running an i7 w windows 10, a 16gb ram and a 960m graphics card. I am way, waaaaayyyy above the recommended specs for this game. Despite that, my first experience with the game is continuous audio glitches, poor framerates that dont change no matter what setting I put it at, rediculously long loading times, and then the game grashing without warning. Ill play with it a bit more as it looks like the game itself is probably decent. But until this is fixed or I figure out whats going on I will have to avoid recommending this game just by the fact that this might happen to others as well.			"

												This game is very addicting and I like the different map layouts.  However I have been noticing more and more bugs with the use of my spellsword.  The space bar would not work and would actually glitch the game where I could not do anything but run around.  The game needs more debugging before updates are released, in my opinion.  However, I do enjoy the storyline and how there is a Main Quest and different Side Quests.  I would reccommend playing if you have a group of friends that you want to play a MMORPG and build a guild with.			"

												So I needed to remake my ""Nexon ID password"" to log in, and after I log in and it looks like everything is fine, I am confronted with a screen that wants me to make a ""secondary passwoird"" and how it's worded, it sounds like it is optional, so I close the window and I'm brought back to the main menu. My first thought was ""Well F2P games can be buggy, maybe it didn't realize that I just wanted to play the game."" So I clicked on start game again, and it brought me to the same secondary password menu. At this point I pressed Alt+F4 to close the game and remove it from my library forever. I would not recommend Vindictus because I don't care nearly enough to make and remember two passwords for a free to play game, and I urge you not to as well.			"

												Edit: 6/4/2014There's been alot of changes since my post in 2012. Most of what I stated before is still somewhat the same, but....Nexon has once again practically ruined a game. Though Vindictus itself is still a load of fun and very skill oriented, Nexon has made some incredibly confusing and worrisome decisions. For one, they totally removed Jumping from the game. Now, Jumping in itself wasn't very well implemented. But instead of fixing it, they opted to delete it completely...which means all of the Season 2 maps that incorporated jumping mechanics, as well as Season 2 enemies that forced you to use Jumping to either kill them or dodge their attacks, have been totally reworked and, quite frankly, boring-ified. Now every enemy, though with different tactics and timing, all are dumbed down and simplified from before. Definitely a bad, bad change in my opinion.Also, as for this game not being Pay2Win... It's slowly but surely becoming exactly that. You can buy cash accesories that give notable bonuses to stats, pets that do the same, and if you want to succeed in very high level play, you're definitely going to need to use a huge amount of ingame currency to strengthen your weapons, and then buy Runes to + them past +6. Infact, you're going to want +10 or higher weapons to be helpful in a group.Anyway, that's my update. This game will forever hold a candle in my heart, but...*sigh* Nexon. Nexon strikes again. I still recommend it, but going higher than level 70 will be...very frustrating for most players.There's a review by v0!dsnak3 that points out other problems perfectly, and ALL not due to the game itself, but because of Nexon being the way they are. Money grubbing event tactics, horrible events in general that focus more on cash players than free players...The list goes on. I suggest reading his/her review, as they nailed it on the head. (They gave Vin a thumbs down, which I have to say I agree with)I'll keep my original review here as well. -------------------------------------------Been playing this game ever since it was released a good 2 or so years ago. It's ALOT of fun, but needs more exposure and advertising! Thankfully they finally brought it here to Steam for more people to enjoy. This Free2Play is centered mostly around dungeons instances. It's one of the rare few F2P games that is NOT Pay2Win!! It's more Pay4Convienience and Pay4Customization. Most of the money you'll probably spend on this game is for ""Inner Armors"" or underwear that give no extra stats, but makes your character look good. There's also hairstyles, tattoos, makeup, facial hair, etc. Admittedly without paying, you will only be able to pick hairstyles, skin color (a large palette), hair color, eye color, and eyebrow color. Still, not bad for a FREE game when it comes to customization.This game, like I said before, is NOT pay2win. It focuses on Skill2Win and Gear2Win. You actually need to learn how your enemies attack, and get a feel for your character. Seriously, try this game out!!			"

												i will start by saying i have been playing this off and on over the past 3-4 years.gameplay wise this is honestly one of the best hack-n-slash out there today.  it has become dated, a few years old now.  runs on most pc's and they have optimized it to a degree.  however a few bugs still persist which may possibly never be fixed (nothing gamebreaking).my biggest issue is the server stability, and times you have to wait when doing anything outside of a battle.  it literally takes up to 1 minute or more on a fiber optic (or equivilant) connection for any action to be completed, be it selling items or storing/swapping/equipping items.  be warned if patience is not something you were born with, this game will likely push you farther away due to this one simple variable.  seeing the server at its most optimal (instant responsiveness when dealing with anything outside of battle) , and then being forced to deal with 1 minute wait times on something as simple as getting rid of trash loot, make doing simple tasks multiplicatively take longer - completely kills it for me.  and it shows in game as well (less people online when server stability is compromised).  i play on East server in NA just so you know.  it is deffinately worth giving a try (assuming you are not in a location that is region locked), so play in the middle of the week if you want the best server stability (maintinence is usually wednesday mornings)reasons to keep coming back:  gameplay mechanics and unique bossesreasons to quit completely:  total lack of server stability the longer the week goes on without maintinence. you have been warned...edit: it honestly seems like random DDOS attacks, because the server lags uncontrollably sometimes at non-peak gaming hours.  patience is still key.edit2: i found out that i had a free internet upgrade the week i posted this review.  come to find out some of the issues very well were on my ISP's end, but when everyone i am playing with is getting the same wait times, you know it's not just you.  this was often the case in the past.

												FIrst off, negative line. One its not better then warframe, Two don't lie its better warframe.Postived line. Its even with warframe fun. Second, it has monster hunter and DW (dynasty warriors) which its way better taste of touch then regular DW. Third, its funny to use object and start throwing at monster also watch kill cam wut u killed it with which good old days where TMNT use trash can as best range weapons. Now I got box to smash monster with XD. Fourth, its fun grabbed few enemies because you can pumbled them with ur fist or break their back. 5th it has realistic touch when your armor dmg which make sense, it really has fun time breaking the monster's armors to make them look stupid at the moment or drive them mad. I recommand best for anyone who have best computer run on this. If your computer able run on this but get so laggy, recommand lower graphic of your options and if it is still laggy change the game's channel where less ppl in the game. This game is really fun and you will find it truely fun when you Co-Op, PvP, and learning to be like hardcore players.			"

												This thing is so poorly optimized its ridiculous. Its nothing like the video describes. The graphics look good but, it looks like they tried to build a game with a low budget, all purpose, graphics engine and it wasn't opitmized at all. The game play wasnt all that captivating either. The quest menu, character menus and NPC interfaces need to be dumbed down to match the simplicity of the actual game mechanics. In the end you get a quest, go to some bulleten board, load up a crappy instanced sailboat. Then you launch into a 10 minute map where you hack slash some generic monsters from an early 90s quake 2 type game and get some loot. All of which is pretty much designed to get you to buy stuff from the cash shop.This does not, as the video says, ""crush"" Warframe by any means.			"

												**Disclaimer: This is going to sound like a negative review, but hopeful.**Vindictus is an awesome MMO that combines the crafting and big bosses of Monster Hunter with the Hack n' Slash style of gameplay. I just wish it was run by a better company...but more on that later. Just bear with me on this one and remember that despite its flaws (mainly Nexon's fault) I still love Vindictus. My advice to you: find a group of friends--maybe even people you know IRL--and plow through the whole thing together. You'll have a blast.I'll save the lengthy review for after the pros/cons.Pros:--Hack n' Slash action combined with Monster Hunter crafting!! All gear is crafted from materials dropped by slain enemies, and the best gear is made from the stuff you collect from [raid] bosses--Player crafting TRULY allows you to make the best gear in the game. There are no raid-exclusive items you can't craft at the max crafting level. However, it is a HUGE time sink to get to max level (I know from experience).--EnCHANTment system adds another level to make your gear even more badass--Raid bosses can be an outstanding team experience--24-player raid battles >:O Vs. DRAGONS >>:O~~~ <--fire breath--Break-off system (detailed above)--Characters <3--Free to play!Cons:--Nexon (see below)--EnHANCEment system risks breaking your weapon!! (up to +10 you're safe) Honestly, I wouldn't view this as a bad thing if item drops weren't so lousy...oh yeah, the drop rate!--Drop rates are complete BS (i.e. 1/1000 chance of getting a rare drop from most raid bosses and remember crafting is drop-dependent!)--Stats beat skill (with the best gear anyone can be god-like)--VERY MUCH pay to win :( Although you can still have an enjoyable time F2P--Peer-to-peer connections make everybody unhappy (if host's internet sucks)--THE GRIND!!Neutral:--No open-world--Missions are pretty repetitive--Inflation means the market sucks--BotsA word on Nexon:My fellow reviewers have said Nexon makes EA look good. Their customer support is almost non-existent, the servers are run by hamsters and yes sometimes one of those hamsters dies (which explains the random disconnects encountered quite frequently), and yes some of the bugs which were around from the very beginning still have not been fixed. I've been playing since the open beta so I can confirm that last one...some game company seriously needs to forcibly acquire Vindictus and bring out its full potential! I'm looking at you NCsoft/ArenaNet!!The gameplay is fantastic. If you like the hack n' slash genre you will love Vindictus. Adding to your basic combos is your secondary weapons (spears, chain hooks, etc.) which fulfill a support-type function on missions. Spears can be used to stagger the boss or break-off certain parts of the boss' armor/weapon/body. Chain hooks are primarily used to slow down or entirely restrict the movement of the boss allowing your party to lay on some serious hurt or giving your spear-throwers an easy shot for that break-off. Going into more detail on the break-off system, some bosses have one or more specific areas you can attack and, after repeated successful blows, break off in order to obtain a special material (i.e. one boss is a mammoth and you can break off its tusks--a vital material for that boss' weapon/armor set) and other bonuses (i.e. destroying a part of their armor causes them to take more damage, and destroying their weapon removes certain attacks from their moveset or simply weakens their attack damage/range overall).Missions are done in the following structure: You get on a boat setting up all the criteria (mission, difficulty, number of players, etc.) which is Lobbying 101 and then, when you and your party are ready (you can solo), a loading screen takes you to the dungeon. Your objective is to kill all enemies in order to progress to the boss room where you're in for a truly EPIC fight. Each boss has its own attack pattern and skills and presents a unique challenge in its own right. Raid bosses are even more amazing--terrifying and powerful both in size and the challenge they present. Some require teamwork, which is lousy if you've got a troll or newbie on your team, but worthwhile and fun if everyone is informed. Some of the things Nexon has done with these raid bosses are truly brilliant :D In one fight you push rocks over a ledge to knock out a mammoth for a few precious moments while your teammates below pile on the damage, and in a different fight you throw holy spears at the feet of an angry demon god-cow-thing in order to pin him in place. In another you fire ballistae at a dragon IN-FLIGHT in order to shoot him out of the air!! SERIOUSLY HOW COOL IS THAt?!Additionally, there is both an enCHANTment and enHANCEment system. The enHANCEment system is your basic weapon/armor upgrades from +1 to +15 which improve the item's stats. The enCHANTment system is more in-depth. First you must find the specfic scrolls you are looking for and the necessary materials for enchantment (these materials are all hard to come by, but if you are aiming for the end-game you'll put in the effort). There are prefix and suffix scrolls meaning each piece of gear can have two enchantments.Oh yeah, and people say the story is good, but I must not have been paying attention. There are some pretty memorable characters, although I'm glad Ellis is dead xD			"

												After about five hours of actual playtime, I can say several things about the game: First, it has a lot of potential. Second, it doesn't use all of it. Most of the actual mmo part didnt really stand out to me, I never saw a party appear on the board, I never felt connected to other players. Gameplay was fun at first, then slowly became repetitive. Go to ruins, fight same generic monsters, fight slightly different boss, feel like you're missing something the whole time. Maybe you'll find it interesting, and it's a way to pass the time for sure, but as a main MMO to invest hours in, I don't recommend it.			"

												This game is actually pretty good for an MMO. Previously I had had problems with the game starting altogether, but of course that was about 2 years ago which was probably my bad. But continuing all around it's a good game I enjoy it I would have to give it a 9/10 at least I found it to be impressive for a FTP a couple things are a little wonky but I hope that they get fixed in the near furture. For example I was playing with a friend and he decided to give me some stuff and when I went to open the gift in the mailbox (note that I was on channel 117 on the east coast servers) the entire game just crashes on me and the gift file that was sent to me still remains corrupted as of right now (I say this because when my friend tried to cancel it gift it crashed his game as well may of been server issues, it may of been client issues, I don't really know right now but I can say for sure it was irritating). Now that may be irritating to deal with but seriously it's an MMO, since when have MMO's ever been perfect there are always going to be problems with the game that require constant patches and updates in order to make sure people actually play it and don't get frustrated and just quit. That's especially true when with games such as this one, where it's a constantly updating game which is good in some cases but bad in others. Over all with the ocasional glitches and what not it is a really good Free to Play game that is well worth the time (even though I haven't spent alot of time on the game), again I would give this a 9/10 because it's still has it's bugs which downgrade the games quality but doesn't downgrade it enough for it to be a complete waste of coding.On a side note, if you have a really bad computer that can't run high quality games such as World of Tanks, Red Orchestra 2 or any high graphics and processor intensive game (my laptop for example HP Pavilion G62 running at 2.13 GHz in processor speed with 4 GB of RAM and an Intel intergrated graphics card) then do exercise some caution with the game and make sure you have your game settings set down to minimum if your computer is like mine because if you don't have the bare minimun requirements, then good luck playing it but for me if I set all my settings to low then the frames cap at about 67 FPS and mediate at about 55 FPS which is really good I might add. Even then putting you settings on low, the game still looks really good. So deffinetly check to see if you computer or laptop is able to run it and if so have fun gamming cause I know what I'm going to be doing a lot this summer after getting of work....dungeon raids with friends.

												I Have Been Playing this game since CB and its fun and all till you get to level 70+ and look at other people gear and say♥♥♥♥♥♥.my stuff sucks, which is probably true. due to the fact that most level 70 boats require you have 16+ attack which is bascally un-attainable unless you are lucky to get a +15 weapon. with that said i will say this.          High level weapons essentially unattainableFor people without a pathological MMO farming disorder, that is.I mean, fragments being hocked for 100M+ gold is not a realistic goal to set in a game, especially one as inherently repetitive MMO. Who has Skeleton weapons, for example, that require x3 Bark No.1 frags per item to craft -- a boss that takes 20-30 minutes to fight with a decent damage-dealing team of 8, has a drop rate <1% (NB: divided by the number of party members) and can only be run once per diem?? Impossible / insane / an hero.The catch-22 of requiring high level weapons to combat end game boss, yet the materials for said weapons being dropped by these very bosses(s), is surplus in its rëtardation.The only hope is that they patch some of these materials into the shop (for seals) as they recently did the Ikrium frag and Alteron tooth... Failing that, Vindictus is a 'play to lv70 and un-install' MMO.But that doesnt take the joy of the game away as you can join a guild and play with them in these boats and farm together etc which improves the experience alot because this is not a solo freindly game.Closing this off: VINDICTUS IS FUN			"

												I'll give it some credit. The combat is nice to begin with, but its not when the game is such a grindfest you play for hours and get no where at all. I orginally downloaded this game from nexus, which is why I have so little play time through steam, after a long break from the hack and slash that it is, I decided to go back to it since I saw it was on here. So I grabbed it and enjoied about the first 35-40 minutes. After that there's almost nothing to do, because the fun fast pace action game you started playing ends up farmville in 30 minutes. I will admit that the paying options do not really affect gameplay and are all vanity items, like raindbowed hair colors, armor that looks nice but is just as bad as anyone elses, etc. at least the microtransactions are fair, and the combat is pretty great for a free game. But i just cant recomend this game to anyone unless they plan on sinking hours and hours of time per map to get one rare drop just to trade it into the commander and move on with the game,			"

Instead, hop straight on to US West server, good connection, lots of people and their market is booming.Pros- Outstanding story line- Plenty of different armours to aquire - Same with weapons- Bosses / Raids- Each boss has a different attack pattern, keeping you on your toes.- Always this feeling of ""What's next?"" - Combat is FLAWLESS- Not really heavy on your connection because when you start a dungeon, it runs off of your connection (you're the host) so if you have good internet you'll never lag, besides joining other peoples partys where the host has a bad connection (not the game's fault though)Cons- Have to pay for more storage space- No bank (besides guild storage and you have to pay 300k to make a guild)- Combat skills can be confusing, I feel as how they explained the skills is pretty confusing (you will get the hang of it eventually though, just a pain to start out with)- Leveling things such as tailoring, armoursmithing etc can be pretty grindy, even for someone like me who absolutely lives for the grind.- Not exactly beginner friendly, not too many tutorials and stuff in game to help the new players (but, you will get a hang of it eventually if you just stick with it).All in all, this game is very enjoyable 8/10.

												A little rough coming in but people are more than willing to explain things. ""Pay to win"" doesn't apply since even if you buy good gear with real money its on a time limit and having good gear doesnt change the game mechanics. After level 40ish bosses get hard and having a good party becomes helpful.			"

Its all about convience if you pay. *Warning* if grinding is not for you then dont play this game or the rest of the following -grinding ofc-dying, dying, dying and dying from one shots...well get used to it-Grinding for money-Grinding so you won't die^<--i highly recommend you do this if you play this game-Your a solo person<---you will die if you are a kirito wannabe... for the sake of the world's accumulating salt join a party-Loot % you will cry every time you finish a 10min dungeon and get trash and more trash, and eventually enough trash to fill the Pacific ocean-Quick to rage<---most important you must be patient for about 300hoursishh... *meh*Sry english isnt first language			"

												I'll give it some credit. The combat is nice to begin with, but its not when the game is such a grindfest you play for hours and get no where at all. I orginally downloaded this game from nexus, which is why I have so little play time through steam, after a long break from the hack and slash that it is, I decided to go back to it since I saw it was on here. So I grabbed it and enjoied about the first 35-40 minutes. After that there's almost nothing to do, because the fun fast pace action game you started playing ends up farmville in 30 minutes. I will admit that the paying options do not really affect gameplay and are all vanity items, like raindbowed hair colors, armor that looks nice but is just as bad as anyone elses, etc. at least the microtransactions are fair, and the combat is pretty great for a free game. But i just cant recomend this game to anyone unless they plan on sinking hours and hours of time per map to get one rare drop just to trade it into the commander and move on with the game,			"

												To anyone wanting to venture in, the game's difficulty ramps up incredibly at around level 35. And then once you hit level 60 the only way to survive in the game is to learn how to fight against massive raid bosses and do very difficult ""hero"" mode battles for gold and drops to sell or use. This is not a game for the casual player. If you don't want to take the time to learn how to fight enemies and deal with all the losses that come before the one success that leads to successive successes then don't bother with this game.The game is free to play but there is a little item shop as well. PvP is all pay to win and it's not even a crucial part of the game. But to PvE efficiently you will at either have to be very lucky with RNG enhancing and enchanting or be prepared to unload your wallet for NX points to get at least +10 on your weapons and enhance items to sell.Overall, it's the one MMORPG that I will actually recommend to people because of the nature of the gameplay. It's action based and not click and wait. You have to be smart and learn when to attack enemy mobs and when to run and reposition and think ahead to what skill you need to use to avoid being hit. The problem increases against the higher level bosses and solving those mental puzzles is what makes the game very fun when you can feel proud of your achievement in predicting and reacting correctly.

It has class based combat and skill leveling system, endless weaponry, and the line between people who pay and people who dont is blurry at the worst.			"

												Vinductus is a fun, action packed, mmo that you can play with your friends for hours. The world is a dark place filled with monsters and little hope. To start off you must choose from one of five characters: Kai - ranger, Karok - brutish offensive tank, fiona - the defensive tank, lann - using dual weapons for lethal combos and evie the mage.Over all this is an extremly fun game and since it's free to play i reccomend giving it a try. The game does get a little repetetive especially since you have to repeat some of the same quests over and over for different tasks though thats the only downside I see.There is a level system, 70 being the highest and you achieve AP through battlequests (dungeons) that you use to upgrade your skills.

												The gameplay is really good but the overall production of the game is shabby, generic, and uninspired. While I wouldn't reccomend people play this game for extended periods of time, I DO reccomend you download this, play the tutorial, get blown away by the gameplay and the graphics and then uninstall. That's pretty much what I did.			"

												For a f2p Nexon game running on the Source Engine, it's pretty good. Minus the Valve logic (aka. impossible physics) and bugs every now and then, its gameplay is fast and engaging and just might keep you coming back for more. Especially if you're partial to Source games and get a kick out of accidentally achieving the impossible. Dungeons are best raided with a party but soloing is also very rewarding.6/10 on my list of best hack and slash RPGS.			"

												I played this before it was released on steam, but I would like to say that this was one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. Amazing character graphics and scenery. All of the different Characters allow a variety of fighting styles to choose from and it always adds a bit of a nice diverse feel to it. And the best part is, its completely free! I haven't gotten as far as I wish I could in this game yet but if you like Dragn's Nest, you will love this game(i like this more than DN to be honest:P). But this is a must play game.			"

												In this free-to-play game, you can purchase bikinis and underwear (at around US$10) for your female character to run around in while she slaps a gnoll against a wall and then drives her elbow in with crushing force.While that sounds like a nice beat'em-up thing to do, the Korean grind seeps in as you repeat missions to gain experience or objective points to unlock the next mission. In a given location, the missions themselves repeat the same maps except in different orders and arrangements. Also, a lot of the interesting skills and mechanics are at levels that are many hours away.The Source engine graphics look pretty and the physics lead to amusing sights. Not so amusing are the times when item drops glitch under the ground or when the frame rate takes a dive when a group of barrels are smashed simultaneously.Still, the thrill of defeating monsters is great, especially with a party. And you get to have a sword-&-shield woman kick a kobold in the face with thunderous impact.			"

												Having played Vindictus before it was even released on steam, I can say that this is a very good, and well made MMO. I highly recommend trying it. The main complaint is the repetitiveness of it, and I can't argue with that. It has a lot of repetition. Nexon attempts to change it up, by changing certain things of certain features during certain parts of the game, and all in all the game can be VERY enjoyable.  The main feature of this game, that brings most of my interest into it, is that it is not the monotonous ""Click 1 to cast spell, and wait for character to do it, then click second spell"" type game, that most MMOs are now a days. This was also my main praise for Maplestory as well. That it didn't use the boring MMO-type way of fighting. Some call it ""Real-Time"" fighting. It is probably the most appropriate word for it. Another feature I really enjoy about this game, is that you can't really screw up your stats. Due to the skill ""meditation"", even if you put skill points into the wrong skill, you just have to wait about a week or so, and you simply GAIN skill points. That's right folks, in this game you can simply GAIN skill points just by having a character made. You don't even need to be online. So skilling your character is a LOT less stressful! But yes, Vindictus is a very enjoyable game, and I do recommend everyone at least try it.			"

												I've been playing this game for more than 2 years now. Over those years i've learned two things in specific that can make this game dificult or un-attractive for new players.1.The first two boats are pretty boring, the third boat onward it finally picks up.2. You need to find friends. Either from steam or a guild you find in game, make sure you get people to play with.The game itself, I love it. The graphics are nice, the music is amazing. The voice acting could use a little bit of work but meh. The other reason i've loved it is the amount of work required so to say. Its not just a gear2win MMO and ""know your rotation"". You have to be on your toes the whole time. Being able to actually dodge, and not just sitting in one spot, tanking hits and pressing 1-6, really freshens up the expirience.If you've been looking for something good and new (new style that is) come and play, and look me up!Update/Edit: with all the season two updates, this game has in general taken a turn for the better. the new boat system is more forgiving, bosses are getting harder and cooler, gear is badass, Hurk is fun as bawlls. And while I still take a hiatus from the game every so often, something always brings me back no matter how long I stop playing. I dont know if its the game or my guild or the new characters, I feel that coming back everytime speaks volumes for this game.			"

												One of the best action MMORPG I've ever played. The combat mechanics are simple to grasp and yet difficult difficult to master. It truly takes skills to be one of the top players. While dungeon crawling gets tedious due to the large amount of weak mobs, it's the boss where all the fun is at. Every boss is unique in some way, and while the most skilled can solo, it is highly recommended to fight in a party. You think the regular bosses are too easy still? There are raid bosses where they are extremely unique and dangerous requiring parties of 8 (some even 24)!Since I am a fickle player when it comes to real money purchases, I am glad to say like League of Legends (yes, I sometimes play that...), real world money purchases do not extend any further than character ""skins"", inner armour, more inventory space, etc etc. Overall, Vindictus is one of the best, most rewarding, adrenaline pumping games I've ever played.

												Pretty bangin' smash 'em up MMORPG. Runs off source engine, maps are small but load times are usually pretty short. The game has a lot of character to it - its best feature. Classes are really fun to play. The game is originally Korean and is a bit 'kawaii desu' but was ported to American. Really awesome crafting system for armor (and I'd mention armor usually looks pretty sick and unique) and players generally have the option to play solo or with a group. Really under-rated in my opinion. Though the game has a cash shop, its main purpose is aesthetics and health/XP/life boosters. Can be repetitive but generally action-packed though the story could be sharper.			"

												Fun. While most of the character creation process is completely not what I would've had in mind, they made it work. Played well before it was out on steam (Only 3 characters to choose from! It was horrible!). It can get old after about a month of hacking, slashing, and blowing things up. It can be a great game to go solo or team up. The controls are easy to learn but hard to master. Depending on the character they can even be sort of awkward at first. But it doesn't stay awkward.The growing variety of the game has brought me back many times. I've never been one to commit to a game either. But the game has been constantly developed so that definitely makes this game worth a try.			"

												A highly addictive MMORPG that incorporates true hack and slash gameplay to create a unique experience unlike every other MMO outside of Gunz.  Characterization is highly customizable, including and not limited to cash-store items and items found and purchased in-game.  Market for items is fairly standard and also highly robust, meaning story related items can be purchased if you have the gold on you.  Community is fairly nice and well-meaning.  Alot of active players to facilitate anyone looking to teamup and play with other people right from the get-go.  Graphics, story, gameplay and an active community contribute to what is an overall solid game that is more than worth the time to download.  Free to play is probably the biggest draw!			"

												One of the most creative MMOs that I have ever played; the Source Engine physics and interactive, environments, make it one of the best free-to-play games available. Not only can you destroy objects and use them as weapons, but when you take down enemies, you can also pick up their corpse and beat other enemies to death with them. Another feature that makes this game interesting is the interaction with the enemies. In most games when you cut enemies with a giant Cloud-Strife-style broadsword, they keep attacking as if nothing happened. In Vindictus, if you hit them with a giant hammer, they are guaranteed to stagger a bit. Simply put, the physics in this game make it great.On the downside, the game can be very time consuming, especially when you’re trying to craft equipment; it takes several runs of different levels to get all the items you’ll need (and I heard it only gets harder as you reach higher levels).

												My friends used to ask me if they should try Vindictus, seeing as I have 2000+ hours in the game, and as much as I love the game I would tell them not to play it, because Nexon as a company was fairly terrible with it's fan-base, at least in North America. Now lately, I feel that Nexon has changed for the better and we're getting on-time updates and things are actually fun to do, events included, so yes I do recommend this game to anyone who asks, try it out, it is a Fashion Simulator, but its not pay2win innately, there are some benefits of paying, but its more than doable without paying!

												This is by far the best mmorpg I have ever played (not that that is saying much) and I've tried quite a few. The combat is fun, fast-paced, and challenging. The graphics look great and are so well optimized that my dinky laptop with an integrated graphics card can play it. The story and characters are both surprisingly good as well. My only complaint is that it can become fairly repetitive. Even so, the areas and monsters are mixed up often enough to compensate, and that which is being repeated it so good that it is not a big deal anyway.Most importantly, it is free to play so there is nothing stopping you from giving it a try. So do it! :D			"

												I have been playing this game since beta. It has had its ups and downs as many other, or should I say, as every MMO out there. I thought NEXON was not going to try too much on this game until now. NEXON has stepped up their game. New forums mods are always communicating events and many other game related news or issues. Its been two months of nothing but events. content has been coming a bit slow but it is there and its fun. There are more events coming this summer along with new character ""Lynn and more new map content. If NEXON keeps this up this game should flurished and will get the respect it deserves. The action mechanincs is like nothing out there. There are six classes to choose from one coming up to make a total of 7. Each are extremely unique in weapons and fighting style. Do I recomend this game? HECK YEAH!!			"

												Vindictus is a pretty decent game. Not the best fantasy, MMORPG game out there but its ok. Vindictus is just like any other MMORPG game where you reside mainly in the town, journeying to different ""stages"" to complete a mission. I did experience a good amount of lag, low FPS, and crashes but it might just be me. Money is very hard to come by in the beginning of the game and you can buy next to nothing, even from the general merchants! Combat is extremely limited at the  beginning where all you do is swing your swords( Or whatever weapon you chose). One unique aspect that I noticed and reveled in was the ability you had to pick up environmental items and use them as weapons or projectiles, for example you could break a pillar and pick up a rock to throw at the monster. Overall, I would recommend you to try this game to see if its for you.			"

												Just to be clear this isnt an open world game but that doesnt hurt the fact that it is a pretty worthwhile and fun experience. You go through quests like dungeons by going to the town and accepting the quests. Then you go to the docks and find the quest and dock the boat to go to the area. Quests/Gameplay:  As said above you dont find the places like in other games like this, you go to the dungeon specifically with or without people as you can choose as well as the difficulty. Normally though you will have to go back and do these same ones for side quests or just leveling up but eventually as the actual story progresses you will unlock new areas to go to and fight in as well as unlocking the higher difficulty stuff you can go back to after. Later on you unlock the area for raids and such but it is recommended in getting a lot of people with you as later on it is hard to find people to do those raids in.Characters:   As of making this review there are 8 characters (Lynn, Kai, Evie, Karok, Lann, Hurk, Vella, and Fiona). They are all more or less unique and fun to choose from. You have many skills to choose from and can somewhat change the appearence of them. I cant really describe each character as I havent played all of them but some of the characters have 2 weapons to choose from and others do not. You may easily find your play style in one of the characters. Overall I find each to be very helpful in a team.Story:  There is a very good story that is being told as you play. There are currently two seasons of the story. It is very rich in many things and helps you learn how to do things like enhance your items or learn how to do some of the side things like fish. Doing some of these side quests will earn you titles that show off what you did and could do later to enhance your stats or just show off a little. Overall the story is very rich and worthwhile.Free2play:  There are things you may pay for with real money but most of them are just outfits to make the women more naked or the men look weird or pretty nice looking. Its more or less for pets (that help a little) or just to show off. You can go through the game without paying real life money and they have a marketplace for crafting materials and the like to help you craft or just buy whatever with your virtual currency.Overall I recommend this game to anyone who just really wants a simple ORPG to play with their friends or play as a single player game and is tired of the norm of MMOs and wants something different.

												One of the best action MMORPG I've ever played. The combat mechanics are simple to grasp and yet difficult difficult to master. It truly takes skills to be one of the top players. While dungeon crawling gets tedious due to the large amount of weak mobs, it's the boss where all the fun is at. Every boss is unique in some way, and while the most skilled can solo, it is highly recommended to fight in a party. You think the regular bosses are too easy still? There are raid bosses where they are extremely unique and dangerous requiring parties of 8 (some even 24)!Since I am a fickle player when it comes to real money purchases, I am glad to say like League of Legends (yes, I sometimes play that...), real world money purchases do not extend any further than character ""skins"", inner armour, more inventory space, etc etc. Overall, Vindictus is one of the best, most rewarding, adrenaline pumping games I've ever played.

I give this game a 10 out of 10.Some things that make this game unique and fun. They provide three different methods to control your charater. These methods are the keyboard by itself, keyboard plus the mouse or a game controller. Also controls are somewhat customizable. Other random perks are armor crafting, armor upgrading, potion making, high detailed graphics, large raids and enjoyable NPC fights. Several other elements also make the game fun but I want to keep this short.The best part that its FREE! Of course there's special cool stuff you can buy for real money but its not required to play the game. Please tell your friends and come try this game yourself. :)			"

Definately wish another developer/company would come out with a game similar to this without any of this games pitfalls (slightly pay2win, most money items are a gamble, misc bugs like loot falling thru the floor,etc.)			"

												A great game marred by server problems and terrible customer support. The combat is, for the most part, fast and fluid. The different characters offer an excellent spread of combat styles, and each character has two different weapons available which radically change the way you can play with a character. The game has excellent customization options through armor and weapons, enchant scrolls and armor enhancement.Slightly offsetting the game is an economy that is somewhat out of balance due to rampant inflation, a heavy emphasis on pay to win philosophies at the end-game, server problems and abysmal customer support. Bans happen arbitrarily, with no explanation or recourse for those affected. The game primarily revolves around player hosted 4-6 person instances, with larger raids being server hosted groups of 6-25 players. The quality of the host's connection greatly affects the playability of regular instances, and server lag is frequently a source of disruption in raids.Having played the game off and on for nearly three years, it's still a solid hack and slash game, well worth playing but perhaps not worth sinking the fortune (or incredible time investment) it would take to be competitive with the established end-game crowd.

												This is so far the only MMO RPG I can actually stomach because it has a combat system based around actually moving and attacking instead of standing still and hammering keys until you or your enemy drops.It's also radically different from other MMOs in that you go to dungeons usually with only four-person parties. There is no loot or XP theft, XP for every enemy killed is given to all players and everyone gets their own items. Raids boost the cap to 6 or 8 players, but some can be either easy enough to do alone at higher levels or ludicrously difficult even with a full crew. Enemy balance swings wildly between easy and punishingly hard. But at least you never feel like you only lost because you didn't have the right stats - only the hardest raid bosses at the very late part of the game require heavy stat-boosting to break their defense.But it's a Korean game which means lots, and lots, and LOOOOOOOTS of grinding. And the U.S. distributor of the game Nexon is a notoriously poor company, slow to respond to almost every customer support request and always lagging far behind the other releases of the game's updates here in North America. Europe though has a much more competent staff looking after them, lucky them.There is a pay-for-power system of sorts in place in that you pay for items that prevent damage to your equipment when enhancing them. Considering how long it takes to collect as many rare items to make the more powerful gear this was obviously a conscious design decision – it's estimated that the drop rate of the rarest items for making top-tier equipment is below 1%. Needless to say this has led to an in-game economy that is completely broken. Offers for rare items topping 10 million in-game currency are common.But somehow I still keep coming back to this game simply because it's such a well-made combat system that no one who's ever made a MMO RPG has ever apparently even thought to try except Terra. Which I can't stomach for other reasons.			"

												This is by far the best mmorpg I have ever played (not that that is saying much) and I've tried quite a few. The combat is fun, fast-paced, and challenging. The graphics look great and are so well optimized that my dinky laptop with an integrated graphics card can play it. The story and characters are both surprisingly good as well. My only complaint is that it can become fairly repetitive. Even so, the areas and monsters are mixed up often enough to compensate, and that which is being repeated it so good that it is not a big deal anyway.Most importantly, it is free to play so there is nothing stopping you from giving it a try. So do it! :D			"

												Endgame is pay to win if you want to do any damage or be able to board any damn pick up boats. In the beginning you have to wear this ugly inner armor which is basically long underwear, which basically forces you to buy an inner if you're a little OCD like myself, and cant stand things looking awkward. The newest patch fixed the hugeee levling grind and if you are looking for the true fun points of this game... They are transformations into paladin and dark knight, the other one is raiding which is how you will most likely make money assuming you get the rare drops. Botting is pretty prevalent in this game which makes things we need super expensive and a bunch of other things super cheap. If you want to have the most fun with this game, you must join a guild. Even if it is with your own friends. Good game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ managment sums it up. I'm only still playing this guild for my guild, Citadel.			"

												Vindictus is a fun, entertaining hack & slash with memorable bosses and great gameplay. Unfortunately the game falls a bit short in its story, leveling, and high level community.Without spoiling anything, the story is extremely cheesy with unlikable characters who you just grow to hate. There aren't any redeeming qualities about the characters even when the developers try to force it upon you.The leveling gets very grindy really quick, unless you are willing to invest a few dollars into VIP services or you manage to happen upon one from a level up gift / special event.The high level community are pretty toxic, to the point that they won't even consider you if you don't have specific stats for your chosen character. If you didn't place your stats rights you are out of luck unless you are willing to invest some money into AP resets.Other than those fallbacks, the gameplay is still entertaining, addicting and worth the playtime.

												This has got to be one of, if not the best MMO I have ever played. I love how Nexon added as much individualization to their character creation as they did. The only way they could really add to it would be making characters be either gender. I'm not sure where people are getting the Pay to Win style from because with the number of free cash shop items Nexon had given out, I got to level 60 without spending a dime. after that, I only bought cosmetic stuff(inner armor, tattoos, etc) until I hit about lever 65 at which point I bought 1 enhancement rune to try to get a weapon to +10(turned out I didn't need it, so I used it for another weapon).I think the community on this game(or at least 99% of it) is very pleasant. Sure you get trolls and irritating people, but find me any multiplayer game that doesn't have that. I thoroughly enjoy the raids offered, and the graphics definitely don't hurt that. That being said, the lag on here is slightly less than perfect, but that's forgiveable with the graphics and all the other stuff going on. Past the character and skills, the customization is nearly limitless. there are hundreds of armor sets and when combined, leave you with thousands, maybe millions, of combinations to give your character the look you want.If you're on the fence about trying this game, do yourself a favor and go for it. The beginning is a little slow, but that's the way all games are... you have to have time to learn the combat system and all the other stuff before you can take down a dragon with it, after all. On the note of combat system and controls, you can choose between keyboard, mouse, or gamepad(works with PS3/XBOX360 or later controllers) modes. Once you select the one you like most, you can fine-tune it to your ideal setup. My ratings for this game are...Community: 4.75/5Graphics:4-5/5(based on graphics settings, but even lowest are still quite wonderful)Connection:3.75-5/5(depending on host and your individual settings along with device capabilities)Story/Plot: 5/5Character Customization/Skills: 4.75/5Ease of use(to get started): 5/5(starts slow, but you learn all the in's and out's of the game)Overall rating:4.5-4.9/5			"

Other than that, it is two minutes of fighting followed by two plus minutes of tracking down all the drops from thing. Also, it should be noted that the armor is somewhat less impressive with the undergarments on the characters unless you want to spend the real money to not have your longjohns show through everything.Decent for what it is.

												Ok so vindictus is really rewarding in the combat system its fluid, hard, and satisfying, the artistry and overall look of the game is very pretty for a free to  play game along with is interesting enemies and bosses. Bosses the threshold between being new to the game and being a vet of it changes very drastically, I was soloing everything till about lvl 25 and then bosses became incredibly strong and hard to beat unless you have a team in hard mode but normal is still pretty easy. Crafting and money go hand in hand in vidictus you need money to craft but you can sell everything for a lot on the Auction house. The only problem i have with the game is the fact you have to farm a lot of training points and materials and when I mean a lot, I mean an♥♥♥♥♥ton unless you have a group and farm hard mode. Overall the game is pretty the combat is amazing and the difficulty scales fast (which i love :).) I have had a wonderful expierence playing this game and i hope you guys come join me in the chao :)			"

I've seen some bad review for the game like its a cash shop game no I've gotten to max lvl with out buying any thing from the cash shop to win. It has good co-op fun raid bosses the players nice, helpful and most of the time willing to help out. ALSO DON'T FORGET ITS FREE TO PLAY so what do you have to lose give it a try you know you want to.			"

												This is a review coming from someone who's not even level 10 yet, but Vindictus so far is pretty cool. The combat system mimics Spiral Knights in simplicity and puts emphasis on physical character position rather than on stats. It has some very nice graphics and the sound is only vaguely bugged/irritating.On the downside, it feels like I'm doing the same thing rather repitiously during the first several missions - the maps coincide in several places. Some of the controls are rather unintuitive and the tutorial is not particularly useful, either.I would still reccomend trying it since it's free. Haven't tried multiplayer yet so I don't know what that's like.			"

												I'm redoing this review because of yeah, I'm pretty sure Nexon got up off their arses and did something.Everything about this game is near perfect. In order to make an income, you need to collect items and sell them to other players. That leaves you with your own thoughts on, ""If I set this much based on the original value, will someone buy it in the amount of time it is up?"" I have sold several things in few seconds of posting them, due to the rarity item and the cost based on the maximum and minimum. Now that leaves a problem, getting money to do so in the first place, as it DOES take a fee to sell. Farm, or if you can, get a friend to donate money to you. [Option two is limited to those who were led to this game by a friend, or who have a friend who already has a large sum of in-game currency.] And to those complaining about Nexon making you pay for things, they make you pay for cosmetics. They are not needed for the main story, nor are they needed for 90% of the sub-stories. Stop complaining about it, as it is a simple want for the items you are being asked to pay for. Fighting is great, perfect. It is easy at the start but as you get higher and higher into the battle sequences, you find it challenging and you have to work as a team. The community is great, nobody complains from what I've seen, and when it comes to teamwork everyone is top-notch. The graphics are great, but of course that does depend on the strength of your graphics card/computer. I have to set mine to low, but at medium they are what I would say ""High"" for a F2P game. If I were to call this game anything, it would be ""Battle Simulation"". Nexon made this game to focus on breaking the limitations of battle in most MMORPGs, and they did. There is no wait time for skills, well, of course for the ones that do really high damage. But combo's are based on you, added to your timing and precision to dodge and attack enemies while taking little damage as possible is also up to you. The trade could use a few touch ups, along with gold. But mainly, this game is near perfect, and I would reccomend this to anyone.			"

												It'd be a good game if it wasn't an mmo. That being said, it's free so you might as well try it out. Getting through the main storyline won't require any $$$ from you.A lot of the negative things about Vindictus stem from the fact that it's an MMO, because most of the MMO aspects of it aren't great. Such as gearing up, which is a nightmare. Grindfest AND a chance based system? It's a little much and most players won't even bother, leaving those who do feeling superior to the rest of the population. It's a lot more enjoyable when you're with friends who don't judge you based on how much $$$ you spent. That being said, you don't really need good gear to have fun. It's a skill based game, gear is simply there to subsidize a lack of skill. I've seen people solo 8-man lv 60 & 70 (end game) content naked. This fact is the main reason I'm recommending it. That and it's free so even if you don't like it, who cares? Uninstall it and no harm is done. As a side note: some bosses discourage players who stack gear. For an example, arguablly one of the hardest bosses about a year ago, Keaghan, has an attack cap of 13.8k. So all the 20k att the wallet-warriors get screwed. A lot of the newer bosses encourage teamwork over DPS, like Bark No.1. Also, an upcoming boss, the succubus queen, has attacks that ignore defense completely in addition to being unable to revive in any way (even goddess graces, the paid method).The storyline is probably the best I've seen out of a F2P mmo.. ever. They really give all their NPCs a personality and if they die (which some do) you actually feel something. It's too bad the voice acting is terrible, but the way you get quest dialogue 90% of the time is reminiscent of graphic novel games. The graphics are of course outstanding, I don't think screen-shots really do the game justice. You can see your characters breath. If you're in a cold environment you see mist form around their mouth between each breath. If you run out of stamina they get a tired animation. Everything is very fluid and seems natural up until the source engine's clipping issue. If that doesn't bother you than you'll be hard pressed going back to the AAA mmo's with comparatively terrible graphics.I see a lot of reviewers don't mention it, but the soundtrack is absolutely outstanding. It becomes especially apparent in raids. The music really enhances the whole game and I strongly encourage any prospective players to check some of it out on youtube.As for events, the majoritoy of them are quiet silly and some of them really give you some valuable items which you'd normally have to pay a lot of money for. An example of a silly one, is they had a valve cross-over event with TF2 and portal characters making appearances. Which introduced funny titles like ""pwn'd by GLaDoS"" and ..interesting hats like the headcrab. A recent even gave out +10 coupons for free, simply for being logged on.All in all, if you can get past the mmo nasty-ness and nexons continuous attempts to get money out of you, it really is a great game.

												Endgame is pay to win if you want to do any damage or be able to board any damn pick up boats. In the beginning you have to wear this ugly inner armor which is basically long underwear, which basically forces you to buy an inner if you're a little OCD like myself, and cant stand things looking awkward. The newest patch fixed the hugeee levling grind and if you are looking for the true fun points of this game... They are transformations into paladin and dark knight, the other one is raiding which is how you will most likely make money assuming you get the rare drops. Botting is pretty prevalent in this game which makes things we need super expensive and a bunch of other things super cheap. If you want to have the most fun with this game, you must join a guild. Even if it is with your own friends. Good game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ managment sums it up. I'm only still playing this guild for my guild, Citadel.			"

												Vindictus is a fun, entertaining hack & slash with memorable bosses and great gameplay. Unfortunately the game falls a bit short in its story, leveling, and high level community.Without spoiling anything, the story is extremely cheesy with unlikable characters who you just grow to hate. There aren't any redeeming qualities about the characters even when the developers try to force it upon you.The leveling gets very grindy really quick, unless you are willing to invest a few dollars into VIP services or you manage to happen upon one from a level up gift / special event.The high level community are pretty toxic, to the point that they won't even consider you if you don't have specific stats for your chosen character. If you didn't place your stats rights you are out of luck unless you are willing to invest some money into AP resets.Other than those fallbacks, the gameplay is still entertaining, addicting and worth the playtime.

												This has got to be one of, if not the best MMO I have ever played. I love how Nexon added as much individualization to their character creation as they did. The only way they could really add to it would be making characters be either gender. I'm not sure where people are getting the Pay to Win style from because with the number of free cash shop items Nexon had given out, I got to level 60 without spending a dime. after that, I only bought cosmetic stuff(inner armor, tattoos, etc) until I hit about lever 65 at which point I bought 1 enhancement rune to try to get a weapon to +10(turned out I didn't need it, so I used it for another weapon).I think the community on this game(or at least 99% of it) is very pleasant. Sure you get trolls and irritating people, but find me any multiplayer game that doesn't have that. I thoroughly enjoy the raids offered, and the graphics definitely don't hurt that. That being said, the lag on here is slightly less than perfect, but that's forgiveable with the graphics and all the other stuff going on. Past the character and skills, the customization is nearly limitless. there are hundreds of armor sets and when combined, leave you with thousands, maybe millions, of combinations to give your character the look you want.If you're on the fence about trying this game, do yourself a favor and go for it. The beginning is a little slow, but that's the way all games are... you have to have time to learn the combat system and all the other stuff before you can take down a dragon with it, after all. On the note of combat system and controls, you can choose between keyboard, mouse, or gamepad(works with PS3/XBOX360 or later controllers) modes. Once you select the one you like most, you can fine-tune it to your ideal setup. My ratings for this game are...Community: 4.75/5Graphics:4-5/5(based on graphics settings, but even lowest are still quite wonderful)Connection:3.75-5/5(depending on host and your individual settings along with device capabilities)Story/Plot: 5/5Character Customization/Skills: 4.75/5Ease of use(to get started): 5/5(starts slow, but you learn all the in's and out's of the game)Overall rating:4.5-4.9/5			"

												After the first 10 mins of this game I was annoyed. The UI is cluttered with garbage, the dialog is annoying, the controls are wonky. Overall I'd rate this game a 1/10 simply because it's okay to look at. Really though it's not worth your time. This isn't the game you're looking for, move along, move along.			"

												I've been playing this game on and off since the beta, and while I do believe the game itself is enjoyable, Nexon really makes the game really annoying to play. The game has a problem with bots that the hack detector doesn't do♥♥♥♥♥♥about. Also, said hack detector has  been known to wrongly accuse people of hacking from what I've heard. If you want to play, try to get friends or a guild to play with or you will end up playing alone with the occasional carry from the high lvl characters doing raid runs.			"

												When I picked up this game about a year ago I thought it was neat, I hadn't reached much hours before this review, but anyways if you decide to pick up the game this might be helpful in some way. Basically, I started the missions in the game, I was instantly grasped by the games combat, you literally break backs and can send the body flying to another enemy. The graphics are neat, but I didn't care about the story as long as I went to hacknslash my way through hordes of enemies, which was probably the high point for me. I also picked up a buddy along the way. He was around my level, and we stuck together for multiple levels, together we did missions until my computer broke because of a hard drive problem, and since it is an old computer I decided to buy a new windows computer. Ever since then I have never seen my buddy. Im sure most of you have experienced this in co-op games, you find someone that you start sticking around with and then just like that you never see him again. When I picked up this game I thought it was probably better than all those other free RPG's out there, so why not just play this? Im sure all those people saying its P2W are just too lazy to do the work they need to do to get what they want without paying, and trust me, as I have played multiple games that have a slow learning curve, if you don't P2W and get it like it was meant to be it will feel like you truly accomplished something, and you can go up to people and tell them that you are legit if you want, I bet they will feel more confident about reaching that goal you just set for them if they are a lower level than you, if its a higher level than you they probably won't care or will feel happy for you.

												One of the best combat systems even in today's gaming frontier. However, it's a VERY rough diamond in the middle of smoother prettier diamonds.  A diamond because the combat, graphics despite it's age, and the lore it has. Rough because of how unforgiving the RNG is in this game when you're attempting to min/max your character stats. Failures on high level weapon/armor enchanting/enchancing will lead to the destruction of said gear. RNG for material drops are no less rewarding. This is mainly due to being a korean made game where RNG is a large aspect in many games made in the country. Despite the RNG I still find myself logging back on to play. Feel free to give this a try, but be warned.I've played this game for roughly 4 years, but had to switch to launching via steam because the new nexon launcher is filled with problems and  nexon seeming just tried to shove it down the throats of players.

												This thing is so poorly optimized its ridiculous. Its nothing like the video describes. The graphics look good but, it looks like they tried to build a game with a low budget, all purpose, graphics engine and it wasn't opitmized at all. The game play wasnt all that captivating either. The quest menu, character menus and NPC interfaces need to be dumbed down to match the simplicity of the actual game mechanics. In the end you get a quest, go to some bulleten board, load up a crappy instanced sailboat. Then you launch into a 10 minute map where you hack slash some generic monsters from an early 90s quake 2 type game and get some loot. All of which is pretty much designed to get you to buy stuff from the cash shop.This does not, as the video says, ""crush"" Warframe by any means.			"

If that's not enough, each of them have specific sets of skills and are fully customizable. The replay factor is great. It does have some flaws, but overall a really great game.			"

												Nexon finally did something right. Vindictus is amazing in almost every sence of the word, featuring high intesnity battles and increasingly difficult yet fun boss raids, what's not to love? The first half of the game is very much a solo experience, as the battles and bosses are well balanced and simple to defeat. However, as you approach higher levels you are forced to work with others to take down the threats, allowing for an incredibly fun co-op experience. Character and class progression is good as the player chooses how to to level their skills, not the game. My only criticism is that co-op has no servers, save for major raid bosses. So if you want to co-op a normal battle quest you're relying on a p2p conection, which can be a huge problem for people playing with friends interstate.			"

												Vindictus is an action MMO from Nexon, and the prequel to the very popular MMO Mabinogi.Vindictus offers balls to the walls fast paced and intense action combat, where a split second can literally mean life or death mid game. Unlike most MMO's Vindictus actually offers a strong and interesting story line, however the story falls short and out of a lot of people’s interest due to the lack of voice acting throughout most of the game.And though Combat is fun after you beat the current story arc, there is little to do but grind leaving the game repetitive.The voice acting at the beginning of the game is beautifully done and executed however for some reason, the quality of the acting falls during the latter half of the first arc.All and all Vindictus is a beautiful action game however it is one you may find boring after a while, none the less it is still worth a play.Score 7/10			"

												Vindictus brings a whole new interaction for gaming, both fast pace and epic + it is one of the best games to play with friends. there are countles items and charactor customization. the bosses are AMAZING and the storryne is verry well thoght out. the only bad thing aout this game is you need a good computer to run it well, if not you need to turn all the graphics dawn and it will allwasy lagg when you first join the game other than that it is a amazing game! deffinitly recomend it			"

												The greatest game of all time. I love the battle mechanics and the graphics.  The character customization is amazing with one exeption, they should add more weapons to use and more freedom in weapon use. Otherwise this game is amazing an i recommend to any RPG fan.			"

												One of the best dungeon crawling games owned by the noteably WORST company in the MMO industry: Nexon. Do not spend a penny until the game's issues are fixed.Still love the game and would recommend, you might end up farming for months, though. Don't be fooled by my hours played, either. I've played this game for years before it came to Steam.			"

												Fun dungeon runner! You can do worse with your time, then running a few dungeons! Running on the Source engine, there are physics based combat scenarios that can work in your favor (momentum carry's a lot of weight here, especially when you are swinging a big sword!). Nice visuals, though the cash shop is a bit expensive (and annoying, like really, I need Karma Koins AND Steam wallet to buy things?)			"

												Did not take me long to remember why I walked on this game pre Steam release. While the combat mechanics are fun, the shelling out of money for cosmetics, hair style/color for one, is just plain ridiculous, then there is the wash, rinse, repeat grinding of the same fragging maps for level upon level...the game is a money grab and nothing more at this point, especially with some of the ""updates"" which has just ground down the choices of character customization even further and...yeah, just do not play unless you are one of those sorts with money to burn just to do even the most basic things that most other free to plays aren't so restrictive on...I mean come on...Pay for hairstyle/color!?!? That is just a new low in the online gaming market to add to my experiences I'd just as soon forget.			"

												NOT NEW PLAYER FRIENDLY!!! connection constantly drops in this mmo!!! I have a great expensive computer just for playing these kinds of games, but it doesn't really matter in vindictus. You can have a 3,000 dollar comp & still lag from other players no matter what. oh & CRASH a LOT!! for no reason!!!I would say recommend if it was a newer game but the fact that these problems still exist in such an old mmo is just trouble. There are still such little things that could have been fixed 100000000 years ago, like the loot bouncing all over the screen & out of the map & into the ceilings.... that is just ridiculous!! the fact that you can't grab your loot after the report screen pops up so you miss everything...They introduce you to the cash shops after like the 5th mission & they give you this default under armor that is - lets be honest- terrible looking with a lot of gear, so it makes you want to buy new under armor. it sucks!!! sure they let you pick a free hairstyle but only for 7 days. you even have to buy your face setup!! so unless you want to look like an asian teenager you have to spend some money on a new face/makeup.I give this game like a 5/10 for now but it could use some work that won't be done. im guessing ever. Go play Warframe, it's a much better free to play.			"

												I've been playing this game on and off since the beta, and while I do believe the game itself is enjoyable, Nexon really makes the game really annoying to play. The game has a problem with bots that the hack detector doesn't do♥♥♥♥♥♥about. Also, said hack detector has  been known to wrongly accuse people of hacking from what I've heard. If you want to play, try to get friends or a guild to play with or you will end up playing alone with the occasional carry from the high lvl characters doing raid runs.			"

												Before I begin, I advise that if you're an Aussie to not even bother with joining the Australian server, it's dead, the economy is dead, nobody plays and the only people that do play are afk people (so I guess they're not really playing, lmao). Instead, hop straight on to US West server, good connection, lots of people and their market is booming.Pros- Outstanding story line- Plenty of different armours to aquire - Same with weapons- Bosses / Raids- Each boss has a different attack pattern, keeping you on your toes.- Always this feeling of ""What's next?"" - Combat is FLAWLESS- Not really heavy on your connection because when you start a dungeon, it runs off of your connection (you're the host) so if you have good internet you'll never lag, besides joining other peoples partys where the host has a bad connection (not the game's fault though)Cons- Have to pay for more storage space- No bank (besides guild storage and you have to pay 300k to make a guild)- Combat skills can be confusing, I feel as how they explained the skills is pretty confusing (you will get the hang of it eventually though, just a pain to start out with)- Leveling things such as tailoring, armoursmithing etc can be pretty grindy, even for someone like me who absolutely lives for the grind.- Not exactly beginner friendly, not too many tutorials and stuff in game to help the new players (but, you will get a hang of it eventually if you just stick with it).All in all, this game is very enjoyable 8/10.

												Its story isn't even that intriguing in my opinion. I just went around not knowing what I was doing, other than exploring extremely linear maps killing enemies whose appearance never change. The bosses aren't that difficult either, and character customization is very limited. Combat is boring. Just straight up boring. For some odd reason my default controls are NOT what the tutorial says. For example, it told me that the spacebar was dodge. Well it wasn't, and for some reason it was shift (by default). And the audio is silent (by default as well). But that could be my problem.			"

												First of all, IGNORE my steam hours, i have played the official client before the Europe launch as the global client and steam version wasnt there at that time.Vindictus was the best hack-n-slash game i was able to play without being bored of grinding, even if you dont get gold or anything but items such as quest items and mob drops needed later on or needed to sell for $, it kept me ingame for a good time everyday and the fight style was better than the Tab-Target system one.I will be reviewing this game possitive because i found only some scratches back then and some new ones now(cons section below) and i actually recommend you give it a shot, at least 1 hour of gameplay(depending of the class you chose) the game can keep you in the community or not.*PROS*-Great graphics with great fighting system.~Dungeon system that is a bit different everytime so you wont get bored of the enviroment.~Good-ish FREE TO WIN item system: By free to win i mean that, if you want to win pvp or fights easyer, you dont need to invest huge amount of money into it, just time and grind, a lot in some cases, but it will be worth, you can get by luck and some gold spent the same items as a *Noob* spends real $ for it. AGAIN, all depending on the grind and luck youve got for enchanting and crafting.~HUGE time invested in boobs details and physics.*CONS*~Removed Jump? Why, i mean, why the hell would you remove the ability to jump-smash spiders and other mobs and look cool while you would do it? (tested on Evie and Fiona, Maybe on other classes works, idk YET)~Sometimes the mobs wont react to the dodge effect so they will still hit you(stupid thing if you ask me)~LOCKED 30FPS LIMIT? I mean, comon, i know my pc aint a beast but hell, at least let me unlock that limit so i can enjoy the game sometimes..~Party System sucks as if you create a party sometimes your friend wont be able to join saying that either one of you is offline to the other.~Space-smashing to skip the conversations... Yeah, if youre not in the story and you only want to play the game, you will smash the keys so you get to the action, a lot of people will react to this as its not an aspect of the game so imporant.. it is.This is all the stuff i can think right now but i can confirm that the game is fun until you get mad and rage quit :)			"

												This is not your typical free to play MMORPG. Vindictus has a lot of things going for it; semi decent graphics, interesting character classes, boob physics, creative enemy and armor designs, boob physics... But where this game really shines is it's boss fights, particularly the multiplayer raids. The boss designs get more and more creative as you move along, with enough variation in each battle to keep you coming back for more. Having other players fight alongside you really provides a sense of camaraderie rarely seen in multiplayer games these days, especially in free to play games. This game is not perfect, the story is boring, the characters are flat, the menus are needlessly complicated, and some of the reuse of stages gets particularly annoying, but I find myself coming back for the creative boss designs and action-packed multiplayer raids, as they're just that fun.

												Its story isn't even that intriguing in my opinion. I just went around not knowing what I was doing, other than exploring extremely linear maps killing enemies whose appearance never change. The bosses aren't that difficult either, and character customization is very limited. Combat is boring. Just straight up boring. For some odd reason my default controls are NOT what the tutorial says. For example, it told me that the spacebar was dodge. Well it wasn't, and for some reason it was shift (by default). And the audio is silent (by default as well). But that could be my problem.			"

												First of all, IGNORE my steam hours, i have played the official client before the Europe launch as the global client and steam version wasnt there at that time.Vindictus was the best hack-n-slash game i was able to play without being bored of grinding, even if you dont get gold or anything but items such as quest items and mob drops needed later on or needed to sell for $, it kept me ingame for a good time everyday and the fight style was better than the Tab-Target system one.I will be reviewing this game possitive because i found only some scratches back then and some new ones now(cons section below) and i actually recommend you give it a shot, at least 1 hour of gameplay(depending of the class you chose) the game can keep you in the community or not.*PROS*-Great graphics with great fighting system.~Dungeon system that is a bit different everytime so you wont get bored of the enviroment.~Good-ish FREE TO WIN item system: By free to win i mean that, if you want to win pvp or fights easyer, you dont need to invest huge amount of money into it, just time and grind, a lot in some cases, but it will be worth, you can get by luck and some gold spent the same items as a *Noob* spends real $ for it. AGAIN, all depending on the grind and luck youve got for enchanting and crafting.~HUGE time invested in boobs details and physics.*CONS*~Removed Jump? Why, i mean, why the hell would you remove the ability to jump-smash spiders and other mobs and look cool while you would do it? (tested on Evie and Fiona, Maybe on other classes works, idk YET)~Sometimes the mobs wont react to the dodge effect so they will still hit you(stupid thing if you ask me)~LOCKED 30FPS LIMIT? I mean, comon, i know my pc aint a beast but hell, at least let me unlock that limit so i can enjoy the game sometimes..~Party System sucks as if you create a party sometimes your friend wont be able to join saying that either one of you is offline to the other.~Space-smashing to skip the conversations... Yeah, if youre not in the story and you only want to play the game, you will smash the keys so you get to the action, a lot of people will react to this as its not an aspect of the game so imporant.. it is.This is all the stuff i can think right now but i can confirm that the game is fun until you get mad and rage quit :)			"

												This is not your typical free to play MMORPG. Vindictus has a lot of things going for it; semi decent graphics, interesting character classes, boob physics, creative enemy and armor designs, boob physics... But where this game really shines is it's boss fights, particularly the multiplayer raids. The boss designs get more and more creative as you move along, with enough variation in each battle to keep you coming back for more. Having other players fight alongside you really provides a sense of camaraderie rarely seen in multiplayer games these days, especially in free to play games. This game is not perfect, the story is boring, the characters are flat, the menus are needlessly complicated, and some of the reuse of stages gets particularly annoying, but I find myself coming back for the creative boss designs and action-packed multiplayer raids, as they're just that fun.

												Amazing combat system I'd say probably one of the best. Alot of characters and 100+ skills. Really nice graphics and epic boss fights. One bad thing I'd say without putting any money your gonna have a hard time. Played game since it was in beta and it just got worse as the game progressed. Also the game is mostly dead, not many players. Only high level. Not very noob friendly.			"

												This game, has been a wild rollercoaster, this game used to be very bad on events and everything, like very awful. They've gotten a new director for Nexon's Vindictus NA branch and they brought last month a great event full of free items and free NX items as well. If any review has ""EU"" or ""European"" in it, don't bother reading it if you're planning to play NA because that stuff really won't apply to you.Without further ado, let us begin this review.+It has an original combat system for an MMO and doesn't really rely on skills being used 24/7 for most classes.+The graphics aren't that bad for it being a Source SDK Base 2007 game.+Controls are easily customizable for if you have a gamepad, mouse and keyboard, or a controller.+Events have gotten better now, so expect in the future better stuff from events unlike previously.+If you know the term Fashion Souls; that applies to this game as all of your gear can be fused to look like another set and be dyed to look certain colours with the dye ampoule system.-Has a terrible anti-cheat system, people have been banned for false positives of ""third party programs"" when it was just another game that they probably had running.+Every character has a role in the game, and is unique and different from one another.+Customization of how your character looks, hairstyles, how tall they are, how much muscle or fat they have; their makeup if they're female; tattoos, hairs, and inner armours(No stats added) [There will be another point on this below in the cons]+Uses market place transactions where the prices are always fluxuating; something one day could be expensive, and in a few days it could go down in price etc.+Bots don't really exist on the NA West servers from what I can tell, dunno about other servers.-Peer to peer connection system, so you have to gamble that you'll have good connection with the player hosting the raid/party.-Pay to progress, there is a lot of stuff that can help you skip the grind, but the only thing you can't skip is the level grind.-The RNG in Vindictus is horrid and painfully bad when it comes to enhancing weapons and enchanting gear as well [Take note of the con above, as you can skip most of the RNG with items from the cash shop.]-Updates are few and far between because the game is made by a Korean company, so the rest of the world gets content that is released in Korea about a few months later.-Cosmetics such as hairs, make ups, inner armours, tattoos, beards, and anything like that are cash shop items and cost money, or you can basically earn them by getting enough gold and buy airtight coupons off the marketplace-Marketplace prices can be skewed and have a cash shop item that puts your item at the top of the list as well, doesn't cost you anything to put up on the market.I give this game an 7.5/10; it's a well done game with some glaring issues, like the content updates being far and few between because it's a game made in Korea. But, overall, this game is worth giving a try.			"

												Haven't played for a while, but still felt the need to write my opinions. Anyways decent game, graphics focus on character models more than that of terrain, and the early levels are a slow grind of repetitive missions until you've spent some decent hours into the game. Once you pass the early stages of the game you reach levels that are more interactive and interesting than that earlier on. Just know before playing that you will look ugly if you don't spend time/money attempting to secure a decent outfit, and that time is required to reach the better levels, but it is worth it if you're into these types of games. Lastly I commend this game for being different from that of most mmo-rpgs seeing how levels are stages, rather than an open world environment, yet still manages to create skill based battles, requiring timing and decent equipment grinding. If you're new your best bet is to ask a high level player to help you and teach you the ropes.			"

												There are a lot of MMO's out there each with their own benefits and downsides, some good and some bad, but if you were to ask me about Vindictus, I'd probably say it's good... Really good.PROS:- The game has really good combat, you don't just press a button and then the attack happens, you actually have combos you need to do. (There are active abilities were you press a button and the attack happens, but you have to aim it and sometimes have to follow it up with something else) Also attack animation look good and are fluent.- Some options on weapons for each class, not stuck with just 1 weapon type. (ex. Karok = Pillar/Cestus - Evie = Staff/Battle Scythe)- Interact with the environment, collect resources, breakable/grabbable items.- THE LORE/STORY, I believe the story and dialouge are AMAZING! It was one of the reason I still play the game. (Kinda rip season 2)- Very little pay2win/play feature that are immediatly apparent to the game ( Immediatly apparent pay2win/play feartures would be Something that will CHANGE the game, like not being able to go to a certain area or equip armor because you need to buy a subscription / ticket with real money)CONS:- Each class has a gender lock on it so if the class is a male, you're going to be a male character. (This is a problem for some people)- Some stages you have to repeat, which can get boring / make the story seem odd (Killing the same boss 2 or 3 times... He's already dead the first time right?- Combat can get repetitve when trying to defeat big bosses or when you are trying to farm.- There is some RNG on some max level gear. You might be trying to add or increase stats, this can result in adding or increasing a stat, or decreasing a stat which is a waste of time, gold, and it ruins your gear.PRO/CON MIX (Thing I'm unsure of)- If you spend money on the game, the RNG factor is not as big of a threat as it would be if you didn't spend money. The reason I do not put this as a con is because all it does it just make you're enchanting faster. You can do all of this without having to spend money, it just takes more time and you have to be commited to the game (Now if your gear gets destoryed thats a different problem...). What i'm saying is that the game IS [[[NOT PAY TO WIN/PAY]]] in my opinion, but rather it IS [[[PAY TO LOOK COOL/PAY TO DO STUFF FASTER]]].MY OPINION: The game is [[[NOT PAY TO WIN/PLAY]]] But rather it is [[[PAY TO LOOK COOL/PAY TO DO STUFF FASTER]]]OVERALL RATING: 8.5/10 DELICIOUS			"

What i'm saying is that the game IS [[[NOT PAY TO WIN/PAY]]] in my opinion, but rather it IS [[[PAY TO LOOK COOL/PAY TO DO STUFF FASTER]]].MY OPINION: The game is [[[NOT PAY TO WIN/PLAY]]] But rather it is [[[PAY TO LOOK COOL/PAY TO DO STUFF FASTER]]]OVERALL RATING: 8.5/10 DELICIOUS			"

												When I picked up this game about a year ago I thought it was neat, I hadn't reached much hours before this review, but anyways if you decide to pick up the game this might be helpful in some way. Basically, I started the missions in the game, I was instantly grasped by the games combat, you literally break backs and can send the body flying to another enemy. The graphics are neat, but I didn't care about the story as long as I went to hacknslash my way through hordes of enemies, which was probably the high point for me. I also picked up a buddy along the way. He was around my level, and we stuck together for multiple levels, together we did missions until my computer broke because of a hard drive problem, and since it is an old computer I decided to buy a new windows computer. Ever since then I have never seen my buddy. Im sure most of you have experienced this in co-op games, you find someone that you start sticking around with and then just like that you never see him again. When I picked up this game I thought it was probably better than all those other free RPG's out there, so why not just play this? Im sure all those people saying its P2W are just too lazy to do the work they need to do to get what they want without paying, and trust me, as I have played multiple games that have a slow learning curve, if you don't P2W and get it like it was meant to be it will feel like you truly accomplished something, and you can go up to people and tell them that you are legit if you want, I bet they will feel more confident about reaching that goal you just set for them if they are a lower level than you, if its a higher level than you they probably won't care or will feel happy for you.

												Vindictus is a neat little MMORPG that i found completely by accident. Though it mildly repetitive the game is incredibly fun. Bring your friends and dont look at other players. (they all have paid for armour that makes you wish you had that much disposable income)			"

												The game is okay early on but as soon as you get to level 70-90 and unlock season two it gets really codependent where you literally have to join parties and you have to farm items for because collecting 100,000,000 gold for a level 70 armor set is next to impossible. But overall fun game			"

												One of the best combat systems even in today's gaming frontier. However, it's a VERY rough diamond in the middle of smoother prettier diamonds.  A diamond because the combat, graphics despite it's age, and the lore it has. Rough because of how unforgiving the RNG is in this game when you're attempting to min/max your character stats. Failures on high level weapon/armor enchanting/enchancing will lead to the destruction of said gear. RNG for material drops are no less rewarding. This is mainly due to being a korean made game where RNG is a large aspect in many games made in the country. Despite the RNG I still find myself logging back on to play. Feel free to give this a try, but be warned.I've played this game for roughly 4 years, but had to switch to launching via steam because the new nexon launcher is filled with problems and  nexon seeming just tried to shove it down the throats of players.

												A great game I must say, best part is, it's free to play :D. Sad thing is, you need to seriously grind sometimes if you want to become a ultimate badass. Leveling is easy at the beginning. As you progress later in the game you start to realize that leveling is a B**** XD. Lemme tell ya this. I sum this game up into two words.

												I've been playing this game for years and with 500+ hours on it, here's my thoughts. Short and simple.I STILL think it's a great game. I don't see very many problems other than these:1: Gameplay gets extremely repetative. (Especially farming for ES to sell)2: Market is almost always fluctuating due to things either being overpriced or underpriced. (Mainly cash consumables, which isn't too big of a deal. Just me being a baby haha)3: Lack of community. There is almost no one on and rarely anyone to play with. Maybe I'm just unlucky? or maybe there's not a lot of people.That's basically all I can find to complain about since I started playing back in 2013.Rating: 7.5/10 PS- I personally think there should be a matchmaking setting as an option to find parties instead of ""Quick Battle"" and ""Party Search"". Again, that's just my opinion.			"

												In a word, awful.Graphics - More bad clipping than a hair salon full of trainees. Sluggish like I have never seen. I have a fairly high-end system (i7, dual 980's) but couldn't even play on Normal without the game hesitating and just plain freezing up.Audio - More skipping than a pre-school class after a candy break. Every time the scene changed, the last sound would repeat for about 10 seconds.Voice acting sounds like they trained at the William Shatner School of Over-emoting.Controls - Feels like I am walking through water. Could not get my Logitech gamepad to work. Finally gave up when the game told me for the third time it had to restart because I changed a setting.			"

												The game's combat is pretty solid, it's combat in a game like this that you can't find any where else, Vindictus get combat right. Dodging, blocking, countering, ETC. The game has it's problems like every game does, but really, no game is ever perfect, there is always♥♥♥♥♥♥to fix, and things to keep updated. Other than that, the game is pretty fun, you won't find fun in a game like this any where else. You can customize your character, you can still make the character you choose stand out from everyone elses, if you choose to. If you are into cosmetics in a game like this, making your character stand out, you will have to pay for it, but it can be worth it in the end. There is basic character customization, but everything else you may have to pay for. In other words, the game gets FREE content from time to time, per say a new character, or area to explore and fight the bosses at the end of it and ""Raids,"" and hopefully fixes to glitches, and optimization.

												Great fast paced and fairly balanced game to play with friends the private dungeons and instances make this game an already jewel amongst mmos due to the fact of other games like Tera causing constant annoying lag with their poorly ran servers, being able to actually play this game without such a thing deserves a 10/10 on its own.

												Limited character creation, class is tied to gender.The opening ""quest"" says it all about the game. We have a weak, demure, damseled woman who wants to save the monster that you actually have to pick up and carry for a part of it, afterwards I was subjected to creating my character where it was discovered there's mandatory boob jiggle for all female characters. Even when you put them in the plate armor it jiggles, disgusting.So, yup, can't play this game and not be some dudebros porn fetish.			"

												Well, I figured I give this game a go because it is f2p but the bugginess of the game is way to much for me handle. Until I find out from a reliable source that the game developers fixed this issue then I will have no issue redownloading the game and giving it another try. I like to play games that are actually playable.			"

												Don't you dare. Do not click install. Don't. DOOOOON'T.This game. I know this game well. Like how well I know that ♥♥♥♥♥ down the street. Like with that strumpet, I wonder if I'm ploughing her or if she ploughs me. Judging by my super-AIDS i assumed the latter. This game will trick you into thinking it's really fun. Because it is. The combat is fantastic. I love it. But absolutely everything else about this game is God-awful. When you start out, it seems really fun. Then you get to the gear and stat grind. It's so bad. It's so damn bad. Nexon took a gem and tossed into a poop pile. 150 damn exquisite iron ores. Me and the other warlord of my clan decided to try out vindi again for the sick♥♥♥♥♥raid bosses, since warframe was being DDOSsed. We are towards the end game now, and holy crap FORGET exquisite iron ore. Most armor sets or weapons require an extraordinary amount of how high level ore. Iron comes from speckled turds in the instanced dungeons. One or two spawn. In season 2, u have a chance at getting lowest tier, second tier, third, or low chance at exquisite ores. Usually second tier drops. It requires 4 third tiers to craft exquisite.These sets require a total of 150 damn exquisite ores, among 20 count drops from raid bosses that are only dailies. Then their is the horrible enhance and enchant system. It's recommended to get a weapon to plus 8 to be any kind of viable. From +5-+8, the percent of success goes to 50%, to 40%. Failure resets rank to 0 and lowers durability, and takes the stones (more grind) you used. Buuut if u buy nexon cash, you can get runes that prevent those effects upon failure. No way to get nexon in game like Warframe btw. No discounts either. Enchants of a good rank only have 50% to 40% of success, but u can increase that by buying♥♥♥♥♥♥ Failure lowers durability and can break weapon for the good enchants. But guess what, u can buy a rune (nexon obviously) that saves your♥♥♥♥♥ Vindictus' gameplay is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic, but the system built around it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and promotes pay2win.At least you can get the parts for a frame in a day, at least formas and potatoes have NO failure chance, and at least you can get plat and resources BY PLAYING THE DAMN GAME.

												Its very much a ""Its alright.. could be better"" kind of game.-Gameplay is decent, although it could be improved, many mechanics just feel thrown in as a gimmick rather than being actually useful. -The controls are janky and sometimes annoying. -The camera would be better if your characters attacks weren't locked to it, I've had few collision issues which is good.-Visually its quite generic, I've had quite a few frame drops during combat which gets annoying.-Customization is insanely limited. You can barely customize your character and considering that is something I love to do.. its definitely a point taker.-Interactions and general exploration is limited and weirdly done. It feels like its trying to be an action-RPG like warframe or Path of Exile but has a bunch of extra UI elements that really dont need to be there.-As for UI/HUD, its quite basic, only really annoying when ""in buildings"" or trying to access different areas.Generally it has some interesting ideas, the 3rd person action-RPG style is cool and I'd like to see it done more, however the game seems to fail to actually deliver it in a really engaging way. Whether its Nexons fault or lack of enough production time is unkown to me, whatever the case may be its definitely something to look at, however I wouldn't spend money on it.			"

												If you are interested in fast pace hack n slash mmo's this is the game for you. if you like high qualtiy graphics and insane boss fights this is the game for you. basically vindictus is a mmo hack n slash video game, yes there is skill to the game and takes practice with your character and the monsters to fight. the game has lag issues but you can look past it when u go to a low population channel on the server. it is a great game to play with friends, like if u download this tell your girlfriend and friends to download it too. i have to note this: this game requires you to use 85% of your mental power, meaning you have to read and pay attention to the NPC's or you will be lost. alot of people leave this game because. ""they have no idea what to do, its too hard"". when all you have to do is read. read! simple.			"

												Vindictus is a great game with an great fighting style. The story is interesting and the characters are unique and have their own personalities. Each area is their own and have good bosses. The classes have their own fighting style and some have second weapons that give them a completely new move set and skills.            I LOVE this game. The best part: its FREE! I will recomend this game to fans of 3rd person hack and slash games.			"

												Ok, I'm rewriting this review.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has money, cause you're going to be buying some cosmetic s***, that is unless you're a f****** p**** and don't want to cough up money for a game that's worth That aside,Combat System? Best in the world, there's nothing like it. Imagine Devil May Cry thrown into an MMO, cause that's basically what this is. You have plentiful skills and it takes focus and time to make bosses your b****.Graphics Quality? F****** great. Seriously, it's so good there's even ♥♥♥♥♥ physics.There's frequently new updates for badass/sexy new characters and freaking awesome new bosses and areas to explore.Overall, don't listen to the quitters who've probably only played about a grand total of 1-10 hours, cause they're stupid unmotivated Marijuana smokers who can't tell a beast of a game from a pile of EA Sports trash...Overall rating 10/10 would play over and over again...

												I highly recommend those who enjoy games outside of the ""tab targeting"" scenario. Tera, for example.This game looks an plays wondefully... that is, when it's not lagging to complete hell. The only way to fix the ""Stuttering lag"" issue is to switch from channel 1-5(Whichever it places you) to a higher channel, like 20 something+.The graphics for this game are gorgeous, and it plays just as well.All in all, i definitely recommend this, even though Nexon isn't paying much attention to optimizing it.

												For a f2p action rpg that is....sort of an MMO, Vindictus is pretty good.  Great action elements.  Easy to blast through levels.  The graphics still look pretty amazing to this day.Has controller Support!  This is amazing for an MMO.  Finally, the lazy gamer can sit back in his/her chair with their legs up and just enjoy an MMO without being hunched over a keyboard. I never played that much of Vindictus because the levels are all seperated by loading screens and are their own seperate instance.  Yes...this game uses instances for almost everything.

												Best combat of an MMO I have every played, yet (I hope it won't be but it is fun). The main flaw of it's game combat is lack of complete manual aiming, there is a bit of auto-aiming for a number of abilities (they still can miss and sometimes auto-aiming mechanic makes them miss) and some lag and really, really minor issues with control/ui settings. The boss AI is very great, along with the combat. If you are an avid MMO player and want to see great combat mechanics, it's a must try and you can really challenge yourself if it's your goal. The level design of the game is fun and engaging along with the environments, though the scenerio and dungeons maps are very similar.It has great challenges and players can progress through this game the easy route AND they can challenge themselves when dungeons have normal, hard and hero modes and all. It's best to see this game as a co-op, and much better with friends I would assume, though extremely great and fun to solo as well. Also this game gets really ""grindy"" after levels 50. Leveling and progress becomes slower and more difficult but again if you have dedicated groups it might be more fun then. However, playing this game as a newcomer and about your first month of gameplay will be quite fun for sure if the combat style interests you.Negatives:The game's major design flaws in my mind are what I already mentioned about aiming. Not capitalizing on the jump feature as much (for balancing reason I assume, still good dodge/leap mechanics though) but major ones are. It's not an open world MMO,Expct to be limited to dungeons only, most being 1-4 players, ""raids"" being 6-20. 2 d shops and quest turn-ins+storyline(not as fun as they could be). A decent story nonetheless and great intro but the rest is borish.Free-to-play with a cash shop for good quality of life and a pay-to-win feel. This is one reason players like me don't like F2P models in part of a game's design. Things cost a lot in this game or a lot of time (survey for points bs).... and lag. Lag in this game comes occasionally when interacting in town with inventory or when in dungeons with big groups or laggy hosts. Nexon or devcat for NA is slow to address these issues I guess.			"

												For anyone reading this review, don't download this game     it looks fun   i'm sure it is fun     if you can get it to work    my computer runs it fine, when i can get to the start menu, because this game has a habit of crashing 9 times out of 10 and when it does start up, the options menu in-game can not be closed    the game doesen't freeze    i can see people moving around, it's that it simply just gets stuck, and you have to force log your computer out or shut it off     in short, don't buy this game unless you enjoy having to log/shut down your computer constantly or love seeing a terminate program textbox pop up constantly.

												Picture an ARPG MMO with instanced combat. Picture that combat is vaguely like Monster Hunter or Dark/Demon's Souls. It really is probably the best combat I've ever seen in a F2P game.Now picture that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t grind of fighting the same monsters over and over again in hopes of a super-rare drop becomes a mandatory part of progression through the game. And also that each time you want to try a different weapon class, you have to create a new character.I will say it's worth it to experience up through the first main boss, maybe the second. Just expect the grind to become intolerable shortly thereafter.			"

												This game had me at first thinking it was an alternative and free World of Warcraft. But I was so confused with the cluttered HUD and weird quests. No open world except in little places, and quests have to be done independently or with 1-4 people as co-op. I would not recommend this game, too cluttered and confusing.			"

												When I found out that Vindictus was by the same guys as Maplestory, I had to try it. Luckily, I was not disappointed. The only problem I have with this game is that it lags when in a party, even at the lowest graphics settings. However, it is only an inconvenience, not a problem. The cutscenes are greatly done, and the story is beautiful. There are plenty of side quests to do, so you don't have to do the main quest immediately. People have complained that you need to grind in order to survive in this, which may be true (I'm not sure), but I enjoy grinding, so it's not a problem for me. All-in-all, I give it 9/10.			"

												Can't believe I looked forward to this game. While the fighting itself was quite fun and unique, the UI was chunky and completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Playing with a friend was worse, and if the quest item was collected by a single individual it would not be able to be traded to the other person to complete a quest for both individuals (unless we mailed it, and then you'd need to be level 10, and then you'd also have to spend money to mail it to the other person). Waste of HD space, and I was frustrated long before level 5, and not a friendly game to play from beginning with another friend.			"

												horrible. the devs were so lazy with the dungeons that you have to play them several times in a row to accomplish some pointless goals. 19 levels in, still stuck running the same boring ice dungeon fighting the exact same enemies with the exact same moves. around this point, the story xp s.h.i.t.s itself and causes the player to have to grind the same dungeon even more to unlock the next story quest (2 levels higher for some f,..u,..c,..k,..e,..d reason). controls are also horrid. the character will usually swing in the direction of the camera which is incredibly stupid, but sometimes they won't. i ended up trying to swing towards some bland kobolds for the millionth time and ended up snapping another direction, hitting a lever, and getting crushed by a spike trap. how in the f,..u,.,..c.,.k can we still not get controls right in this age? hitboxes are almost as bad as dark souls. i can be out of an enemy's swing and get hit. i can be too close for an enemy to hit with their oversized hammers and still get hit. i can be in the middle of a dodge, be under or above a swing, and get hit.on top of all that, there's not a bit of exploration. there's one town and you repeat the same handful of dungeons from the docks. there is an exploration board, but it's a lie. all that is is repeating raid bosses, but buffed tenfold. so, it's pointless and misnamed. garbage. pay to win, too. i got a bunch of free gear with timers that far outclassed everything normally available. speaking of timers, i checked the pay to win store. there's timers on paid items. yes. you pay for temporary items. OR you can spend double to make them permanent. this means, 20 dollars for a permanent outfit, or 10 for it to wear off in a month. how does that make any sense??nexon, by the way. that really explains it all. has nexon made anything not bad?

Her secondary weapon is a large scythe that is use to cut up monsters in halfs and also used for a special move called ""Reverse Gravity""Vella : Vella is a swift warrior that dual wields swords just like a Lann but is much faster, Her points of attack are used to defect monsters or bosses against themselves.

												Vindictus can be a very fun game to play though, the servers are crappy. If this game was also an open world... instead of seperating East/West Server, it wouldve been more populated. This game is slowly dying because nexon doesnt even care for its players. They are very slow at replying to your tickets and the game is becoming a pay2win.Though the good side of this is, max graphics has a promising detail. Bosses are fun to play against and the character customization is already very detailed (More hairs please) Vindictus became my 2nd family because of the friends and the guild members I made in here. Sure there is lag and it does annoy me however it still doesnt stop me from playing it.			"

												If the developers worked more towards expanding on PVP and possibly inspiring a competitive pvp mode, then the game would ""come back to life"" -Creating custom PVP maps with OBJECTIVES or GAME MODES -Balancing champions and abilties in PVP-Creating certain interations with specific characters-Possibly having a custom armor/weaponry system The game already has a spectacular PVE mode so if a revival for PVP was to come about, then the game would make a resurgence.

												I really wanted to like this game but the combat is boring, shallow and repetitive. All classes have few active abilities, resulting in a daunting wall of passives with the occasional counter/contextual skill thrown in instead of engaging actives. Combat revolves around positioning and attack pattern memorization; however, because of the lack of active skills, this boils boss fights down to 20 minute pokefests. Being a Korean MMO, the exp curve gets intense about ¼ of the way up turning the game into a repetitive grindfest of redoing the same dungeons over and over (especially if you're trying to craft because of poor drop rates). Even at the beginning of the game it gets stuck into the typical quest recycling rut forcing you redo areas.Overinstancing, of towns and dungeons, kills immersion & community. Endgame consists of WEEKLY raids. If you have a group to play with this could be fun for a FOTM (or two), but otherwise there are better options for MMOs and Action RPGs elsewhere.			"

												My Rating : 8.5* / 10*Vindictus is simply a [Free to Play] [MMORPG] masterpiece. With a total unique combat system. Beautifuls graphics and a big community. Many hours of fun and intense combats is awaitings you. The reason why i'm only giving a 8.5 for this game is the payable content is somehow expensive, but atleast it is not needed to play the game. Otherwise this game really worth trying it. Have a good play.			"

												I've played quite a few Mmorpgs and this one is personally my favorite, I've played is for months now and found little to no flaw in the game itself. It does have a decent story line, good graphics and an all over amazing fightying style. I find the fighting style of this game to be very unique and interesting in my opinion. Most other games do not have the fighting style of this one. You do have to pay for additional things such as more apperance options, weapons, and armor. But it doesn't stop it from being a well made F2P game. And because it is a slasher you do have a game more involved with skill and weapons which i personally enjoy.			"

												I've come back to this game multiple times and the combat mechanics have always been what I've been talking about in the gaming industry for years.Whether it be TERA Online, D&D Neverwinter, or Vindictus these kinds of games give us more than just massive NUMBER STACKING & pew pew pew shoot'em & guns only games.Naturally I would be more into recommending this game, but comparing this game to others where you are able to go from the beginning and then experience the end game content Vindictus does not really help you do that very well.Not to mention the issues of HOW Vindictus does their free to play market really forces people to either be rich and fork over money OR quit playing all together because I have countless of F2P games and yet THOSE GAMES give you TONS OF FREE GIFTS, even if they do a simple maintenance over bugs, and the gifts they give you HELP they aren't just ""oh here's a free hair coupon enjoy!"".Vindictus loves to make things over the top, but once you log in to see what you get to use it's usually a HAIR COUPON (7DAYS!!!), some buffs for you skills (7 DAYS!!!), or maybe a exp buff for either the weekend or... (7 DAYS!!!!!!!!)It really gets rather old that god FORBID they actually give you rewards & gifts that are actually AMAZING or at least greater than time sensitive items.Not everyone can HANDCUFF THEMSELVES TO THEIR COMPUTER/CONSOLES for the entire time they have these lousy TIME SENSITIVE ITEMS!More to the point of playability, free to play has to do with how you get those gamers that AREN'T playing or logged on to come back and see what they have in store for them when they log back in to play.Don't just damage the community with horribly done F2P marketing schemes & make it much more enjoyable for ALL PLAYERS, ANYONE to jump into the fray and collect that end game content!!The more players you shut out from the end game content the more player base you lose because the game itself is about what EVERYONE is able to do in the game, not just the people who give you a quick buck or those players who have no life by playing non-stop.

												Edit #3: This is part is mostly to get that sweet fall sale 2016 badge but the new updates do make this game more friendly torwards casual players so that's a thing now.Edit #2: I was looking at a lot of the reviews and noticed people are saying this game is pay2win. That             is not the case. It is pay2beconvenient. It is possible to get good gear without spending money, it will just be harder. With the recent season 3 update (recent as in today), it is no longer a problem to get decent stats to do raids with. You can now literally get your gear by playing the raids and using the seals you get as a 100% drop for the materials you need for your gear. Nexon has been a horrendous company in the past, but I think that as of recently they have made a change for the better. I highly suggest anyone who has quit the game for these reasons to give it another chance.Edit: 2000+ hours and it's still pretty good.I have played 1000+ hours of this game so they must be doing something right.

												I played  more than enough (around 2010 i believe) and i think it's about time people knows what this game really is about. Here's a summary: You'll play till lvl 70 and realise how EXPENSIVE and how much you need to GRIND in order to get some decent stuff. Basically, you'll either end up multi-accounting or botting due to the fact that the dungeons are limited/day and some /weeks. Otherwise, if you have that ""collect errything"" or ""i want my avatar to look unique!!"" syndrome, stay FAR away from this game because i swear it will destroy your wallet's an*s and will take HUNDREDS of dollars from you. If you don't have that but you like being powerful and you are an overachiever kind of player that likes to max out everything and get the best stuff possible, get ready to spend money too because this game >> (-that's where the real bulls**t begins-)<< has a SH1*TY SYSTEM when it comes to ""enhance (+up)"" or ""enchant (add scrolls to your gear)"".First BS fact: so, when you enhance (max in the game is +15) you'll need potions and stones, this is the alrighty broly part but when you reach a certain point (+10 i do believe) your gear gets ""binded"" that means you can't sell it anymore BUT you can buy unbind potions and you can unbind 3 times, after that you're f00ckt. When you enchant over +10, you have higher chances to break your weapon and when you break it you'll have to pay in AP (attribute points i think). These are the points you use to upgrade skills and since they added that ""repair broken weapons with AP"" system they also introduced their ""AP capsule pack"" and when you enhance or enchant you can buy runes that whenever you fail your rune breaks instead of your weapon but since +15 is pretty much impossible without buying from the item shop you'll end up spending around 150$ (if you're very lucky) of runes.Second BS fact: in this game you can also colour your gear. Now that is probably the most fked up part IMO, if you want your gear white or pink (or any freaking nice colour you want) you'll pay over millions for some stupid 4ss dyes that you buy from the shop... Or, you can content yourself with the dark and sh**ty colours you'll pay to dye from dye shop. When you buy some dyes you'll have this little thing. . . Look this video and you'll notice the BS involved >:( 


YouTube™ Video: Vindictus: Clodagh's Dye Ampoule 

			Views: 9,792		

			Just showing what these dye ampoule's do exactly :)		

So yeah, you pick your colour (If you manage to) and then you hope to get dat one out of six colour that you picked. Every F*ING G*DDAMN thing in this game is about a RGN system, EVERYTHING is built up to suck your wallet's J*zzThird BS fact: The servers, they suck so much! Whenever an event begins (they are all focused on that stupid avatar shop btw) the servers are impossible to deal with, everything lags so much you keep crashing and failing your dungeons you spent half an hour doing so you'll have to wait for that to end before doing them and this, is since they released their sh*tty game.Fourth BS fact: The support, i lost millions of gold in items sending them through mail to put them on another character (because this game likes to swarm you with useless garbage to force you to buy their item slots) and i contacted them and they told me ""oh well we can't do jack-sh*t for you unfortunately, soooo yeah HAVE A GOOD DAY :D"" my reaction followed with a(凸ಠ益ಠ)凸 and then i heard lots and lots of people ranting on it saying how slow and lazy they are.Fifth BS fact: I suffer from dat ""It's rare? It's mine!"" syndrom and sometimes they put a ""limited time item/outfit"" and im like ""i'll buy it"" and one year later that same thing pops back up again...All in all, this game would be so enjoyable if it was open world and if it didn't had that pay to play and pay to win GARBAGE SYSTEM. I met a lot of great people in it (sometimes some lame-4ss t4rds) heard some strange sometimes some sad stories and enjoyed playing with those people but everything is broke up with all this puke everywhere and then there's this r*t4rded server rivality and that could've been a good occasion to place a World VS World system but im affraid they'll make you pay for a fklng pass to try it out!If you don't believe in this review, go find out for yourself but just do me a favor and avoid giving this fked up company more money than they deserve. They make EA look like an angel next to them.			"

												Viva Kebabs- 546 Flinders Street, Melbourne.After seeing many reviews praising Viva Kebabs, I thought it would be best to try a HSP from there for myself so here's my review. (I got a lamb HSP with cheese and the holy trinity)Signage: 10/10. The Halal certification was on the front of the store. A bit small but noticeable enough. There were neon lights on the side which were still fairly noticeable during the day.Greeting: 10/10. As usual, Viva Kebabs is pretty busy but the guys there are nice. Don't remember the exact words but I remember hearing 'brother' which is always welcoming.Packaging: Styro/10.Chips: 10/10. They were cooked fresh, nice and crispy with a slight crunch. Defs worth the wait.Sauce: 10/10. The amount of sauce was very generous, some even dripped onto the floor. I forgot what other sauce went on the holy trinity besides barbecue and garlic (Blanked out lmao) but the guy knew what I wanted straight away.Cheese: 10/10. A good amount of cheese that melted with the heat of the meat. The cheese was covered in sauce as well so it didn't taste plain.Meat: 10/10. A great ratio between the meat and chip serving size. The meat didn't taste bland at all, my tastebuds must have jumped with joy when they experienced the taste of the overall HSP. The meat was stacked like a mountain, heaps of meat there.Price: 9/10. It was $15 which is a fair price considering the top notch quality, and you get to choose a drink.Overall rating: A solid 10/10. Everything is cooked fresh and tastes splendid. The serving size is pretty big, I struggled to finish it by myself so it'll definitely fill you up. It's pretty easy to access as well as its roughly halfway between Flinders street station and southern cross. The only bad thing is that there aren't any seats nearby but that doesn't really matter.Would 10/10 recommend trying Viva Kebabs if you haven't already.			"

												A very solid MMO. The game is purely action based, and is very fun. Attacks do not rely on a formula to hit, like WoW, and every click of the attack button has an instant response. It's a but simple, but the battles are very satisfying.   The game looks great, and uses the Source engine to its fullest. Bosses are large and well detailed. Environments are small, but there is a lot of detail in them as well. There are a few texture issues here and there, but the game looks nice overall.   The voice acting is sparce, at most. It mostly consists of grunts from your character and the few voiced cutscenes. The soundtrack is great, with each dungeon having their own themes. Boss themes are truly epic.  The cash shop only has cosmetics, EXP/AP boosters and the standard enchantment insurance scrolls. Nothing that is required in any way to enjoy the game. Sure, the game gets grindy, but the EXP rate is pretty fair. Each mission has its own boss, so it rarely gets dull. Definitely worth it.			"

												I have a few friends that downloaded the game and it sounded like a lot of fun to play.I downloaded and was really excited to try it out for the first time and on initial load up it crash out on me. My friend told me that happens to alot of people and to just relauch it and it should work fine. So i relaunched it the game made it to the main screen so i was happy and went to change my video settings to what fit my computer best and i got a wierd message saying ""Speed Hack Detected"" and it shut the game down. I have tried every solution i could find, note there is not many actual solutions just a bunch of people telling you that your connections to slow and the website for the game gives no help what so ever its just people repeating the same nonsense that doesn't help I would not recommend this game to anyone			"

												Lackluster controls and gameplay.  Weird world design, very restricted, seems to require public matchmade parties to do anything, even if no one is available to join. It offers partial controller support for those gaming from a couch (or just have that preference) but its UI is not new player friendly. Inverted look on controller has to be manually adjusted.  Was expecting to jump into the world and start playing as I haver other MMO's, but was simply not the case here. Story and dialogue take place in static rooms where a picture of the character and the text of what they're saying is displayed. Haven't seen anything like that in a while.Decent graphics but the game chugs along with random momentary freezes here and there. Not my cup of tea.			"

												I wish that people would post useful reviews instead of unfunny one-liners that help no one.In terms of graphics, this game is all right, nothing ground breaking but areas are bright, vibrant and overall good looking.The music is -okay- nothing memorable, however it isn't bad, it's good.The gameplay/controls are quick and responsive, and easy to learn, not overly complicated like some MMOs out today and that's a plus for me, as most mmos/games have you sifting through tons of menus to do everything. Not here.Character customization is good, you can pretty much customise it however you want. Towns and outside areas are pretty lively  and bright and interesting to look at. The game is fun and easy to get into for new players and it isn't pay to win too much if you don't mind grinding countless hours for equipment. The providor, however, Nexon, is notoriously bad and is at the bottom of the barrel in customer service. Its taken ages for me to get respomnses from them in any way, shape or form, so counting on them is a nope. So there's your warning on that before you consider this game.All in all this game has everything you'd expect from a F2P game, its AVERAGE. Nothing incredibly mind blowing. Its not incredible, but it isn't bad either, so I can't NOT reccomend it. If you want a game with fun sword/pillar?/club/whatever gameplay, and interesting combat, then yes, try it out. But if you're looking for great customer service. Then nope. I am on the fence about this one, really.Before any of you say ""You have only 4 hours on record what do you know"" I played it through the Nexon site before it went to Steam. So nope.			"

												Alright, I was pretty pumped to play something new and original in the MMO space. But I gotta say, for being new and original... this game is pretty boring. Maybe I didn't give it enough time, but I don't necessarily think that's my fault. Here's why.1) The intro story sets up nothing for a new player. There's a giant spider attacking a tower. Why is this relevant to me? I can't connect with this chick who's mysteriously talking to giant spiders... And maybe I could get a little narrative on why this village chose a giant spider as its guardian anyways?? There's just too much left out, but what's worse, I'm not compelled to want to learn why. I'm compelled to♥♥♥♥♥blast some gnolls with my tree, and that's it.And then there I was, clicking with no real danger to me. Nothing had hit me, or even come close. I even did the first few missions, thinking okay, I get the basic controls, let's get into something challenging... but no. I got to the gnoll boss in the second mission and realized I was thinking about how much fun I'd have playing something else. And maybe it could have been better if I was playing with other people, but there was just no one. I sat on the boat throwing dice for 5 full minutes waiting for someone to join my group, and it was only when i was 90% through the dungeon did someone join my group. Now, I will say this game has absolutely BEAUTIFUL graphics, some of the armor i saw on other players was just really cool looking, same with some of the weapons. And character creation was surprisingly robust for a F2P game with paid cosmetic options. But I feel like this game focuses too much on how cool everything looks, and forgets that gameplay needs to be fun, too.			"

												Very buggy visually, horible audio with multiple sounds coming from one npc at the same time, gameplay was boring from the start since its complexity revolves around furious left clicking, and the emphasis for the devs seems to be cinematic cutscenes rather than making a fun game. This behavior seems common on games whose characters tend to look more ""anime"" shall we say. If it looks like crap, sounds like crap, plays like crap, it's crap.			"

												This game focuses on combat, and it is so unbalanced. The game is instance based, but when the instances all look the same, you'll get bored very fast. The game is too easy because you get end-game gear randomly in your mailbox. Like all of Nexon's games, there is a huge in game store with pointless cosmetic items that expire in a few months (you probably won't even play for that long). The game's visuals are nice, but when you are near other players, they are covered in a brown cloak. When the game has trouble rendering things when there is nothing to render in the first place, there is something wrong.0/3 Loco the blacksmith hammers			"

I decide to take a break from playing any Nexon games, next thing ya know I return and I'm permanently blocked :/I sent an email about 2 days ago using the billing pp thing and they still haven't replied.Don't ever get your hopes up about reaching a high level because before you know it, it's all gone.

												Very repetitive slow-moving beat-em-up MMO game. It's fun for about the first 10 hours, but then I realized I'd have to put in another 20 using the same 3 attacks and I uninstalled it. Not worth it considering how many other great beat-em-ups are out there.			"

												Honestly, if you could click a single button and skip all the pointless dialogue, I'd recommend it. As it stands, half the game is rapidly clicking to skip sialogue screens so you can turn in your mission, grab the next, and get back to the fun.Pros:-free-third person hack and slash-character fighting style customization-party-based dungeon crawling that is still doable in single player-the gameplay is fun-pretty-the crafting is straightforwardCons:-buggy (not a new problem, or one they're working very hard on)-the storyline is told through written npc dialogue-skip one page of dialogue at a time by clicking again, and again, and again, and again.....-poorly written npc dialogue-the story is fluff. It's just a way to slow down your fun. "

												you know what? this game isnt for me at all. you dont make it very clear what im suppose to do on the ship. im stuck there and nothings happening. why do i have to make a party to finish a quest when the mission is very simple? why cant i just go to the boat and do what i have to do and leave? why make this difficult? and you wonder why people arnt playing this. beautiful begining though, i was like man...this game is awesome. but then i got into town to the docks and onto a boat with no objective. im lost.... very lost and your not making it simple enough. if im stuck there im not going any further because that tells me the game will get much more complicated from here on. also in the begining, it was cool when i was battling some chics giant spider pet for no reason, but when it went to a cut scene and its running away from me climbing up a wooden and stone tower on a already crappy and condemed building. why didnt the whole place fall down when the top tower came crashing? am i missing something? did i not see holes in the floor when i was going up before the big spider fight? did i not see the entire building im walking on in crap condition? so lets say i was in a lighthouse with a rotten bottom and the top of the light house came crashing down...what do you think will happen to the bottom of the lighthouse? yeah thats right. the whole building would collapse. its whatever... enjoy your game.. im going somewhere else			"

												If youre looking for a new take on the Action MMORPG. well go somewhere else. Generic gender locked classes. Single player game that's begrudgingly MMO it seems. meh controls. gameplay that offers no challenge. this may just be the first 10-20 levels as i'm currently level 9, though they didn't make me work at all for it. overall, just a generic MMO with not really any redeaming value aside it feels like a jrpg with how you interact with NPC's. so if that will sell it for you, then it will. for me, i'm going to keep playing and hope it gets less boring			"

												This game gave me cancer so instead I'll tell you the 10 easy steps you can take to making a traditional tiramisu at home! Ingredients3 large eggs500 grams [~12.3 oz.] Mascarpone cheeseEspresso or Strong CoffeeBoudoir biscuits/ Lady fingers/ thin cakes(optional) 1 cup of cognacPowdered cocoa [or instant chocolate drink mix]Sugar (to taste)STEP 1 : Crack and make 3 large eggs into two different bowls (use a large bowl for the egg white and a smaller bowl for the yolk). Make sure that none of the yolk gets mixed with the egg white, otherwise the egg whites won't whisk properly.STEP 2 : Whisk the egg yolks with an electronic whisk and gradually add sugar until the egg yolk becomes thick, creamy, and light yellow.STEP 3 : Add about 5oo grams [~12.3 oz.] of Mascarpone in another bowl and give it a quick stir to loosen it up. Then, with the electronic whisk, mix the egg yolks and Mascarpone together.STEP 4 : Wash and dry your whisk and then whisk the egg whites until they form firm peaks. Continue to fold the egg whites into the Mascarpone and mix until there are no lumps.STEP 5 : Put that to the side. Make some strong espresso and let it cool.STEP 6 : Line a large and fairly deep dish with lady fingers (boudoir biscuits) and pour over two thirds of the coffee mixture.STEP 7 : Put half of your egg mixture over the top of that, followed by a thick dusting of cocoa. Use an instant drinking chocolate, as it's a little sweeter.STEP 8 : Dip more lady fingers into the rest of your coffee mix (don't worry if you run out; you can just knock up some more) and carefully place them over the the top of the cocoa.STEP 9 : Empty the rest of your egg mixture over that and dust with cocoa again.STEP 10 : Leave it in your refrigerator for two hours and serve.Now take the tiramisu out of the fridge and stuff it all into your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, wait 3-4 days for results.

												Hated it. I played skyforge for a bit so the combat system felt borrowed. Just trying to play the game I felt tunneled, I was stuck in a ♥♥♥♥ing tavern for 10 mintes then they told me to go back after I jammed escape just trying to not feel trapped, when I was already at the TL;DR point with the stupid chat and questing set up. I reached level 3 by running to a town. Honestly it feels much more open playing skyforge, which is this games equivelent, and that too is an instanced world. I may have played less than an hour but I want my time and disk space back. Bravo to those who can handle this game past an hour. You're a god damn paragon.			"

												A nice blend of hack-n-slash and MMO. It's alright if you play with friend(s), but if you go solo, this game might last you 30 min. As with any H-N-S, the fighting is repetitive with your attacks being the same and the baddies being the same. Prepare to fight the spider mob reskinned about 8 times. F2P makes up for a lot of this, though it also suffers ""pay2win"" with auto-party res(surection) for sale for real cash and gear that makes you Norris-like. Prostitution has gone digital as you can purchase thongs and string bikini tops for your toons for a whopping $20! The story is very good and is perhaps the game's strongest pro. The beef that I have with the game is I feel like content is deliberately withheld from me JUST so they can charge me for it, instead of additional content for sale. 6/10 Best played as a break from your main games and only in small bursts. It's not awful but not that great either.			"

If im gonna play an action mmo, i much prefer a Neverwinter, or ESO type... (niether of which were able to keep me interested) Though ESO came close, it just simply ended up being a hollow shell of TES name..

												The game SUCKS. WHY? THIS game gives NO HEADS UP when UPDATE. They rarely have updates THEY FOCUS on COSTUMES, NO NEW SKILLS, or CHARACTERS. TERA KEEPS IMPROVING has way more updates. They actually try to SATISFY PLAYERS even has LEVELING SYSTEM took out the STAMINA so its MORE EQUAL to other MMOs. Leveling is way easier. TERA when UPDATES they give TIMES so you KNOW WHEN YOU CAN PLAY. RIP VINDICTUS!! IMPROVE YOUR GAME!! Even WARFRAME has more UPDATES when it UPDATES they let you know to RESTART GAME. What have you GAME MAKERS actually done to improve? to make better? HOW to IMPROVE? Could make a new class how about a GUNSLINGER the guns could shoot MAGIC bullets or REGULAR. MAGIC BULLETS would be great though since the BOSSES have HIGH TECH GUNS. Evie should have more healing skills when wielding staff - that cooldown is ridiculous. Easy mode should be more solo able. They cut the BOSSES ATTACK WOW what about their SPEED TOO use DODGE move TWICE and BOSS STILL RIGHT BEHIND YOU then you use potion might as well let the BOSS finish you. Going to anyway since you'd be playing a game of CAT (boss) and MOUSE (you).			"

												Vindictus is one of those MMO's that you can't miss out on. It has fantastic graphics, characters, environments, and more. In this review I will be breaking down the good parts, and the bad parts in category. Good:Gameplay:  Vindictus uses traditional real-time combat that is both fun, and hilarious. Each level has a multitude of scattered object that the player can pick up and use as a weapon. From pots, to enemies corpses there's hardly anything that your character cannot use. Because of this, you will have many hilarious moments when whacking a boss with a cleaning broom. After the final blow to every boss, you go into slowmotion, where you can see your character in the act for some extremely amazing screenshots. Graphics: The in-game graphics are some of the best to date. When on the highest possible graphics, the environments, characters and enemies are stunning and feel real, despite the fantasy world it takes place in.Storyline & Lore: I'll be perfectly honest, the games storyline isn't very intriging. The game takes place in it's own universe with diverse, and utterly odd creatures and dietys. The game features so many sub-plots to the point that the main storyline isn't really important, and is optional. The game is not voiced over, instead upon speaking to say a quest giver, you will see a picture of them, and have text only dialoge. Trust me, you do NOT need ANY storyline to get sucked into the game.Community: The game's player size is pretty healthy. From levels 1-80. Despite the healthy size, it is not neccessarily a friendly one. There are few ways to really interact with other players. The guild systems are simple, basic, and do absolutely nothing. The chat system is decent. Most players do not interact with one another, this is more of a ""help yourself"" type of community.Overall,Good:*Amazing Graphics*Great, fun, and interesting gameplay mechanics*Great in-game economy*Great variety of maps, dungeons, and HUBS*Relitively healthy player base*Amazing musical scoresBad: *Unfriendly community and playerbase*Borderline ""Pay-2-Win""*FREQUENT crashes ( server based )*Extremely hard to run on any computer*Lack of variety in missionsVerdict: 8/10 NOTES: Only play this if you have a relitively healthy and powerful PC. I have frequent crashing on a fairly new system. God Bless,-TheFurryFox "

												This was a very interesting and enjoyable romp, the story line was nice and I liked the event items I received when I started to play. The customizing was okay and although I'm not fond of having to purchase certain types of things in the cash shop I figured it was typical of this developer and moved on.I did have a few somewhat annoying issues, which is where to purchase better gear for my avatar. The gear I found was okay, but not as good or powerful as I expected as I leveled. The shops and crafting was a bit confusing & asking for help didn't always spawn a helpful reply. Finding companions to game with wasn't simple either, nor was finding parties to do specific quests. But it was fairly entertaining and fun which is what it's supposed to offer, so in that area it succeeded. "

My computer specs allow me to run next to high settings and yet when i put all the setting on the lowest of the low somehow this game will only give me about 47 fps  hell i can't even get the game to properly give me ratio resolutions on a laptop Nexton has severly limited it to the point where you have to play it full screen or the window mode will actually go beyond the bottom of your screen. This is rediculas.I just have to just say it NEXON IS CRAP EVERYTHING THEY TOUCH EVERY GAME THEY AQUIRE TURNS TO♥♥♥♥♥♥AND OR GETS DOWNGRADED FROM BEING A GREAT GAME TO A GAME THAT IS BELOW AVERAGE. If I were Steam I would remove all of Nexon's games. Nexon is a bad company and allowing people to play their games through Steam is  saying that Steam will allow Nexon to continue to get money and resorces to keep turning great games into bad ones. Games are suppose to be fun. Nexon clearly does not seem to understand that concept. I would not reccomend this game or any game that currently is owned by Nexon.			"

The only drawback is the limited customization options you get for your character and it's mainly just different outfits you can purchase from the store, and the fact that the classes are genderlocked. However, if you can get pass that I'd recommend it to anyone seeking a good hack and slash mmo game to jump into.			"

												Boring, repetitive and lack-luster gameplay. Lack of a story and no special dialouge from specific classes despite the fact that this is an RPG. The characters essentially take the Gordan Freeman ""shell character"" route in the storyline, and that doesn't really work in my opinion. The only strong suit is the raid-bosses, which are fun when you have a lot of people. 5/10, very bare minimum game, boring and repetitive. "

And while they are still implementing all the class types and spells, its an excellent beginning and a real breath of fresh air. Why isn't the Source engine being used for more MMO games, because once you see this eye candy you will find it hard to put up with WOW or other pedestrian graphics. Definitely recommend to download.			"

												I read several reviews before I downloaded this game, and even though several of them were bad reviews, i decided to download anyway. Then I made a Nexon account and started playing. Three things stood out to me: One, the game was ok, the startout was fine and te character creation was pretty good. Two, lag like hell. I have a pretty nice computer, and I don't get lag in very many situations no matter what I'm playing, but this was just crappy server lag. Three, BUGS I read a review by some guy that said if some other company took over this game instead of Nexon that it would end up a lot better. From what I've seen, this is true. When I play the game, even if I turn it on highest volume, I get NO sound. None. I've seen several other bugs as well that just screw the game over for me. But to top it all off, half the time I can't even play simply cause the log in box shows an error message and won't let me log in. Until Nexon gets their♥♥♥♥♥♥together, don't bother downloading.			"

												The biggest selling point for me was the combat system. Surprisingly has lots of depth and plenty of bosses to test your metal. Best description I can give it is if Monster Hunter and Dynasty Warriors had a really glitchy and laggy baby. Games are player hosted in 4 man parties, these parties can go to 8 man raids for bigger boss fights which is difficult to host for many without a higher tier bandwidth connection. Game also has some server issues in general. Game would be perfect if not for the mentioned problems.Combat is sweet, presentation is superb, and game is actually translated into proper english!			"

												If you’re looking a hard-core boss fights, this may be the game for you. Since recent patches “Jan 2014” to the game, levelling has never been so easy! Doing the main quest and little bit of side quest will get you max in no time. Story is very good if you bother to follow, but where this game really shows its true colours, 'is the boss fights' with intensive, hard, proactive game mechanics you find yourself trying to defeat this boss over and over. But once you think you have mastered this boss fight you fail to dodge his attack and fall over and die.			"

												Nyeah... I REALLY REALLY wanted to love this game. And, maybe if I had played it two months back I'd have enjoyed it more. The character/ weapon designs are just fantastic. The trailors for it made me cream my panties... but...recently I got into Raiderz... it's not nearly as pretty as Vindictus, but the fights...  they're just not as fun. This game feels very hack n slash compaired to Raiderz...  Where as in Raiderz fights feel like actual fights, requiring split second decisions. You have to anticipate your enemies attacks and know when to go in for the kill... Rushing will just get you dead dead dead...  I'd hope to have a similar experience in Vindictus... but after two hours I was bored and disapointed... Also was very annoyed by the game's interface, and dialog was very final fantasy-ish. I'd recommend Vindictus to someone who wants a pretty and modern looking MMO that is unique. But the level of indepth combat just wasn't what I was expecting or hoping for. Zerks from raiders would like Vindictus... They're very ""hur hur slashy slashy.""			"

												Loved it  up until I hit the level cap.  The game itself is genius, calling it a ""unique"" MMO conparing to all other MMO's out there. It's a Third Person Dungeon Runner with beautiful graphics if your card can handle it, great game to play with friends, and on a brighter side, It's flippin' free to play.  Now to get technical, there is however some flaws like in most MMO's. In Vindictus you won't find yourself adventuring around so much. In fact, you'll be running around the same dungeons over and over again until you reach certain requirements to pass on to the next. There really is no questing besides the ones you pick up in the two cities. The  classes are gender blocked, meaning each class is a specific gender. But on the flip side its fast, fun, easy to play and a great game to waste some time with. I'd give it a hard 8/10.			"

												One of the best renditions of Third Person point-and-click combat available. Combining elements of Monster Hunter combat and an MMORPG environment. Combat is entirely controlled by the user including controls for movement, dodging, aim (what little there is for a hack and slash), and mouse-button skills.A perfect combination of Valve Engine's physics enable environmental destruction and being able to pick up and use any object as a weapon.The one downside to the game is the rather repetitive battles in-lieu of Monster Hunter. Characters set up a battle by the Docks and are loaded onto a boat before leaving with your party. Battles are linear and very enclosed with monsters spawning all the way to the boss.Overall, the game is a great play.			"

												Hack Slash and CRASH!The game is simply beautiful (on max settings). It has taken the MMORPG genre, and put a v8 twin turbo 1,200HP engine right under the hood and thrown the gear into overdrive. It's fun, it's emersive, it's just something outrageously different. Even though F2P mmo's are out there, and everyone is trying to find a new one to play every couple weeks because you get tired of the grind fest, this one is fun and keeps you playing the whole time.The story? It's alright; but you really play for the fun of playing with other players and killing everything you can with extremely strong and seemingly appropriate gear. And guess what? The girls in this game actually have appropriate gear for higher teirs that cover up their body and protect them properly. The mage still has revealing clothes, like she does throughout the whole game, but she is still more protected at the endgame.The annoying part is the endless grindfest from lvl's 60-80. It's is monotoneous and never seems to end. But is is fun when you have friends to do it with. You will have fun, and you will enjoy the game.It's not so much ""P2W (Pay to win)"" as you might think. You can get extremely great endgame gear and you can make the gear if you want. The difficulty of doing so is very high, but the payoff is great and it is possible to have great equipment when you're at lvl 80.So have fun, go shoot monsters in the face with magic bolts and arrows, or killing them with a heaping heck of a huge sword, or maybe hack and slash 'em with your double swords, or lances, or just punch them in the face until they die a brutal, uncomfortable death.

												Vindictus is a game that hasn't seen a lot of popularity, but it doesn't mean it is terrible.The Action combat in Vindictus is TRUE action combat.The levels feel difficult to complete on your own, but that adds to the action.Combo's in Vindictus are very fluid and easy to execute, and just feel very nice overall.There are a total of nine different characters with their own unique weapons.The classes are Gender-locked, but they do have great customization (if you want to pay real money for it.)Each class is unique in their own way. Arisha is a mix of Magic and Swordsman ship. Being able to cast spells and enchant her sword with Arcane Energy to do a lot of damage.Hurk is just an berserker. He does insane amounts of damage in as little time as possible.Evie is the traditional ""mage"" of the game. Using her staff OR a scythe, she is able to attack from ranged with devastating magic spells.Kai is an archer. I think that says enough.Overall, Vindictus is a very good game and I HIGHLY reccommend it!			"

												This game has come a long way from beta, without ruining some of the older charm the game had to offer. I find my self coming back time and time again. One favorite aspect of mine is; the game is not limited to your equipment or something absurd, it's limited to the player YOU and your skills. Of course I recommend this game 10/10 would rate again. That said I give it a 9/10. Another thing, they fixed plenty of the current issues, when you were hacked kind of agreed to that (which is dumb I know) but you agreed during that time in the game's early state that you didn't mind being hacked.

												Nyeah... I REALLY REALLY wanted to love this game. And, maybe if I had played it two months back I'd have enjoyed it more. The character/ weapon designs are just fantastic. The trailors for it made me cream my panties... but...recently I got into Raiderz... it's not nearly as pretty as Vindictus, but the fights...  they're just not as fun. This game feels very hack n slash compaired to Raiderz...  Where as in Raiderz fights feel like actual fights, requiring split second decisions. You have to anticipate your enemies attacks and know when to go in for the kill... Rushing will just get you dead dead dead...  I'd hope to have a similar experience in Vindictus... but after two hours I was bored and disapointed... Also was very annoyed by the game's interface, and dialog was very final fantasy-ish. I'd recommend Vindictus to someone who wants a pretty and modern looking MMO that is unique. But the level of indepth combat just wasn't what I was expecting or hoping for. Zerks from raiders would like Vindictus... They're very ""hur hur slashy slashy.""			"

												Finally, Vindictus comes to Steam. A casual, yet action-oriented MMORPG. Perfect for playing in moderation and taking plently of breaks in between the action. Plently of boss fights and lots of replay value. Only cons are lots of network lag from other players with bad connection playing from foreign countries (Just host your own missions and there is no lag), and you really get shafted by playing 100% Free (Super-limited Storage space).

												The game opens with a decent story line, and rich graphics. Play control is a responsive and fun with a destroyable fantasy environment. The player models are also well done and very customizable, however that is where the great parts end.Expect to grind the same levels over and over, usually gaining little experiance or key loot along the way and trading in everything for the next gear set. After getting mid to high range, expect to get hacked as this game is very suseptible to both in game player hackers and people stealing accounts, even when you utilize a 16 digit random password. The only thing more insulting than the terrible security is the utter lack of customer service. Too bad, this game could have gone somewhere.			"

												Loved it  up until I hit the level cap.  The game itself is genius, calling it a ""unique"" MMO conparing to all other MMO's out there. It's a Third Person Dungeon Runner with beautiful graphics if your card can handle it, great game to play with friends, and on a brighter side, It's flippin' free to play.  Now to get technical, there is however some flaws like in most MMO's. In Vindictus you won't find yourself adventuring around so much. In fact, you'll be running around the same dungeons over and over again until you reach certain requirements to pass on to the next. There really is no questing besides the ones you pick up in the two cities. The  classes are gender blocked, meaning each class is a specific gender. But on the flip side its fast, fun, easy to play and a great game to waste some time with. I'd give it a hard 8/10.			"

												This game to be short is a great game at first. Let me explain. This game an i had a great connection, i would play it and i would get coupons for things you usually had to pay for. I would play this game for a long period of time and it would reward me with more coupons, and this would keep me playing. Even when i would log off for a year and a half i came back to the game giving me a crap load of skill points (which i instantly through away). After that the game would give me Permanant stuff. like hair coupons, underwear coupons, etc I took it as a reward for playing for so long. After this i played for about 50 more hours i got off for another half year. Upon arriving back to vindictus. it told me that i had gotten nothing new, which i found odd. usually it would give me atleast one thing like a new coupon or weapon set. but no, it came out to be that it game me a box that i got 1 potion for the long wait. i said ""meh"" and carried on. going into a high level dungen i noticed then I HAD NO WEAPONS NOR ARMOR, this was infuriating! seeing as though the game game me ""permanant"" weapons. i had to abort the mission where then i came back to town, looking for any kind of weapon i could use. i found the market place and found that all weapons my level were selling for 3 quarters of a million coin ( i obviously dont have this kind of money) so i then wonder around the map trying to find litteraly anything i could use. i stummble in the forge and buy a staff for really cheap. i say sweet and go back into the mission i needed to do. when i arrive at the mission i find myself not able to do any kind of damage to the things i need to fight which it takes me about 30 minutes to do a normal level. i figure ""why not go to a lower level to get money so i can buy a staff my level"" i then find out that there are level penaltys for level diffrence frome a missions level to my level which give me 0 coin. this also makes me mad seeing as though im stuck to where i am till nexon gives me another ""permanent"" weapon.in short:Pros:*Story*Gameplay*Multiplayer*Rewarding*Fun to Play CharactersCons:*It's Made by Nexon			"

												Game is fun. Even though I agree that Nexon is crap, don't let it be the reason to avoid the game. Vindictus is probably one of the most important games of Nexon so they can't ruin it unless they want to be dead. The fighting is beautiful. Everything is dodge-able and blockable if you time everything right. But it doesn't matter because you probably will get hit.For much of the game, you can solo it.The community is dead since there aren't many players. That's why I recommend the game. It's still awesome but I need a team to continue on.Not pay to win but grind to win. LOTS of grinding. In fact, they might as well call Vindictus Grindictus.			"

												One of the best if not the best MMO I have played in a long time. Its combat system is unique, nothing can compare to it. The physics are just phenominal, and the customization is fantastic. Any fan of MMORPG's have to play this game. Once I started playing, I couldnt stop. It is at the top of my list of game recommendations. Really, you need to play this!Other review's say that it Nexon and all the games they produce are 'pay2win' games. So, to them i throw this. If gamers wanted a game that was COMPLETELY free and caused NO PAIN IN PLAYING IT, the whats teh point in gaming?Most games today, on the PC, have a pay2win or pay2play system. Every game I've played in the past and present, along with a few select games not on PC, requires money. And if it requires money, it requires A LOT of it. Don't quit great games like Vindictus just because of said P2W systems and few trolls here and there. Enjoy the game for what it really is: A hack and slash MMORPG unlike any other.			"

												I played this game back when I was a Kid. I fell in love with it. The selection of Characters mixed with their abilities and how each has thei own strengths and downfalls, the sheer action of the game as well will have you sitting there enthralled it this brilliant Masterpiece. Sure, it has it's flaws and some Minor Connection issues here and there. But over all this Game is a Most Have in my oppinion. Hell, The only this stopping me from playing this game right now myself, is the fact my Gaming PC Broke. Lol. xD But as I was saying from Before. This game will Enthrall you with how engaging the Combat system is. I found myself willingly going back in to the same levels when I needed to grind to get higher so I could Progress. I honestly felt like a Badass when I could just hack my enemies to pieces in a matter of Seconds. This game is a missive 10/10 in my oppinion and ask any Veteran of the game you see and I'll bet you that they'll say the same.Hell, back when I was a boy I was so hooked on the game I would wake up every morning at 4AM before I had to go to school and Play in PvE, Do some PvP here and there, but the best part for me at that time was the Dragons that they addd. I'd Wake up and I'd Enter the Lobby and wait there until the Proper number of people joined and we'd hunt ourselves a Dragon!Yes, this game is amazingly addicting and fun. No, it is not a flawless game, no game is and every game has there flaws or small Blemishes here and there. But due to it's Content, Engaging story line, Immersive Combat, and STUNNING effects and graphics. Like I said before. This game is a Whopping 10/10 in my eyes.			"

												Well, it's hard to say for sure, but I do like the combat, and many things in the environment can be used as weapons. Destructable landscape is a nice touch, so is being able to pick up a recently slain enemy's corpse and beating another enemy with it. Extremely gratifying to the raging sociopath in us all. ;)The quest system...well..it could use some improvment. An empty room/building screen with some thumbnails of NPCs gives you a quest. If you pick the right NPC. Not game-breaking, but a little awkward in my opinion, and the journal system seems lacking.The skill system seems a little confusing. For example, there is no obvious way to undo points once you've alotted them. I actually buggered up an early quest that was supposed to teach me how to use the skill system because I inadvertantly put the points into the wrong skill, and could find no way to undo it. So now I can't seem to advance past that quest, short of going out and grinding out some more kills to get more points. However that doesn't seem terribly easy to do, at least as a solo player, since as near as I can tell, everything is instanced. I could be wrong about that, since I got terribly frustrated with that scenario and logged off. I will go back and look into that, and if I am wrong I will change my review accordingly.  Failing that I may start over, and try again.  Simply because the combat is worth a second chance, despite my own ineptitude.Overall my first impression is that it is a decent game, with extremely fun and visceral combat. I would like to see more character customization,(that isn't hidden behind a microtrans) but that is a complaint in many, many games for me; microtransactions or not.  I have always disliked age and gender-locks, but it is an action game with RPG elements, not a straight-up RPG.  Gender-lock bothers me more in RPGs, as some games go overboard with 'sexy girls with ridiculous physics and sloot-boots'. I want a female warrior, not a pole-dancer.But anyway, I digress, as I am wont to do. Yes, I would recommend this game if only for the great combat. Perhaps it would be more enjoyable if I weren't a die-hard soloer, but it is not a bad game.			"

												Okay, I will say right now vindictus is NOT FOR EVERYBODY. Pros:-Competent combat system. Each character gets 2 to 3 weapon types to choose from which greatly alters combat. with fun souls styled combat.-Graphics. For a source game it looks pretty damn good.-Dungeons. They're fun and well designed.-Generous devs (At times). You are often awarded cash shop stuff for free such as the vvip service.Cons:-Grind city. Levels 1-60 are a chore and leveling speed varies at times from decently paced to agonizingly slow.-Forced to re-run dungeons early game to advance. Gotta meet the next dungeons level requirement.-Long party waiting time. Bring friends.-Awful story. I personally cant be bothered to pay any attention to it. The story is awful.(This is my subjective opinion)Final thoughts: Vindictus is a good game riddled with some minor flaws. I recommend it to anybody willing to spend 60+ hours to get to the meat of the game. Raid bosses are neat. And it has a decent virtual economy. "

Then there's the lag hiccup that reminds me of an old scratched record.Gameplay:  The story and battle system are the driving force that keeps me coming back.

												MMORPGs are usually pretty boring in terms of combat. Even TERA gets kind of old.But holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game. The combat makes TERA's combat look like last years child's play. Each class has unique and jaw dropping skills in their arsenal to bring to the battle. None of the classes are boring, except for maybe Fiona. Oh, and also their gender locked, which might bother some, but I don't mind. As good as the combat is, the way the game is structured is not as great. Dungeon crawling constantly is pretty cool, but if this was a game in an open world that would've been crazy good. I would've been thoroughly impressed. But nothing's perfect.So in conclusion, if you're itching for some hardcore fighting, come try out Vindictus. This game beats any game I've ever played in terms of combat. I am so genuinely content each time I come back to this game, only because of the sick♥♥♥♥♥♥you get to pull in a fight. The only reason I'd say this game is bad is that it isn't open world, and it's Nexon.			"

												Vindictus is a game that hasn't seen a lot of popularity, but it doesn't mean it is terrible.The Action combat in Vindictus is TRUE action combat.The levels feel difficult to complete on your own, but that adds to the action.Combo's in Vindictus are very fluid and easy to execute, and just feel very nice overall.There are a total of nine different characters with their own unique weapons.The classes are Gender-locked, but they do have great customization (if you want to pay real money for it.)Each class is unique in their own way. Arisha is a mix of Magic and Swordsman ship. Being able to cast spells and enchant her sword with Arcane Energy to do a lot of damage.Hurk is just an berserker. He does insane amounts of damage in as little time as possible.Evie is the traditional ""mage"" of the game. Using her staff OR a scythe, she is able to attack from ranged with devastating magic spells.Kai is an archer. I think that says enough.Overall, Vindictus is a very good game and I HIGHLY reccommend it!			"

												Ok, im gonna start by saying this game is NOT perfect.  Nexon makes it SO hard to get gold and A LOT of the items in the cash shop is rather expensive.  But, this game is rather fun.  combat is really smooth depending on the character you play.  Maps are a bit over used, you will be playing the same quest over and over, just to get gold on some useless items.  Music is AMAZING, BUT THEY DON'T USE IT!!!  Thats probably my biggest complaint, the music in this game is probably some of my favorite type of music.  The quests are rather dull especially since they dont have music.  The story is decent for an MMO, but I only read the first and last chapter.  Im still going to be playing through it again and read through the whole thing.  If you want a pretty fun MMO, play this, its free.  Just don't spend any money on this if you are just going to play it once.  It also a lot better with friends to talk to while playing since it can be boring on the season 2 quests since they are a bit more open.*edit*I feel its about time I edit my review, with 200 hours under my belt now, I still feel the same.  Season 2 quests are a bit more fun now playing with randoms, but can get frustrating when the host has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet.  Most of the grinding once you reach level 60 starts taking way to long.  You rarley ever level up, but like I said up above if you have friends that grinding isn't going to be as boring.  You are going to want to craft most of your own armor once you reach high levels since most of the time the marketplace gets overly expensive when trying to buy equipment.  If you happen to find yourself on the West Vindictus server, come and join me and my friend's guild Sekai.  We are rather small, but we are willing to take on more active players.			"
