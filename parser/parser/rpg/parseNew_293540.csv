												Good game - Good concept - Greedy DevelopersThe game in itself is fun and enjoyable.  However the developers are too greedy and as a result ruined the experience.  When I say 'sparks', it means bought currency.  Two major gripe I have with this game:Inventory SlotsThe one biggest problem I have is inventory slots.  You start off with a tiny inventory which requires 'Sparks' to unlock FIVE slots.  Then each additional unlock, the amount of spark needed to unlock an additional five slots becomes higher.Currently I have 40 slots in my inventory and to unlock the next 5 slots, it will cost me $4+.  Even parts you have equipped on robots count towards inventory so this gets filled up very quickly.Robot Slots So you unlock a robot slot with sparks.  But wait, they limit your inventory so you can't build anything with your new robot slot!  Thus making you spend on inventory in addition to buying new robot slots.  CratesYou would think the game had enough money sink?  No.  When you win matches you have a chance to get crates.  To stand a chance to open these crates you will have to use sparks otherwise the picklocking tool has 0.1% ~ 5% chance depending on crate level.  I have no problem with this in games but when you add in the other two money sinks then this makes the game have a bad f2p model.ConclusionStay away from this game unless the developer gets their head out of the gutter.  Too many money sink.  With the inventory limit it literally forces you to use sparks to progress.  Yes you do get sparks in-game but no where near enough to make the game enjoyable on being free.  I have no problem spending cash on a f2p game but there are too many money sink that are not really optional. "

												A concise review...of course, mileage may vary (different people have different experiences, values, and expectations which will result in different opinions):PROS:Great art styleGood combat mechanicGood bot custom creation system (except for upgrading parts, which is one of the worst in any game I've played, see below).Devs are active in the communityCONS:Most importantly right now: In-game purchases of boosts (credits for example) DO NOT WORK. The devs are aware of this complaint but insisted it is working fine. I have evidence to the contrary (several screenshots during and after the 24hr boost, there is no difference in credit gain whatsoever. It was a wasted purchase.Tutorial is severely lacking (lobby chat has a never ending supply of new players asking what to do, how to build a robot, etc.) Limited to small skirmishes of 5 v 5 (some may not necessarily mind this, but for others, it just feels to small, too ""quick.""It's very common for players to go AFK because they get rewarded either way (even if it is a loss). This creates a serious imbalance in the small 5 v 5 match.VERY limited inventory space (devs want you to buy more), which means there isn't much room for customizing or building bots. Creativity is discouraged.The price increases (it isn't static) if you want to increase your inventory. Again, another discouragment of creativity.Player is nickel-and-dimed for almost everything imaginable in game (customization, extra space, being able to form a squad/group with more than 2 players), etc.Chat Lobby has no filter, there is no way to mute/ignore/ban players (people spam porn sites and obscenities quite a bit, again, screenshots taken).Upgrading your parts is expensive, yet adds very little value. Almost all parts gain minimal durability and durability only. Each part already has numerous properties, but none (w/ exception of damage for just a few weapons) ever get upgraded. It's absurd IMO as a higher tier part ought to have a relevant increase in quality...in Guns and Robots however, it does not.You get random bonus chests at time, but have to pay a lot of sparks (purchased with real cash) to unlock them.SummaryThe game is worth playing as long as the player understands that this is a game in which the player is expected to spend quite a bit of money to enjoy the full experience. However, spending money in-game (vs DLC Starter Pack) just doesn't work (for me) and the devs don't seem to be concerned with it.It's a game I'd play casually, for kicks, but would not recommend to friends and definitely would not recommend spending money on, a lesson learned the hard way after purchasing the Starter Pack and spending sparks in-game. It's a cash grab through and through.			"

												There are many things wrong with this game. 1. This game has tiers, like in Robocraft, so you aren't supposed to be put with people who will annihilate you in one shot. However, I was put in a match with one of the top 10 players on the enemy team. They one-shotted me, and later, two others, on my team. To put this into context, destroying an enemy robot in this game can take over 10 seconds of non-stop fire. 2. As I mentioned before, this game has tiers. But you can only 'tier-up' when you upgrade your robot's parts. However, the only thing upgrading parts does is give them more health, except weapons, which get more damage as well as more health. This means, in higher tiers, your robot will have more health and do more damage. This also means every other robot will have more health and do more damage. What's the point? Am I missing something?3. There is no progression in this game. Yes, you can upgrade your robot, but as I said, the whole 'upgrading' system is linear and useless. 4. There are very few people playing it. Getting into a match doesn't usually take any more than about 30 seconds, but being put into matches with, quite often, the same people, who are quite often, using the same robot each time, can get repetitive, especially when they use over-powered weapons. 5. You will occasionally get a box as a reward after completing a match. You can open these boxes with credits, the in-game currency, with a success rate as low as 0.25%, upto 5%. Failed attempts will not destroy the box, only the tools. You can alternatively pay real money in exchange for 'sparks', which you can use to open the box first time. This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that these crates can give unique robot parts. That's right, people who pay real money get an advantage over those who don't. Personally, I have enjoyed this game so far, but I simply cannot recommend it to anyone.			"

												Great concept and graphics, but here are the failures that make it not playable at the moment.1. The matches are ENTIRELY too short. I'm talking 30 seconds to 3 mins max. It takes longer to queue and ready up for a match than it does to actually play it.2. No sufficient tutorial. I ended up wasting a lot of currency because the game did not explain what to do to a reasonable degree. I'm still not sure how to take components out of the items.3. There is NO respawn, which in turn is part of the reason the matches are so short. Everyone dies in 3 minutes or less, game over. You didn't get to play so now you're back to waiting to queue for another match which will be the same exact boring match where you either die quickly and don't play, or the match ends up ending a few minutes later.4. There's not as much customization as the game lets on. Some things clearly work better than others, and many of the options are redundant. You'll never have a need to mix and match so many things, you'll just want to go with what works better than other things, and it will become obvious quickly.			"

I always got into matches with OP enemies with 4 sniper rifles or a couple of rocket launchers and i would be destroyed in a second! The worst part is, by the time i killed a robot (which i never did) it would have gone to the parts shop, upgraded itself then gone the the toilet and to the cafe and eat a 5 course meal and blow my head off with one shot.This game is too hard on the new players and it is almost impossible to match the OP players in the lobby because as you rank up THEY do aswell.1/10.

												Right off the bat, the guns feel awkward to aim. What makes this worse is that for the first hour or so of play, your weapons will feel like PEASHOOTERS. Even when i had enough cash to purchase a flamethrower that the shop said dealt ""heavy dps close up"", i was point blank shooting with it for 10 seconds, and they showed no signs of damage.The module system is confusing to get in to, as instead of just buying weapons, this game sneakily makes you purchase weapon PARTS (two, to be fair.) The same for all other main robot parts; everything comes in 2 pieces.For a free game, and with only 800 mb, it isn't the worst. But still not worth it.			"

												One of the worse games I've had the honer of playing. The concept is great but its anything from playable.The three mayor concerns with this game is.A. There is no matchmaking to speak off. The game tries to put up equal teams but it cant so every game is stacked and one team ALWAYS rampages the other.B. The game is mostly played (as most f2p) by east block players and Russians on their dial up modems with even ISP on dial up modems. Result a good base of players warps all over the map and abuses this by using high speed bots.C. There are hundreds and hundreds of bots to combine out of several different parts, alas there are only about 3 viable concepts that everyone uses. So youlle constantly face the same bots and the only way to beat them is using the same bots and getting the drop on them.It is however free to play so I wouldnt say not to give it a try. The microtransaction system is extremely fair and well implemented (big thumbs up there). Compiling your bot out of different components however is rather puzzling as there are quite a few stats and they arent very easy to compare (also see remark C).Another big thumbs up is map design. They are very very small, but extremely well designed making them a pleasure to play as they make use of the Y axes unlike any game Ive seen before.			"

												Guns and Robots can best be described as World of Tanks meets Loadout. Let me explain why:It uses the World of Tanks method of resolving objectives. If you blow up, that's it, you're out. If everyone on one side dies, the game is over. The objective rarely is considered in most matches because of this. It also uses the idea of disarming an opponent based on where you shoot. Shoot the feet, you slow the opponent. Shot the arms, you disarm it. Shoot the head, you impair it's vision.It's like Loadout in that, in order to succeed, you have to experiment with your build. There are a sea of different parts, whcih are used to make modules, the components of your robot. Each robot is made up of one chassis, one engine, one body type, one battery (or two), one head unit, and 2 to 4 weopons and weapon frames. This means you can tailer the bot to match your strategy as much as you wish. To make this more absurd, you can equipt up to two devices, which allow you to pull the game to your advantage.Also like loadout, you ave to buy every part. Unlike Loadout, however, there is a limited inventory for each part, and each part can only be used on one robot at a time, so you are encouraged to just have one, with a few spare pieces to mmix it up a few times.In short, it's intense, it's annoying, but once you deal with it, it can be a really good game. Or a really bad one.			"

												I have not really played much of this game, only participating in two of the gamemodes so far, but I'll go ahead and list what I like and dislike so far.Like:+The customization. It's very similar to Loadout in a way, but with robots.+Third person perspective allows you to see where you're getting shot from (most of the time).+The matches are (normally) quick, unlike many games.+There's an option to automatically repair your parts and resupply your guns after battles using credits. This is INCREDIBLY useful if you're lazy like me, or if you simply like to be able to jump straight into your next match.+Almost all the parts that I've seen are able to be bought with credits, and from what I've seen, they're not very expensive.Dislike:-In order to expand your inventory, you have to spend 'sparks' which I believe you have to pay for. Please correct me if I'm wrong.-If you leave during a match after you've been defeated, you can't do anything with that robot until the battle has finished.-It's always five on five with no respawn. It's made worse by the point above this.So, even though there are some bad qualities, I would definitely recommend this game, at least to try it out since it's free. Please, leave any feedback if any of these things change, or if I was wrong about anything. Hope my review helped!			"

Posted: September 22, 2014
												The gameplay is rather fun.  When you can actually play.  Several issues make this difficult, some part of the game and others the players.There are three game types, though two are rather similar.  Capture the Batteries and Plant the Bomb are games designed on moving something from your base to theirs or the other way around.  Capture the Batteries has you go to their base to claim one of two batteries to return it to your base.  Only one battery spawns at a time and capturing has no regard for where your own are.  Plant the Bomb has you take a bomb to their base and put it on their totem.  You defend the bomb until it explodes or you go back to your own base to disarm a bomb if they have planted.I would have no issues with these two types of games if nearly every one I've played didn't end up being about the third game type.  For those types of games there should be respawns and it shouldn't end until those objectives are finished.  Instead it comes down to who can blow away the other team first.  Destroy the other Team is the third type of game and it's how all games seem to play out.Why would we bother doing complicated battery and bomb objectives if destroying them works just as well?  Beyond that issue is the reward system for playing games.  You get the same random rewards for winning or losing.  I've often gotten better rewards from losing a match then winning.There is a repair and ammo replacement system that costs in-game currency.  This would actually be a concern if each match didn't make enough coin to pay for both every time.  I don't see a point to these systems if even a lost game gives enough money to deal with it.  All this does is govern your profit from a game, which is rather random anyway.The queue system is another problem.  I can no longer count how often I have been put in a group with or matched against someone far below my robot level.  A one or two level difference isn't really enough to notice but when I'm 5 and they are 1 it becomes the difference of me shooting once or ten times for a kill.  It seems to be a practice for level 4 and 5 robots to group with level 1 robots, forcing them into matches one or the other shouldn't be in.In match group balancing seems to be firstly priortized by robot level (which is good) and secondly by personal level (which is bad).  This comes up often.  If four level 5 robots are queued then it makes a match of 2v2.  It will then use the levels of the people to balance the teams.  Personal levels determine, without spending the real money sparks on, what parts you can upgrade to which point.  So in that instance it makes sense.  But then we get a match with four level 5 robots and two level 3 robots.  It will make a full group of the level 5 robots and put the others together because the personal levels of the level 3 robots is higher then some of the level 5 robots.  With some variation of individual part levels, this puts a heavy toll on the lower level group.Upgrading parts changes your robot level.  A level 1 robot will generally have all level 1 parts.  You can have higher level parts and still be a lower level if you don't upgrade some parts or even take off some.  So I can go into a level 1 match with my mostly all level 6 parts simply by dropping most of my guns and special ability parts.  Even at one gun of two or of four, that level difference is enough to blow them away.  This seems to be a common problem with leveled games and I don't really have a fix for it.The speed at which I upgraded didn't feel that slow or fast.  I played matches to get upgrade parts and money and then the parts would upgrade while I was sleeping.  Building new parts and the robot as a whole seemed easy enough.  You have a build platform that you simply start slapping parts on.  There is a blue transparent version of the part to help guide you.  You can even upgrade a part as you are using it, leaving less need to stop playing just to wait on one part.You start with a basic robot and a slot for a second robot.  Additional slots can be purchased with Sparks (real money).  Now while you have room for two robots you do not start with enough inventory space for all those parts.  You can build one robot, the one you start with, and that's it.  Buying more inventory room starts at a simple 10 sparks, somthing that you start with.  This gives you enough space to either upgrade your robot or get a few off parts.  The next space buy is 85.  After that it's 160(unsure of the exact number only that it was way up there).  For a game that talks so much on customizability this is horrible.In it's entirety I would not conclude that this game is pay to win.  However, some elements are in the game that certainly make it headed in that direction.  The better crates you can get either with Sparks or by chance after matches contain arm peices that allow two or three weapons to be attached to them.  It is horribly expensive to get these as it is only a chance to get them per crate, but it is still there.  They can certainly claim it is possible to open these crates with the coin bought crate openers but at a 0.01% chance to open there is little point.From what I could find the only thing that is ONLY purchasable by Sparks are the paint colors used to customize your robot.  You start with a few blah colors and can buy more at outragous prices PER color.I wouldn't say this game is unplayable by any means.  But there is a lot that needs to be done to make it a fun and stable environment.  Everything from the basic robot construction to Spark purchases needs to be reworked to allow for a smoother time in the game.  I'm all for them making their money but it is currently too spikey in prices.In closing I will add this one tip:  To detach a single part from your robot be in build mode and click the part so it is highlighted then click the detach button below the robot.  To do this to the ability parts you will need to rotate the camera to see them and then do as the other parts.			"

												At present, Guns And Robots is more than a bit of an unbalanced mess. The game divides up robots you create into weight classes and 'Tier' ranks, in an attempt to make sure that any robot you design will never face down a robot considered to be 'more powerful' or in a higher 'weightclass'. Unfortunately this system is extremely broken and is constantly getting exploited by experienced players so they can game the system and earn fast coin.The basic issue is that right now.. since robots are so highly customizable, every individual part needs to be invidually 'scored' based upon its power curve and over all effectiveness. Two Dragonov (Spelling?) Sniper Rifles, while considered Heavy Weapons, can actually be bolted onto a light weight robot chassis and have only minimal impact on your over all speed. This allows for high speed, high maneuverability designs that still pack a heck of a damage _punch_. This problem compounds even further when you move up from a 2-Weapon Robot Frame to a 4-Weapon Robot Frame. 4 Sniper Rifles, or 4 Hailfire Rocket Launchers basically allow you to faceroll over most of the competition, yet still somehow keep your robot ranked in the ""Tier 1"" (""Lightweight"") groupings. If you want a 'build your own robot' game with a ranking system that WORKS, go try ""RoboCraft"". ""Guns And Robots"", at present, is an unbearable mess.			"

												I had to create a recommendation for this game after reading all of the negative reviews saying that you need to pay to play.  This is not the case, sparks are earned through achieving daily goals, leveling up, or steam/game achievements.  I played around 100 hours of this game without ever purchasing a dlc, but after enough hours I decided to support the game (even though it was through a game bundle).  This isn\'t a huge game or the shiniest, but it is really fun if you enjoy taking apart and putting together your robot in different variations to take into battle.  It is true however that some weapons are nearly useless compared to others but that has been due to the devs nerfing one thing, and as a result some other gun becomes op.  There were a few generations of weapons that I personally watched everyone use, then get nerfed, then everyone would use the next op weapon just to get it nerfed as well.    This game really is ftp, try it and don\'t listen to the negative nancies who claim you have to pay to play.			"

												Very simple: I'm tired of trying games that haven't been properly tested. Game started up in Nvidia Surround across 3 monitors just fine. Tutorial got me as far as the workbench and no farther. At that resolution, which is one of those listed under options, the workbench area is offscreen. I had to stop the tutorial to fix and post bug to forum. Went back in game to give another chance, and the tutorial had backed up a few steps, wanting me to spend in-game money I had already spent... so I couldn't continue tutorial because I no longer have money to buy parts I already own. All of this less than 10 minutes into game. Spare yourself the grief. Graphics suck anyway. Not even worth the bandwidth to download.			"

												I didnt expect this game to be this good. In this game, you control a custom robot, and fight in team fights (1 life per match) which feature objectives like capture the flag, plant the bomb etc...but they are mostly negated because you can finish the match by simply killing the enemy.Pros:- good robot customization, you can build your own robot from scratch, make your own custom weapons and other robot parts, it most fun part of the game, using and testing different loadouts- ladder and ranking system, your robot reaches higher rank by upgrading its gear- not great, but good graphics (they are cartooney like borderlands, there are black edges around models) - nice looking themed maps- there is also some cosmetic customization like hats, profile pictures and masks which you can earn by doing achievements; you can also change robots' colors- you can earn everything for FREE, it just takes time, you can earn exclusive currency (the currency you usualy need to pay with real money in other games, you can earn it in this game), by completing achievements and doing daily missions- nice achievements to earn- there is tutorial- even though population is small, you still can find the match if you search for minute or two- it seems that some of the players are acctualy bots, although game doesnt state them as such, this of course, boost number of matches played- friend and guild system in game¸- you can play minigame while you are searching for matchNeutral (things i like but other people might not) :- you get only 1 life per match and matches are really short, thing about this is that this system allows more players to play, since matches will be done in couple of minutes, maybe 5-10 minutes at most, and players will search for another match so new players wouldnt have to wait long to play; if matches were longer,2-3 groups of 10 people would play matches for more 30 minutes which will mean other players probably wouldnt find anyone to play with and would just quit- there are consumables and more powerful ammo you can buy before the match, even though you can buy it for free, i dont like this systemCons:- devs are trying to resurrect this game (they havent updated it for more than 1 year) using indiegogo site so players can fund the game... however it seems that project is failing ( they have raised 180$/50000$ only)- i dont think there is that much skill included in this game, basicaly only thing you need to do is make a good robot, and you will kill anyone with weaker one, no matter how hard they try- robots could use more functions, like jumping- only three game modes : capture the flag, plant the bomb, and basic elimination; however most of people ignore them because you can consider each mode as elimination mode, when one team gets eliminated they lose- this game could use casual servers where you can pick which one to join, also you cant pick mode you want to play either- playerbase is small, under 50 players at the time- it seems that most players are children, i dont blame them however, it is game for them, but still, adults can enjoy it aswell- robot making can be confusing for new players at start- there are inventory slots, which are very annoying even despite the fact that you can unlock them for freeI recommend you to try this game as soon as possible, because it will probably get closed very soon.Why did i vote no? Well simply because there was nothing that lured me to play the game again, after i quit it.			"

			This game is Guns and Robots by Masthead studios. Enjoy. I also posted my review on steam. You can read it here - http://steamcommunity.com/id/SatanovichZ1/recommended/293540		

Matchmaking is really fast, I never had to wait more than a few seconds to get into the action. There doesn't seem to be any issues with lag which as I am located in Australia and I was worried that there may not be servers in my region. Controlling your robot is very easy, weapons on your left are bound to your left click and vice versa. I think you can also fire weapons individually with number keys. So you basically are allowed a lot of versatility e.g. you can have your long range weapons on one side and your flamer thrower or shotgun on the other side for close quarters. I found that it was really fun to play. Only problem I found was that you weapons don't fire from you perspective, so often my projectiles would clip into objects even though I had a clear line of sight of targets. Also because my weapons sat low on my chassis I couldn't fire over certain cover. It's something you just need to get used to. You seem to get plenty of the base currency from playing matches. I was quickly able to buy components and set up my robot in the basic configuration that I wanted after just playing just a few matches. You have a limited amount of inventory space for robot components. You need to use premium currency to increase it's capacity. But I found that you can just sell components that you don't want to use anymore to make space for replacements. With all the base currency you earn it's easy to afford new components in case you want to switch back or try something else. There appears to a large variety of options when it comes to build and equipping your robot. The modules you assemble together to build your robot are made of multiple components. This basically allows you to customise them e.g. a base component may apply a damage modifier to your weapon at the cost durability etc. You have a player level which progresses as you complete matches and unlocks upgrades for modules i.e. for chassis, weapons and so on. Upgrades require special components which I had trouble earning as rewards for matches. You can buy them with the premium currency which I thought could sort of force you invest money to avoid a grind, because you don't seem to earn a lot of it through matches. However I did notice that you can actually convert the free base currency to the premium currency and as I said getting the base currency seems to be pretty easy. So getting enough of the premium currency might not that hard at least in order to acquire low to medium tier upgrades.For a game that is described as cartoony I really like how it looks. Yes some of the designs are pretty silly, but some of the robots look really really cool. There is quite a large amount of variety and interesting examples in the designs created by players. The most memorable build which I saw was a big heavy one that slowly glided around. And personally I built a heavy weapons platform with four guns and tank tracks. It was really slow but it felt cool as hell to move into the fray with it =)This game is absolutely worth playing so far. Not a single major issue. Even better with friends which by the way are easy to form a squad and play alongside with.			"

												Interesting concept that misses the mark.. No Single Player to speak of and only quick 5v5 battles with no respawn.. Physics are quite bad and it seems you could hit a robot with a rocket and they will not be affected in any other than a damage.. While Its not P2W.. You have to pay with out of game currency to up your inventory slots in order to hold the myraid of different parts.. This customabilty is the best part of the game.. As it is free to play I hope you all DL and try it for yourself ( with friends if at all possible). As for me I will be uninstalling because as 3rd Person shooters go, There are far better options available!			"

												I enjoy playing this game, but there are too many annoying elements for me to recommend it in good conscience to other people. Though if you want to subject yourself to rubberbanding foreign players, peak-a-boo cloaked shotgun/aoe players, and instagib builds, then by all means this is the game for you. And yes I know it's hypocritical to criticize instagib builds when I use one myself, but you have no choice unless you just plan on dying all the time.The devs need to take a long, hard look on weapon balance and the overall [fun] factor of the game if they want to retain players. They actually have one of the best, if not the best F2P model I've seen and it's a crying shame the game eventually becomes such a frustrating experience. And yes this game is a frustrating experience if you aren't rubberbanding. Think about that for a moment before considering to download and play this great game.PS: Don't believe me about rubberbanding? Go fire up a download/upload to choke your bandwidth and see how you magically live longer while at the same time having negligible effect on your aim.			"

												I am a fan of Guns and Robots, I will admit at first I was skeptical about G'n'R but after I found out what parts I was best with, I wil admit I started having a lot of fun. There is a huge amount of part combinations, but I will admit many of them are nearly useless. It is important to try lots of parts and see what you are best with, otherwise you may be in for a tough time. I like that there is no pay to win in game, everything can be unlockied in game, and to make matters better I have never had to grind for anything, I actually have too much currency! How often does that happen in a free to play shooter? There are also a good amount of cosmetics and paints to decorate your many many robot parts with, and there are a decent amount of maps and game modes as well. You probably won't get bored  fast. Overall I recommend this game to anyone looking for a good free to play shooter, lots of customizations, lots of weapons, and  a good mixture of game modes and maps. and best of all no pay to win!

Some things were very unclear. I tried to forget about it and I just wanted to build my robot, so i did and it looked nice. I entered a game and everyone completely obliterated me. I didn't even know who was on my team! I finnaly found someone idle and kept shooting him over and over... i didn't even know if i was even hitting him. So he turned around and shot me 3 times and I died. This game is extremely confusing and most of the time boring with sluggish movement speed.

												Honestly, I would recommend against this game, for the time being anyway.The art style, the sounds, the various interesting maps, and the sheer amount of customization is great in this game, but it falls prone to one thing being better than the others in just about all cases. I built the heaviest possible robot, with automatic machine guns on both hands, and I've been getting the majority (if not all) of the kills in every game, and haven't lost once.That brings me to another point, regardless of the game mode that you're playing, the game devolves into a deathmatch battle, because killing the enemies makes you win anyway. There's no respawn, and you often get thrown into 2 v 2 games to make matchmaking quick, so games last all of a minute or two at most. Nobody even bothers with the objectives, let alone acting as a team.Anyway, all of these things can be looked over while playing the game. Short matches? You get to play with more games. Ideal build? Cool, more kills for you. With just this stuff, I would recommend the game, because it's a bit of quick fun. However, there is one problem that really makes this game a drag, and that's progression.There's nothing in this game to really make you keep playing it. You can level up by getting experience from battles, but leveling up only allows you to upgrade your equipment to a higher level. Upgrading equipment requires money and parts, and the parts cost Sparks. You can only get Sparks by paying for them with real money, or (guess what), leveling up. You play battles so that you can play more battles to get the stuff so you can upgrade stuff to play more battles. This isn't fun or interesting, this is just grinding for the sake of grinding. Why would I bother upgrading my stuff so I can win more games, when I'm already winning games in order upgrade the stuff?Anyway, this is an interesting game to try for a little while, but don't expect to be playing it for more than a few hours. Maybe a little longer if you have some friends. If you want something similar that actually rewards progress, go play Robocraft or something.			"

												The concept behind the game is simple enough and quite appealing: build a goofy robot out of random scrap and junk, strap some equally goofy weapons to it like dynamite launchers, bootleg laser guns and acid filled water balloons, and then send it out to go blow up stuff. It's rather cartoony, doesn't take itself all that seriously, and in theory would be a fun quick-fix sort of game.In practice though, there are a lot of imbalances and glaring issues that ruin the fun. The main offender is the upgrading. You have to upgrade your robot's parts and weapons to stay competitive, but it's not just a matter of paying some coins and waiting for the upgrade to finish like other games of this type. You also have to have upgrade components which can only be found randomly as post-match rewards or bought outright with premium currency (aka the cash shop), and if you don't feel like buying them then you're going to be stuck waiting a very long time for enough components to do anything. This really kills the experimenting that should be a part of any game about robot building, as it makes you not want to invest in new parts or weapons. Having the timesink alone is more than enough to slow down upgrading, adding in the extra element of components just comes across as a very cynical cash grab attempt.Weapon balance is also another problem, as too often one player can steamroll an entire team by themselves just because they managed to build a heavy bot with four launcher arms. Supposedly battery power and weight limits have a limiting effect, but since launcher rounds travel in a straight line and not an arc, it seems all too easy to just build something that can tank all the opposition's fire and spray AoE misery right into their faces.And finally, there are a number of overall fit-and-finish oversights that left a sour impression. The tutorial gives only the very barest of detail on how to build a robot and doesn't give even a basic explanation of how weight limits, battery power or engine choices affect your movement and ability to use your weapons. A lot of features can only be found by just clicking around and stumbling onto them. Even some very basic functions aren't working right: there's an achievement for renaming your robot, but at the time of writing this you can't even do that. Shouldn't the things tied to achievements at least be checked to make sure they're not broken?There's a fun idea here, but the game loses its appeal quickly and still feels like it needs a lot more work before it's ready to be played more than once out of curiosity.

												I really like the fact that you can build and customize you're own robot and even paint them it makes it more realistic.                 Anyways I am seeing forward to the updates in the future! And i hope there will be more weapons depending on wich lvl you are and new armor.			"

												only thing that keeps me from playing the game further is that if you dont pay, you are going to be stuck with either only one bot, or 2 small ones since inventory space is very limited, and there is no way of buying enough currency to just upgrade the inventory (predatory prices, is either the 1 dollar pack or the 4 dollars one and the one dollar one is not enough to get an inventory space upgrade), and seriusly if i'm shackled unless i pay or i have to mind very carefully what i build, i'm going to play annother game.of course this is a rewiev from someone that played less than an hour, so try and see, people might love having only one mech, or 2 flavors of the same one			"

												LOADS of weapons, and you can use up to 4 of them in any combination you want on your robot. If you use 4 you will be slow, so most of the times you will be using 2 of them, but its okay since the balance is needed. It has 'capture the batteries (flag)',  ""plant the bomb"" and ""team deathmatch"" modes. The game is soo funn, and there is no time limit before you get bored because your robot is simply 100% customisable. Every part (chassis, body, head, weapons and , yes, HATS) has around 10 different models on shop with different status so you can make the perfect robot for your style. Its like Team fortress, loadout and robocraft combined. The downside is that it is new so it still have some problems like having only a few maps and some balance problems (there was a specific very overpowered wepon but it got nerfed yesterday, but still some are clearly stronger than others). But at least every weapon cost basically the same and it is not pay-to-win since you can earn all the currency just playing. The only 'pay to win' thing here (too expensive to buy just playing it normally) are cosmetic things, like hats and painting. All in All, it gives loads of fun but need new maps. Would recommend for sure.			"

												At first I thought this game was going to be fun.  Building robots and marching them into battle.  Sounds good right?In two days I leveled past 20.  I estimate I was doing above average.However, in that time I started to notice wildly mismatched games happening.  I started to notice wildly OP weapons -- I'm talking weapons that could literally one or two shot me when in quad configuration -- and I was running a fully geared and very slow (as a result) heavy build with 5 levels of armor throughout, etc.  It seemed like that should have meant something.Well, it doesn't.  There are severe imbalances throughout Guns and Robots and it's a Pay2Win game along the same lines that World of Tanks is.  It might not be SEVERE pay2win, but it's still there, just like WoT.  It's a damn shame.This model of game is also designed to create addiction.So, I uninstalled it.Your experience will vary, but I cannot recommend this game.  I typically end up locking such games or uninstalling them, and in this case, since the balance is nowhere near as good as WoT, and because the game itself has a paltry inventory space that's basically begging you to pay money to field more than one robot, the variety isn't even close to WoT, where you can field a half-dozen tanks easily without feeling anyone pinching your wallet, etc.: Guns and Robots earned an uninstall.I'm just tired of this sort of game design.  It's all shiny, candy-coated and looks good on the outside, but once you start chewing on it, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.			"

												Tons of fun, is currently having some major issues dealing with, well I'm not sure, launch?  There were 10-19 people in queue for 3 runs in a row and in all 3 runs it paired us up in 2v2s instead of 5v5 which is the default.  Which are ok, but much less fun.  Needs to be more chasis etc to choose from, but a decent selection to start off with.  Game bugged out and I couldn't close menus or exit.  Worked completely fine last night and I had a blast.  8.0/10 last night,  6.0/10 until they fix stuff.To warn, there's a fairly sizable 'pay to play' barrier it looks like once you get beyond the early stages of the game.  You'd have to play like 200 matches just to expand your starting 25 slots of inventory just to get another 5 slots. 25 slots is enough for 2 full bots with no/a couple extra parts  And you HAVE to have a 2nd bot to play because your other bot goes inactive while it's upgrading.  This game could be amazing, I mean hugely tons of fun, but the implementation needs some major tweaking...and a lot more players.I've made edits to my review after the most recent patch.  Which in theory has attempted to alleviate the inventory issues, but simultaneously has me stuck at a loading screen so now I can't play at all.  Devs have acknowledged the issue and are working on it.			"

												I'll start with the positives, 1.it has a large amount of customazation which is good2.its fun just to mess around for a little whileNow the negatives1.there is no balance in the weopons 2.it has a weird customization proccess, and placing thing on your robot is bizzar you might as well just press the button equip3.I didnt enjoy the way this game was pressented, i like the concept but the execution needs work.Now some little things i didnt enjoy about this game4. when your ready for a battle the ranks are determend by star color with no numbers that i saw. who thought that was a good idea?5.you can spend alot of time trying to kill one guy and nothing happens, then he just runs and someone else gets the kill6.health bar was hard to read they should indicate what is actually being damaged on the enemy robot than just a bar that tells just about nothing.I didnt put much time into this game, but i really dont plan too. it wasnt that fun to begin with the tutorial is slow paced, i can read faster than it was being written. so i wouldnt recommend this game to any of my friends, unless the liked a pay to win kinda feel.

I strongly do not recommend this game. Key reasons: Poor matchmaking (both between robot tiers and player levels)  Lack of control on what game mode you wish to play  Constraining Inventory.  Problem with players using ""hacks""  No notable support for the community.  No way to report offending players. The matchmaking itself is pitiful at best, you can have teams set up in such a way where all the experienced (sometimes even veterans) players are on one team, and all the new people are on the other. So it seems it does not balance player levels, only robot tiers. Sadly it is very difficult to find any decent games with anything above a T2 robo (it goes up to 10). At T3 I am lucky to be able to to score a 2v2 match, which often ends up including T4 bots (on the opposing team), with just the T3 going vs the T4.You cannot choose what game mode you want to play, and yet there are daily missions that ask for very specific things such as ""win x amount of team deathmatch/bomb squad/capture the battery games"" and countless other daily missions that require you to be the one to fulfill the objective of such matches, which is exceedingly difficult, because not only are you unable to choose your game mode, but far more often than not, players treat every match (regardless of game mode) more like it is team deathmatch.Inventory is also constricting enough to strongly encourage using some $$ to expand it, though you can get most if not all things from simply playing the game ... the time it would take to achieve such things will really have you question if its worth it, especially with the quality of the game as it is now.There is apparently also a problem with people using auto-target and wallhack cheats, I have been in games where not even 5 seconds in, I would be getting shot by an enemy using railguns (in the suburbia map) across 5 walls, not being in line of sight, and not even firing in my direction (evident by bullet trails into the sky in another direction).Lastly, it seems there is no real support for the community, as there have been countless times when i have seen the chat being absolutely flooded with spam (with no apparent chat bans or otherwise), and throughout the weeks I have been playing it I have not seen any key updates to solve any of the major problems of the game. In fact, a report button seems non-existent! So with that I feel we can probably assume the game developers arent that interested in really keeping the game in a good shape it should be.			"

												Oooh, Guns and Robots... It is such a shame how unpopular you are. Sure, you are not the greatest game out there, suffering a number of issues both big and small... But deep down there is a fun game here.Alas, what holds G&R back so hard is it's balancing and small, unsocial community. With any game that allows you to build your own weapon, there are bound to be dirty players who exploit this fact and abuse it to create frustrating builds that take the fun out of the game and either force you to build your own cheap build, or just attempt to tough it out and try your best to beat them (And if you have skills, chances are you will at the very least do a considerable amount of damage to their bot). As for the community, there is hardly anyone left... On average, there is probably around 150-100 players daily, if you are lucky.. Often this means fighting the same people over and over (said people probably being the cheap builds that frustrate you so), meaning it gets dull seeing the same robot over and over, nothing new and creative coming your way, and even worse for noobs to the game who get put together with level 80 vets. Even moreso, the community is very quiet for the most part, not much chattering going on between players, which further makes the game feel empty.Does this mean the game isn't worth playing? Hell naw, when I first started playing, I really enjoyed it. It is fun making your own personal robot that suits your playstyle, mixing and matching parts and painting them all up to make a fancy killing machine that people will easily remember and adore/fear, and when you join a guild, it is fun working together to gather enough money to help invest in the guild to purchase buffs that give you a slight edge against your rivals. That, and the fact that this is the most generous F2P game I played in a long time, where all the things you can buy with real money don't have serious impact in the game, keeping it fun for everyone.If you do plan on playing this, though, I suggest you bring some friends... It is much more fun when you have a crew you can rely on instead of having to go solo and risk having to be paired up with bots... yeah...			"

												Welp, I found out why this game has mixed reviews. It's because it's dead.I saw this game on launch, but since I had a toaster at the time, I didn't play it. Once I finally got a little more than a toaster, I was looking at the F2P section and saw this. Because I never got to play it before, I decided to give it a go, even though the reviews weren't the best. What I found was a solid game. Obviously not finished, but solid nonetheless. It was really fun, until I realised that the grand total of people on at that time was: 23. Sadly, yes, that was the truth. I found out because I was wondering why I was fighting the same people over and over. Even though the servers are up, it's going down the road that many other F2P multiplayer games on Steam have gone; inevitable extinction. So yes, this game was good, and still is, but no one is playing it anymore. Rest in pieces  to another indie game by and obscure company, falling into the abyss of forgotten games.TL;DR I can't recommend this game since it's sadly dead.			"

												At first look, this game seems mediocrely entertaining and sometimes fun depending on the user. However, after some experience with the game, the game has come down, quite a lot. The game is good on the gameplay side but in the multiplayer ranking system, the game doesn't do that well. For example, If you are a new player who joined the game and you are just expecting to have fun, well, don't have your hopes high. Because the game is randomly ranking you, you might end up with a severely high-ranked team, which you will have no chance against. This isn't a one-time thing either, it can happen anywhere, anytime. That said, I still enjoy this game, due to good players, and such. But if you want feedback, look below-. Pros .1. Good gameplay2. Entertaining for long periods3. Good controls and graphics. Cons .1. Can get quite frustrating. [Depends]2. Glitches here and there. [Sometimes]3. High usage of bad language by players, not the ""normal bad language"". Some which are personal. [Sometimes]. Suggestions .. Improve the ranking system [Foremost important]. Disallow usage of same weapon 4 times, this is another issue i've seen where people use high powered weapons to destroy you easily. [Secondary importance]That's all for now, if you do these things, I assure this game will be one of the best. "

												At the end of the day this is a third person shooter with what appears to be a variety of customizable parts, cool weapons, and strategic maps.However, after playing for a while you'll realize that there's actually very little customization at all and mostly combat ends up being two teams of people smash eachother together hammering their fire buttons until the tide turns in one direction or the other due to focused fire.Weapons and components appear to have lots of stats, but more or less all end up being the same. One gun may have 10 damage for 3 shots per second, another 30 damage for 1 shot per second. They'll use about the same amount of energy per second and so on. There are differences but they're mostly minor. Different chasis have different speeds and some other stats, but mostly you're deciding if you want 4 arms (for higher DPS and lower sustained DPS) or 2 arms. That's about it. Light mechs dont seem to have much advatnage over heavies (they go faster, but not really MUCH faster).All in all there are simply better games out there that deliver a higher degree of customization and strategy, ranging from more complex games like Mechwarrior Online to more similar ones like Robocraft.

												Seemed like a fun game when i picked it up, tutorial was a bit lacking but i never let that stoped me.then i went to do some matches (5 of them before i deinstalled the game), and oh boy was that a horrible experience.I'm not sure if this game even has a matchmaking system, but every opponent kicked my♥♥♥♥♥And not just by a little, it felt like my weapons barely dented the opponent (the health bar went down so slowly it might as well not have been) whereas i had trouble surviving even a few shots.overall it felt like the game tried to get real life money from me on almost every turn, now i don't mind f2p games to have some moneytization but this game just feels (and as you can see i haven't played that mutch, so it's just my opinion) like a pay2win game.If You're looking for a game which probably needs a TON of time to get decent and fun, this might be it. if not, don't even bother installing it.

Main complaint: Why lock the movement orientation to what ever way you are facing?  You have a WASD to use.  You shouldn't have to adjust which button is actually forward depending on which way you are looking.  W should always be the way your feet are facing not the way your head is facing.			"

												Right off the bat, it's not a very easy game to learn. I've been trying to figure out a number of  things without any real help from the game. Also it has been exiting for no reason while I'm in a battle so that obviously leaves me hanging with  some frustration.			"

												I played when it was released and then it was fun. It was pretty good as you leveled up decently fast. I returned about 3 weeks ago and I was just disapointed. Such a good F2P was turned to♥♥♥♥♥♥because of the need for money. When I played it, it was a nice cartoony game that was pretty decently skill based. Not you need to spend money to slightly enjoy the game.			"

												I think Guns And Robots is a great game to hop in and enjoy for the following reasons;1# It's easy enought.2# It's got loads of weapons from crazy dynamite throwing flaks to high accuracy laser snipers.3# There are more reasons why it's a great game but you're going to have to peel and feel them yourself!Olso I think this game need a lot more attention, sadly enought, I can't help it.

												Guns and Robots is a free to play PVP shooter game, where you drive robots into battle.  It worked, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  It is multiplayer PVP game, but it has bots that fill matches if it takes too long to fill a match with humans.  Could call it Pay to Win, but barely.  It was fun to play, and easy enough to upgrade your robot, without spending money.  The bots are challenging too. Two of the match modes have Objectives like Plant a Bomb and Steal a Battery, which are easy for new people to do. Has a minigame to play while waiting for queue to pop.  Has some tutorial, video,  manual and a wiki.   Has 3 classes of robots and 150 different components to build with.  You might have to pay money to have more than 1 robot for more inventory slots.Try it, maybe you might like it.  For more info:

												I played the game for almost an hour.Good things:the tutorial was very basic and very quick before letting you get to the main game play.Bad things:I can't express how much this game is a pay-to-win game.I started my first fight with a bunch of people who were supposedly my level, but seemed to have energy shields, boosts out the wazoo and were super armored.  Most everyone carries around high damage explosive weapons and the fight zones tend to be enclosed areas, so...yeah.The amount of enjoyment I got out of this game and the amount of progress I felt I made could be best stated as the equivalent of banging your head against a brick wall.   Not recommended.			"

												I love this game! It has great graphics and amzing mechanics (my favorite being that you can build your own robot and that by destroying parts of your oponents robot in battle it hinders what they can do). But it has one problem... there is such a small inventory for items, you can only build about 2 robots unless you spend a ton of money for more inventory. Although, overall a great game. 4/5 with small inventory 5/5 if they make inventory bigger. A must have for steam users!			"

Was a bit frustrating in the beginning - took me a lot of time to get myself acquainted with all the robot modifications and how to apply them. But other than that and maybe a few minor bugs, this is a really fun and enjoyable game, especially if you're playing with friends. The game has got high potential in my book and I do recommend it to other gamers..!!			"

												When I got this game (Thank le flying sphaghetti monster it was free), I loved it. Making your own robot, your own Man o' War? THIS WAS THE GAME IS WAS LOOKING FOR. The Mechanics are great, the only problem I have is the Robot Speed. Now, having two robots, which of one made to Skirmish, (Which has all light Components, not including Battery), Is kind of slow, despite me even using the Turbine Engine (Or that's what I remembered, I'm playing the game after I finish this), Which I don't get, because my other robot has 4 arms, and Heavy everythin', and It's almost as fast as my Skirmish. That's pretty much it, I guess. I tip my fedora to the developers, for I can quickscope casual scrubs with almost any weapon.			"

I played for twenty minutes and that's all I've gathered. I would have played more, but the teams are lime green and orange, but I'm colorblind. They could at least add an option to change team colors.			"

												All in all the word for  Guns And Robots is 'querky'. It has a lot of ups; and a lot of downs, people tell me graphics are rubbish, nut in the middle of a firefight your not going to be staring at the walls are you? And yes i kinda agree when you tear yourself away from shooting another Robots head off, yes the graphics are a little plastered on. My main problem with Guns And Robots is what im going to call 'class diversity' for example i was in a 5v5 match where 9 people were using the same type of gun, this may not seem so bad for a game like Robocraft but when you look there are over 15 types of gun to chose from its quite depressing. What i like is that you have to keep a constant eye on you health, which is different for every single part of your body and this makes the combat more responsive. Another downside is the community; which is very small, in Robot Ranking 3 for example your more likely to do a 2v2 that a 5v5 as the amount of players at the moment is so small. In a way this is good because you get to know people and its much easier to make a clan, but you'll be versing the same people again and again.So if you like community, querky and somewhat reponsive games; I'd recomment Guns And Robots.

												Guns and Robots is a blasty blast to play.  The customization for your robots (you get two to start off with) is ridiculously fun to mess around with.  Only major complaint I have about this game--aside from limited inventory (worse with multiple robots)--is that the player base is almost completely gone.I recommend this game but wish that more people played it!  I hate seeing good games go under!			"

YOU dream about it I got it, I have two accounts and yeah played all of the games you want. Mostly mainstream but this game is a gem!Im 22 and hitting 23 in August, I have been cultered in Queke and early days of cs 1.5. I use to be in internet caffees playing cs 1.5 from about 9 years of age. I love it!So! This game is like quake on third person view with build your own mechanics on a robot (YOu can make any robot you want). And crazy ninja firefights of MW days in child friendly environment. YOu cant go wrong with this game it is for adults (hardcore) aswell as kids ( novice ) if you want to train your aim for csgo you in a best place my friend. BUt you lack in aim MAKE FLAME TROWER ROBOT LIKE TMMMI, or a brawler. Every1 will scream your name in anger!LOve this would recommend this to friends! <3 GGWP GLHF PMSL I LOVE IT!

The main screen comes up in black and white and there are a couple of cogs spinning endlessly now - been like it since the DLC became active in my game.			"

												For what it is I mean its free so what can you expect. It is a simply robot building game. You are VERY limited to what you can do.Personally, I think there are a lot better Robot games on the market and some of them are free as well. I wouldn't spend a lot of time in this game as you can see I have not.The graphics are pretty good and the game play is alright. I just got bored with being so limited to what the player can do.			"

												My juvenile delinquencies in Guns and Robots have lead me to believe this is a very satisfying stress reliever.  Keep dying in Dark Souls?  Boss just fired you?  Got an exam that you totally didn't study for?  Worry not, Guns and Robots takes away these stresses and fears because the pvp is stupidly easy!  I've acquired two followers, bullied foreigners (which may or may not have diminished foreign peace relations) and imprinted THE LEGEND into the minds of the same enemies I've battered in the past hour (because no one plays this game)!!!

												I like this game. I don't normally play shooter games but this one feels different. The games are quick ( < 5 minutes) and there is no respawning so you have to be careful.While its not strictly pay to win there are a lot of things you could spend real money on. If you want 3 people in your squad you have to pay for that. Otherwise you are limited to only two. The others on your team will be randomly determined.			"

												So after a year I decided to play this game again, nothing much has changed since back then.The graphics are outstanding as always and so is the gameplay. Assemble your robot and launch your attacks against the enemies. Play with strategies or just go for the kill. I have 2 videos, one is team deathmatch and the other capture the batteries. There is also a third game mode, plant the bomb, I will post a video about it on here some other day.In both I was talking through skype with my mate so we played it organized. TDM:

			This is quite a lovely games full of explosions, you should give it a try if this game looks appealing to you, it's free2play and not pay2win.		

CTB: 


YouTube™ Video: Guns and robots - capture the batteries 

			Views: 11		

			Was playing a round of CTB with my mate weasel, round ended up pretty good! Was talking through skype with my mate so we planned it organized of how we would get both batteries and both kills.		

Unless you squad the teams are pretty balanced! Which is hard to find in any other pvp based game out there. You don't get matched with or against players that are more than 1 rank higher or lower, unless you squad ofcourse. Being in a squad brings a lot oppertunities and dissadvantages. You know your mate that he won't mess up and it's easy to talk to (no russian language or an other which you dont understand) and you can use certain tactics to win. HOWEVER you can also get matched up against players ranked higher than both of you. Especially if the gap between you and your mates robot rank is big. So keep this in mind. Now the question might arise, what is this rank that I keep blabbering about? It outputs the strength and agileness of your robot in a simple number ranging from 1-10. Keep in mind that the differences are HUGE. A rank 3 robot can kill a rank 1 robot in 1 hit. A rank 5 can do the same to a rank 3 etc. Ofcourse this isn't always the case, but that are the differences. So yes the games are very balanced.For once this game isn't pay to win, you can pay for buffs or you can earn them ingame with the special buyable currency known as sparks. They are easy to collect or pay like 1 buck per 100 sparks. This brings buffs such as more xp for your character or double golds from games or 3 way squads. Or you can buy cosmetic stuff, shortly said, the gameplay does not get ruined by peoples with a lot money.If you have watched the short videos you will have a rough idea by now about what the game is. I highly recommend you to at least give it a try. The tutorial pretty much covers the basic gameplay and play 1-2 rounds online. Most of the players (that speak english) are very kind and will help you rightaway if you're stuck with something. A good community for once in an online game!The game is free to play, but those game are 9/10 times better than the game for which you pay 20+ bucks. The sound effects are also superb. With a surround system you can hear where your enemy is walking and act according to their position. For example you don't move and flank them when they get close. Visual, graphical, gameplay and community wise I give this game a well deserved 9. There are some minor buggs but they won't ruin your gameplay unless you have invested 50+ hours. Then you might be able to spot the first bug ;) Oh also they have easter eggs in the game! Found a dutch add in the garage.. after owing the game for a year or so...

												It has it's good notes and a few bad, overall, would play again.Starting with the good.Arena style gameplay, is generally fast paced and fun.Cusomization process is simple and streamlined, this stock with this barrel gives you this weaponEach size class has it's own strengths and weaknesses.The Bad.Certain weapons have some balance issues. Long range shotgun rocket launcher that is deadly at any range would be a good example.No players que up for higher teir bot battles, tiers are working, just seems like everyone stops progression at 2Overall it is a wellbuilt microtransaction based free to play arena.  No cash needed but you have to pay for the hats.			"

												Played it for a little while and enjoyed it without paying anything, duelling is fun when your teammates know how to team up properly.Rule of thumb is: Pay for inventory slots with the coins you earn whle playing. Once i did that to have inventory room for two builds I spent some of those coins  on some crate and get lucky to get a new shiny love bear rainbow railgun weapon:

												damn the owners really shekeled out on this one. I'll just sort to the history of this game, from their website;CEO Bagoyil Steinboch created his game in Isreal for one goal, shekels and gold. He poured all of his greed, and hate for man kind into this creation, he called it one thing. One thing he muttered to himself while sleeping every night.. In his private plane, in his limo, in his own mansion. He whispered to him self... "" shekels "".Bagoyil later on created the game "" Guns and Robots "" but he realized after his first 80 million USD made from his work, it wasn't enough. He then went on to go full jew tactics and realesed deals, market deductions and a array of campaign ads for his game, Guns and Robots. He advertised, deals of a century, almost gaining you, the consumer money! But little did the paying customers soon to find out, it was all a sham... The deals where actually deductions of -5%.The guerilla marketing scheme that Bagoyil had thought to be his riches, became his his god-hood in the jewish community. He created a thing, no.. A machine. He created what he always wanted all along, what he and his family dreamed of making all along. He dreamed, of making a SHEKEL GENERATOR.With this creation he made, he was held as a demigod in his local jewish community, they all held him in the highest regards! But even with his billionare status gained from a simple video game, he still did not spare one penny, nor a shekel to his starving village of jewish family. Later that month, all of his family, friends and village died of starvation and some say, you can still hear Bagoyil laughing to this very day. "" muahahha... hahhahaha.. HAHAHAHA...... shekels. ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ "".It later came out that year that the owner of this game was actually Gabe Newell the whole time!			"

												Its an okay game.. I seriously don't think that you can play it for over an hour at a time because it is pretty good at the begining but then it becomes pretty frustrating to play.. I would still recommend it here because who liked robocraft will enjoy here too even though I'm definitly not the kind of person who plays this kind of games.			"

YES!would i have its baby? ONLY IF THE RELATIONSHIP WORKS, AND AFTER THE 3RD DATE!If you dont believe me, play it for yourself!(but its not perfect. i think you should be able to take money out of your guild's bank once a week and sparks once a month, but the guild owner puts a predefinded maximum withdraw so the guild doesnt go bankrupt. Also i think stronger engines should cost more, not the exact same as weaker ones.)			"

												This game, even though I have only played it for a few minutes, is rather unbalanced. When you first get your robot, you get these tiny little peashooters (Thats what they feel like, anyway) that only do up to 8 damage (this is the most I saw) and almost no armor to stand in combat with. Then, once your done with the tutorial, you almost instantly forced to fight other players with weapons that can kill your robot instantly. Once you die, you're out of the match, and you have to repair your robot (I haven't noticed what you lose yet, sooooo.... yea) and then you have to jump back into another match.  The only thing about this game I liked was that, while waiting for a match, you can play a little game while waiting.			"

												Fun multiplayer action game that has a good amount of customization options for your character, but very little inventory space unless you buy some with real world currency. I think the shooting part is a bit unbalanced. I'd prefer if enemies (and you) died quicker because when you match players with random players, the result isn't very good - the level of players in your and enemy team is anywhere between beginner and pro.I still suggest giving it a try for the fun it can provide.

												Kind of reminds me of Loadout, but with Battlebots.  Mixing and matching parts is fun to be a tank, a skirmisher, or a sniper, or a combination of any of them.  Matches are fast-paced and generally over pretty quickly.  Plus there's a minigame during the lobby screen to keep you busy.  8/10 would free-to-play again.Updated after several days of play: The game is pay-to-win.  Sometimes this is not bad; but in this case, do not give the devs any real money.  First of all, you make money fast enough without resorting to cash payment.  Second of all, the devs don't seem particularly active on the topics discussion, updates, hotfixes, patches, hacking, and cheating.  I'd like to know the devs are actually improving the game before I give them money.			"

												first of all, i'd recommend this as a free game for about 15 minutes before moving on to something better. however, some things are probably going to frustrate you like the horrible team balancing that will pit you against bots that could kill you even with a 3 year old smashing a keyboard just because of sheer unbalanced power. your skills just won't matter. this will continue forever, simply because you didn't start when they did, or you didn't spend outragous money to  build the baddest bot, or a combination of both. which brings us to the money issues. the biggest problem with recommending this (at least to anyone intending on spending money) is the incredible scamminess and greed of the microtransaction system in this game. a game developer giving so little for your money, and lying about the real usefulness of many of the things you're buying should be sued for fraud. things like the multitool, that operates like a key to open crates of random items, says 5% chance of opening one of the easiest ones, which should be approximatly 1 in 20 tries, very consistantly ended up being more like 1 in 50 tries, or 2%. the difference between the two, amounts to how many people spend real money on it, before they get something from the crates that isn't total crap. i see people realisticly spending 100's of dollars without getting anything worth having, with the transaction being based on an outright lie.this might be free, but it's very much pay to win, with very little chance, otherwise. i just can't recommend this, unless you love being abused in pvp games, or have unlimited access to someone else's money. even then, go spend that money on a better game.

Also save your Sparks, you get flooded with them at the start and you really should use them to upgrade your inventory slots,bigger inventory = more robots= more veriety = all around more experienced player = finding what your best with fastest = getting picked up by a good guild = a great time			"

												This game is really fun but most people don't try to play it enough to make it out of the tier one rut.First off upgrade your robot. Yes there is fewer people playing the higher tier levels but all the people who played the game for a long time like to go back and play as tier one with over powered robots to mess with new players and get into games faster. If you level up your bot weapons and armor and get to at least tier 3 the games will still be quick to join and more equal robots.Do not buy or upgrade the special weapons like mines or sentries. A lot of people do this and complain about being beaten every game. They are usually weak and uneffective and brings your tier up by one or two. Putting you into games were your robot it self is a lot weaker then other robots. Get into an active guild that play with friends. Make plans to play better or just have people to talk while playing and getting to games. The buffs are way over price and doesn't really help much so I barely donate to my guild. I would not recommend 4 weapon bots. They deal a lot of damage but the armor is low. I use the LMGs at tier 8 and it only take a few seconds for me to mow down 4 weapon bots. Also watch the patch notes on what is getting nerfed and buff. It only takes one update to make your bot the best to the worstIt is not pay to win. Yes the cosmetics cost a lot of sparks that does not help the robot get better. I would not recommend buying keys to the specific crates. I buy a whole bunch of the generic keys and I have open 5 or more of the best crates. Caution: the spam filter is not the greatest. There is one person trying to make people buy sparks from him all day everyday. Try to just ignore it and if you are trying to ask to join a clan ask the people you are playing with in game. Over all I find this a fun small game I play when I am mad at other games. Just don't try to copy everyone else in tier 1 and you will do perfectly fine in this game.-Thank you for reading			"

												I actually really like this game despite all of the micro-transactions. The battles are short and fast paced not to mention, getting into a match is quick and easy. I do wish they would elaborate more during the tutorial rather than just showing you how to use and build a bot, but instead it would be nice to have the game explain how to use and implement devices, buffs, etc. The micro-transactions are not that bad, and its not in a pay to win style. You could easily get a lot off enjoyment out of the game without forking over a dime. I think for a free to play game this is very solid and still has a lot of potential.			"

												Please read all Cons, Pros and the Conclusion to get a full feel for what the good and bad traits are of this game. Cons:- The matchmaking as of the time of typing this seems to be full of A.I. due to the lack of actual people playing the game, which makes this game lose a lot of it's luster and that "" competitive"" feel.- The in-app purchases are both fair and unfair, more unfair than anything else. You have to pay for a ton of sparks to get a VIP account just to have 3 people in your squad ( otherwise you can only have one other person.) Then to unlock nicer paints you have to pay damn near $100, and you have to shell tons of sparks ( the monetary unit used in-game) to increase your inventory size.BUT..Pros: -I, myself have created a guild and am fortunate enough to have met and collected some great and active players to fight along side with and chat between matches.- I don't understand what people mean by the game has "" unfair combat and ranking system."" I have never had my share of win and lose streaks and this game has a pretty fair match making system. -Making your robot is fun! there are definitely three styles of bots that you can succeed with. ( heavy, high hitpoint bots/ light, lightning-fast, fast damaging bots, etc)Conclusion:-This game is definitely more fun in a guild or with friends! if you are a solo player, this game probably will lose your attention in a matter of hours. give it a chance, if you dont like it, you're not out any money.

												I was looking around for a free to play game that looked fun and wasn't pay to win. I came across Guns and Robots and decided to try it out. Next thing I knew, I was playing it so much on the first try. The customization is awesome, and its just so fun and addicting, making you find out which combinations suit your little tin bucket the best. There are very few elements of pay2win (from what I've seen). It merely just adds convenience and allows you get to better things faster. If you don't pay anything, it will only take longer. Which I'm fine with. More time to play the game!			"

												Fun multiplayer action game that has a good amount of customization options for your character, but very little inventory space unless you buy some with real world currency. I think the shooting part is a bit unbalanced. I'd prefer if enemies (and you) died quicker because when you match players with random players, the result isn't very good - the level of players in your and enemy team is anywhere between beginner and pro.I still suggest giving it a try for the fun it can provide.

For one, it would seem, that not all items work in the game yet, or at least, I can't get the Roadside Assistance to work. Secondly, the team match-up balance is way off. It often makes a team with fx. two Rank 2 and one Rank 3 Vs three Rank 3. Or something very similar. I'm not whining, but lossing again and again and again just kills the fun in the game.			"

												OMG, this is a master piece :D The game is mega addicting and the pace of the game is really up to you. You can play the game in any style you like: rush, tank, stealth, tactical, etc. A large variety of weapon choice, although the meta guns are there and they usually work better than other guns. There is some teamwork involved, and cover base shooter elements in this game.YET, there is one huge problem. There is a really, literally, PAY 2 WIN factor, but it's not any kind of pay to win, you will probablly need to pay a gigantic amount of money to do this. There are crates/boxes (random drop or bought with real money) in this game and they can be opened with paid ""keys"" (paid with real money). 3 of these crates contain unique weapons that can't be bought with in game currency, but the most expensive crate contains 2 completely op equipment.The 2 equipment allows the robot to have carry extra guns. Standard robots, bought/built with in game currency, can have up to 2 or 4 guns. But these 2 equipments allows the robots to have double or triple the amount of guns comparing to a standard robot, although damage is reduce, due to the increase amount of guns, the damage is still doubled. When used with projectile base guns, these op equipments allows much larger amount of space being under fired.The pay 2 win problem right now is not common and you can rarely see it, but when you do see it, it's instant gg. unlike most so call pay 2 win games, those gives a slight advantage, but this gives an obvious ""you will stand no chance against a paid robot"" kind of advantage.*I will rate this as neutral if I can since the open season event*Pros:+Free :D+Great art+Large variety of weapons, body parts+Some cover base shooter elements+Interesting maps+Pay 2 win situations are not common+Really fun and addictive+Queue mini game, wtf :DCons:-Pay 2 win situations although not common, the game turns absolutely discoruaging when such situation does happen-Unstable server-Buggy, not critical-Can do a better job on UI-Some achievements can not be achieved yet-Balance between guns are really off *but all available to the public*For now, the game is great and I really recommend it, but when the day where pay 2 win is common, just uninstall this...

												This game, even though I have only played it for a few minutes, is rather unbalanced. When you first get your robot, you get these tiny little peashooters (Thats what they feel like, anyway) that only do up to 8 damage (this is the most I saw) and almost no armor to stand in combat with. Then, once your done with the tutorial, you almost instantly forced to fight other players with weapons that can kill your robot instantly. Once you die, you're out of the match, and you have to repair your robot (I haven't noticed what you lose yet, sooooo.... yea) and then you have to jump back into another match.  The only thing about this game I liked was that, while waiting for a match, you can play a little game while waiting.			"

												Kind of reminds me of Loadout, but with Battlebots.  Mixing and matching parts is fun to be a tank, a skirmisher, or a sniper, or a combination of any of them.  Matches are fast-paced and generally over pretty quickly.  Plus there's a minigame during the lobby screen to keep you busy.  8/10 would free-to-play again.Updated after several days of play: The game is pay-to-win.  Sometimes this is not bad; but in this case, do not give the devs any real money.  First of all, you make money fast enough without resorting to cash payment.  Second of all, the devs don't seem particularly active on the topics discussion, updates, hotfixes, patches, hacking, and cheating.  I'd like to know the devs are actually improving the game before I give them money.			"

												This game has made some serious improvements since the last time I played it. I played it back in the early stages of it, and let's just say the game was a trainwreck. No team balance, getting new parts was fairly hard due to the low income of credits and whatnot, but now this game is AMAZING! Definitely a 10/10 in my book, as well as being listed as a must-play title. It's not Pay-to-Win since people can still get the same parts for their robots with or without paying for the game, and the people who play tend to be very friendly. Also, this game is VERY fast-paced, the matches only last for like 2-5 minutes and they're over when one team completed their objective OR if one entire team of robots have been destroyed. Give the game a whirl, it's F2P, and it's less than a gigabyte, so even if you don't necessarily like the game, you won't waste too much of your time waiting for it to download.Biggest attractions of this game:-Customization is flawless (countless modules including guns and chasis and heads and etc.)-Team balance is pretty good-Community is pretty funny-Controls are fairly easy-A shooter with Robots-Lovely achievements-All currencies are easily obtained while playing the game-FREE TO PLAY!Somewhat of a bummer:-No gamepad support (YET)-Takes a while to get certain parts to upgrade your modules without paying for them with premium currency (Sparks)-Very small bagspace-Only 2 free Robot slots, and it's 85 Sparks to get the third slot (not sure about how much it is to buy anymore)			"

												Uninstalled very quickly. The majority of the game belies inside of 'Customization', and by customization, players generally think ""Hey, I can look different than schmuck number X256!"", but no.Seriously, this game still uses 'rental' features for cosmetics and some items. Rental features went out of style when people quit playing Combat Arms, I don't know why they thought it'd be a good idea here. Basically, you're going to be stuck with Robot Scrapula until the end of days unless you want to play for hundreds of hours, OR you can pay out the butt and get some cool laser cannon, and some headgear, for some cash.The tutorial on how to use the shop was longer than how to play the game, I think that's example enough of what this game is all about.

The game isn't exactly play to win as it tries VERY hard to match you up against people your rank. The actual gameplay is fun.overall I would recommend don't upgrade past rank 2 and just have fun!

												first of all, i'd recommend this as a free game for about 15 minutes before moving on to something better. however, some things are probably going to frustrate you like the horrible team balancing that will pit you against bots that could kill you even with a 3 year old smashing a keyboard just because of sheer unbalanced power. your skills just won't matter. this will continue forever, simply because you didn't start when they did, or you didn't spend outragous money to  build the baddest bot, or a combination of both. which brings us to the money issues. the biggest problem with recommending this (at least to anyone intending on spending money) is the incredible scamminess and greed of the microtransaction system in this game. a game developer giving so little for your money, and lying about the real usefulness of many of the things you're buying should be sued for fraud. things like the multitool, that operates like a key to open crates of random items, says 5% chance of opening one of the easiest ones, which should be approximatly 1 in 20 tries, very consistantly ended up being more like 1 in 50 tries, or 2%. the difference between the two, amounts to how many people spend real money on it, before they get something from the crates that isn't total crap. i see people realisticly spending 100's of dollars without getting anything worth having, with the transaction being based on an outright lie.this might be free, but it's very much pay to win, with very little chance, otherwise. i just can't recommend this, unless you love being abused in pvp games, or have unlimited access to someone else's money. even then, go spend that money on a better game.

												Please read all Cons, Pros and the Conclusion to get a full feel for what the good and bad traits are of this game. Cons:- The matchmaking as of the time of typing this seems to be full of A.I. due to the lack of actual people playing the game, which makes this game lose a lot of it's luster and that "" competitive"" feel.- The in-app purchases are both fair and unfair, more unfair than anything else. You have to pay for a ton of sparks to get a VIP account just to have 3 people in your squad ( otherwise you can only have one other person.) Then to unlock nicer paints you have to pay damn near $100, and you have to shell tons of sparks ( the monetary unit used in-game) to increase your inventory size.BUT..Pros: -I, myself have created a guild and am fortunate enough to have met and collected some great and active players to fight along side with and chat between matches.- I don't understand what people mean by the game has "" unfair combat and ranking system."" I have never had my share of win and lose streaks and this game has a pretty fair match making system. -Making your robot is fun! there are definitely three styles of bots that you can succeed with. ( heavy, high hitpoint bots/ light, lightning-fast, fast damaging bots, etc)Conclusion:-This game is definitely more fun in a guild or with friends! if you are a solo player, this game probably will lose your attention in a matter of hours. give it a chance, if you dont like it, you're not out any money.

												I always wanted a game with these aspects:Spore's customization aspectAny typical shooter's replayabilityMICHAEL BAY! (explosions)Low system requirementsMultiplayerWorld of tank's winning and losing  (once you blow up you are done, and when the whole team blows up, said team loses)Loadout's experimenting to winAwesome OP gunsAnd of course, ROBOTS!and if you judge this game based on these aspects...I'd give it about a 9/10do i reccomend it? YES!would i have its baby? ONLY IF THE RELATIONSHIP WORKS, AND AFTER THE 3RD DATE!If you dont believe me, play it for yourself!(but its not perfect. i think you should be able to take money out of your guild's bank once a week and sparks once a month, but the guild owner puts a predefinded maximum withdraw so the guild doesnt go bankrupt. Also i think stronger engines should cost more, not the exact same as weaker ones.)			"

												This game is so much Funand the best thing is that you basicaly make your own class by thinking...""I want it to be fast or powerfull or with big fire-rate""you choose every part so it can be well protected but you may make it slow...because every part weights and you can choose  your legs to be powerful enouth to cary the robot "

												Very unhappy about this game.Okay, Guns and Robots, failed to explain to me how to let Guns and Robots work well together. This can be seen by trying to let me waste my currency just to trial and error for the right robot. Moreover is inventory limitation, forcing players just to sell mistakes and suffer a lots just to get back gold. Sometimes ended up with too slow robot or too cranky robot. The tutorial just not awesome and helpful at all, sadly. As well as user-friendliness for customization, found it much more annoying when trying to deattach devices and creating certain module.Much more rage-quit in the real match. I just feel certain build is very over-powered. Not because of upgrade, but is because of rare weapon or crazy 4-weapons built. Only the players who played can explain this.This game should be categorized as Early-access, seriously. Lag of play-testing. "

												This game is so amazing and has so much potential! :DThe game is so unique and the graphics may not look to nice but the gameplay is so addicting! There are some concerns like the people who use 4 of the same overpowered weapon and just kill you instantly which sucks and you have no chance i wish that could be fixed! But this game is so much fun with friends or random people! I highly reccomend this game! :D8/10!			"

												일단 이게임은기존의 fps와는 좀다릅니다일단 이 게임의 장점은 여러가지 미션을 동료들과 미션을 완료하는 게임이기 때문에 협동이 진짜 많이 필요한 게임 입니다.그리고 자신만의 로봇을 만드는 커스텀메이징 기능도 있으며 무기데미지를 측정하는 기능까지 있어 참으로 만족스러운 게임 입니다.그러나 무기가 밸런스가 파괴되어 있습니다.무슨 말이냐면 이게임 에서 로봇을 꾸미는데 일단 꾸미는데무려 무기를 4개나 붙일수있습니다.그것의 단점이 예를 들어 최강의 무기 로켓런처를 4개 붙여 놓으면그냥 맞는 플레이어가 그냥 한방에 훅가는 겁니다그리고 탄창이 자동 충전이라서 생존감도 떨어집니다그리고 또다른 최강의 단점이 무려 무기가 다 가격이 똑같습니다그리고 안경이나 모자는 엄청비쌉니다.그냥 현질을 엄청해야 살수있습니다.그렇다고 이게임을 나쁘게 보는것이 아닙니다제가 팀포2를 하기 전까지는 이게임으로 아주 심심할때 진짜 재미있게 했습니다.이게임도 무료고 현질안해도 잘 게임이 진행이 되니 추천하는 게임 입니다.
