												Knights of Pen & Paper, originally for iOS, is a turn-based RPG with a novel concept: you take on the role of real-life players in a tabletop game.  The camera is set behind a table where up to five of your characters are seated, with the dungeon master on the other side leading you through the story.  Dialogue tends to be humorous and frequently goes out of character.The game begins with character creation, where you must assign your players a real-life persona and one of a dozen traditional RPG classes, each with four skills.  The actual gameplay takes place around your table, as if you’re in the middle of all the action, and consists of traveling to locations on a world map and completing quests, which are really just more battles in disguise.  In fact, the entire game is simply one battle after another and becomes very repetitive, very fast.As expected, level-ups provide stat bonuses and allow you to upgrade your skills and wear better equipment.  Armor and weapons may only be improved at the blacksmith, but each character has four additional slots for equipping various accessories.  In addition to in-game shops, there is a “real-life” shop where you may purchase snacks that provide temporary buffs for your players, as well as decorations and furniture that confer permanent bonuses.Overall, Knights of Pen & Paper is passable in the context of mobile gaming but completely forgettable when compared to quality games on the PC platform.  Considering the price is $9.99 on Steam vs a mere $2.99 on iOS and Android, it’s borderline offensive that the devs left in-app purchases in the game, allowing you to buy gold with your Steam wallet funds.  Such a shameless exhibit of its mobile origins is a fitting red flag for a game that also fails to break away from the shallow, repetitive gameplay those origins typically entail.			"

												I admit, I miss tabletop gaming. I miss the DM trying to kill off my characters. I miss creating ridiculously out-of-the-box characters. Heck, I miss the days of popcorn, Mountain Dew, and just hanging out and rolling some dice. Those days have been gone for me quite some time, and yet playing a little game called Knights of Pen and Paper reminded me of those good old days.Knights of Pen and Paper attempts to mimic tabletop gaming for an accessible audience. Players start by selecting three noobs to join the adventuring party, along with their class and starting skill. Like any tabletop RPG, as the adventuring party explores, kills baddies, and completes quests, they earn experience to level up and gain more skills. Each party member gets one skill point every time they level up and can only put points into one of four skills. While this creates simplicity for those unfamiliar with RPGs, it doesn't provide a lot of variety.In fact, variety is what Knights of Pen and Paper struggles with throughout its twenty hour campaign. Although the backgrounds mimic an 8-bit style, there isn't much in terms of detail or design. The soundtrack loops, but it feels like there's only three tracks in the entire game. Although there's plenty of classes in the game, many of them are locked and the requirements for unlocking them appear random. The base classes — paladin, mage, cleric, etc. — while classic, are trapped with only four skills, which wouldn't be the case in tabletop gaming.While variety isn't the game's strong suit, accessibility is. It provides a simple turn-based battle system wherein players can select between attack, skill, defend, item, and flee. This makes for an easy learning experience, but it lacks any real depth that a tabletop game has. The game is also surprisingly grindy, and while it does a great job of teaching players what to expect in encounters (usually enemies three to five levels higher than the adventuring party), it's a bit crazy how much players will have to stop and grind because it's not entirely on par with the party's level. It feels like the developers set out to make a simple RPG to give players the feel of tabletop gaming, but the combat could have benefited from actual dice rolls on screen to indicate whether or not the player's characters succeeded or fail in their actions. However, with the grindy combat, perhaps adding dice rolls would have just made everything take longer than provide more accessibility. Still, the combat lacks depth and it needs something else to make it a more engaging process.Dice rolling does exist within Knights of Pen and Paper, it's just not as frequent as it should be. Dice rolls occur when players travel between areas, failures leading to battles, successes leading to safety. Dice rolls occur when players are mining for grindstones or moving through dungeons. These elements are done well and are fairly straightforward, but this game would really benefit if it was implemented into all actions, especially if its goal is to mimic tabletop games. What's further disappointing is the campaign itself. While the writing is charming and hilarious, the majority of the quests are either escort missions, collecting items, slaying some bad dudes, or traveling from place to place for plot purposes. The amount of backtracking in this game is brutal and inexcusable, and even the adventuring party complains about it. It goes back to that problem of accessibility versus variety — on one hand, the campaign should be easy to learn and follow along, on the other hand there should be more to do than then the standard affair. The charm in the writing, and even its awkward translation errors, can only go so far and will likely leave veteran RPG gamers wanting something more substantial.However, Knights of Pen and Paper does succeed in its overall atmosphere. Players get the sense of gamers hanging out, bantering, and asking to pass the Mountain Dew. There is an overall sense that the Dungeon Master is out to kill the adventuring party, and the back and forth within the writing really does work well. The graphics and music, though overly simplistic, are vibrant and give the feeling that players are on an adventure and there is loot to be had. The game is also a fantastic time waster because in its lack of depth it success at being the type of mindless game where players find themselves going, ""just one more quest."" Considering all of the game's flaws, it admittedly succeeds in the one area that for some people matters most: it's actually fun.There are some perks in Knights of Pen and Paper's PC release that differ from the original mobile version. For starters, it allows players to leave party members at the tavern, and bring a new adventurers into the party. They can roll for a new character and not feel like they have to start their entire campaign from scratch. There's also an extended campaign for those who want to explore more of what the game has to offer, and there's tons of new dungeons and loot to acquire. The main campaign can be completed in around twenty hours, with the extended campaign offering quite a bit of replay value. There's also tons of items that can be purchased in shops that can give added bonuses to various stats, which is a nice cosmetic feature.Knights of Pen and Paper is a sweet little throwback to the days of pen and paper gaming, but its simple approach may not be enough to entice every RPG gamer. Yes, the combat is simplistic, but it's fast and easy to roll with. Sure, the story is simple, but it's cute in its presentation. Knights of Pen and Paper's imperfections are many, and yet it's completely easy to sink time into. It's straightforward in its approach and yet, despite its flaws and frustration, I kept playing. Knights of Pen and Paper will never offer gamers a deep experience, but it offers mindless gameplay that admittedly can keep you coming back for more.Recommended "

												Knights of Pen and Paper is a fantasy RPG, which plays like tabletop RPGs. The twist is that you're playing as both the dungeon master and the players. Basically that means you can decide yourself what kind of quests you want (to some extent) and how difficult you want to make the fights by choosing how many enemies you want to fight against. And because the game is like tabletop RPGs, there are several situations where you'll throw a virtual D20 dice.When you first start the game you get to choose from about 10 characters to be the players and 5 classes for them. Each character has a different passive bonus that increases some attributes, which actually leads to choosing the characters based on the bonuses and the class you're going to pick. When starting a new game you get to choose 2 players for free and the remaining 3 seats in the table you can fill by buying the players with in-game gold. You can swap the players in places that have a tavern.If I remember correctly, you first have 5 classes available, but you can unlock a few more by completing side-quests. You can only have one of each class, so for example you can't have 5 warriors as your party. You wouldn't want to either. The reason being that each class has its purpose. Some classes are healers, some are tanks and the rest are either melee fighters or spellcasters of some description. Each class has 4 skills, which are either passive or spells and skills that you can use during combat. The passive skills usually boost some attribute, but some of them also have special stat boosts like life steal. The active skills are pretty basic fantasy RPG skills. You can increase one of the skills every time you level up, which just made the skills more powerful or increased the attribute bonus. So it isn't very deep skill system.The combat is turn based and the players and the enemies all have a box either on top of or below the sprite, which shows the number of their turn. On the player's turns you choose to either attack, use a skill/spell, use an item, defend or run away from the battle. You quite rarely want to use anything other than a skill or spell, because those are the most effective way for beating the enemies. As I mentioned earlier, you get to choose how many and what kind of enemies you want to fight against. Once you buy a certain item from a special shop you can fight 7 enemies at a time, but before that the maximum was 5, I think. I bought that item very early on and didn't check the maximum amount before that. The enemies you can choose from vary quite a lot and you can often choose to fight tougher elite monsters, which give better rewards.I thought the combat was quite fun, but it got kinda boring after 8 hours because in the end it was just the same thing over and over again. At least they kept things fresh with different enemies. The difficulty ramped up quite a lot after about halfway into the game, when the enemies suddenly became very high-leveled compared to the players. Surprisingly enough, I could survive against much higher level enemies than my players were provided I only fought against 3 at a time. It could take a long time to kill them all, but I still could do it. I suppose I played it quite safe since most of the time I fought battles I knew I could win and as a result my whole party died only 3 times during the time I played the game.When you're not in combat you can choose from several options depending on your location in the world. In almost every place you can choose to rest, start a quest specific to the location, use items, check the equipment of the players or travel to some other place. Cities usually also have shops for buying potions and equipment, a tavern and a blacksmith. The blacksmith can upgrade your equipment, but you shouldn't do that until you have increased the blacksmith's level enough for the odds to be on your side. The upgrading is chance based and it happens by throwing the dice. The range of ""winning"" numbers increases as the blacksmith levels up, which makes it easier to win. It's also a good idea to have level 16 players, because then you can equip items that decrease the equipment upgrading cost. I wasted several hundreds of in-game gold before I found about those items.Moving in the world happens by opening the world map and then choosing the location. Traveling costs some gold and every time you move on the map, you throw the D20 dice and depending the roll you might get a random battle. That would get annoying very quickly, if you had to fight some low level monsters when moving around the starting area with high level players, but luckily the chance for the random battle depends on the players' levels and the levels of the monsters in the area you're travelling to. You can also a buy an item that permanently increases your dice rolls by 1, which makes it impossible to get random battles in low level areas. I thought the time it took to travel between each place was a bit too long, but you could reduce that to half if you had a certain game master active.Quests were quite repetitive and not very fun. There is basically 3 types of quest: kill x amount of certain monsters, escort/deliver something and ""fetch"" some items by going to a certain place and killing the enemies there for the items and then return to the place where you started the quest. On the upside the quests gave a lot of experience. There were also some story quests as this game has a (boring) story about saving the pen and paper world. I think the dialog should have been funny, but I didn't find it funny. There were quite many references, but those weren't funny either. At one point I stopped caring about the story entirely and just skipped through the dialog. I just didn't find it interesting at all.The game also has a special store that you can access anytime you're not in combat or in the middle of some conversation. The store has items like furniture, which boost something permanently, and snacks, which give a boost that only lasts for about 15 minutes. You can switch between the furniture you have bought without having to buy them again. I usually switched them based on the situation I was in. Everything bought in this store transferred to other saves too, so you only had to buy the stuff once.I believe the game was originally designed for phones and tablets as there is an in-game store, from which you can buy in-game gold for real money. However, using the in-game store is never required and it can be completely ignored. Once you reach a certain point in the game, you can easily get around 300 gold from a fight that lasts for a minute. The in-game gold is transferred between saves so you can have a save for farming gold for the other save. The real money store in the game seems to be a thing that makes some people skip the game entirely, even though you never have to use the store.The graphics are 2D pixel art and the sounds effects are pretty old-school bleeps and bloops. There is no voice acting, so you have to read through all the dialog. I thought the music was repetitive so I ended up muting it.Overall I thought it was pretty enjoyable game and I was quite addicted to it for a while. I played it for 21 hours in total, which included me first going through half the game and then starting a new save to get couple of achievements. I finished the story in the second game I started and also beat the optional boss. I also got every achievement aside from the 3 broken ones. The boring story and the in-game real money store are definite cons, but the rest of the game is fun even without very deep character development or combat.			"

												There isn't much to this game; it's just a simple, humorous 8-bit turn base game. There is a lot of hilarious commentary and for the most part character development is nice. I know that the dialog is all pre-set, but it makes the characters pretty funny and sassy. One of my favorite aspects is the ridiculous dirty jokes made through-out the game.There's a ton (I mean A LOT) of characters and classes to choose from. There's a nice little upgrade setting that lets you have a few different moves and upgrade them. It's just like any other turn base game. It's fun, it's cheap and the developers are extremely nice and enjoy interacting with their fans; which is always great. I would definably get this game while on sale.			"

												This is a very simple looking RPG on the cover but once you get into it, there is plenty of min/maxing to be done. A turn based gameplay makes fits this much more than a normal action type. I love how you can swap in ""team members"" to the table once you purchase more seats at the table.Another thing which is probably overlooked in Knights of Pen & Paper, is the dialog of the dungeon master and the players, some really humours lines came out during my playthrough and I would really recommend anyone read through them for a giggle. The soundtracks can get fairly repetitve but what do you expect for an 8bit style game. I'm up to about twelve hours gameplay and I am still finding new things to try out. I would 100% recommend this to any RPG/Turn based fan			"

												I don't know where and when I got this game...But... This game...This game is awesome!I liked the overall parody feel about it while it has a strong and solid work about delivering action and plot in moderation, getting some loud laughs from me here and there. The battle is unforgiving, so you always have to be focused, despite it being turn-based. The difficulty is adjustable in a manner ""How frisky you are today?"", taking on anything between 1 and 7 rats or elite monsters. The open-ended way the characters are presented lets you use your imagination. I do feel like playing a table top sheets'n'pens while playing this. Yes, the feel of every character is an illusion, but it's a very-VERY well made illusion.Another point is the building difficulty: Items give you stats that you barely see. Levels give you damage that you barely see. Hp and Mana regen is earned by tears and sweat dripping down your inner thigh. All this while enemy shamelessly uses lifesteal and applies crazy bleeding stacks. Some battles will be so tight that you will stain your undergarments a bit and still lose because of the enemy randomly preferring your rouge to your fully buffed granny paladin. You will put a sleep on a DoT'ed enemy and lose your healer because of that, and you will spend 4 times the money you earned in that battle to revive your team. You will even spend 2k on upgrading your sword and still get nothing in return because you are a looser and you will have no money to leave the god forsaken town.But... You know... That's what's good about this game... That's what's your adventure is. And you should not just accept it, but have tons of fun while at it!I would like to say thank you to the developers. I've seen a lot of attempts to do what they achieved in this game and i think they did it better than anyone else I've seen so far, including UnEpic and Magicka, the first being too far away and the second being a bit too silly. But this game, oh, this game grabs the bull by his modesty and makes him enjoy it so much that he's ashamed afterwards, but he begs for more.Highly recommend.			"

												This has the appearance of a nostalgic D&D tabletop setting, but is more like a poorly-translated turn-based JRPG, where tactical positioning and well-timed skill choices are not the focus. Instead, players find themselves killing hordes upon hordes of monsters to make numbers go up so they can kill bigger hordes of scarier monsters. The story tries to be humorous about a D&D group finding the line between fantasy and reality blurred with numerous shoe-horned cameos, but the writing itself is unnatural to the point that it feels like a high-schooler's fan-fiction. In fact, if you're looking for a game the emulates the D&D experience, I recommend Cardhunter, a free-to-play tactical game with better writing and more involved gameplay.Even if you're in the market for a mindless grind-a-thon, don't buy this on the PC. Opt for the mobile version instead, since the game also constantly puts you through miniscule but unskippable animations that would be more bearable if you could look out the window while they play. Hell, I'd recommend other mobile games entirely, but some people like their skinner boxes and this is one of the skinneriest boxes I've ever seen.P.S.: This game *had* micro-transactions, but those have been removed. According to an anonymous source (see comment), the microtransaction was originally forced on by a publisher. A sad case of publisher overruling developer control. The game is still a terrible grind though.			"

												The first 4-5 hours are great, when you are exploring the world, unlocking new classes and testing different groups. Sadly, afterwards the game becomes a massive grind of fighting the same enemies over and over, going back and forth the same places and every battle feels exactly the same...It has a lot of flavor and cool references, but still I couldn't even force myself to reach the end of the game. There's micro-transactions in-game, but honestly they don't get in the way, the massive grind at end-game and lack of interesting battles are this game's major flaws. "

												Disregard the play time, I started playing this on the battlestation but then decided it was better played on a tablet.Although this game is a phone/mobile/tablet game it is still a good game to play. I didn't honestly mind playing it on the PC.I spent at least 40 hours into this game, this game has the refferences, it has the jokes, it has the pokes, the jabs, the dice, the everything you need to make you want to play a game like this.It starts you off in a room where you are playing a game of well... dnd. sort of. so you play it like you normally would play dnd except... it's silly. which I love. It would be like having that cool uncle who actually has no life guiding you through an adventure he made that is filled with everything that cool uncle wanted to do. As an example (SPOILER)  The is a place called steam island, obviously there are monsters there etc, but you have to go retrieve the crowbar for gabe.  You know what, games with those kind of nudges are just my thing. GG10/10 a game to play offline, on a mobile device. OR on a computer.(I am an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ so I got a lot of the achievements for this game on PC too.)Also Flower is OP, that extra dice roll is 2 stronk, she is a must have on the team.Story: 10/10 (Solid.)Gameplay: 8/10 (Fairly Basic, Contains the holy trinity of dullness.

												I really loved the game. It took me 20 hours to complete, which includes a restart after some hours when I had unlocked more interesting characters than the starting lineup. I'll have to go back and finish it with the ones I missed in the future. The game was a lot of fun, and definitely worth the asking price. It made me smile many times, what with all those wacky references to other games and developers. I bought the Deluxe edition to support the developers as much as I could, as I had researched the game prior to buying it, and I'm glad I did. The extra gold you start with is nice (but doesn't provide any sort of advantage other than when you get a full lineup but let's face it, it doesn't matter).If you're on the fence, then just go ahead and spend the 10 euro or whatever the price is in your region. It's a fun throwback to the golden ages of gaming, and it's just well done through and through. I doubt very much you'll regret it. Don't worry about the ingame cash shop. I never used it, and NEVER had a reason to. You earn redicilous amounts of gold in this game just doing the main quest line, and the extra gold you can buy for real money is so useless, I'm puzzled why they added it at all.			"

												I enjoy the premise of this game, the core idea that it tries to emulate with a twist, a DnD session where you can customize and control the players and the room that the game takes place in, even the dungeon master. I will say that the game does have charm and has a good art direction, though I would say that there should have been more effort in the pixel art. However, it has both condensed and distilled the core elements of pen and paper gaming to a level which is far too simplistic for me to enjoy. The combat is shallow, the quests are repetitive, and the stats and perks are shallow and hardly feel like they matter. The UI is also highly simplistic and does not even provide important information efficiently or at all. I am sure that this is a fun bathroom game on a mobile device or something on the go, but the flaws of this game impeded my enjoyment of this game and cannot recommend this game to people who want an enthralling experience.

												Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition is a decently entertaining turn-based RPG, which likely fares much better on it's original mobile Platform. As it is, the repetetive nature of combat and grinding make the game somewhat tedious during longer sittings on PC, thus making it all too easy to lose interest in the game sooner than it likely deserves.

The Good: Fun premise, mixing the tropes of D&D-style tabletop gaming and Final Fantasy-esque RPG combat, with the usual nods to post-Tolkien high fantasy worlds. There's a solid dose of fun pop culture references (from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Super Mario Brothers in the sewer dungeon, to Pirates of the Caribbean and the Creature from the Black Lagoon in the seaside areas). And it's not just gratuitious name-checking either -- all of it is properly statted out and integrated into the gameplay.The Bad: Admittedly, it's hardly ground-breaking stuff, especially if you're partial to comedy/parody RPGs. It's not quite as witty or clever as its web-based counterparts like Kingdom of Loathing[kingdomofloathing.com] or Card Hunter[game.cardhunter.com]. But even as someone who liked both those games, I wasn't disappointed -- I'm now at 10 hours play time and counting.The Ugly: Less-than-ideal game balance. It definitely appears to favor particular player/class combos over others, to the point that it's damn near impossible to last the higher levels with certain oddball party compositions, which kinda takes out some of the fun.

												Imagine playing table top D&D, and getting sucked into the world of Nintendo, where you are still playing Table top D&D, only you are playing it as an NES video game. That pretty much sums up this game in a nutshell, only you play it on the PC. It looks like an old school NES game, but incorporates the table top D&D feel, Very interesting concept. Much different than the early video game D&D adventures, this game tries to stay true to old school D&D. I thought it was a fun little game and would recommend it, because it can be picked up for next to nothing or even free and if you enjoy anything D&D related, you should at least give it a try. Get ready for a Nostalgia rush.			"

												I really liked the design concept of the game. Ideally it gives you the freedom of exploring a vast, magical world and design your own adventure. It has the potential of becoming a tool kit for creative story telling with its pre-existing mechanics, however, that being said, all the stories within the game are all pre-written and quite limited. The game does a nice job in trying to replicate the feeling of being both in a real world and an imaginary one when playing DnD by allowing the player to purchase object in the ""real world"" with the gold you get in the game world while these items would aid you in games. The downside of this is that the game gets extremely grindy after some hours of playing. The characters of the game are relatively diverse, yet they only have 4 moves each, which makes the combat pattern repetitive. The style of the game is an 8-bit pixle art type, which is fine ---- gives me a feeling of Pokemon Leafgreen. The soundtrack of the game becomes really loopy, and seems rather limited. I would prehaps give the game a 6/10 as a decent time killer. A good game if on a discount (say for 3 or 4 dollars), but would not recommend buying for 10 dollars.			"

												7.1/10 - An RPG Focused on Battles!This is an interesting twist to the RPG genre; Battles similar to an RPG maker, but with a little more freedom. There is no exploration, just a map view, battles and quests. You can dictated the number of enemies you face and build a team up to (5) players.The game is ultra-focused on the combat so I did get bored after a few hours. I personally wouldn't pay full price for this game; but on sale it's worth the pick-up.Worth $4-5 if you enjoy RPG fights! Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												At first, Knights of Pen and Paper was VERY fun. I enjoyed the little jabs the GM gave, I felt like I was being challenged fairly, it felt like I was playing a fun little tabletop. I even bought the Halloween DLC because I was having such a good time with it.But then the challenges became SO exhausting. Toward the end it feels like you're just stuck in mud and can't progress no matter how high you level up. It stopped being fun and became a chore. If you enjoy grinding this game could be for you. Personally, not a big fan.			"

												I can describe Knights of Pen and Paper as a Dungeons & Dragons simulator instead of your typical RPG. There is no exploration or movement. It is all menu and dialog based. The map is pretty segmented like a Mario map and there are not maps so much as there are quests. These quests revolve around typical and simplified RPG turn based combat. The catch is you also play your own dungeon master, so you can select your enemies to fight and how many you will fight. Its as if you're making your own busy work. The classes feel balanced, but the battles begin feel too long for the never ending grind that this game becomes. Unless you want to spend real money to buy in game gold.The game has a lot of personalization. You start the game selecting characters and their classes. Each character has its own passive ability and then you assign a class. You can only have one of a class per party. Each class has 4 upgradeable abilities, some are passives like regenerate HP per turn and most are combat abilities. When you level up through experience defeating enemies, you can level up a skill. Leveling up skills increases the MP they use, so its a double edged sword where eventually you can only use a skill once or twice before you need to rest or use potions. There are items that will regenerate MP and HP along with increase maximums.The combat abilities feel useful. Paladins have a leader strike that is a powerful attack. The strike will increase their threat to enemies driving the majority of attacks to that character. To balance the attention, the paladin has a temporary shield power, a flash heal for themselves and devotion that increases the base HP. A cleric can heal the entire party or focus healing on one character. They can also use a smite skill that damages an enemy and heals themselves. To round things out there is a weakening spell to debuff enemy attack power for three enemies. Mages have a single enemy damaging fireball that will burn them, damaging HP each turn. They also have a deep freeze that damages and stuns an enemy. Mages also have a meteor that damages an entire enemy party and finally a passive stream that increases the base MP. I can't cover all the classes, but they feel well rounded. The classes have to feel well rounded, because the game is nothing but combat. A chess game between you and enemies that you chose to fight. The game has plenty of quests to give you and you can tackle them one at a time. Nothing that will stump you, since all the 'quests' seem to be collect X amount of Y or defeat X amount of Y enemies. Escort X from point A to B and then fight a battle. It wouldn't seem like such a grind if your travel had more exploration instead of moving along a line from location to location. There is some banter along the way, but its just your party sitting at a table facing a dungeon master with different beautiful backgrounds. The battles get long, even with better equipment. It gets frustrating when you complete a quest to kill 7 plants only to get another quest to kill 9 plants. Then that quest followed by another quest to get 19 carrots. How? By killing the same plants you've just slaughtered. You can always pick your quests, but its useless when you'll end up doing them all anyway.When you visit a town, you don't walk to a store, you just click on an icon that will open up the store. The items are nice. Upgrading weapons and armor involves a gambling system. Sure it costs 150 gold to have a blacksmith upgrade your gear, but there's only a 35% chance he'll succeed. Seems like a gamble and a waste of gold. The blacksmith will get better with every try . You can even increase the blacksmith's experience by using grindstones that you'll buy or find in caves.That leads me to warn you of this. Microtransactions. Why grind for gold when you can just buy it with real life money? The microtransactions aren't in your face or annoying, but they are there and some people have problems with that. If you want gold, go kill some enemies, there's nothing else to do in the game.If someone in your party dies, that costs gold. Since resurrection costs gold, when your party gets wiped out and you don't have enough gold to resurrect one of them, that's it. It was originally a gameover, because the game will save itself preventing you from going back to a previous point when your party was alive. So you'd have to buy gold with real life money. Luckily, there is now a free continue that will resurrect everyone, but reset their level experience. I'm thankful of that. If you don't want to grind to level up your characters, you can always buy experience with gold. There is always a need for gold. Whether its experience, resurrection, traveling, or gambling to upgrade your equipment. Oh and don't forget buying stuff.At some point, this game is busy work and you know some people are ok with that. In all, I would say its a fun game, but other RPGs are better. Since this is trying to be a Dungeons & Dragons simulator without being a true RPG its just lacking in some areas.			"

												The game started quite nice. Humor was pretty good, gameplay was quite a chilling experience.

												Cute concept for a game. Unfortunately, the novelty wears off fairly quickly, and the actual gameplay just doesn't hold up. Traditional jRPGs are carried by their characters and story, because the combat and mechanics thereof are so one-dimensional and stale.So Knights of Pen and Paper has the same boring combat as any Dragon Warrior/Dragon Quest/Final Fantasy/etc game, but all the writing, charm, and polish has been replaced by easy jokes about RPG tropes.If RPGs are played for the story, where's the story? I guess the gag is that there is no story, that this is the RPG stripped down and laid bare. I can buy that. But since there's no gameplay worth noting, does that joke really carry a game for 5+ hours? I don't think it does. The premise is done a hundred times better by Half Minute Hero - which has all the same lazy RPG ""observational humor"", but uses it as a fluffy coat to the solid framework of fun, interesting gameplay. I recommend you pick that up, instead. Knights of Pen and Paper isn't worth the time it takes to finish it, much less the asking price.			"

												Don't let the complaints fool you. This is actually a great arcade classic turn-based RPG experience. Think of the original Final Fantasy games, in a much more fun, comedic fashion, but still has the challenge, and core elements you love. You will go on grand adventures, fighting many various foes with a pretty good storyline.There's options to increase the challenge for even greater rewards / xp, loot, etc. etc. vamping the difficulty that suits you.It's hard to explain all the qualities that makes this game so cute, and enjoyable, but I think it's definitely something every RPG fan would love to play for a few hours. The main downside people seem to complain about is that there's one very small in-game real money shop, which you can pay like $1-5 for in-game gold. The game is not balanced around this shop, and I've never once understood why it was in the game. Perhaps it's for ""stupid people"" who make foolish decisions, or need a ""boost"", but I did not need it.However, I did decide to go with the digital deluxe edition for $1 more, which comes with a lot of goodies, including a new character, 800 starting gold, some minor boosts and a new area with a monster super effective to all dmg. (fast easy xp + gold)I paid: $3.75 (digital deluxe)Reccomended price: $5			"

 This isn't a terribly bad game, but it's fun is very fleeting and you'll forget about it the minute you exit out of it. The premise was cool and was the main reason I bought it but they really didn't do anything with it - the characters are all interchangable (literally) and the dialog seems to be aimed at kids - the humor is mostly refrencing things and changing one word or changing it slightly (Wizards of the East Coast, HAHAHAHA). You set your own pace on everything, like choosing which enemies you want to fight and how many, so the game never really suprises or challenges you. The quests are boring and all feel like sidequests (kill this many things, go here, collect this many things, blahblahblah). They've taken microtransactions out of the game but you can tell a lot of the mechanics were set up with those in mind.They do have some neat things like the ability to buy upgrades and powerups for the 'real life' players, and these upgrades carry over different saves, but there isn't enough of this and you'll have most the things you want rather early on. The graphics are pretty nice as well, if you like the 8bit style. This game is probably better played on a phone or mobile device, this isn't a terrible port but it shows it was made for a touch screen in mind - for example you have to select the enemy to attack every time. I'd recommend buying this on a mobile touch screen device, it'll prob cost less - also it'd be easier to play it in short bursts like it is prob meant to be played.In short, they botched it.			"

												First of all, there was an update that killed save files, which is a big problem for an RPG of this length.  I wasn't interested in replaying the first ten hours of the game, so I've never played it since then.  I'm not really sure what the developers were thinking.  It was an old game when the patch came out, so the loss of save files was definitely unexpected.Also, it's pretty dumb that if you already have some of the DLC from buying the +1 Edition, you can't just buy the extra DLC you're missing without rebuying it with the base game.  Come on now.As for the game itself, I would rate as so-so.  The theme and art is top-notch, but everything else becomes kind of a drag as you keep playing.  There's way too many boring encounters.  Some of the areas seem really poorly balanced-- I went into a dungeon with a level rating lower than my party's, and was basically insta-killed (had zero problems up to that point).  You might like it a little better than I did if you're a big fan of grindy RPGs, because there's a LOT of grinding.  What kept me playing was the witty writing, but it wasn't quite strong enough to carry the game on its own.			"

												A fun little twist on the typical computer RPG, where you are both the DM and the players.  It does get a bit grindy, and there's little to no storyline to speak of, but I have yet to see another RPG-like game that incorporates the meta concept at all, let alone as well as this one does.  The concept is interesting, and while combat does get repetitive and you end up doing a lot of gold-farming, the tongue-in-cheek dialogue and easter eggs help keep it interesting.This is, admittedly, the kind of game that's best played in short bursts rather than long sessions, but if you remember the days of 8-bit games and wonder what computerized D&D could have been like back then... this isn't a perfect approximation, but it's a fun little game that's worth a try, particularly if you can get it on sale.

												I'm really bored at my computer one night and find a game that is having a sale that just covers my left over money from my steam wallet. So I buy it after realizing how little space it occupies, and have the time of my life. The game is about a group of people (that you choose, each having their own perks in the game) play a game of D&D. You start off slowly, but then begin find a sense of fun in it somewhere. This game can get a bit repetitive and boring at times, but it's really worth it. I can't get too excited with it, but you can easily lose yourself in this game when you get down to the grind and try to clear a dungeon. There can be cheap situations where you die easily, but for me, it wasn't unbearable. I don't normally appreciate these kinds of games, with this being a major exception. Although I can't give it a high rating, I can at least recommend it to my friends and family.			"

												A great casual game. It really only has the one game mechanic, as if you're in a battle in a final fantasy game, or any turn-based RPG - Each turn you choose to battle / magic / item, and your party defeats monsters. An interesting aspect of this game is that you control the number and difficulty of most of the encounters. But graphically, there is not much beyond what you see in the trailer. Besides the world map, and the table where your party sits, you don't move around.It could get boring for some, if you're not looking for an endless battle; but the game is as difficult or as easy as you choose to make it. I definitely think it's worth it. It's very easy to pick up and play a few minutes at a time, as there's no learning curve. There are enough random encounters, and it's well polished, this game will keep me entertained for hours.			"

												This is a game you will love or hate depending on your tolerance for RPG tropes. The best parts are when it succesfully makes fun of the cliches of CRPG's while bringing a sense of humour about what makes the pen and paper versions so much fun. At its worst it IS those cliches. One of the things I really disliked was that to upgrade your characters standard weapons and armour costs a fortune at the blacksmith and requires extensive upgrades to get above a less than %50 chance of the upgrade being successful (Your money, which is in short suppy, is spent regardless). You can upgrade the chance by getting grindstones, but GRIND is the opperative word. Grindstones are only available in caves and there is only a precentage of getting one for each ore pile you click on. You will need to go back to these places again and again and again to try to get enough grindstones to raise the chance of an upgrade succeeding more than %50 of the time. I do like it, but with caveats. If you can tolerate the random grinding required, go for it.Pros:         Good sense of humour        Graphics have a lot of charm        Chirpy retro musicCons:         Grinding         Repetition         Rinse/repeat         Tear enducing upgrade system "

												I really like this game, it's genuinely a fun and simple tactical RPG, but after a few hours it became really tiresome. I wish it was more robust, more complex. I wish it had more varied locations, way more frequent epic boss fights. There's great humor in it, but it needs a lot more dialogue or even dialogue choices. Overall it's a rather simple representation of a Dungeons & Dragons tabletop game & it is really fun, but really becomes a chore after a while. I'm hoping the sequel fixed some of my complaints. Despite its shortcomings I'll recommend it because it's well priced, simple, but fun, for a while at least.			"

												Pretty fun oldschool feel game. Some people don't like this game because it has a micro payement system in it where you can buy extra gold with your creditcard, but it is really not needed to do that. In fact, it would spoil the fun of the game and it reduces the total play time. So yes, specially when you see it on sale it is a good buy if you like these kind of games.7.5/10			"

												Its a neat concept, but the gameplay boils down to grinding and spending money (and you can only get money by grinding or paying real cash).In addition, its one of those games where upgrading equipment has a failure chance. When you fail (and you only have a 35% success chance), the money is lost and you have nothing to show for the 20 minutes of your life that you spent grinding to get it. There's no skill involved in this either. The only thing you could have done to increase your chance of success was to buy certain items beforehand, which you can only pay for through relentless grinding, or paying real cash. You may be noticing a trend.			"

												Suffers horribly from effects of a phone game meant to drain wallets to advance.  Tried playing it again after a few years of it just sitting installed.  Without using cheatengine or a similar program to give gold, you will find yourself spending vast amounts of time in the farm area obtaining it.  Then seeing the same quotes played repeatedly going back to town to buy grindstones and upgrade the blacksmith before returning again.  The system itself would be great for a normal turn based rpg similar to Dragon Quest, but the terms of grind versus receiving spartan bits of plot makes investing the time to complete the game not worth it.

												Knights of Pen and Paper is a tongue-in-cheek look at table top RPGs. The characters are silly, the ""microtransactions"" even sillier, and the references to other video games and people in the industry is, quite frankly, horrible (but in a silly way). The entire game has your characters sitting at a table in various places such as a village, a cave, an arcade, and so on, while a DM (Dungeon Master, for those of you who are unfamiliar with pen and paper RPG terminology) guides them through their quests. The graphics are simple, but fit well with the game. The music is repetitive, but catchy. And there's loads of replay value. I definitely recommend getting this game.			"

												This game easily could have been a free-to-play-game, but once you start playing, you realize that it IS a game you can play without restrictions. The idea of a table in the middle of the screen sounded weird, but you actually don't notice it in mid-battle. This is an awesome game.    It's simple enough to just pick up and play, but you can still work out a winning strategy. Think of it like Pokemon. You can kinda ignore the stats and get through the game, but you can also maximize your team's potential by equiping certain items. So if you don't want to think about it, you can make it through, but if you do the math, you can do better. It's. Just. Awesome. You can go pretty much anywhere right from the start, but you'll probably die if you do. But that's still an option.    I recommend reading a guide before playing, as there is some terms you probably won't understand, but it's smooth sailing from there.			"

												It's like Dungeons & Dragons, minus the need for friends. One time I was playing this and 5 hours ended up passing before I realized it when I thought I had only been playing for 2 hours. 15/18But seriously though, it's like DnD, except you control everything that happens, from how many enemies you fight in each encounter (most of the time) to which quests you do to how many characters you have in your party at one time.It's a pretty meta game, calling upon/calling out various things you'd normally find in a DnD campaign and other tropes relative to table top RPGs, but at the same time it's pretty genre savvy in and of itself, so if you're familiar with these kinds of games, you'll probably get a kick outta the dialogue.There's also a sequel available too if you like this then be sure to check that one out as well.

												Maybe this game works well on a cellphone but to sit down and deliberately play it on a PC is laughable. The gameplay is so incredibly shallow you can win practically every encounter by closing your eyes and clicking your mouse unless you try to stack the odds against yourself (which you will since every fight is so simple) and even then your rampant clicking will only be broken up to cast a healing spell now and then. There just isn't anything to it. You can pick multiple classes for your heroes but besides the 4 different abilities they all feel like they play the same. I couldn't even explain what was going on with the gold system. Everything at the store costs 1-5 coins and monsters drop a few coins here and there...but I started with like 5000 gold for some reason. I’m not entirely sure but I feel like the game tried to balance out the absence of micro-transactions of its mobile game counterpart by dumping all the gold in the world in my pocket and calling it square.If this game has anything going for it, it’s the sprite work which is very pretty and the music is pleasant but everything is massively let down by how unstimulating the game feels. It's not a BAD game but its a pretty BLAH game "

												Despite no mention of it anywhere, this game contains microstransactions that will make the game easier. This means that on top earning money through game sales themselves, the game is continually monetised through the sale of more in game currency. It also suggests that the difficulty and the amount of mindless grinding required in the game to progress is geared toward frustrating you into getting out your wallet to buy progress with real world cash.This business model is unacceptable. If I pay money for a game I expect there to be a final transaction for me to enjoy the game as is. When I'm expected to buy my progress through the game on the other hand, under no circumstances do I want to pay money up front, especially not without being notified of these transactions. I don't want to pay a fair price for a game only to find out that I will have to invest a lot more to really enjoy it.The game itself seemed clever at times, but I soon felt forced to either grind through enemies at a boringly slow pace or fork over real cash.

On top of that, nothing in this came off as original at all.If I ever had a GM make a campaign that was 100% references and forced us to battle everyone we met? I'd tell him he sucked and then leave.

Unlike old Final Fantasy games your random encounters just occur randomly, you don't need a dice that you have 0 control over to place it in your face.I feel it's there just to♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, and there's no benefit to having a success roll except for enchanting weapons.Game is also extremely short.

All the 90's references can't make up for Knights of Pen and Paper's grinding, mobile roots.Pros: Graphics, Sounds, ControlsCons: Gameplay, Story, BugsFor fans of pixel graphics, Knights of Pen and Paper will not disappoint, although it may be a waste of most computers' potential.  The sounds and music fit well, although they may begin to grate after a few hours.  Control with the mouse and the smallish menus are perfect.Unfortunately, the grindy, repetitive gameplay is where Knights of Pen and Paper shows its mobile roots.  The story isn't terrible, but lacks the great moments often had whilst playing true tabletop RPGs.  For achievement hounds, the Deluxe Edition is a must, as it provides a slightly better grinding area.  A number of achievement bugs ensure that the grind lasts many hours longer than it should.Knights of Pen and Paper is a throwback game in many ways, but a number of flaws mar it severly.5/10			"

												Quite enjoyable.  Perhaps the jokes are obvious as some reviews have said, but they're still fun.The game is better if your computer is a touch-screen as this is a mobile port.  Mouse clicking is kind of a drag primarily because of this reason (click the Skills button, now move the mouse up to click the thing you want to attack, now move back down to click the Skills button of the next hero, now back up to click the enemy, now back down...).  It would have been better to add some keyboard/controller support.But, speaking of the whole ""mobile port"" thing, it IS nice that I can transfer my save file from my Android device and play my current game on my PC and Mac.  I've gone between all three platforms without too much trouble--just save it to my choice of cloud storage and then download it into the game file folders to play from where I left off.  The fact that there isn't Steam Cloud is a bummer, but since Steam doesn't have a client on Android, it doesn't matter too much for me.Overall, very nice little game.  Grab it on sale and have some old-school fun.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper is a solid game, but not a perfect one. It has fairly well thought out mechanics and there is nothing you can do in the game that the game itself doesn’t make intuitive to do, but there are multiple points when the difficulty-curve is not so well designed, even going so far as to require you to grind well after finishing every quest in the game save one that is actually HARDER then the last main quest of the game.It is also very simple. In fact many would probably call this game an RPG-lite and they would not be wrong. Despite the new angle of playing the people around the table instead of the heroes on their character sheets, this game is overall a very simple title… simple enough I was not surprised to see the game is readily available, not just on the PC, but on mobile phones.This makes for a surprisingly good game overall, but not one designed to be played over long sessions. Rather, it’s a series of bite-sized sessions that will ultimately get you through the to the end, assuming you have the patients to get through some of the later muck.Full review is available at http://redsectorshutdown.blogspot.com/2017/03/knights-of-pen-and-paper-pc-review.html "

												As much as I wanted to be able to recommend this game as at least a casual mindless fun type of title, it turns out that the game is not even successful at that. The game's premise of telling a story from the point of view of people playing a Tabletop RPG is played painfully straight without any humor involved other than the premise itself. The game also provides no attempts at being an authentic Tabletop RPG experience by being restrictively linear and having a fixed storyline. Speaking of which, the game's story has no sense of atmospheric or emotional depth and is paper thin, no pun intended, and is literally the most generic and bare bones story you can think of for a fantasy game. Again no attempts are made to actually make this interesting or relate it to the game's premise. The gameplay is made up entirely of fetch quests that are normally reserved for sidequests, and there is no exploration included at all. The game will stop being fun after about an hour. Also the game features micro-transactions in the form of buying in game money with real world money, and the game's design seems to be based around making you use up as much in game money as possible. Traveling to new locations, reviving dead partners both cost in game money despite making no logical sense why this should be the case. Up grading weapons is something that costs an absurd amount of money to attempt, but it starts out with only a 35% chance of working, and the only way to increase that percentage is to successfully upgrade weapons. Because of this, you will likely go through all your in game money really quickly, and seeing as how money takes a ridiculously long time to farm in this game, it seems entirely likely that the idea was to get you to use the micro-transactions.This game is not recommended.Full Review Here http://www.gamefaqs.com/PC/708672-knights-of-pen-and-paper-1-edition/reviews/156854 "

												In a word: Avoid. Read on for reasons.A game that simulates pen and paper RPGs? Sounds great, doesn't it? This game will do just that, but the Dungeon Master is largely unamusing, which leads to a mundane story. The comments your party makes are usually cheesy one-liners or memes, or video game references. You roll a d20 for quests, upgrading gear, getting grindstones in caves, resting in non-towns, and travelling, and failing a dice roll only makes the game more tedious. The battle system is all turn-based, and order is loosely based on initiative, but it's mostly random.A more minor point though are the microtransactions for in-game gold which are COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY but for some reason every day some guy will complain about ""ermergerd microtransactions"" in the community hub. The microtransactions are NOT REQUIRED at any point in the game; the microtransactions only help you by shaving off a few minutes of your time that would otherwise have been spent doing what you already have to do for the entire game. The microtransactions only give you gold. You get gold from fighting monsters. For the obsessive, completionist players:As of typing up this post there are at least 5 broken achievements out of 43. Apparently there have been inquiries sent to the developers asking when the achievements will be fixed, and the answer provided was that the devs were busy working on another project that isn't Knights of Pen and Paper. tl;dr:Do not buy, because:1. Unoriginal plot2. Ridiculously random3. Unnecessarily tedious4. Broken achievements			"

												If you've ever played an mmo like WoW and during the quests you would often get to get x amount of y thing or kill x amount of z monsters and you thought, ""Holy crap that sounds, and is, like the most fun I have ever had!"" then this game is for you!It starts off grabing your interest with a prision escape and a cute art style and 'dnd' type set up, but quickly wears down into a slogging grind fest. There isn't any decisions to be made (As one would expect from a dnd game) or strategy, and there isn't even any dice rolling aside from travel or sleeping. The classes are un balanced like crazy. The mage and the cleric are easily the best classes in the game. The rogue is in 3rd at average and the warrior and paladin are just complete garbage. The characters dont do anything story wise and there is no banter or personality to them.The character sheets are pretty boring. Each character gets 3 active skills and 1 passive that you can level up. However the skills are just about asa basic and uninteresting as you can get. The mage has a fireball, Frostbolt, meteor, and mana increase skill. The Cleric has smite, heal all, heal one, and a damage debuff skill. The rogue has a stealth, double strike, disable, and posion skill. The warrior has a healing, damage debuff, cleave, and one more skill I forgot. And the paladin has a shield, heal, aggro strike, and defense increase skill. B-O-R-I-N-G!!!You do have a nice selection of buyable items to give buffs thought. Various items/props/food and even the dm can be changed. I do think that is nice and adds some charm to the game. The equipable items however, are again boring +to stat upgrades. Nothing cool or interesting.I hate not recommending this game as it is a solid concept that I hope to see expanded and improved in the future, but in its current state it just isn't worth your time or money.

												Kind of a cool oldschool concept mixed with nice visual representation of DnD sessions, but totally ruined by utter simplicity of combat, constant grinding for gold, and out of place microtransactions that don't include additional content.While mobile version of this game might be worth your while, charging 15$ for a pc version of this shallow game and keeping microtransactions in place is dirty. You should spend your money on some better games instead.			"

												If you like classic Tabletop/RPGs then this brings the best of both worlds together (Tabletop and Video Games).Controls are so simplistic and the game runs on very little resources that a lower end mini tablet can run this game without any problems, while still offering that classic RPG challenge.The references and Easter Eggs that pay homage to older RPG style games are just the + in ""+1 Edition""If you find yourself looking for some time to kill I recommend playing this game (at full price, but you can never beat a good deal).

												When this game first came out on Steam, it was a port of a really grindy and repetitive mobile game that had microtransactions in it, namely to pay actual money for more in-game gold instead of having to grind it out from combat and the infinite amount of escort and item collection quests. People who bought it on release were ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about the microtransactions.Now that the microtransactions have been patched out, it plays like a game with too many ♥♥♥♥ing escort and item collection quests. Basically, a mobile game without the option to skip the grind. Don't ♥♥♥♥ing bother, read a book instead.			"

												To preface this, I won this in a giveaway (on steamgifts)...I absolutely enjoyed this game.  I am currently going through a D&D cycle of obsession right now and this totally fit the video game need for that in a really odd way.  The game itself is fun as it totally pokes fun of all the nerdiness that is associated with table top role playing games.  It functions pretty well overall, but you can definitely power play this and not have as much enjoyment.  This leads me to believe it has a bit of a balance issue, but it doesn't really matter too much.The controls and interface are pretty straight forward, no issues at all. I didn't try to see if there were hotkeys for the characters ablities as I was just playing with my mouse mostly. Overall I would give this a 10/15.  4/5 for controls, 3/5 for gameplay, and 3/5 for graphics.			"

												This game is really great.The story line is funny and there's plenty of eastereggs to find.The concept of gaining gold to buy more or new party members is fun and the fact that the gold can be used for items that change the status effects in the game (the game that they play) is really neat.And the meta. This game really uses the whole meta concept so nicely, that I haven't played another game that does is quite this well.Theres plenty of replayability, since you unlock more characters as you play and there's those nice achievements to get, from playing with different charanter setups. Some of the achievements are actually quite hard to do, which just makes it more enjoyable.The game can get quite repetative and combat can drag out a little, so it becomes more of a grind than a fun experience. But for me the promise of what happens when you get to the next part of the story is enough to get me through it. It you really hate repeating the same pattern over and over again in order to win fights, then I would not recommend playing this game.This game does deliver what it promises though.8/10 since the grind does drag it down a little			"

Combat, levelling, and crafting are excessively grindy. The story is essentially non-existant and the attempts at satire are forced.

												This game is based heavily on grinding, which I guess is par for the course for what was originally a phone title. Gotta sell those IAPs!This would not be so bad if the game was actually free-to-play, or if the RPG mechanics were any good. After all, lots of titles in the genre have a bunch of grinding at their core and still manage to be fun.Unfortunately, combat is shockingly shallow, character building and crafting might as well not be there, and while the quest structure is framed in an original/cute way, it just underlines how barebones everything is.I was also put off by the shameless, constant nerd pandering -- which mostly takes the form of (you guessed it) lazy pop-culture references, but you also get healthy doses of terrible banter of course.Not the most enjoyable way to waste your time, even if you can get it for cheap/free.

												If you're a GFX junkie, then this game certainly is not for you. Graphics and mucis are all 8bit and at first glance the game itself seems to be written in some old version of BASIC on a Comodore 64 (which is actually quite possible :D). But underneat that layer of all that 8bit gloss there's an extremely fun game!This game is full of humor and all standard old-school pen-n-paper RPG clichés that you have probably done when you actually played those pen-n-paper games with friends. Sadly though, that DM kinda sucks. If I had him for a DM in my pen-n-paper sessions, we'd have long discussions about NPC naming, story telling and such. But I think this is most likely yet an other prank from the developers :pI picked it up for €2,50 on the sale today, but if I knew this game was so much fun, I would have bought it earlier and have paid the €10 as well. It's really worth it, so much fun this game gives me!			"

												Now here's a charming tidbit of experimental gaming. A player pretending to be players role playing a game. It could have gone so wrong, but the developers understand that brevity is the better part of expression, and choice representations of tranditional pen and paper role playing cement this as a must play for anyone curious enough to give this a second look.It may take you that long to realize just what's happening, but once you do you'll probably be hooked ensuring your Grandma has her 17th level Paladin wearing fully upgraded equipment. The biggest drawback is the titles in game currency, which on iOS translates to real world microtransactions. Fortunately you can quest your way through earning all of the gold you'll need to pay for all of your upgrades.This is an addictive game, and the pixel art style has its appeal, through does not appear to scale well to all resolutions. A minor gripe, as the gameplay is the most compelling aspect. You'll want to grind away so your players can have the leveling high. There's no doubt this is a niche experience, but one you'll no doubt remember. A little pricey solo, I'd suggest buying the bundle of both Knights of Pen and Paper I and its sequel in one package (available via either of the games Steam pages).			"

												Knight of Pen & Paper is a simulator of RPG style combats. You can choose which monster to beat and how many of them. So you're totally free to put your own difficulty.The game reminds me of those old roleplays used to be ""played"" in forums:5 characters around a table with a master that is telling all the interactions you're doing with them. Plenty of environments, classes and monsters more or less tough are available during the quests.The bad point is the repetitive actions in combat, from a place to another you can't change your character because it will take too long to level. A character has only 4 skills, you can easily choose which skill is the best though you will note that the effects of a single skill does the same for every monster: An ice monster should be weak against fire. The mage class uses ""Fireball"", no effect. ""Deep Freeze"", super effective, and that against most of the monsters.Finally, the game should be fine for beginners, who never played any old RPG game before because Knights Of Pen & Paper is really easy to beat, hard with patience.Otherwise, I think the game would fit better on phone and tablets.

												Knights of Pen and Paper is a blast. I love turn-based RPGs and this game is an excellent one that has a solid mixture of gameplay, humor and replay value that took me by surprise. To start off with, if you enjoy turn-based RPGs then this is worth buying. Read on for a more in-depth review.In Knights of Pen and Paper you play as some friends sitting around a table and playing a Dungeons and Dragons-like game. You pick out your party and set up their class before the game begins which I thought was pretty cool. Typically new characters are introduced throughout the game, so it's interesting that we get to create our own dream team to play with. That's not all. You'll still find more characters throughout your time in the game. They'll offer new classes to use which you can switch out whenever you're not in combat. I found the cast of Knight of Pen and Paper to be nothing less than diverse and clever.The gameplay is pretty basic at far as turn-based RPGs go. Each party member and enemy will get a turn, and you're given a bar showing who's turn is when so you can plan out your turns accordingly. Leveling is a lot of fun as you get to unlock new abilities and see how each of these characters evolve. For me, the true appeal of Knights of Pen and Paper is its presentation. The story isn't groundbreaking--it's about as generic as any quest in Dungeons and Dragons could be. However, the characters themselves are entertaining as the story plays out. The developers did a great job of portraying all the party members as human beings who with personalities. Sometimes someone will question the logic of something absurd happening and is quickly told to shut up by the game master. I also remember one character being jubilant in defeating a boss and the text-based dialogue was perfect. Whenever I saw the speech bubbles appear I got a little excited.Knights of Pen and Paper is a solid game. It's got a classic feel to the gameplay, it has amazing presentation and it doesn't take itself seriously in the least. Even if you've never played a turn-based RPG, this is a game that would be the perfect entry to the genre.			"

												""Now THIS is what I call of Retro Love Letter, folks.""After playing a said 15 hours throughout the game, I couldn't help but put it down with a smile.Before I begin, there are several things you should know: Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition isn't a perfect game. Not even close. But that being said, it is some of the most humourous, most rewarding and most awkwardly endearing RPGs I've played in a while.It's pretty much a heartfelt love letter to retro gamers and DND gamers like myself; plenty of brilliant references (""Journey"" Village, anyone?), a hilariously cheesy plot, as well as there being plenty of fun things to go around.While most RPGs place you on the receiving end of the game, you both control the players AND the gamemaster; you control the characters' decisions and actions throughout the game, while you conduct any battles you choose of. Giving a total of 12 classes (I think; could be wrong) and 15 ""players"" to choose from, the game keeps things rather interesting with the gamers' unique quirks and diverse classes.While some complexity fans might find this a problem, the skill system isn't too deep. You generally have 1-3 something active powers wherein you have 1-3 passive powers. You upgrade it, and you get an increase of power in that skill. Personally, I found it enjoyable at the simplicity of the skill system, and wherein some hardcore gamers will probably be dissapointed, I found it organized and simple to enjoy the game.As for the story, while it's admittedly paper-thin, it's nonetheless enjoyable. You have a set of five gamers set out to save the world from rats, bandits, yetis, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles(C), Pac-Man ghosts, fire hydrants (I kinda made that one up...), and YOUR MOM! No seriously, you actually fight your mom in this game as the equivalent of Kingdom Hearts 2's Sephiroth.Then you get to the quests of the game, which isn't as fun. It's practically divided into three types: defeat ""X"" Y times, escort/deliver/travel x to y/to y, and find X. But even then, I found enjoyment of it for the reason I'm going to list in a bit. A common complaint with the game is that it follows the typical cliches of an 8-bit RPG and too much repetition. But even then, the game damn well KNOWS it cliched! I can count the number of lampshadings how the ""hero arrives just in the nick of time"", but you get the idea. And honestly: was Secrets of Mana repetitve in some areas? Yes. Was Chrono Trigger repetitive in some areas? Yes indeed. Was Final Fantasy repetitive in some areas? Yes, yes it was. And that's what made the game so enjoyable in my opinion: how it lampoons every issue with classic RPGs while providing it a loving tribute to it. Along with the create design the game offers, it's hard not to love it.The game's only downside as far as I'm concerened, is the dungeons. Not only are the to few and to far, but the randomness of it, the pure frustration of the difficulty, and the fact that it's completely out of the players' control could've made it much better. But I guess that's the price for having a focus in an other area oh so much so.In the end, if you like action-packed gameplay, deep skill systems, and fast pacing, then this game will probably not be for you. However, if you love retro gaming, memorable, if not cheesy, writing, and incredible optimization, then you will love this game as much as I did.Overall Verdict: 9/10. Superb game, really recommend it for your steam library.			"

												Overall this is a fun game with a few downsides.Pros:- graphics- music- references and jokes- this is a long game- character building (you can respec skills for small amount of gold)- fights are fun- game about playing a role-playing game- insane and fun plot- DLC is fair and square. It's a long, Halloween themed, series of quests.- some classes are really powerfulCons:- some classes are relatively weak- repetitive quests - that are fun nonetheless, due to amusing writing- grinding gold and XP - you really need to grind a lot of gold and XP just to advance further- upgrading weapons and armors takes too much gold- some fights take too long to finish- this game is mainly about fighting enemies- the plot develops fully only after playing like about 10 hours into the game, before that one point it's mainly a fantasy parody- you see those Space Invaders and school bullies in trailer? Good, you'll encounter them after about 10 hours of gameplay- one bad decision during buying stuff or upgrading weapons/armor can result in a need to grind more gold for about half an hourTo be honest - I've had a blast of a time with this game. It was fun, jokes were really good, the plot was absolutely insane. I can recommend playing this game if you like parody games that have focus on battles. Drop it if you don't like too much fighting and grinding gold/xp on same enemies over and over again.______For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ "

												Heh.-_-Okay, so: do you A.) Like Dungeons and Dragons-style adventuring games?B.) Like playing actual D&D style games, on pen and paper?C.) Would like to try a simulator of the two?This is that game. Will you like it? That's debatable.I bought this game when it was a daily deal because I like pen and paper D&D-style games. Note that I had received all of the boosts from the digital deluxe version.The retro-style graphics are a nice aesthetic, and there is quite a bit of variety with the creatures you will encounter in the game.So the game plays with you as the DM (dungeon master) overseeing a game of D20 Knights of Pen and Paper. You have seats that can sit how ever many characters you would like to use, but the last few seats require you to pay the in-game currency. You can keep grinding to afford the seats in the future.For each seat, you can sit a type of character (ex: hipster, grandma) and assign them a specific class (ex: barbarian, bard). This offers a seemingly wide range of party configurations.The difficulty is completely self-driven, as you are both the DM and the players. That being said, you may have an ""objective"" to kill 5 orcs - you can choose to fight them 1-at-a-time, or all at once, or whatever configuration you prefer. The entirety of the game involves A LOT of grinding, and this is even considering the boosts you may have gotten from the deluxe edition. I love D20 games, but this game can become repetitive extremely quickly. If there was a multiplayer cooperative functionality, it might have saved it a bit, however, there isn't one.There is A LOT of variety for you to upgrade - you can change everything from the type of table you're playing on (each type provides different bonuses) to the type of door in the room to the DM. All of this can help shape your overall party into a specfic area, like tanky high HP characters, or high MP, magic-relying casters.I paid ~$5 US for the deluxe edition, and I think even then you may want to hold off and wait for it to be cheaper, if you are interested in trying the game.

												This game is just absolutely fantastic! 20/D20I've been wanting to get involved in D&D for AGES but I just can't seem to a) Find any friends who want too b) Find any groups in my area that run a weekly or something.. A little sad.. But oh well I'll keep looking. In the meantime - This game fills that space perfectly! It's got quick wit, great humor, reflections on a vast array of older games; most of which I had a really nice time remembering thanks to this beauty!The gameplay is fairly quick and gets you into it without boring you in any way. A nice range of different classes, each one seperating it from the last meaning you can mix and match your 5-man squad quite a bit to your preferences!Difficulty can be .. Sort off.. Scaled. By choosing more enemies it makes it more difficult. I personally don't class this as 'difficulty' as such, and you can cheat the system by setting the enemies closer or further apart to suit your teams attack.. Though, even with 7 enemies sometimes it can be 'easy'.. This is a slight downside, but still isn't much of one and you won't be choosing 7 enemies to fight until you become stronger anyway, as it is generally too much (when matched against similar levels that is).But generally speaking this is a great game with tons of great moments!! If you're a fan of RPG's and D&D in general, you'll love this (I think..)!! :DPlus the new ones out soon!! Can't wait!!!			"

												Pretty brilliant. It's a turn based RPG, but it's not hard for noobies.You can balance it yourself by starting with more or less characters. I would strongly recommend starting with 5 players because the endgame is very hard otherwise.Other then that you really need to play it for an hour or two to find out if it's for you. I like the dry humor and pop culture references. And how it doesn't take itself too seriously. But some people call this 'lacking in depth' and I guess they're right too. They do re-use certain backgrounds and let you grind from level 32-37 and 1 mission later 37-45 at the end of the game, so they definitely rushed through the end trying to add some 'gameplay' without putting in work sadly. That level 50 mission is optional btw. Throughout the rest of the game there is rarely a need to grind though. Do note that the game has some large bugs. Some achievements are broken, some missions are broken, DLC doesn't work for some and there's graphical glitches. This seems like a hasty port honestly. And then there's the fact that if you want the Deluxier Edition you have to buy it at once. You can't upgrade. If you already have Normal edition or Deluxe edition (extra's, but no DLC) you're screwed. Also they just wiped everybody's saves trying to emplement the (not fully working) cloud save. Then wiped all saves again when reverting to the old build.So the game is very fun, but beware that this game is published by Paradox. As long as you're lucky enough to be in the 90% for whom most things don't break you're good. But if something goes wrong there's no support and dealing with Paradox is like talking to a 3 year old and when they realize you're right they just ignore you.I only recommend this game because it's unique. It's very money-grabby, too expensive and the publisher is unethical and clearly doesn't care about it's customers, but the game is so much  fun and most people don't care about what happens behind the scenes. And if I'd downvote it the fanboys would downvote this review and you wouldn't be reading about the downsides of this game right now.			"

												So the video preview is what got me to try this game. I will say it's the most meta RPG I've ever played and, unfortunately, it's very much in the spirit of a freemium facebook game.You need gold to buy a cup to buy more party members. Need gold for party members. Food, Travel, so on, you need gold for quite a lot. But no worries, you can buy more gold for USD, just click the everpresent gold buy button in the top right.I can see playing this game at short stretches, but I have no interest in the freemium nature of it.

												Pros:The game is kind of humorous.The backgrounds look nice.They removed microtransactionsCons:The gameplay lacks any depth.The game is super grindy.The game is REALLY resource intensive for what it is. (It uses 14% to 17% of my CPU just idling at the title screen.)Text is recycled far too often.The music isn't bad, but it is way too short. So in a given fight it probably loops 5 or 6 times.Alternate save files don't have independant gold, room items, characters, or classes; however, the blacksmith doesn't carry over. (The whole idea of all that being persistent is just stupid as it was physically impossible to get the game over achievement unless I deleted my save file.)More of a nitpick, but the developers made themselves the best characters in the game. (That's a bit too narassistic, in my opinion, and since they have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one-liners it ruins most of the fun of the game.)Overall:I got the game in a sale because it looked like it would fun to play. Little did I know I would just make a party full of physical attackers, leave the twister floor mat on, and just run this in the background while I played other games. The game got a bit of a chuckle from me when I first played it, but as the game dragged on it just got more monotonous due to there being no real growth in the game. Everything in the game scales linearly, including mana costs, so it's more about playing keep up with how much health the enemies in later areas have as opposed to actually feeling strong.			"

												Appealing idea at first: table-top RPG simulation.Turns out, the game is about grind. There is a story, but it is only about ""move, grind next 10 battles and 1 boss"". All battles could be won using the same tactics, with numerous menu invokes and the same skill rotations. Couldn't finish the game, though grinded with all my force to make it to the end and delete a game.Graphics is bad for my taste. Pixel-art by itself is not a justification for a tasteless.

												For quite a few hours I really liked this game. Then I ended up with all my party dead and not enough gold to revive more than one. And not enough gold then to take that one to an area in which to earn more gold. Sooo.... heading to the internet I read up on what happened and I saw a lot of confused information about other save systems, a blacksmith that wasn't mentioned in the game from what I could see, and microtransations that may or may not be in the pc version of the game as they were in the ios version for the mobile.Really such a shame as up until then I was loving the game, but seriously not enough to try and start it all over again. It's simple enough in premise, very more-ish when you're playing but unless you know what you are doing before you start, I wouldn't bother. If you do want to play it, definitely read up on it all before you start as you'll  have zero help in game.			"

I could get to the last dungeon easily, but then had to do almost 5 levels of grinding with all my guys just to be able to complete the final dungeon.-The blacksmith levels up far too slowly. The only way to level him is to get him grindstones, which you can find 1 to 4 of in certain locations.  However, at the final level you can give him 20-30 grindstones and barely move his xp bar.-Any game that encourages micro-transactions has already failed.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition is an example of what is wrong with the gaming industry, publishers and developers working together to make a game that is less than a full and proper experience without first investing heavily in it.  In most cases, that means you must use real world money to make your game run the way it should in the first place.  Luckily the game gives players a choice, you have the choice to play the game a great deal, or to buy shortcuts to make the game better.  Everywhere you turn there is a price attached to everything, you can gain the currency with playing or with plastic, and playing takes way too long.I would say that the game itself, when you ignore this horrible choice of microtransactions, is mediocre, not exceptional.  It has several novel ideas, but it lacks any real pay off, there is nothing revolutionary or deeply engaging about it.  Even the flavour text, the stuff you would hope would be most entertaining in a dungeons and dragons type of game feels weak and boring, as though the developers were not into it.Overall, I was quite disappointed with this title and I don't think many people will be able to enjoy it.

												Fun concept, bad execution.  The sequel is more recommended.  There are just TONS of better indie RPGs on Steam, that are more stable and more appropriately priced.*Edit - After spending a bit more time with Knights of Pen & Paper 2, I can honestly say that it is a superior product in every way shape and form.  All of the things that were promising and intriguing about the original, just not an awful pile of badly ported mobile garbage.  Skip this game and please go buy the sequel - it's fantastic.Nothing but cons to list here:Unstable and buggy port, my game was even missing a bunch of the dialogue.Poorly written dialogue, confusing and nonsensical story.Wide array of classes and items, that are almost all entirely useless due to lack of necessity/context in which to use them, and complete inability to level alternative classes once you reach mid or end-game (beyond an incredibly long and boring grind, repeating the same fights over and over for hours on end).End-game is an equally long and boring grind, money is extremely hard to come by, since the original (mobile) version of the game encouraged you to pay cash for gold - The disparity was never fixed when porting to PC.The price is absurd.  The port is so badly done, that there is zero justification for the seven dollar price increase.  The $4.99 DLC is a slap in the face for the amount of content received.  Easily should have been a $2.99 game w/ $0.99 DLC. "

												What a little gem! I found this beauty in the Paradox Humble Bundle (still available at the time of writing so go grab it if you haven't already) and fell in love with it.

												This game is awesome, well worth the low price, I also recommend the digital deluxe edition. It includes some gold and stuff, but mainly a village thats GREAT for grinding xp in the early parts of the game.Anyway, heres my thoughts:Sound: The soundtrack isn't bad, pretty much what you'd expect in an rpg game, I do occasionally get sick of the looping song. However, the boss music is awesome and intense.Graphics: The graphics rock, It's all pixel art and it looks awesome!Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty simple, but its also fun and at times, hilarious. The basic idea is your a bunch of people playing a game like dungeons and dragons in a basement. You choose your characters race (Pizza guy, jock, nerd etc) and class (cleric warrior paladin mage etc) and start playing. As you level up you will unlock and upgrade your different skills. There are plenty of fun items to find and equip, and I also joy at leveling up. Not only can you  buy ingame items, you can buy furniture, new tables, and snacks and drinks for the basement that your ACTUALLY playing the game in for buffs in the game. Pretty funny if you ask me. The game is very fun to play overall, even though at times, the missions feel a bit similar.Overall I would give this game a 8.7 out of 10.			"

												A fun and simple game, witty dialogue and, in some cases, reminded me of my tabletop gaming group. What I didn't like is the excessive need of grinding, more so, in the end levels, the fact that you could screw up the game if you didn't choose the correct skills each level and the music, in the end, it was the same soundtrack again and again. If you can work with that, it is easy to recommend this game.			"

			Built upon the 'game within a game' concept, the player creates players who play the game while they play the game of managing the players.		

Built upon the 'game within a game' concept, the player creates players who play the game while they play the game of managing the players.Many classic tabletop RPG tropes are highlighted here with awkward adventures, illogical random encounters and McGuffins as far as the eye can see.  Having been ported from mobile devices the pacing and flow of the game still has some of the feel from the original versions which can drag the experience down.			"

												This game is a wonderful mini-masterpiece that makes you feel as if you're playing a table-top game without the actual table or friends. You can experience D&D-style gameplay without having to break out dice, charts, pencils, and painted figures, and it really makes it much easier to immerse yourself into the game. With the deluxe edition, you get SO many awesome new items and references to play with, including furniture such as THE TARDIS from Doctor Who, 800 gold coins and starting buff items, and even a new player character that makes a powerful magic user! I'd honestly buy the game just for that.So many different players-class combinations to choose from that could either make the game difficult or easy, and it's so much fun to try different combos!I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes RPG games, humor, and gaming/television references!

												It's a charming concept that loses its charm fairly quickly. The humor gets old, and the combat system gets boring and repetitive. The story is pretty bland and its execution is poor, drowned in the midst of required jobber battles that the game throws at you in a mockery of typical poor DMing style. It's got the American Nightmare problem in which it acknowledges why what it's parodying is lame, but doesn't actually do anything to fix it. Something that's ironically bad is still, unfortunately, bad.In all, it feels like a quirky, above-average quickie mobile game that sells itself as an engaging RPG.If you like that sort of thing, then get it when it's on sale. It's not worth $10.			"

												I don't know where and when I got this game...But... This game...This game is awesome!I liked the overall parody feel about it while it has a strong and solid work about delivering action and plot in moderation, getting some loud laughs from me here and there. The battle is unforgiving, so you always have to be focused, despite it being turn-based. The difficulty is adjustable in a manner ""How frisky you are today?"", taking on anything between 1 and 7 rats or elite monsters. The open-ended way the characters are presented lets you use your imagination. I do feel like playing a table top sheets'n'pens while playing this. Yes, the feel of every character is an illusion, but it's a very-VERY well made illusion.Another point is the building difficulty: Items give you stats that you barely see. Levels give you damage that you barely see. Hp and Mana regen is earned by tears and sweat dripping down your inner thigh. All this while enemy shamelessly uses lifesteal and applies crazy bleeding stacks. Some battles will be so tight that you will stain your undergarments a bit and still lose because of the enemy randomly preferring your rouge to your fully buffed granny paladin. You will put a sleep on a DoT'ed enemy and lose your healer because of that, and you will spend 4 times the money you earned in that battle to revive your team. You will even spend 2k on upgrading your sword and still get nothing in return because you are a looser and you will have no money to leave the god forsaken town.But... You know... That's what's good about this game... That's what's your adventure is. And you should not just accept it, but have tons of fun while at it!I would like to say thank you to the developers. I've seen a lot of attempts to do what they achieved in this game and i think they did it better than anyone else I've seen so far, including UnEpic and Magicka, the first being too far away and the second being a bit too silly. But this game, oh, this game grabs the bull by his modesty and makes him enjoy it so much that he's ashamed afterwards, but he begs for more.Highly recommend.			"

												I wanted to like this game, I really did. It had a nice aesthetic, nice music, and it was from a small studio. Had I been aware that this was an iOS app before it was a PC game, I might've been more wary. The first couple hours went by relatively nicely, but after that, not so much. If you buy the Deluxe Edition DLC, you get the Magika Wizard, a character with a better passive skill advantage than most other (see next point) characters. Around level 15, you unlock the Developer Player Characters, self-inserts that have even better passives, making whatever current party you're using seem feeble in comparison. Also around this time, you'll notice your strength isn't getting you as far as it did in the beginning, so you go to buy gear. Only, the blacksmith, by default, has a 30-some percent chance at actually crafting the item you pay him for. So, either you toss bags of money at the him, praying that he succeeds (because of course he doesn't reimburse you), or you get grindstones, items that let you ""level him up"". It takes around 2000 grindstones at 25 gold apiece to have him reach 100%. That's 50,000 gold. At level 15, you might gain 200 per fight. Oh, but what's this? You can buy gold in-game for real money! Of course you can. Sadly, this game really was designed as a cash-hungry iOS game first and foremost. 4/10, for the initial hour or two of fun before the grind.			"

												This little game, a nostalgic blend of retro-console RPG's and old-school D&D, is novel and amusing. I love the interface, with the DM seated on one side of a table and the players (characters) on the other side, and with the scenery changing around them and the ranks of opponents springing up from behind the DM's shoulders. Character development and turn-based combat are simplistic and two-dimensional, but interesting and challenging. However, it all starts to get repetitive and a little monotonous after a half-dozen or so hours of play. If you can get this game on sale for under $5, it's worthwhile. As for the in-game gold that can be bought with real-world money: It's totally unnecessary, and buying some may even spoil the game for you, since it will make the game too easy and reduce the number of enjoyable hours you'll get out of it.

												So I've spent the last 5 hours playing this, and I think its well worth the $3.74 for the deluxe version. I bought it on today's daily deal, then sent one to my husband as well. He's a long time D&D nerd and I've played on occassion as well.I'm only around levels 19-24 in my characters and spent most of my inital gold opening up full party options and some table add-ons, so I've been doing a lot of dungeon crawling to earn money for armor/weapons upgrades. There is an option to buy gold with real money, but I'm finding it easy to earn the gold I need so it's really just a time saver, and the cash shop is not quite the money-grab a lot of other cash shops are.

												I wanted to like this game, I really did. It had a nice aesthetic, nice music, and it was from a small studio. Had I been aware that this was an iOS app before it was a PC game, I might've been more wary. The first couple hours went by relatively nicely, but after that, not so much. If you buy the Deluxe Edition DLC, you get the Magika Wizard, a character with a better passive skill advantage than most other (see next point) characters. Around level 15, you unlock the Developer Player Characters, self-inserts that have even better passives, making whatever current party you're using seem feeble in comparison. Also around this time, you'll notice your strength isn't getting you as far as it did in the beginning, so you go to buy gear. Only, the blacksmith, by default, has a 30-some percent chance at actually crafting the item you pay him for. So, either you toss bags of money at the him, praying that he succeeds (because of course he doesn't reimburse you), or you get grindstones, items that let you ""level him up"". It takes around 2000 grindstones at 25 gold apiece to have him reach 100%. That's 50,000 gold. At level 15, you might gain 200 per fight. Oh, but what's this? You can buy gold in-game for real money! Of course you can. Sadly, this game really was designed as a cash-hungry iOS game first and foremost. 4/10, for the initial hour or two of fun before the grind.			"

												I feel torn about this game.  At first it was interesting in the simplicity and style, yet as the game progresses it feel immensely tedious.  There will be quests where you are required to go from one location to another and have to fight at each step along the way, sometimes up to five or six battles.  Then once you arrive the quest is to slay a number of monsters repeatedly.  The endgame seems almost unfair, requiring a lot of grinding unless you spend a lot of time exploring sidequests.  Based on the price, I think the game has a niche in the category of game where you advance through it periodically while taking a break from other games.  Could improvements be made? Absolutely, but for an indie title with some creative 4th wall shattering, it serves it's place decently.			"

												What a little gem! I found this beauty in the Paradox Humble Bundle (still available at the time of writing so go grab it if you haven't already) and fell in love with it. Not the style of RPG that I've really had much experience with so for me this was a bit of an experiment. I digress, a simple and smooth game that's easy to get into. I found it a little odd that my rogue has an attack almost double that of my warrior but that's pretty much the only issue I've had. Of course there's grinding... and then some more grinding Oh I'm sorry did you think you were done? Guess what!?MORE GRINDINGBut that's what you sign up for with these games, you have to be prepared for it and I have to say, it pays off. The parody of the traditional D&D scenario is wonderful and the humor is very self aware. The references are tasteful and abundant but not overly so that they obscure the story.I would recommend this to anyone lacking the means, friends or who's simply as antisocial as myself to actually play D&D (not a bad thing) to give this a go if you are interested in that sort of thing.

												A fun and simple game, witty dialogue and, in some cases, reminded me of my tabletop gaming group. What I didn't like is the excessive need of grinding, more so, in the end levels, the fact that you could screw up the game if you didn't choose the correct skills each level and the music, in the end, it was the same soundtrack again and again. If you can work with that, it is easy to recommend this game.			"

Now this game has my full attention and has completely blown me away. I wasn't expecting to open the game and sit and play it for hours on end without looking away from the screen. I have only one regret about buy this game though. It is that I didn't buy the deluxe edition when I had the chance cause there is no upgrade as of right now so I'm missing out on a few extra levels and a new character. So buy this game, and buy the deluxe edition cause you will regret it!			"

I love the idea of the game with the players at the table as the main UI etc.I too have been thoroughly enjoying the game and it's a shame those MicroTransaction (MT) haters can't see past their own hate of MTs to give this game a go. The MTs are such a non-issue, the game is not gimped in any way, shape or form without using the MTs. All I can say is, give the game a go.. you will genuine like it if you like old school rpgs.One of the most enjoyable turn based RPGs I've played for a while. "

												An absolutely ridiculous game, the good kind.I find references here more often than I do in World of Warcraft, it's insane, I mean the starting ""Master"", is the fat Comic Store guy from The Simpsons, and another of the starting ""Bonus objects"", is a Tardis.Even if you go to a certain place, you find the top of a Stargate, it's horrifically funny in my opinion.On a more serious note, the gameplay itself is more simple than it may seem, sure it's tactical, being a WoW veteran, I had to go for a ""Tank, healer, dps and offtank/dps"" kinda thing, with a Paladin tank, Warrior offtank and Druid healer, obviously later on I added a Rogue and a Hunter for dps, but you can do any combination possible.All-in-all, simple, funny, and easy game, I'm going to let you decide on the rest.

												Firstly I will tell you this game is a mobile port.Second it has a microtransaction of buying ingame gold for cash,but you never  and I mean never need to use it.There are plenty of items ingame that increase the amount of gold you get dropped that have other stats to them.Now to the review.Short Review:Game has classes you can swap in and out,skills that you can level individually,upgradeable class locked weapons/armor and plenty of item accessories and consumables.The game has pop culture reference comedy all throughout it,hardly any variation in quest types and is grindy since you only turn-base fight your way through each situation for the most part.Plenty of boss fights in the game,no puzzles, and a small learning curve on how to handle things. Uses dice roll to determine things such as crafting chance,battles,etc. If you like games you can play 5min-1hr + at a time,do not mind grind , a pop culture heavy comedic story, and little varation in gameplay then pick it up on sale, or in a bundle. I would not pay full price,just does not feel like a $10 game , more like a $2.50-$5 one.Regular Review:The game itself is a comedic sort of table top dice roll turned into a video game.The dialog trees,characters, and the story have comedy all throughout them. The game has tons of pop culture references from 1970s- onward in both enemies,outfits and dialog.Gameplay mechanic wise you pretty much fight turn based fight your way through all the quests you do.There is hardly any variation in the quests escort,item fetch/deliever,rescue, and fight/slay. They incorporate you grind fighting your way through.There are no puzzles or anything so do not expect much outsite of witty dialog and fights.Items in the game are what you would expect, consumables with stat buffs that last for a certain time.Weapons/armor are not sold but are upgraded by blacksmiths.They are only found in towns as well as item purchases.There are different character classes each with 4 skills that you can level up individually.When you decide what character classes you want you have to pick a person whom hs their on special stat they add to be that class.You can swap in and out character classes that you level up when you are at towns with taverns.The game can be played for 5min- 1hr+ depending on how much grinding and story you are willing to play through. There is a NG+ when you beat the game to continue on your adventures which resets all the quests making the mobs tougher at the beginning onward.My final verdict on this game is if you do not mind the grind,it is a enjoyable title.Its simple yet to the point.I played it in spurts and had fun playing it.Its deffinately not for everyone but no game out there is.Get it on sale or in a bundle, not worth $10 to me more like $2.50-$5 game.Not for lack of content,more for lack of variations in quests and gameplay mechanics.

												Literally a game of grinding, but at least it has nice visuals. Probably feels better on a touch-interface than using a mouse (no keyboard hotkeys). Deluxe edition cuts down on the grinding by giving a head start (so just get the original version) but if you hate grinding then you shouldn't get this game.

												Do not ever buy this game, even if you see it for a really low price. This game is a total bore fest that has some good concepts but overall fails at executing them. Full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ humor, lame wannabe retro graphics, irritatingly horrible music and lame game-play that will make you wonder why you are playing this game to begin with. If you want a good Computer RPG that is similar in vein to PnP RPGs, I suggest picking up the original Fallout games or the Black Isle Studio DnD games, such as Baldur's Gate and PlaneScape. Or you could go get a legit PnP RPG game, gather your pals and play that, and that's also heaps better than this.			"

												I love how easy this game is to pick up and put down (though putting it down is harder and harder the more I get into it!). I love casual games of this kind, especially ones that are deep enough to really get into. I love the idea of the game with the players at the table as the main UI etc.I too have been thoroughly enjoying the game and it's a shame those MicroTransaction (MT) haters can't see past their own hate of MTs to give this game a go. The MTs are such a non-issue, the game is not gimped in any way, shape or form without using the MTs. All I can say is, give the game a go.. you will genuine like it if you like old school rpgs.One of the most enjoyable turn based RPGs I've played for a while. "

												An absolutely ridiculous game, the good kind.I find references here more often than I do in World of Warcraft, it's insane, I mean the starting ""Master"", is the fat Comic Store guy from The Simpsons, and another of the starting ""Bonus objects"", is a Tardis.Even if you go to a certain place, you find the top of a Stargate, it's horrifically funny in my opinion.On a more serious note, the gameplay itself is more simple than it may seem, sure it's tactical, being a WoW veteran, I had to go for a ""Tank, healer, dps and offtank/dps"" kinda thing, with a Paladin tank, Warrior offtank and Druid healer, obviously later on I added a Rogue and a Hunter for dps, but you can do any combination possible.All-in-all, simple, funny, and easy game, I'm going to let you decide on the rest.

												Despite being sprites rather than 3D, this game threatened to overheat my laptop, which I count the first strike against it. It's no good sacrificing graphics quality if you're still going to demand huge amounts of GPU investment. The second strike is that the massive amounts of heat are going to waste doing nothing at high speeds - the game is irritatingly slow at times, and I used CheatEngine to double KPP+1's speed to get it to a tolerable level. In-app purchases are the third strike leading me to conclude: KPP+1 is a bad game. Cute characters, witty humor, and a whole lot of hack'n'slash against evil monsters doesn't make up for poor underlying design.			"

												I wish there was a ""meh"" button between yes and no, but Knights of Pen and Paper is... well, a basic, bare-bones turn-based grindy RPG.  Don't interpret the no vote to mean I think it's a bad game, it's just not that inspiring.  You set up a party, choose which fights you want so as to make sure you don't bite off more than you can chew, and then grind, grind, and grind some more.  Then you curb-stomp a quest boss when you can be bothered.  You have four skills per character, and basically pick one or two to min-max, and use basically exclusively for the entire length of the game.  Since your potential actions are so limited in combat, the differences between one fight and the next are negligible... if you're even fighting different enemies at all, since uneven challenge and reward schedules tend to reward players heavily for fighting the same pack of creatures in droves until you're ready to leapfrog half a dozen levels to the next cash cow.  A special ""rug"" for auto-battling basically means this game becomes something to press ""start"" on, then come back to later to reset another battle.  The only real thing to do outside of battles is to buy things, so there isn't much to break the monotony.Kinghts of Pen and Paper is a decent concept, but it just doesn't engage the player enough for me to give this a good recommendation.

												First game I've ever bought on Steam where I've not actually gotten what I paid for. Sure sometimes a game will have bugs, and sometimes there may be un-noticed system requirements/limitations which are my fault for missing. But here, it's not even the right product. Advertised as win/mac/linux, but buying the deluxe version, none of that extra content shows up for linux. No response from the publisher/devs on their own steam forum linux-specific discussion. First time I've ever felt truly cheated on Steam.Edit: Dec 12th, 2014WIth the latest update, it seems that at long last 2 1/2 months later, the Deluxe Version finally works under linux. Of course they've still been selling for Linux this whole time instead of taking that off until it was fixed. What miniscule communication there has been in that time was all of poor quality and incorrect. Moreover this actual fix wasn't even described or announced. Still cannot recommend.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper +1 wasn't really the game I was expecting to go through. I thought it was actually worse than it is, and I'm glad I ended up buying this title and playing through it's 9 hour-ish campaign. The basic premise is, you are a group of friends that are playing the much known fantasy tabletop role-playing game, and your adventures are depicted both through pixelated landscapes/characters and from what the D&D players are actually saying, or actually the dungeon master. Much like in the main idea from the movie Inception, you are playing a game in which the characters are playing a game. So, gameception?KoP&P (Knights of Pen and Paper) is an RPG, and most features you expect from one are available in this title. Leveling up your characters, giving them new items, armor and weapons, upgrading your character's abilities, questing your way through until the very end, or until New Game +, in which your able to replay the whole game, with the same characters, but everything is harder. It didn't really attract me, since the main campaign features a bit of grinding and I didn't want to go through the same. It's useful for completing the achievements, though.Soundtrack fits the theme of KoP&P, but can actually become boring after a few hours of gameplay. Another interesting feature is the abundance of references to tv shows, movies, etc. You eventually find a character named Nabe Gewell, which lives in Steam Island, which I found amusing. The 4th wall is also broken lots of times.In conclusion, do yourself a favor, and purchase KoP&P. It entertained me for a couple hours and I'm sure it will do the same for you. Alas, if you actually don't enjoy D&D's concept, steer in the way of another game. "

												Let me first say that Its cute. Its user friendly. It has some funny moments.Having said that, I feel this game is empty. I can handle slow paced and repetitive games but Knights of Pen and Paper is so slow, so repetitive, and so monotonous that I can't appreciate it even as a background distraction while multitasking. Any game so simple needs to compensate with good story depth, complexity, style, or pacing. This game delivers none of these. "

												The premise of the game might be funny at first, but dulls down to pure boredom as you progress through this repetetive grind fest of an RPG...The Leveling as well as the Fight mechanics are, well boring, as well as the whole presentation of the game, you just see your group of people sitting at the table doing next to nothing as you read text boxes...I know this is all intended but still, the narration just lacks the humour or tension or just anything to make up for all the downsides... I played for 10h, I had fun for 1 at most...the other 9 were just hope it could get better, but ah well, it did not...I would not recommend this game to anyone.

												This beings back so many great memories of playing the original table top Dungeons and Dragons. I have only put in a few hours but for being an old school gamer, this game is what I was hoping it would be, fun and attention grabbing. You start out with 2 characters and you start doing quest, mostly by killing mosters, which you gain XP and coins. With the coins you can unlock more characters, buy equipment, pay for travel, buy additional tables, buy bonuses, etc. If you are bored easy, do not like 8-bit graphics, never played D&D, or do not want to grind out some levels, then this game might not be for you.Pros: -Adjustable screen resolution-Like you are playing a D&D game-ReplayableCons:-Music (8-bit music but mute works great)-Grindy			"

												If you are a linux user beware of the +1 edition. Save your money because the extra content does not work and so far the developers have not even posted a reply on the forums stating they are aware of the problem or care. Works well on my Windows machine, all extra content loaded with no fuss, and is a fun little game, but since I run both systems, the best I will give it is 0/10 for lack of support.			"

Boring.Knights of Pen & Paper is long, dull, grindy and most of all it is boring.It starts out novel enough. You are playing a game about a bunch of gamers playing D&DA few obvious jokes and references and things start out pretty well.The sound, music, graphics, they all lend themselves pretty well. But the grind, jeez! This is a single player game! Who thought that...Converted mobile app with a cash shop in the mobile version? OooooooooooooooohI don't need to say much more really. As far as converted mobile games go its actually really well ported. But the play time is so artifically padded that you probably will not complete the game. A sequel has been announced and I hope and pray it addresses the flaws this game has or even just does away with the excessive grinding for the inevitable PC port.I know some smartass will reply that this is an RPG and you are supposed to grind but this isn't 1997 anymore. Games like Bravely Default, like Magic Fantasy Battle 4, have come along and said 'listen, there is grinding but we streamlined it or we made it fun.'I stopped caring about the storyline the 8th time I was told to backtrack for excuse reasons. I especially stopped caring when my Lv32 Barbarian, with maxed equipment, wearing 4 +9attack items, still can't one shot a friggen spider! I especially was agitated that a newer version of this game was released that I can't simply upgrade too, or even buy apprently since steam says 'you already own that game' when clearly I don't. Flaws aside the game is enjoyable in short bursts which is fitting given its mobile phone roots. It was ported to the PC and no real effort was made to make it a more PC friendly game. Instead its dull, repetitive and boring.Also the achievement, beat in 365 (game)days, is unachievable it seems. That's always nice for the achievement hunters.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												(This is a copy-paste of my Google Play review, since I apparently don't ""own"" a license to the app and my review was automatically deleted right after posting it) - I purchased it via the Humble Bundle.This game is a great game! In fact, I got hooked into it to the point I play it instead of Clash of Clans (if I'm not already playing Geometry Dash).It's so satisfying to be able to have a Dungeons-and-Dragons-like game in my pocket that I can bring anywhere and play at anytime.The mechanics aren't groundbreaking, but it's included everything that I've forgotten to consider as a Dungeon Master.The story's full of references to our gaming culture, but towards the end of the game, I felt that the story died after the ""you have to save the world"" bit... And the grind to the higher levels seemed impossible.(I mean come on... I've finished all the quests elsewhere and all my characters are only Level 37, despite having to beat Level 50-60 bosses which naturally one-shot them all, and getting gold becomes impossible without having to repeat near-death dungeons as farming lower down becomes more and more redundant as you level up since the bosses are the only thing that actually yields descent (more than 40) gold.)The only other problem with this game is (only applies to the Android version)... I can't buy the DLC or add gold.			"

												Quite an addicting little game. Tne story involves a group of good ol' table-top rpg players trying to define the thin line that separates the game fro reality. It is a turn-based RPG where you choose what kind of adventurers you want in your group and level their character sheets as you would in a traditional table-top RPG, with dice rolls and everything. The story is the main selling point of the game and it does have its' own little charm to it, I did laugh at most of the jokes, though some of them fall a bit flat (it is mostly reference-based humour). There's a lot of text to go through, so it is not recommended for people who like to skip most of the dialogue in games. Good for playing if you have a bit of time on your hands, however I would not recommend it for ""hardcore"" players - they might be disappointed with the combat system (which is a bit simplistic and does not involve a lot of management) and find the game too repetitive. The progress does feel rewarding, however, there is quite a high level of grinding involved which should be taken into consideration. The art style and character design match the tone of the game well and the simple animation feels natural. The music could be better, after some time it can get a bit repetitive.Overall - I do like the game and I do recommend it if you are just looking for a little time waster.			"

												This is an example of how games of old should be made anew.Everything is fully customizable, from the role of each class you pick to your next quest;The gameplay is solid, comparable to classic JRPGs like Phantasy Star II and Dragon Quest V,But with a ""do what you want, when you want, the way you think you can handle"" touch.The graphics are reminiscent of Kairosoft's cellphone games (Game Dev Story), and look very good.Highly recommended!

												For its value, its a good game, streamlined, nostalgic and a bit wonky. Fun for idling the hours during those days you just want to shut out the world and escape for a bit. A good solid game, worth the few hours you will spend playing it and then replaying if you like the achievements.  Buy on Sale, though good, not worth 10$.			"

												This is an example of how games of old should be made anew.Everything is fully customizable, from the role of each class you pick to your next quest;The gameplay is solid, comparable to classic JRPGs like Phantasy Star II and Dragon Quest V,But with a ""do what you want, when you want, the way you think you can handle"" touch.The graphics are reminiscent of Kairosoft's cellphone games (Game Dev Story), and look very good.Highly recommended!

												Tabletop rping gone meta. This game is chock full of little gags, from visual ones in the background to quotes and characters. The gameplay itself is solid and is a lot of fun. There are times where you do have to grind but that's standard issue for an rpg and if you dislike that then there are very few rpg's I would or could recommend.I have no issues with this game... With one exception, the in game microtransactions. You can avoid them quite easily, but it irks me that it is still included in a game I had to pay for in the first place. Either be free and have microtransactions or paid and not have them not paid and have them, that's just underhanded. That being said it's actually really easy to get around. If your main team dies just create a new one and any coins they earn will be shared between the different playthroughs. There's also a new game + mode but it doesn't really add anything except the monsters being more difficult.I would highly recommend this game but I would also wait for it to appear in a steam sale.

												I really, really, really want to recommend this game. It's a cool little game and a bit addictive to boot. Had I written this review after just an hour then it would have been an enthusiastic yes! However, it has a serious flaw; it is so repetitive in nature that eventually you'll find yourself playing for the sake of it. I skip dialogs. I auto-click through tedious battles. I just want the game to be completed. My desire to achieve that has, well, almost been depleted. I made a few errors on my first go at the game. The thought of restarting fills me full of dread. There's no way I could grind my way through the game again and have any fun doing so.The game seems to lack keyboard controls, and all the mouse movement is RSI inducing. I'm sure its better on a touchscreen, but this is a review of the PC version. The developers really should look into enabling some keyboard controls.			"

												This game is so addictive!!!  I've played it for hours and it's always fun to just load it up whenever you have some spare minutes! :)  It's turn based combat with different classes that you can choose to add to your team and the ingame store has plenty of cool things to buy with ingame cash that you earn from battles.  It's easy enough to keep wanting another go but difficult enough to keep you trying to ""just get past that next load of monsters"" :)  And at this price... a must buy for any fantasy turn based combat player.  P.S. don't get put off by the pixelised low res graphics... the amount of fun and humour more than makes up for any cosmetic looks and will keep you coming back to it again and again! :)			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper +1, is... Different.Something you should know:On the google play store, it is only £1.99.On steam it is £7.99. For the SAME GAME.Just for this, I wouldn't reccommend buying it from Steam on principle, as even though it is a brillian game, it is still only a mobile android app. On PC.Now I got this game with a Humble Bundle, so assuming I paid the £1.99 for it, I can certainly say it was worth it.I think my first runthrough took approx 12 hours, that wasn't rushed but it wasn't lazed either, so even if you where to pay £7.99, it still has more play time then most £40 hit title campaigns.In the game you take control of 5 people role playing in a board RPG pretty much, and without going into to much detail, it's like playing a game of Dungeons & Dragons with amusing characters and dungeonmaster.The missions are reasonably simple, and if you complete the entire campaign in a day, like me, then it does get somewhat repetitive by the end, though if you actually have a life and pace it out a bit more, you may not find this the same.The game is FULL of references, there are pointers to Star Wars, Pokemon, Sponge Bob Square Pants, TMNT, Final Fantasy, Mario and much much more, almost every five minutes I would see something and be amazed at how many references they have fit in there.That is everything, and if you are reading this and the Humble Bundle PC & Android Bundle 9 is still on (It is until 14/04/14) then go and get it, as it is worth it.

												A fun pseudo-DND rpg game. I enjoy the amount of metagame in the story. The things that the charecters say and the generic sounding names of things makes it funny. The gameplay is like the old school final fantasy style so if you enjoy that kind of GUI. My main complaint is that it gives you 3 slots to start new games but you share your gold and upgrades between each game. So your 2nd playthrough will always be easier.			"

												It's not a bad little game.  It's a port/adaptation of a game originally developed for smart devices, but it plays quite well in translation. There are a few small design changes I'd have made differently, and it's not as funny as I had expected, but it's a neat turn-based RPG done simply with a couple cool extras that provide some depth and customization. My overall impression after about ten hours would be a solid 8/10.  I don't feel the need to seek out a RL game of D&D afer playing this, but at least I can dork out over a D20 in secret thanks to Knights of Pen and Paper.			"

												KPP+1 seems like an interesting concept, but it's really not. The theme is you actually roleplay players in a roleplaying world as characters.  You get the impression this is going to result in lots of humor and a diversity of environments where the players goof around in-character, but it doesn't happen.  Instead, you just end up picking a party of characters, optimize their performance with player personalities, buy add-ons for your gameroom that give character bonuses such as a better table or door, and meander through a roleplaying world which has little plot in itself nevermind the lack of out-of-character plot among the players.  There isn't THAT much grinding if you do all the quests and use your items and gameroom bonuses appropriately to multiply the amount of experience and gold you get from battles, but you still have to complete slayer quests which are like how in MMOs you have to kill so many monsters for a reward.  The battle system is rather repetitive too.  Basically, you just get a taunting tank, heal it, and disable opponents while bombarding them with a magic dps and melee dps.  This goes on over and over with no change in tactics.  I say this despite how you can ""choose the difficulty"" by picking how many monsters you want to fight.  It's either you pick too little monsters to bother, pick just enough to repeat over and over, or pick too many to handle.  On the plus side, you can grab revive items in the shop in case your party dies out rather than paying the revive cost if you pick too many to handle, but it still doesn't make up for the repetition.  This is compounded by the ridiculous investment needed to level up the blacksmith by buying ""grindstones"".  Each one costs 25 coins, yet the optimal levels of upgrading require around 100 grindstones.  Basically, that means you have to earn 6-7k coins, and when you're earning around 50-100 coins per fight until about 75% of the way through the game where you start earning 250-300 coins per fight, that means you're not going to experience using the blacksmith for a very long time.  You also need to buy enough luck amulets and great molten rings to make the optimal level cost effective, and you have to buy gameroom items to accelerate your income, so that's another 2-3k.  This ignores how you're spending coins on other things, so it really takes a long time just to unlock better equipment for your party.The campaign ultimately feels like a tutorial sampler of what the game has to offer.  Had the game included a custom campaign editor, this would be awesome since players could make their own material and share it in the community.  Heck, the campaign even feels like it'll unlock this towards the end in saying how the gameworld is much bigger than what you can see, but it never gets unlocked.  Also, the new classes you unlock are mostly pointless.  They're effective, but you have to level them up instead of being able to introduce them into the game right away, and that's a huge timesink.  Even if you play ""New Game+"" you still have to level them up.  This really stinks since it'd be nice to immediately jump into using a barbarian, knight, shaman, bard, and necromancer instead of a warrior, cleric, druid, mage, and rogue.  The game however just says, ""NO.  YOU DO HARD WAY OR NOT AT ALL!  GRRR!""On the other hand, if you start a plain old new game for the party, then you have to go through the hassle of upgrading the blacksmith all over again!  Don't forget the great molten rings or luck amulets too!  To be fair, you don't have to buy the income earning gameroom upgrades again, and you can technically grind out the income with your previous party in your other game since coins pool from all saved games, but still, you're talking about a good 8-9k in coins just to upgrade the blacksmith again. At that rate, you might as well just buy experience potions for 100 coins a pop to give everyone 6500 experience, plus you can buy the potion upgrades in the game room and use Ronaldo for the potion upgrade......but still, it's just more repetition.  This is supposed to be a roleplaying game instead of a railroad shooter.If the devs just spend a little more time on writing a plot, this game could have been awesome, but they didn't, so it flopped.

Maybe at times there is too much grinding but if you are not scared of that, get it and play it. Also it's not really long, if you want to only finish it, but there are plenty of things that is making you to play this game again and again. I really enjoyed this game and since there is second Knights of Pen and Paper I will be sure to grab it and have fun with it one day. It was really relaxing time I spend playing this game.			"

												KoPP is modeled after D&D gameplay. You play as a group of roleplayers sitting around a table, going on an adventure led by a dungeon master. No, really. The DM is actually there, narrating the quest. It’s a really unique RPG in its presentation, though not so much in its gameplay, which is a rather simple turn-based battle system.The simplicity owes to the game's origins on mobile platforms, and this is why recommending KoPP is complicated for me: It still plays exactly like a mobile game, much better suited for playing in small intervals. Understandably, a lot of people don't expect that from a $10 PC game. If it was the same price as the mobile version ($3), maybe it could get away with its lack of depth. Not for this price.It's also worth noting that there are microtransactions in the game. [Update: Not anymore. As of patch 2.09 (2014/02/14), they have been removed from the game.]. Also, some achievements are broken, and won't be fixed for a while. [Update: Also fixed in patch 2.09, I was able to obtain all of them.]You may be wondering why I recommend the game after all. Very simple. I still enjoyed it. I'd play it while watching a stream or something, when I wanted to unwind and avoid ultra-complex games. In a way, I went through it with the mobile mindset, and this is the case in which I'd recommend KoPP, if you want a simple game.Just don't get it for full price, even if you really want it. It's not worth it. Wait for a sale of at least 50% off.			"

												Fantastic game; totally worth buy at the discount. Its basically a parody d&d 8/16bit game. Develop a party of up to 5, with a few different classes (pally, druid, rogue, mage, cleric, warrior), each with their own abilities, grind enemies, or do quests. Kill enemies, get gold/loot to buy better gear. Upgrade your gear at the blacksmith. Lots of replay value imho. It may get grindy for certain buffs, but battles can be made easier or harder and you can always rest to recoup health/mana.			"

Looks like it has a lot of things to keep me busy playing and looks like chances to goof around and try other things for laughs. However, my only gripe with the game so far is there isn't much classes or kinds of players to pick from. Yet, I'm really looking forward to playing more of this game when I get the chance. This is a very simple load up and play game. Totally recommended if you enjoy D&D. Worth the $2.49 I spent on this game, easily!			"

Posted: December 8, 2013
												(this review mainly looks at microtransactions)I initially was really excited about this game, as I find the premise and art style quite appealing. The problem lies, as many reviewers prior to me noticed, within built-in microtransactions. Ability to bypass the grind paying for in-game currency ruins any kind of trust in the economy at all. Some people might be OK with this, but I do have a couple points of contention: - The financial aspect introduces a bias from the point of developer, conscious or otherwise, to balance a game in a way that will push a player to use microtransactions. From that point on, hitting a wall, you can never possibly know either you are bad at game or the game is rigged. - Basically what a player pays for is something that earlier would've been archived by using CheatEngine or similar software. I want to stress that my point here is not ""paying for something that could be free"", but rather introducing the idea of cheating from the get-go. On top of that paying to not play game is plain weird to me. A bonus point - Steam page for the game doesn't have any mention of in-app purchases (aside from user reviews). With those points in mind, the choice comes down to whether you are willing to invest time into something that shouldn't be trusted by design.			"

												It's a game with a great sense of humor and style. It's definitely an homage both to old school video game RPGs as well as old school tabletop RPGs, which is an interesting and fun intersection of interests. The micro-transactions/real money bits of it... kinda suck honestly and it tends to hold the game back in some ways that are annoying, but in general the game is pretty fun, especially considering you can hop on and play for 20-30 minutes and drop right back out again.

												Looking for a game that you can pick up or leave on the fly? Then this is it. think of it as an actual pen and paper game like Dungeons and Dragons. then sprinkle in the NES Final Fantasy graphics and battle system and there you go you have this game.The battles are pretty quick, and you can save in the middle of things making it nice to come back to.  Nice features to the game are the power ups you can purchase for your room that offer bonuses to your team, like extra gold when you defeat foes or extra Xp (the power ups are like pictures on the wall or snacks on the table).  I also liked that the game size was pretty small  around 100mb, which means I can leave it on my computer  for when I want a quick game.  I definitly suggest getting the +1 edition  since it offers a few extras that you can not get  on the  normal version.			"

												If you like turn-based fantasy combat and have nostalgia for tabletop RPGs, this just might be the game for you!Gameplay can be a bit repetitive, so it's not really a game you can sit and play for six hours, but but half an hour here, two hours there? It's lovely! And there are some interesting story turns I've encountered so far.Mostly I love it because it's not too serious, not too involved, perfect for a short gaming session, and has a great sense of humor. Perfect for when I've got a bit of time to kill. Tough battles can also require some careful thought or you'll find your party dead! And it's great how you can adjust the battles yourself, decide how tough it'll be, and challenge yourself as much as you like. Lot of customization in the gaming experience.Plus, so many things to buy in the shops and so many items to find!Seriously, I love the game.			"

												Having never played the classic tabletop D&D myself, I at first find the concept interesting however this turns up becoming a disappointment. The enjoyment value in this game is pretty inadequate.1) Clicking fiestaYou basically just need to click when you want to do almost anything. Just click the shop icon to buy item, just click the map button to travel, etc. You have control of the dungeon master. You get to choose what and how many enemies you want to fight with the limit of 7 (after unlocking it) same type of creature (combination is not possible). The combat system is pretty much lacking, and no brainer. There are only three damage type, physical, nature and magic. It doesn't matter if you hit enemies with ice or fire. The only option you have in organizing your party is pretty much who you want to include in the party (max. 5), no formation whatsoever. The ""threat level"" system is at best vague and unclear. 2) Unclear storyline and boring questAfter playing this game for so long, I still have no idea what the story is about. Comments from the ""players"" range from boring to cheezy at best. The variations of sidequest are too little. Collect certain item from certain monster drop, kill certain amount of certain monster, escort someone (and 100% encounter at every place when you do this quest) and go to certain dungeon to fight with the developer. There ain't a puzzle for me to solve.3) Character creationCharacter creation is pretty much simple. Every ""player"" have his own bonus and you might want to make use of this bonus for the most fitting job. Each have 4 skills and set stats built. Everytime you level up, you have one skill point to spent. At first this seems okayish but as your level goes up, balance issue will be a slap on the face. Physical attack easily overpower magic skill. Leaving spellcasters as useless ragdoll.4) Bad economy and MicrotransactionThe main argument in the forum dwell on this ""innocent"" button on the top right corner. You can buy in game gold that you can earn by slaying monsters with real money. Why the heck it is there in a paid content anyway? Let me skip that annoyingly long argument. There are a few things that make people upset with the economy of the game. Firstly, the blacksmith. The only way to have better equipment is to go to the blacksmith (that can be found in some places) and have them upgraded for a fee. This process involve probabilistic element with success rate proportional with the level of the blacksmith. There are ways to reduce the cost and leveling the blacksmith without risking your gold but those are pretty much grinding. Secondly, you ""buy"" ""players"" with gold to start the game. There are ""players"" that are so expensive that it is impossible to start the game with without buying gold (on your first run). Thirdly, the gold is tied to your account, meaning that after your first run, you can start a second run with that amount that is left. This make second run pretty much broken as you probably have too much gold.5) The music is bad and annoying. It is getting on my nerves after a while.			"

												Do you like Dungeons and Dragons? Do you like turn-based RPGs? Pixel-art? Yes?This is your game.This is a great D&D style RPG without the faux real-time of Baldur's Gate and Dragon Age: OriginsIt is a very simple game, but thats what makes it so easy to pick up in play.Not to mention that you can also controll the Dungeon Master(Narrator) which makes the game more or less challenging depending on your play style. (Although fighting low-level enemies gives you low-level rewards)The game also has a very nice Pixel-art style that is not only beautiful to look at but nice to play through. The music is also one of the best parts of the game, with a pixelated style that reminds me of old-school western RPG with a battle theme as addictive as that of any Final Fantasy game.Overall this is probably the most genuine fun I've had with an RPG in a long time, and easily one of my best finds/purchases.

												(this review mainly looks at microtransactions)I initially was really excited about this game, as I find the premise and art style quite appealing. The problem lies, as many reviewers prior to me noticed, within built-in microtransactions. Ability to bypass the grind paying for in-game currency ruins any kind of trust in the economy at all. Some people might be OK with this, but I do have a couple points of contention: - The financial aspect introduces a bias from the point of developer, conscious or otherwise, to balance a game in a way that will push a player to use microtransactions. From that point on, hitting a wall, you can never possibly know either you are bad at game or the game is rigged. - Basically what a player pays for is something that earlier would've been archived by using CheatEngine or similar software. I want to stress that my point here is not ""paying for something that could be free"", but rather introducing the idea of cheating from the get-go. On top of that paying to not play game is plain weird to me. A bonus point - Steam page for the game doesn't have any mention of in-app purchases (aside from user reviews). With those points in mind, the choice comes down to whether you are willing to invest time into something that shouldn't be trusted by design.			"

												A lot of people are saying that this game is nothing more than a bad iOS port complete with microtransactions. I'm here to set the record straight: this game is an iOS port and it has microtransactions, but it's far from terrible. If anything, this game is an intimately-crafted love letter to all things nerdy (D&D, sci fi, etc.). The game does have microtransactions but, if you play it right, you don't need to buy anything beyond the game itself. The only other things that I've spent money on are trading cards (which is par for the course on Steam). If you're looking for a decent roleplaying game with hours of replay value then this is the right one for you. If the thought of microtransactions or performing repeated tasks doesn't appeal to you, then you should probably skip this game (and roleplaying games in general).			"

												It's a game with a great sense of humor and style. It's definitely an homage both to old school video game RPGs as well as old school tabletop RPGs, which is an interesting and fun intersection of interests. The micro-transactions/real money bits of it... kinda suck honestly and it tends to hold the game back in some ways that are annoying, but in general the game is pretty fun, especially considering you can hop on and play for 20-30 minutes and drop right back out again.

A pretty fun game to waste your time but still you'll get bored easily since there's nothing much to do except do some quest, kill x amount of monster, etcWARNING:  This game is heavy on pop-culture/gaming references.

												This game has a lovely setup. Its well done, but it sadly (for me) is getting too repetitive for me.It has a somewhat stale soundtrack, with one or two really good, and the thing for detail isnt their best side. The only thing that makes me hate this game is that its a p2p. Not only do you have to make a Purchase of the full game of course. but you also get the option to purchase ingame items for real money, and its bothering me alot.So with this short somewhat angry review i will then leave the game at a 4/10...

												Hmm, the story is actually quite interesting at times. Can't quite say the same for the play. Get onto an early optimal strategy, and you can just ride it through the entire time. Eh, it's alright I guess, but there's better pen and paper nostalgia trips out there. Actually comes out much better on a mobile platform, able to quickly pick up and play for a few minutes and get sucked in for an hour or three til the battery smacks you upside the head. Still could do with more side stuff to do, less linear direction, and more varied strategy. 3/5			"

												Looking for a game that you can pick up or leave on the fly? Then this is it. think of it as an actual pen and paper game like Dungeons and Dragons. then sprinkle in the NES Final Fantasy graphics and battle system and there you go you have this game.The battles are pretty quick, and you can save in the middle of things making it nice to come back to.  Nice features to the game are the power ups you can purchase for your room that offer bonuses to your team, like extra gold when you defeat foes or extra Xp (the power ups are like pictures on the wall or snacks on the table).  I also liked that the game size was pretty small  around 100mb, which means I can leave it on my computer  for when I want a quick game.  I definitly suggest getting the +1 edition  since it offers a few extras that you can not get  on the  normal version.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper +1, is... Different.Something you should know:On the google play store, it is only £1.99.On steam it is £7.99. For the SAME GAME.Just for this, I wouldn't reccommend buying it from Steam on principle, as even though it is a brillian game, it is still only a mobile android app. On PC.Now I got this game with a Humble Bundle, so assuming I paid the £1.99 for it, I can certainly say it was worth it.I think my first runthrough took approx 12 hours, that wasn't rushed but it wasn't lazed either, so even if you where to pay £7.99, it still has more play time then most £40 hit title campaigns.In the game you take control of 5 people role playing in a board RPG pretty much, and without going into to much detail, it's like playing a game of Dungeons & Dragons with amusing characters and dungeonmaster.The missions are reasonably simple, and if you complete the entire campaign in a day, like me, then it does get somewhat repetitive by the end, though if you actually have a life and pace it out a bit more, you may not find this the same.The game is FULL of references, there are pointers to Star Wars, Pokemon, Sponge Bob Square Pants, TMNT, Final Fantasy, Mario and much much more, almost every five minutes I would see something and be amazed at how many references they have fit in there.That is everything, and if you are reading this and the Humble Bundle PC & Android Bundle 9 is still on (It is until 14/04/14) then go and get it, as it is worth it.

												The idea is BRILLIANT in my opinion! Here is a game clearly dedicated to pen and paper RP-ers, and the meta-feel of it all is excellent. The execution, however, is not up to par. The game begins well, with quips to geek culture all over the place. However, it quickly devolves into a ""hit monsters, get XP"" run of the mill game. The RP component is not there, they fail to pull jokes consistently and you get an old-school hack-and-slash RPG with a meta LOOK. The game caught my interest in the beginning, yet ended up being too boring to complete.			"

												Dissapointing in many ways. The game is very adamant about breaking the 4th wall. This started being somewhat endearing but after an hour or so the overly obvious refrences in the lazily made backgrounds, really hurt the game. You're left not really caring about your characters or the world, as the game constantly states that it is just made up. Town have names like default, desert, forest... The game lacks inspiration and drive to be worth your time. Dont get this game unless its on sale or you want to see how which direction not to go with your retro game.			"

												So I just bought this game and I've only few hours in it but I LOVE IT SO MUCH. Where to start? I guess one of the big things about this game is that you can have so much fun with it even if you play on a 2003 toaster. The soundtrack is enjoyable and immersive with MANY different tunes for creepy caves, happy villages and dangerous roads etc. The turn based gameplay is easy to get a grip of and you'll be having fun within minutes. Hilarious character choices. Oh and the game is often funny as hell. Cheek and banter flies across the game table while your party roams the land. Definitely recommend. Worth the price.... by far			"

												Look... if you have this game, was most likely part of a bundle. But I wouldn't have bought it otherwise. The game was supposed to be retro and amusing but turned into a horrible grind. A really *grindy* grind. It was cute for a while but then quickly got annoying... and the pop-culture references have been done to death.The quests often were ""Kill 7 of X then come back"" or ""Collect 7-12 drops from Y then come back"" and there were a few examples where you had do it that 4 times in a row. You have to pay gold to walk between locations, so it feels like you're questing on a Monopoly board; ""Go south 2, kill 7, come back"" or ""Escort 5 spaces East, get attacked every step, come back"" while you are paying each way. Dumb.The little dungeon system... is annoying. You can't rest or run away from a fight or it boots you out and you have to do the whole dungeon again. You have to wander around to find the key for the boss fight, taking damage from fights or traps 75% of the time. Who does that? Who is going to spend time to do 10-50 of those for the achievement? Pass. Just pass.			"

												FIRST OF ALL: the last update deleted my savegame file, so I would recommend to everyone: make backups of your saves, because the updates can reset them. Or turn off the updates for this game only.This game is fun, has a nice gameplay, unlockable cool characters, lot of achievements, and you need work with your team and use the most useful tables, decorations for you. I was on the end of the game almost, but the update just deleted my save files, so I've got one from the forum, which almost the same like mine was. There are a lot of main and sidequests, you need to upgrade the blacksmith to increase your armor and weapon stats, you can use accessories to get bonuses on your characters and you can switch to another ones and create new ones anytime within the game.About the serial number, you'll get: You can redeem it on the official Paradox forum, and CAN'T use it in-game as a promo code.The only wrong thing about this game is the update system, but the game itself is really fun and enjoyable. :)			"

												this game isn't good but at the same time it's not bad. If you can handle the grinding for the levels then it actually is good. My main complaint is just really the grinding. The game is good with a good amount of classes to choose from. You can unlock 5 (i think 5) by completing quest in the game. The quest can get annoying since sometimes it might be just fight this and hope this drops. i would give this a 6.5/10 If the game is on sale i would defintily get it then.			"

												Knights of Pen. And Paper! I tried to be witty there.Now, I'm not one to do really large reviews, but I can tell you this: Buy this game.A ton of people will go on and on about how it sucks, how it's stupid, but it's a really fun RPG game for those that are into the genre. And a lot of people have gone on to say that it's just a time waster, but no, it's more than that. Like an RPG game, it'll take you into the story the best it can. It's up to you, if you let it do it's job or not.And as such, this took me to believe that not many people gave it that starting chance. The chance to change their lives forever.Now, you might be thinking I'm biased, and yeah, I am. I never got the chance to grow up with great games that were released on older gen consoles. Like the NES, the SNES, and even the Sega Mega Drive. I got to miss the truly astonishing ups and lows of gaming history. All because I'm a kid. So, when a game like this comes along, a game that does so well at giving the player a feel of the old world, I take it like it's a van full of candy.But, TL;DR: Buy this game if you're into the genre, you won't regret it.

												This is a clever cross platform RPG that plays like a tabletop without the roleplay. The Good  - This is a really fun game with a lot of backstory.  - There is a lot of freedom to do what you want/need to do.   - There is a ton of replayability because of the large amount of character options.   - Go anywhere you can afford. Grinding isn't the main thrust of the game.The Bad  - It's an RPG you will be grinding in some cases.   - Once you get a rhythm down it can get repetetive.  Overall this was a surprisingly fun game. I was expecting something cute and shallow, but the sheer amount of stuff there is to do makes this a truly fun game with a nice story.			"

												A very well done little game where you take control of players (and to a lesser extend the GM) to go through a campaign slaying monsters, random villagers, and saving the world(s)!A Bit grindy at times but I think that was just how I ended up playing. I believe it is possible to go through the game without doing a lot of grinding for levels.The only downside to this game is you don't quite have has much control of the character stats as I'd like, and there aren't many skills to utilize. But this didn't detract from the experience in any way.			"

												A simple game that carefully balances some of the best and irreplacable facets of gaming both modern and retro. This game offers a really nice blend of modern humour and references in the form of turn-based Retro Pixel-art, all of which is set in a world set inside a game of dungeons and dragons-or-some-similar-RPG. If you have played DnD you'll get a couple of references that might tickle you greatly but its not a pre-requisite to have fun with this little gem. Great bang for your buck, good looking, nice sounding and entertaining. But I wont tell you anymore incase I ruin the magical adventure :D			"

With the pixel art style and humors in story it brings you back to 80's when you sit with friends and roll some dice. Gameplay is quite casual and easy to pick up when you've got some time to kill.You can create a 5 members party, every member only have 4 skills, (some of them are passive skills) and there's no positioning. So there's really not much space for tactics, you'd probably be using the same way against all types of enemies. You can create a new member and exchange someone in your party to have some variety. But trying to level  up that guy is another long way to go. There are only limited amount of quests to do, after completing them all you can do is battle with some EXP/gold efficient monsters again and again.I stopped playing when find myself stuck at a boss and have to farm some money. To me, Knights of Pen and Paper = RPG in a nutshell. It shows me what I like and dislike in RPGs, without having all those fancy graphics, cut scenes, complex battle systems, large amounts of items. And I actually like this style, if you let me pick a game to play between Knights of Pen and Paper and Final Fantasy INSERT YOUR FAVORITE NUMBER, I'd probably still choose this one.			"

												This is a clever cross platform RPG that plays like a tabletop without the roleplay. The Good  - This is a really fun game with a lot of backstory.  - There is a lot of freedom to do what you want/need to do.   - There is a ton of replayability because of the large amount of character options.   - Go anywhere you can afford. Grinding isn't the main thrust of the game.The Bad  - It's an RPG you will be grinding in some cases.   - Once you get a rhythm down it can get repetetive.  Overall this was a surprisingly fun game. I was expecting something cute and shallow, but the sheer amount of stuff there is to do makes this a truly fun game with a nice story.			"

												I love this game.  Everything about it has an old-school feel that blends tabletop RPGs with NES graphics.  There is a lot of grinding in this game, but that's what RPGs are about.  You choose your initial characters from an assortment of people who each have their own unique bonuses, then pick a class for them based on those bonuses and what you want in your party.  If you make challenging enough fights, they require a bit of strategy.  My paladin typically casts a shield to reduce damage by 50%, then increases his threat to draw attention, while my rogue stuns people for 3 turns (thanks to items I have that extend the time by 2 turns).  My mage will either AoE the entire group or fireball for a burning DoT.  My cleric has a powerful single heal, decent group heal, an offensive move called smite, and a debuff on 3 enemy's attack strength.  My newest addition, the berserker, goes berserk (I can't choose his targets but he gains extra damage and regen) and has passives/equipment that boost his crit rate above 30% while also allowing him to heal for 63% of his total damage.  And those are just my 5 classes, there's quite a few more to unlock as you play.The grinding part comes in two forms.  You'll find yourself moving back and forth to caves often to get grindstones to upgrade your blacksmith.  You'll also want to fight a lot, and grind quests to earn gold.  Gold can be spent buying yourself some equipment at the blacksmith, or on a whole bunch of upgrades to the room you play in, the table you play on, etc.  Purchases made will give your party bonuses, such as higher RNG die rolls, more gold/exp, boosted stats, regen, etc.There's always something to do in this game.  It can be tedious at times, but the humor of the game, including comments from the game master and party members help to ease this.  Overall, I think it would be a worthy addition to anyone's library who is a fan of old school RPGs.			"

												I love this game, it's witty, can be fun if you enjoy the grind, is fun once you've bought enough boosting items. This game has a lot of 80's kid focused humor.It's loaded with great nostalgia/references and beautifully done pixel art, the sound is great though you will likely turn the music off after 3-5 hours of playing.You can have several parties going at once and share earned gold across parties which can make for interesting progression styles. There are permenant upgrades to your table and the room you're playing from that really change the way the game is played and I felt that was a very nice touch.The DEV team was bought out so there's no real support for the game anymore, it has some odd bugs in it still and can occasionally break if you do some things too quickly.Overall 100%ing this game was fun and a steady challenge it took me just under 30 hours.I have a difficult time recommending this game though since it's not really something that just anyone can pick up and play. This game can be frustratingly difficult at times. Especially if your party composition is unable to overcome an obstacle, you may have to start a new game to support your main party.But I've decided to recommend it due to the 8bit charm it has throughout the game which is really entertaining.

												I had a ton of fun with this classic arcade style turn-based RPG. There's plenty to love in designing your own D&D room, then using all the bonuses in the game world when you start playing. I can see this used to be a ""pay-to-win"" sort of game, but thankfully that's been taken out so it's all good now.As far as style and identity, this game has NONE of it's own. Every creature, every location, virtually every screen and character and bit of dialogue is pulled from somewhere else. The temples are marked with nintendo controllers. Gonzo and Rizzo (muppets) are aliens. There are Chozo (metriod) statues and dancing skeletons and everything in between. This game is a giant cluster-(blank) of references, both of the pop-culture and video game history variety. While this IS charming, it does get old after a while. There's a difference between a cute little nod towards another game, and just building your ENTIRE GAME around references.TDLR:+It's very, very fun and cute for a quick laugh. (excellent price)+It's a solid turn-based RPG that'll tickle your nostalgia bone.+20-25hr campaign with tons of unlockables.+/-The ENTIRE GAME is nothing but references to other games and geek culture.+/- Low difficulty, okay replay value.-Some achievements are needlessly grindy. (Complete 50 dungeons, wee!)-Some achievements are badly bugged. 1-3 of them simply don't work or don't work as intended.Is it worth getting? If you're ingrained in nerd culture and can grasp all the nintendo, Doctor Who and other references-- its more than worth it's price tag. Check it out. :)			"

É um verdadeiro simulador de RPG.Prós:+ Desenvolvido por brasileiros. BRASIL POHA!!+ Boa variedade de inimigos.+ Cenários interessantes.+ MUITAS referências.+ Conquistas fáceis.Contras:- Quando se cria uma classe e aplica este a um personagem, caso você queira mudar de personagem, não tem como recuperar os pontos de habilidade da classe, ou seja, você terá que upar tudo novamente.- Possui uma conquista muito CHATA: finalizar calabouço 50x (desnecessário).- Não possui nuvem steam, MAS você pode se cadastrar in game no sistema da desenvolvedora e assim manter os seus saves.Conclusão:* O jogo passa um excelente e nostalgico clima retrô com seu layout pixelado.* Quem possui amigos com seus mais de 27 anos de idade relembrará dos momentos de RPG de mesa graças as conversas entre os personagens e as referências espalhadas não apenas pelo ambiente mais também pelos próprios personagens.* VALE MUITO COMPRAR ESSE JOGO!================================ E N G L I S H ================================This game is so funny!!!!I played for 50h, and I didn't notice the time going by. It's a true RPG Simulator.Pros:+ Brazilian developers. BRAZIL RULES!!!+ Good variation of enemies.+ Interesting scenarios.+ It has too many references.+ Easy achievements.Cons:- When you create a class and apply this to a some character, if you want change the character, you'll not be able to recover the skill points from this class, in other words, you'll have to up the skill points again.- The game has a ANNOYING achievement: Finish a Dungeon 50x (unnecessary ¬¬').- It doesn't have Steam Cloud, BUT you can create an account in game on the developers's system and then keep secure your progress.Conclusion:* The game shows an excellent and nostalgic retro climate with your pixelated layout.* Who have many friends with more or less 27 years old will remember the moments when you played RPG board game. All this thanks the conversation between the characters, the references scattered on the scenarios and the character types too.* Well BUY FAST THIS GAME!			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper is what I'd call a sufficiently flawed dungeon-crawler.  While the game does allow for a lot of ""customization"", the upgrade system feels wholly dissapointing.  Upgrades/level-ups are barely even noticable, being slight precentage upgrades that almost always mean next to nothing; The variation of the classes is really where the enjoyment of the customization is.  In addition to the lackluster upgrade system, the entire game is grind-ey as all hell.  Want to upgrade your armor? be prepared to either walk back-and-forth between town and cave for a couple hours; that or pay through the nose with your hard-earned gold.  The humor/references are cute at times, but get old very fast... with neither making up for the repetitive gameplay.			"

It's a good time waster and quick to get into.			"

												Very fun classic turn-based RPG with D&D tabletop RPG elements to it. It has micro-transactions but they're not needed at all. Fun, humorous and light-hearted this is a great game to waste some time in with some replay value.Not sure if it's worth the $10 as I got it for free but it's definitely a fun game if you like this sort of thing.

YouTube™ Video: Knights of Pen & Paper - Epic 'mini' Review

			Vamp's back, with a different type of video. This is a game I snagged off a humble bundle a while back. It's a pretty neat game for a mobile port, and since I've been having a lot of fun with it I...		

 Other than that video, I have to say the game is well done. Even for a mobile port, the game runs great and has a very simple strategy feel to it. I would recommend this for anyone with little time on their hands, or anyone who is a fan of funny, quirky, games, also for those who enjoyed playing DnD. Gud gaim 5 chickens outa 2 cowsPeace!			"

I mostly went for it as I rarely find any games that are Turn-Based, but it is filled with that same kind of humour from hilarious Gamer's movies like Hands of Fate and so on, however there is a lot of Free-To-Play elements that'll make you want to spend money for gold coins, which you can aquire in game, but much slower.

												Really bad port. You can't use the keyboard. It is all just clicking. Nothing is different from the mobile version. It is the same exact game. You are not getting anything more in the PC version. Even the quests are the same. I'd really recommend the mobile version to play on the go, the PC version has nothing more to offer. It's like bringing Angry Birds to PC, it's just the same game, it's not worth more.Now if they expanded on the game and made it more PC friendly, able to use a keyboard, and made the UI fit better on the screen, it would have been a great game. But it's not. The only difference is that you click instead of touch.Now I like the game on mobile, but this is just a bad PC port. It's still a good RPG overall though, I really like it.			"

Unless you like choosing your own enemies and grinding on enemies to progress.. then the answer is no.			"

												This is basically a Western take on the JRPG formula with everything that makes a JRPG worth playing carefully removed. Your characters are blank slates, the cut scenes are static character portraits, the story is nerd ""humor"" (Nabe Gewell needs his Magic Crowbar LOLOLOLOLOL!!!1111), there are no locations to explore, the battle system is incredibly tedious and the central design philosophy of the game is based around mindless grinding.

												Interesting idea: you play as pen-and-paper roleplayers, using every stereotype a bad GM can throw at you: cringeworthy story, funny-sounding remarks and lots of combat. If this sounds bad, you either have not played a pen-and-paper RPG, or you were lucky enough to have exceptional GMs. :)If the game could be completed in 5-8 hours, I would recommend it as great and funny satire. However, it is very padded out: at 14 hours, I was close to finish it (I guess), but should have to level up characters or grind for more equipment, and I said, enough is enough.			"

												You play a small group of players in a D&D tabletop adventure controlled by a DM. Camera is angled from behind the players and the events take place in the backgroud. Mechanics are solid enough and the game is presented very well. has a clever idea and good dialogue.However this game is a port from a mobile format and has all the grind and micotransactions you would expect from the platform at a 10/15euro asking price. Gameplay boils down to farming easy monsters for gold (which could be purchased for real world money instead) Gameplay gets dull and repetitive.			"

												This concept sounds good on paper; classic D&D how you remember playing classic D&D. Unfortunately, they left out the game part of D&D.Essentially, this game is trying to be a humorous game. It's not one you play for a challenge or for fun, but to laugh at. Unfortunately, there are only so many jokes, and there's lots of battling that must be done to go forward. Typically, you'll spend at least ten minutes battling before the next joke or reference, and there's still no guarantee you'll even find it funny.That might be acceptable if battling was any fun, but unfortunately, it isn't. Every enemy in the game (at least those that I saw) does the exact same thing: Attack on their turn. There is literally nothing to react to except damage. To make matters worse, once you reach level 5 and unlock each of your skills, you can kiss any sense of progression goodbye, since every subsequent level only grants more stat-ups and numerical upgrades to said skills. As for loot and gear, the fun is sucked out of that too; while loot often drops, you have access to a store that sells pretty much any gear you could ever need, so if you're halfway intelligent about visiting it, any loot that drops will always be inferior vendor trash.Lastly, the game is OBSCENELY grindy. This is the level of grind I would expect from an poorly-made free MMO. Doing almost anything in the game costs coins; often a lot of them. And there are two ways to get coins: A) Win battles, or B) Buy them with real money.			"

												Absolute garbage. Hordes upon hordes of uninteresting monsters for miniscule amounts of coins, and a slow♥♥♥♥♥pace. This game feels so slow and boring it feels as if they're TRYING to get you to use the microtransaction ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that is in this game.PCs aren't phones, keep your trash away from here.If anyone wants to truly get a lot of coins use ArtMoney and get infinite coins and laugh at their pathetic attempt at getting you to buy them with actual money.

												Naught but a boring grindfest with lots of fine promises. The supposed banter happening between players is very limited and not focused on at all, and what players you bring with you means nothing outside of their stat blocks. I bought this game thinking there'd be lots of personality and not too much focus on its technical aspects, but it turned out to be a game with little to no personality and technical aspects that aren't that interesting to begin with.

												Knights of Pen and Paper is quirky, it's enjoyable, and charming, but what's really down there is a game that's downright infuriating. The actual concept of a fun D&D like experience of Knights of Pen and Paper sounds fun and gives it a nice charm to it, but it's simply put down by extremely simple and boring battle mechanics, proceding to follow by annoying dice rolls that become much more of an annoyance then an actual Tabletop game, extreme grinding to the point of just annoyance, and the fact that this game isn't simply something to play a long session on just doesn't give it a justifiable pricetag that's way too expensive for it's own good. It works as a fun mobile game, and I really love the charm and such, but it's still isn't enough to warrant such a purchase of 10 dollars.I don't know, maybe I am judging it a bit too much, after all, it's roots were from a mobile game. I wouldn't recommend playing this game to many people (Particularly those who don't like mobile games and their microtransaction-like models), but if you like something that can be played in short bursts, is quirky, and simple, this game is for you.

												This is one of those games you might give a quick look and pass on, but you'd be making a grave mistake!If you're into oldschool style turn-based RPGs, pick up KoPP+1.  It's a ton of fun and completely playable in both short doses and long sessions, with a decent story that pokes a lot of fun at the entire table-top RPG genre and many other pop icons.  I purchased it on a whim and quickly fell in love with the quaint graphics, the quirky story, and the RPG style character/equipment progression. With the amount of time I've sunk into the game (replaying and achievement hunting), I'm forced to give the game a 9/10 rating and highly recommend it!  I wish there were more games like it!			"

I like the fact you can create your own team of players and customize the room you play in. The fun little quotes they have are pretty cool. The only thing i would like to change is that the Dungeon Master should pick which creatures you face, instead of the player choosing which and how many creatures to face.

												I just bought this as part of a package deal for $5.09.  It came with a promo code, but it is impossible to enter it in game.  The game doesn't let you use lowercase letters even though the code has them.  Consequently, it won't accept the promo code.  Finding an error in programing within the first minute of playing the game and hearing the grinding, iritating, and monotonous music looping over and over again as frustration builds soured my opinion instantly.  Ever stop watching a movie within the first minute of playing it?  That can happen with video games too.  There are plenty of reviews about gameplay, but the community needs to know about flaws as well to get an accurate picture.			"

												Don't buy this game. In-game transactions are the cancer killing gaming.Despite this it seems cool enough for the first hour or two but it quickly devolves into grinding. There's also no semblance of balance. Just play Final Fantasy VI or Cthulhu Saves the World instead if you want turn-based RPG combat.			"

												This is not the best looking game, but it is a fun RPG to play.  I run it in a window while I do other things on my PC.The game is a very simple, single player, turn-based, RPG game, where a bunch of friends sit at a table with a DM and play a D&D-type game by a rolling a die to decide everything (view trailer on Steam).  You can have anywhere from 2-5 people in your group.  The graphics are Pixel Art (i.e. very basic square pixels to create everything).  There is a simple map with locations that are level based.  You have a main quest line as well as additional quests per location.  Finishing some quests can open up new quests throughout the map.  There are also dungeons, that have their own maps, monsters, bosses, etc..There are 12 player types and 17 character types, although not all of the player/character types are available initially.  Each player and character can only be used once in your group.  Each player type, gives your character a passive skill.  Each character type, has 4 skills that can be a mix of passive/active skills.  You get a skill point each time you level your character.  There are quests to find the additional player/character types and once they are found they are available to all save slots (see below).The game has three save slots, so you can have three different groups playing the game.  The game only has one pool of gold that is shared between all three save slots.  You can purchase new tables, table items, room accouterments, doors, walls, and other items that will also be shared between all save slots.  So once they are purchased, they are available to all three player groups.  A couple of essential items are the BK Crown and the Holy Grail, which allow you to face 7 enemies at a time (default 5) and have 5 party members (default 3?).  You get bonus XP for larger groups of enemies.  You earn gold at the end of each fight, quest, etc..  You use gold to purchase potions and items from a store/blacksmith/enchanter/etc..  You also need gold to travel.  You can fight at any location to generate some gold as needed.  You can rest after most fights to recoup your health/mana, although a dice will roll to see if you have any interruptions to your sleep.  If your player dies, you can revive them but paying gold.  Initially, your low level character can be resurrected for 0 gold.  I played the game without needing any potions by just using my group's healing and mana generators during a fight or resting after a fight. "

												A fun and very casual JRPG-like themed like a Tabletop D&D game. There's plenty of upgrades both for your individual characters and the party as a whole. These upgrades increase the quality of your characters gear, or even buy new accesories for your room which grant passive bonuses to your group. This is a light RPG game, great in small bursts, as this was once a mobile game. However it's also fun in longer bursts. I plan on updating this review later, so check in if ya want.			"

												As an avid fan of the D20 system and DnD series(I play Ver. 3.5 currently) created my the Great and Powerful Melevolence himself, Gary Gygax, I loved the pitch off the bat! It's in retro 8-bit animation style, leaving room for extra nostalgia for those who used to play the old DnD Game Boy games and NES games(amongst other titles too!). The story(campaign) is funny, edgy, tense and just an all around perfect adventure. The aspects that I enjoy most from this game is Armor and Weapons upgrading through the Blacksmith(which you can upgrade with donations of materials, etc.) and that you CHOOSE how big of a fight you get yourself and your party into. It's like having a voyeur POV of a very long DnD campaign, and YOU CONTROL IT! What's not to like?! :3			"

If you think DnD is funny but just like RPG's... play this game.It's just a group of nerds playing DnD around a table in a basement, but the table and all come with you on your adventure with your Dungeon Master as guide.  As you level up and complete quests and fight monsters and crawl dungeons, you can buy deco and loot to place on your table / in your basement that give passive bonuses like +attack etc.  ALSO THIS GAME WAS LIKE 2 DAMN DOLLARS.♥♥♥♥♥ amazing just play it.

												Excellent game, one of my favorites for the year, but certainly this type of game will not be everyone's cup of tea.If you're around 20s or older you would perhaps miss those retro moments and this game will bring to the table exactly that if not better. I will not, however, classify this as a ""Main"" game though, as the game itself is pretty fast once you know your way around and perhaps light-bites of retro fun is a better summation for this title. Regardless, its a neat and great one at that and I suggest you get one right away if you love old-school RPGs.8.5/10			"

												I wasn't expecting to like this game as much as I have been. In all honesty, this is a fun little game! There's several different kinds of combinations you can make with your characters, and there's also new classes to unlock along the way, which just adds to the replayability to see all the different kinds of combinations. The gameplay is incredibly simple, but it's fun to kind of 'multitask' as you're doing something in the background while also playing this game in windowed mode.The game also kind of lets you 'choose' how the game progresses, as you're essentially the Dungeon Master. You can choose what kind of enemy to fight, and also how many of them. This allows for you to play at your own pace!You can also add on more characters as you go along (up to five in total), but you'd have to level them up all the way from level one, which can be kind of a pain, but, ya know, comes with the territory. The same applies for whenever you unlock a class and want to use them. You'd have to level them up from level one. Kind of sucks, but once again, this is supposed to be reminiscent of old-school RPG's. You want to play that new class you just unlocked? Gotta start 'em from the beginning.Overall, even though I'm only a few hours into the game, I still want to play it and progress even further. This game could definitely keep you occupied for a while, especially if you're looking for a more traditional, old-school RPG. Check it out!			"

												This is one that I’d been playing on and off alongside Grand Theft Auto 5. You’ve gotta understand, GTA5 is addictive enough that pretty much everything else fell by the wayside, so that’s really saying something. Knights is a really fun game that’s about…well, gaming. Specifically, it parodies tabletop RPGs, dungeon masters, and so on.You get to form a party of up to five people with varying classes such as fighter, paladin, and so on…but with real people such as little brother, jock, nerd, and so on. The combination of the two forces kind of creates a whole new class in most cases, fully capable of being stronger within their respective classes or at the very least more interesting.In fact, you can change everything including the toys on the table, back pieces, dungeon master himself, and so on in order to modify various bonuses, buffs, and the like. I’ve never played that much into tabletop, but this game is nothing but addictive and it’s easy to see why. If you like RPGs or in general you’re looking for something easy to pick up and play, this one’s for you.			"

												This game is awful. I got it in a bundle. It plays like Dragon Warrior (the ultimate example of why JRPGs are bad) but with microtransactions. The whole ""real people playing a pnp RPG"" concept is paper thin. It just gives you additional stats that directly update your combat abilities (e.g. buy a new gaming table and get +1 to attack) and stuff like that. The microtransaction angle is really heavily pushed on the player.It's a pure progress quest. Choose to churn through monster type ""A"" until they drop enough coins to afford the sword that can kill monster type ""B."" These developers should be boycotted for all of eternity. I'm really disappointed in Paradox for publishing it too. This has to be the most shallow, unethically money grubbing game they've ever put their name on. I can't imagine their cut of the sales would compensate them for being associated with this trash.			"

												It only took 30+ years for someone to make an RPG game about D&D, from the third person perspective.I can't stress enough how much I love this game. It's just so unique and lovable. The dialogue is great and the amount of things you can do in the game are ridiculous. One thing I love is that the game rewards you for pushing yourself to the limit. The harder you make it on yourself, the more EXP and Gold you'll earn, making the game easier overall, later down the line. But give yourself an easy time and the game will become brutal at the later stages. There are multiple classes (Some are secret. Shhhh...) to choose from and multiple players for those characters. For example, the Hipster playing as a Druid or your Grandma playing as a Necromancer. Make your own party and formulate your own way to win. Anything is possible. Single target DOT team. An AoE team. 'Classic' 1 tank, 3 DPS and a healer. Whatever you want to do.There are microtransactions apparent in the game, but they are about as pointless as a chocolate radiator. Best not to bother with them. In fact, just forget I said anything at all.Like classic RPG's? Buy it. Have some fun. 10/10.			"

												Sadly, Knights of Pen and Paper has all of my least favorite elements of RPG's (meaningless random battles) and none of my favorite ones (role-playing).  I was hoping for something that was more akin to a random story simulator with some combat that played into the narrative, but from the get-go I was just deciding how many bats I wanted to kill before I completed the ""quest"".

												Loved it, played tons of hours for such a little game. Got the the end boss, and it's at least 300% harder than anything up to that point, forcing you to grind for another several hours to even have a chance at hearing the boss fart through a walkie-talkie.Obviously, final bosses are supposed to be hard, and maybe I'm missing the point, but this is just poor design.

												Wonderful little rpg. I was looking for something to spend some time with simple tasks and leveling up. If you like rpgs and the physical world where they came from you'll enjoy this smooth yet nostalgic game. No need to get to dedicated but don't be surprised if you get lose a few hours playing and wonder where the time went.			"

												I really enjoyed playing this game. I got kind of hooked on it while I was playing from my laptop (which has the gpu that can just about handle rendering a webpage) and I ended up playing for 4h straight. It's got a lot of classic RPG elements in it, which I like very much. There is talk of a lot of humor, but I did not see too much of that (yet?). The functionality is nice, and it's great that you can switch between characters during a game. Only thing I find lacking is pokémon style upgrading abilities for the spells.Also, it would have been nice to have the game full screen and a little more animation on the player characters. All in all a very good choice to waste a couple of hours on.			"

												It was cute and clever and all. Fun for the first ten levels.And then everything gets grindy. Like, really grindy.There are, maybe 6, 7 classes all with 4 skills each (some are randomly passive, too). So it turns into a lot of grinding and not enough variety. Which might be good for them because they used to have microtransactions for gold. They might still have that option on the mobile version, too.There was also confusion because Steam will give you an acess code and tell you that the program will possibly need it. On the main menu of the game you will also see an option for inputting such a code. However, no matter how many times you try, the code Steam gives you is not the code needed to unlock the game, the game is activated upon perchase. What you are supposed to use with the code Steam gives you is registering for the game dev/publishers' website forms...ops. And the option to input a key is extra content that was given out during an event. So...yeah...thanks for the absence of an explaination, guys.So all in all, Good on the art, good on the humor, not so good on the gameplay.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper is a really good method of killing a lot of time without getting bored.Of course you have to like the 8 bit style and the battlesystem relying on initiative.A lot of nicely built in jokes and even more references to Star Wars, Monty Python and other must knows.At some points it's a bit repetitive, that aside recommendable without hesitation.

												This game is awful. I got it in a bundle. It plays like Dragon Warrior (the ultimate example of why JRPGs are bad) but with microtransactions. The whole ""real people playing a pnp RPG"" concept is paper thin. It just gives you additional stats that directly update your combat abilities (e.g. buy a new gaming table and get +1 to attack) and stuff like that. The microtransaction angle is really heavily pushed on the player.It's a pure progress quest. Choose to churn through monster type ""A"" until they drop enough coins to afford the sword that can kill monster type ""B."" These developers should be boycotted for all of eternity. I'm really disappointed in Paradox for publishing it too. This has to be the most shallow, unethically money grubbing game they've ever put their name on. I can't imagine their cut of the sales would compensate them for being associated with this trash.			"

												This is a fun game while it lasts, and I do mean while it lasts.  The combat gets very repetitive after awhile and there are only a few choices in character builds.  Once you have unlocked all the classes the can get old in a hurry.  There is just not enough diversity or depth for me. If you get it on sale it is worth the price.

												ok so i seem to be the only person on the internet who can enjoy a game without it having to meet the graphic quality of pcand i agree it is a higher price than it should be but i got the digital deluxe edition and love it and i care for microtransactions as they don't force you to buy gold in this game you earn it from doing quests and killing monster and there are even items the improve the gold you get. as for the battles: i find that they can still be tough no matter what level you are. my only problem with this game is the black smith as you'll spend loads of gold getting him up to 50% and still waste gold when you fail to craft an item other than that i think that this is better than the ios relese mainly because of the new content in the digital deluxe edition. but i at least recomend getting this game and giving it a try.

												Good fun for the price; >>>but buyer beware!!<<<I got this on Friday and have played the hell out of it this weekend.  Super addictive little RPG game that has a great angle with the way you are people playing a D&D campaign.  Love the retro graphics and all the homages to pop-culture. Worth $3.00 for the +1 version? Absolutely.Here is the caveat; this game is broken and has been since June 2013.  Developers are to busy making a new game to fix the unattainable Steam Achievements for KOPAP+1 so if you like/don't mind having a half empty achievements list this is the game for you.  Personally I was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ they should remove achievements from the list if they just don't work in the current version of the game.  Also there is some sloppy dialouge skipping. When I played this I always felt that no matter what classes I chose that the combat was still on the simple side.  This game will never be able to shake the feeling that you're playing a micro-transaction based iPhone/Andriod game because that is what it is, just now on Steam.  There are a total of 3 interesting dungeons but the reward for running them isn't nearly where it should be.All in all it's a great time killer and for the price you can't go wrong.  Maybe one tday they'll patch the issues but after 6 months of knowing about it and doing nothing don't hold your breath. "

												I picked this game for the concept alone.  A game about characters playing a tabletop RPG.  While the premise sounds promising, it doesn't exactly follow that format which would have turned this game into a sim of sorts.  What it does present is an amusing Turn Based RPG game of the old days, from classics like Dragon Warrior to D&D.As someone who actually played D&D for a few years, this game was rather appealing.  Select your team of generic players and their class (and will wear a matching hat for said class) and start an adventure.  The game provides you what most RPG games tend to have: a sense of direction.  You're provided with the main storyline and a few side-quests to pick up some extra gold and exp.Be warned, this game has micro-transactions.  It is not a vital aspect of the game as you can earn gold by farming but it's only optional.  I personally do not approve of it but that should not stop other people from doing so.  Your money.If you are looking for a charming, turn-based RPG that is a bit out of the ordinary, check this title out.  I'm enjoying it so far.			"

												A game that obliterates your grasp of time.  This game should not be initiated late in the evening as you will almost always find yourself still playing by one in the morning.  New players begin with five seats, but can only afford to fill two of them at first.  Choose carefully which skills your heroes will specialize in, don't make jack-of-all-trades; because even though you can 'usually' controll the strength of the mob parties you will fight, you can't afford to be unspecialized.   I'm loving this game so much I can barely elequate.Humor:  Casual, but usually satisfactory, 8-bit cliches and DM wit, 7/10Music: Fits the game, it's 8-bit rpg themes, what is there to say?  6/10Controls: Smoothe as giant moth fur.  In combat, whoevers turn it is, no need to click 'attack' and then select which enemy to attack, just click the enemy and, wham, a virtual 'rush' mechanic for mopping up weaker mobs.  The world map could've been given a bit more compensation room at the fringes because you click and drag the map to move it around and some locations ARE right at the edges, just a minor irritation there, could've been fixed with the ability to zoom out, but they didn't include that.  There were other things, but overall, deserves a 9/10Visuals: In an 8-bit tabletop rpg sim, all you can ask for is a great color pallete, and it's in there.  8/10This game is virtually always in Ironman mode, constantly autosaving, so even if you hit esc enough times to terminate the game, no need to freak for your progress' sake :)That's enough from me, enjoy, my comerade gamers, *drops the mic*			"

												Between Steam and the Android version, I've surely logged 40 or 50 hours on this game. It's great fun, and the game-within-a-game structure makes for some funny moments in the main quest. While the gameplay can get a little stale after you've maxed everyone out (not hard to do), it's still a fun diversion from time to time. I can wholeheartedly recommend KoP&P, but at the same time ... it's game that's also a tremendous missed opportunity for something greater.My big complaint about the game is the lack of additional content. The one DLC, ""Haunted Fall,"" is a mere sliver of addtional content, and hardly worth the price. This is the kind of game that SCREAMS for a rich set of adds ons and expansions, particularly for high-level gameplay. After two years, however, we have one lackluster, overpriced expansion that would have been a free upgrade from most other publishers.If it had Steam Workshop support, it could easily become one of the best pick-up-and-play RPG games out there. But, again, we have nothing like that. Just a great core game and some tantatlizingly untapped potential.That said, at $10 it's a touch on the pricey side. I picked my copy up on sale for perhaps $5, and when the DLC was maybe $3. It's a great deal at $8, but I'm not sure I'd feel the same way at $20 for the Deluxier version. If you can get it on steep sale, you won't regret it. Otherwise, stick to the much cheaper mobile version,			"

												its a close call on this one it starts out good but it gets old fairly fast the classes of your party are set you get to pick the ""race"" but its just a minor trait the skills are unlocked in any order you choose but theres only 20 total 4 preset to each member of your party the quest system is fairly random with some story quests thrown in but they are all more or less the same other than some quest rewards there is verry little looot set up you end up buying most of the stuff in the store i still havent got a single new weapon if the classes could vary have more skill variety better equipment setup id be willing to change my rating as is id say wait till you can find it on sale for 5 or under			"

												8.5/10 - An RPG focused on battlesThis is an interesting twist to the RPG genre: Battles similar to an RPG maker, but with a little more freedom. There is no exploration, just a map view, battles and quests. You can dictate the number of enemies you face and build a team up to (5) players.You can choose from 12 different classes which I found Rogue to be the most helpful(out of the starting classes)The game is ultra-focused on the combat but I still found it enjoyable but after about 4 hours of playing none stop you can get bored beware XD . I personally wouldn't pay full price for this game because its a bit short  but on sale it's worth the pick-up.Oh yeah almost forgot get the deluxe edition because it will be cheaper than buying the dlc separetly.

												Surprisingly addictive... The only complaint I have is that it gets a little repetitive, but I still find myself sinking hours at a time into the game, trying to just get a LITTLE further, wanting to level up and unlock everything and find more bosses to beat. The extra Farming Village with the Scarecrows is super worth a little extra price, too; it makes leveling up and earning more gold a LOT easier. Definitely recommend!			"

												A delightful, interesting, and fourth-wall breaking take on  the classic pen-and-paper RPG. Aside from a couple of achievements being a little grindy, i dont have a single problem with this game. the combat is balanced, the enemies are varied and interesting, there's plenty of classes and class combinations, and a lot of humour and particually excellently designed moments. I'm very glad i bought and played this game, and if you've ever liked RPG's or turn-based combat, i suggest you check this little gem out			"

												My first impression was really good. Nice style, humor, cool idea overall. Not only you choose your classes, but also the ""people"" who play them.Sadly, after an hour or so of gameplay, it gets too grindy. It turns into a lot of very similar encounters without enough depth to them. Also the music gets really repetitive... The mobile roots can be noticed...I'd like to recommend this game, because the idea seems to have a great potential. However, it's just not fun for me after a couple hours, and still a long time before the end. I'd love to see a sequel with less grindy fights and more gameplay apart from combat. "

												Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition is a turn based RPG game set in a scenario that is a, well, table top pen and paper game, the game starts out with you choosing two starting party members from a specific selection of characters and classes, for example, a jock and a warrior, each character having their own little passive buffs, such as the Jock having a +1 to attack.Whilst the concept is nice, the gameplay tried and true, and characters, classes, and enemies all nicely diverse, and the quests a bit repetetive, you might begin to become a bit tired of doing the typical selection of escort, kill set number of enemies, or rescue quests, that is, only if you're not a fan of games such as this.Overall, the game is a fun one, with a humorous setting and story, I highly reccomend it if you're a fan of turn based RPGs, or RPGs in general, and even more so if you enjoy humorous games.

												This is maybe the best cheapo indie game I've ever played.  If you like DnD.. play this game.  If you think DnD is funny but just like RPG's... play this game.It's just a group of nerds playing DnD around a table in a basement, but the table and all come with you on your adventure with your Dungeon Master as guide.  As you level up and complete quests and fight monsters and crawl dungeons, you can buy deco and loot to place on your table / in your basement that give passive bonuses like +attack etc.  ALSO THIS GAME WAS LIKE 2 DAMN DOLLARS.♥♥♥♥♥ amazing just play it.

												Fun game.  Had WAY more of a story than I expected from this kind of game.  The classes are cooky, and it's a diverting enough game.  Definitely worth $5...might not be worth $10 or more, though...Update for Haunted Fall DLC: The DLC has three new areas, all connected with each other with another plotline, plus a new class and a bunch of new items. The new items aren't really worth the price tag, because they're all just variations on what was already available (health, mana, etc) but the witch class is interesting and the new content is fun. It looks like the DLC isn't installed because it's integrated into the story, so it only opens up at a certain level, but it's there. Don't pay full price for the DLC because it's probably not worth it, but if you can get it in a bundle, it's good. Adds an hour or two to the game length if you do everything.			"

												The game would have been really fun if it was half as long. Unfortunately it is padded with a ton of boring grind.In retrospect I wish I wouldn't have dragged myself through so much of the game. It was fun for a few hours but at some point I was just hoping it would finally come to a conclusion. However, it just kept going, copy-pasting fights over and over, adding loop after loop to a story that had you running around in circles, never getting anywhere. The biggest punch in the face was when I finally got to the boss and it wiped my characters in one strike. Trying again would have meant hours of more grinding.Very unsatisfying and a waste of time.			"

												This game gets old very fast. The forulma is a very narrow one and is very repititious. It's also very much on rails. There's no investment on any level other than monetarily on the part of the player. It's a bit insulting in that way. It's funny for a laugh, because it's about a group of role-players off on an adventure and it makes fun of the culture, but I don't think I can recommend spending your money on it unless you already have all the games in it's price range. Even then i'd say wait for it to go on a super sale before diving in. You're better off taking a pass.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper is like a online board game/dungeons and dragons game.The game isn't exactly like a dungeons and dragons game but is a RPG/Adventure and action filled game. With different characters to chose from the adventure is different.I found that this game is very fun, has some old school memories involved and has comedy and cool missions to go on.Each character has different abilities and weaponry, but also each character has a special characteristic which makes then unique.Such as the Cleric which is the healer can also be built as a damage person as well as healing.The amazing use of customizing the background of the game has some different passive abilities which change how the game is played.The layout equipment has cool abilities such as small xp boosts in battle and also a higher pickup chance.The battles are cool as well, the customizing of how many enemies you face is a great way to lower the difficulty if a new character is introduced to the party. This makes the game much harder or easier for the player, for a smooth ride or for a hardcore bombardment of Giant Rats or Bats.Kinghts of Pen and Paper is simple, enjoyable, addictive and has a unique feel to it.The game is worth the buy and has many enjoyable features which i may not have discovered yet.

Grade: 96/100Difficulty: Easy.Pros: If you've ever played a tabletop game, this is a walk in the park. The humor and references make it fun to play. The variety of options adds a lot of depth to the game, and any one campaign will likely take you several play sessions to complete.Cons: It can be a real grind to earn your in-game gold to purchase game table elements or the player character gear and upgrades. There is an option to buy the gold, but I don't recommend it when a few rounds in a dungeon with adequate healing potions will do the trick. The music can also get redundant very quickly unless you learn to tune it out.Replayable: Yes. Very yes. Simple enough to pick up on a whim, immersive enough to feel different every time you play without becoming boring.			"

												The fact that I've amassed 30 hours on this since its most recent sale a week ago should suggest just how much I'm enjoying this game. While at times it has seemed to drag on (particularly with some of the fetch quests, but what game with fetch quests DOESN'T drag at those points really), I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience of what is effectively D'n'D in video game form.I think the one thing I've enjoyed the most about this experience though is that you control exactly how easy/hard the game is for more or less the duration of the game. For about 90% of the battles, you decide just how many monsters you face, whether you make it easy on yourself and just take on one small bat for minimal but easy exp, or whether you take on a horde of Invaders for major risk/reward exp/gold - a concept which I thought is pretty damn neat. Along with being able to change your party at any point in the game (with more classes to unlock as you playthrough), you can really make the experience your own every time and try all sorts of weird and wonderful combinations.Fun addicting title with neat graphics and a good soundtrack that I'm sure I'll be playing for many many moons to come.

												The first thing that really impressed me about KoPaP+1, is that it recognised my eyefinity multi-monitor setup without skipping a beat and started in native resolution on my central (designated no. 1) monitor. The second is the pixel art, which is sumptious and extremely well done.This is a light and amusing game, paying homage to tabletop RPGs and early 90s cRPGs. If you have reservations in respect of the gold buying facility which is apparently a feature of the tablet versions, it is disabled in the PC version. At first I found the concept a little too meta and self-referential, but the humour grew on me to the point where I found myself laughing and recalling real pen and paper sessions where the GM and players said almost exactly the same things the characters in game were saying.If you are trying for full completion of achievements, keep in mind that your gold is common between all your saved games, so you can accumulate a good amount of reserves to equip the uber party you create for the 365/465 day completion achieve. This is probably the most elusive while the similarly rare 50 dungeon complete achieve requires no particular strategy except an appetite for doing the same thing over and over again. I've found resetting or upgrading a party which has completed the game and replaying the content at a higher level to be the best way of accumulating gold for such an attempt.Wait for a decent sale price and you will get at least 25hrs of entertainment for a reasonable sum.

												This game was included in one of the bundles I bought so i really didn't know what to expect jumping into it, but I must say after 8 hours of playing this game it's really fun.  The humor in this game is pretty good, the gameplay is spot on to any older style turn based RPG and they have enough classes to constantly change up your party.   I will definitely be keeping an eye out for future game releases from the devs.Great Game!!!!! "

												Knights of Pen and Paper +1 is a ported mobile game (with a swath of improvements).  You control a DM and players as you embark on a traditional adventure for glory (and xp and gold and loot).There are plenty of sidequests to give you a break from the main quest if you desire and you can even just sit and farm monsters if you prefer.The writing is funny and drops plenty of references.  It can be a little rough at times, as though it was translated or written by a non-native speaker.However, if you have a tabletop itch to scratch, this will surely satisfy.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper is like a online board game/dungeons and dragons game.The game isn't exactly like a dungeons and dragons game but is a RPG/Adventure and action filled game. With different characters to chose from the adventure is different.I found that this game is very fun, has some old school memories involved and has comedy and cool missions to go on.Each character has different abilities and weaponry, but also each character has a special characteristic which makes then unique.Such as the Cleric which is the healer can also be built as a damage person as well as healing.The amazing use of customizing the background of the game has some different passive abilities which change how the game is played.The layout equipment has cool abilities such as small xp boosts in battle and also a higher pickup chance.The battles are cool as well, the customizing of how many enemies you face is a great way to lower the difficulty if a new character is introduced to the party. This makes the game much harder or easier for the player, for a smooth ride or for a hardcore bombardment of Giant Rats or Bats.Kinghts of Pen and Paper is simple, enjoyable, addictive and has a unique feel to it.The game is worth the buy and has many enjoyable features which i may not have discovered yet. Deffs buy the game and try it out9/10 Good Game. GG.			"

												KPP is a small, yet clever and fun game. You build your party of players, and let the DM take you through the magical, tedious universe of a classic D20 tabletop game.Travel to different areas on the map to battle monsters and complete quests. Collect gold and use it to buy items, equipment, even go meta and spend your gold on a pizza for the table. It's everything you might expect from the title.Overall, it's pretty straight-forward, simple, classicly repititve, and surprisingly charming. $10-15 is a little much, but definitely grab it when it goes on sale.Sidenote: Plays well on an x86 tablet, using only touch gestures.

												Nice game with lots of in-jokes for whoever has ever played D&D in their life (plus a good amount of geeky references in general). The game is mostly combat though, and the combat is as classic a turn based RPG combat as it can get - any SNES Final Fantasy had a similar system with more depth. This, combined with the fact that the game is pretty grind-y, makes the gameplay rather repetitive. Buy it only in offer and only if you like the idea of the ""meta"" RPG jokes.			"

												The main knock against this game is the grind that ruins the entire experience. The whole game seems like it's built to try to get you to buy gold for real money with micro-transactions. Everything from the meager drops from enemies to the fact that you have to pay gold to upgrade the blacksmith to the fact that upgrading weapons and armor always has a failure chance requiring you to spend even more gold. Even the in-game methods of boosting your gold gain almost always come at the expense of experience which in turn prevents you from mitigating the one thing that you're most likely trying to escape from: the grind. The whole time I was playing this I could feel it reaching for my wallet... in spite of the fact that this feature has apparently been removed from the game.And this is really a shame because it's not a bad game in any other aspect. The combat is the core of the game and, while basic, it's pretty solid. I never found myself feeling overpowered or like there was no aspect of challenge to it; nor did I ever feel like the game had pushed me into a corner where I was helpless. Even though you have very few abilities to choose from, there is depth and strategy in how they're use. The pixel-art backgrounds are good and contain a lot of cool references. It's kinda cool and chilling when you go to an area to level-grind and notice after an hour that slenderman has been standing there the whole time. I personally found the humor a bit flat and irreverent... though also occasionally spot-on speaking as someone who's played the tabletop RPGs this game is supposedly an homage to.Bottom line: If you like level grinding or have a high enough tolerance for it to see the rest of the experience though then this is the game for you. For me, I've found the game too tedious to play at length and it's not worth spending hours farming gold for the meager amounts of story and the occasional chuckle. Maybe it gets better later on, but it doesn't feel worth it to me to spend the time slogging through it.And for anyone who says ""This is SOOOoo much like D&D""... no, it's not. At least, not if you have a good DM it isn't. ;)			"

												This is a GREAT game! But thats only my opinion and because it was what I was looking for at this time in a game. Its funny. Its simpull. You can put it down and come back to it and not worry about forgetting anything or what to do. Its not graphics hungry so it can play on any michine. Its retro and brings back alot of memories for me of actually playing the game of pen and paper D&D. The humor is funny. And its cheap. Worth every cent.  Like my positive review all the negitive ones are only opinions of people who didn't look into what this game really was. Read them. there is nothing wrong with this game. Its got a great developer. And is already making a second game.  The only thing I would ask of the developer would be more dlc. That and a way to create your own caractor and even give the origianl caractors new names.EDIT! As of this time I can not recommed this game. After playing 30 hrs and rasing my characters to lvl 35+ an automatic update was applied and my saved game was wiped out! So far there has been no response from the company. I'm not sure I want to sink that kind of time back into this game. I guess it will all depend on how the company handles it and all of the upset players.  If they do well I will once again change my review back to positive.EDIT 2 !Company tried to fix problem with a Master Save. It was a very poor fix. As of right now I will not be playing this game any more or buying the new game. I will keep an eye on the forms to see if they lisen and try again.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper is a turn based RPG game that's pretty simple. Each character has four skills, you unlock more characters as you go, and you can pick a party of five and buy upgrades and stuff.The humor in it is pretty cheesey, so can be enjoyable if you like that sort of thing.Achievements are all very obtainable, although they will take you two playthroughs to get them all.First playthrough took me about 14 hours to beat everything, will probably take 8-10 if you dont. Overall spent 24 hours total to 100% the game and get every achievement. Was fun doing so. Expect to get 10 hours from this game without 100%, 20 hours with 100%			"

												The initial reason for purchasing this game was because it looked like it would likely run on my computer.  Which, hey, it does a swimming job of it.I also thought it would be the kind of game I might actually enjoy.  Damn it, I was actually right there, and this is a game that while hugely ""simple"" in design and all that, totally draws me in.  No idea why.  But as a ""not a gamer"" the having played over 13 hours of the game, and being actively avoiding it, in about a month is really a huge plus for the game.  So, yep, go for this if this kind of game (classic (sort of) RPG) interests you.			"

												If you're looking for a quirky, fun RPG that simulates the basics of a game of Dungeons and Dragons, then this game is worth trying out. You are given a selection of players with different passive abilities, and are able to invite them to your game as the class of your choice. New players and classes can be rotated in, and you have control over everyone's skills, equipment upgrades and accessories, but not their base stats. You are able to switch Dungeon Masters, furniture, and table items that add bonuses to your game, as well as purchase perishable food items which give temporary bonuses to players.Fully upgrading your equipment and game room does require grinding for experience and gold, and the game is plagued by seemingly random difficulty jumps as the recommended levels for quests start to outpace your characters' growth even if you complete the optional quest lines. Despite this, the game is still quite enjoyable and charming, as long as you have a soft spot for old school RPGs. However those looking for a compelling narrative are going to be disappointed, as the game's dialogue is riddled with generic stereotypes and frequent grammar mistakes.So if you're looking for a traditional turn-based RPG with some D&D flair to spend hours slaughtering monsters and levelling up your characters, then this is your game. If that sounds boring and repetitive to you, or if you require an epic story and interesting characters, then you may want to pass on this one.			"

												On the whole this is a fun little RPG that hearkens back to tabletop DnD. But it's not without a few significant flaws in my opinion.Pros:1) Good concept and basic game design2) Combat involves some strategy - while combat has some RNG components, by and large strategy will win/lose most matches3) ""Bonus"" purchases are creative and allow for nice customizationCons:1) ""Crafting"" system is almost entirely RNG. A bad streak of rolls and you can come away with nothing.  Equipment upgrades are relatively expensive without significant off-quest grinding, and even levelling up the Blacksmith and maxing out luck bonuses, the chance of failure is still relatively high for items of that expense.  2) This problem is exacerbated by 'mining' being the primary means to upgrade said blacksmith. Relatively few nodes vs. a steep cost-scaling, and a needlessly long dialogue (which can't be interrupted best I can tell) each time you attempt to mine a node makes it like pulling teeth after level 3-4.  At BS level 7, even with bonuses my risk of failure is about 20-25%.  And perhaps due to bad luck, I think my actual failure rate is closer to 40%.  3) The design feature that has certain quest types trigger combat as you hit each zone is reasonable in the early game, and incredibly annoying in the late game. As a lvl 35 party, what's the point of slowing the game for me to have repeated battles against lvl 5 enemies?On the whole it's a good game, and it's probably going to take the average player 12-20 hours to play through the main campaign. While side quests are technically optional, end-game battles are much higher level than you'd likely manage if you just skipped through. Regular mobs can be cc'ed regardless of your level (so at worst you can slog through a long fight even if overmatched), but elites/bosses cannot.It will be interesting to see what improvements they make for the 2nd game due out this fall.

												The game is advertised as you playing the *players* of people playing D&D. the gameplay honestly is just watered down D&D with the cast replaced by a table full of players though. It's a cute game for a bit. It cameos or references various topical humor bits liek Gremlins, Scooby Doo, Star wars, TMNT, Short Circut (the list goes on amazingly and would probably be the main reason to keep playing when the gameplay starts being a bore: Just to see what else they show us).But it doesn't really keep your interest too well as a game. The classes don't branch out or anything. Every class has the same 3 or 4 moves they started with. It also suffers from ""FF7 status effect syndrome""; where only pure damage and buff moves matter as anytime a debuff would be theoretically useful the monster is immune to it anyway - usually a boss, but not always.It's a cheap game though so you can't really go wrong if you just want to goof around and mess with something that doesn't take itself seriously. In small doses it's fun.			"

												You can probably tell at a glance whether you will like this game. If you are a fan of the Pixel Art style and enjoy RPGs, then you will love Knights of Pen and Paper. Otherwise, move along. This game is quirky, entertaining, and more robust than a lot of people give it credit for. The last game I bought on Steam before Knights of Pen and Paper was Final Fantasy III, and I have to say, I actually think KoPaP has a better class system than FFIII. I certainly enjoyed it a lot more. There are six classes available at first, with another six that you can unlock for future playthroughs by completing side quests throughout the game. Each class has four abilities which you can upgrade over time as the character levels up. These abilities can either be passive (increasing attack power, critical chance, physical resistance, etc.) or active (dealing extra damage, buffing friendly units, etc.), and the variety of different classes and different abilities means that you can come up with different strategies and play styles on each and every playthrough.This game has a ton of replay value. Setting up a unique and balanced party is half the fun--the other half is learning how to make the most out of the combinations you choose. And since each of the twelve (or seventeen) playable characters has unique traits as well (such as extra experience, extra luck, or skill bonuses), this game provides way more variety between one playthrough and the next than you might think from the ""casual"" label the game has earned from a lot of people. Furthermore, KoPaP's gameplay successfully solves some of the problems inherent in turn-based RPGs--including Final Fantasy III. Turn order is determined at random at the start of every battle (bases on each character and enemy's Initiative stat), but it stays the same throughout the entire battle. Thus, the game allows you to strategize, knowing exactly which characters get to move when, but still introduces an element of randomness that makes every battle feel unique. Consecutive fights against the exact same enemies will play out differently and require slightly different strategies.Visually, KoPaP makes clever and effective use of the faux-8-bit style that's currently so popular in indie games. When characters from other Behold Studios games appear as part of certain quests, the humorously obvious contrast between the blocky KoPaP characters and the much higher-resolution guest characters serves to remind you that this game looks the way it does as a matter of choice--not of hardware or software limitations. The backgrounds in nearly every area you visit are loaded with minimalistically rendered pop culture references, from Lord of the Rings to Captain America. But these references get annoying quickly once they start working their way into the game's main plotlines. What is amusing as a background easter egg comes across as cheesy, clunky, and unfitting as a major foreground element. The game tries to spin these pop culture interpositions as an inside joke about how real-world RPG dungeon masters come up with their material, but the joke, in my opinion, falls flat. Therein lies one potential pitfall of the game: KoPaP derives most of its humor from stereotypes and inside jokes about real-world RPG players. Sometimes, the game strikes on some genuinely amusing and accessible ideas. All of the original twelve playable characters are pretty funny--from Hynx (the hardcore guy who came up with his own lame fantasy name) to Mr. John (the totally normal business man who plays in his scanty spare time) to Grandma (who doesn't know what's going on and wants everyone else to speak up). But after a few hours, you'll probably be pretty bored with characters complaining about stupid quests. Or asking for the hundredth time whether someone can order a pizza. Or worse, laughing at the game's own jokes. Self-congratulation is never funny or desirable in a video game.The game has other flaws as well. KoPaP was made by a Brazilian company, which is really cool. But the localization is really spotty, and--especially as you get closer to the end of the game--a lot of the dialogue is totally garbled and difficult to make out. Given how much of the humor and plot of this game depends on dialogue for delivery, that's a pretty serious problem. Also, outside of a single box of flavor text when you first create a character, none of the playable characters has any unique dialogue. Each character simply gets assigned different lines of text that are the exact same on every playthrough. And while it can be amusing to hear Grandma complain about why there aren't more hot girls in the game's quests, the canned dialogue gets old once you've already seen it once or twice. For the most part, the game does a good job ""scaling"" enemies so that you are always at an appropriate level to tackle  the main storyline quests. But towards the end of the game, more enemies gain powerful abilities that can make them much harder than their level suggests. You will face some frustrations from enemies that are pushovers in one battle and obliterate you in the next. The game also helpfully tells you approximately what level of enemies you will face in any specific quest. But there are a lot of mistakes--particularly on quests that have you going to multiple locations or that show up as a set--which can lead to you stumbling into difficult areas before you're ready (or abandoning a quest halfway through). Really, I can only see two truly ""casual"" elements to this game. First, you can save and quit at any point when you aren't fighting enemies. It's a nice touch, since it means you can play this game for five minutes or two hours. But, second, this game shows its ""casual"" nature in that you will probably start to get bored if you play for much more than an hour or an hour-and-a-half at once. For one thing, the game's story is pretty goofy and trivial--more entertaining than engrossing. And there are only so many variations on the ""go to X, battle Y"" formula that the game can throw you before it gets a little tiresome. Seriously. The gameplay in this game consists entirely of traveling to different areas and fighting different enemies. Of course, combat is fun and engaging, but the game is still better in small doses.If all that sounds appealing to you, then buy this game. I bought it on sale, and I have really enjoyed it. It's just fun!			"

												It's worth playing, but worth a lot less than the asking price.  It's a cute game and it' s funny, but the gameplay really suffers.  The escort missions are really awful and greatly detract from the overall experience with forced encounters that pose no challenge or threat and simply waste your time.  Another bad mission is the ""gather the 5 desert flowers... 8 furs... 5 glitches..."" It's quite contrived, which doesn't help when the story is very minimalistic.  The overworld map is the absolute enemy to this game.  That map really ruins the pacing of the game, if moving from one location to another wasn't so boring and time-comsuming the game would feel a lot better.  The combat is good, but could be improved.  If the enemies could have more interesting abilities then the grindy nature of game could be helped a lot.  It would be great if there were more D&D-like mechanics included, because that would be appropriate with the theme and would be fun.  It's art and style were fun enough for me to recommend, but if you were looking for an good RPG then look elsewhere.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper is a throwback to old school table top rpg's.  At least it presents it self that way.  You have a dungeon master that sits at a table along with your party.  He tells a story and provides quests for you to do.  It's a pretty easy game and fun too.  You can determine how the game is played.  You want to just solo it, bring 5 different classes along, fight just 1 monster or 7.. it's your call.All in all if you dig the graphics and of course like rpg's this game is a definite play through.

												It is very good game for its price, cannot ask more!This game took traditional methods of classic table top Dungeon and Dragon (DnD) RPG with modern turn based approach. Just imagine playing Pokemon with DnD approach. The storyline is pretty much linear in my opinion, but I really like the writtings. Jokes and some references are pretty on point in this game (although not in Borderlands level). The sounds are mediocre, neither good or bad, it just suit the game. The pixel arts are pretty and fit with the game theme. Overall, is not a big RPG game like Earthbound or classic Final Fantasy, however this game offers compact gameplay and without hassle. I play this game in the mean time everytime I get bored with studying or programming for ~30 minutes. Definitely a worth game to play!			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper is an RPG within an RPG : as a dungeon master, you gather a team of friends to be ""the characters you'll play with"", and each of your characters play another character inside the grand adventure of roleplaying, Inception style. Cool, uh ?The ""fictional adventure"" is decent, but not very original or engaging unless you're a stat junkie or easily fall for nostalgia. The ""game night advenure"" is a complete static one and takes place around a table. From this point, your options to level things up are limited to your vicinity. And that's kinda boring even depressive the envision your progression as providing junk food or changing furniture. I thought the real joy of a gaming night was the emotions shared by the players.Maybe the game should have been more accurately named Gaming Buddies of Ikea and Superstores. Didn't worked for me.

												The first thing that really impressed me about KoPaP+1, is that it recognised my eyefinity multi-monitor setup without skipping a beat and started in native resolution on my central (designated no. 1) monitor. The second is the pixel art, which is sumptious and extremely well done.This is a light and amusing game, paying homage to tabletop RPGs and early 90s cRPGs. If you have reservations in respect of the gold buying facility which is apparently a feature of the tablet versions, it is disabled in the PC version. At first I found the concept a little too meta and self-referential, but the humour grew on me to the point where I found myself laughing and recalling real pen and paper sessions where the GM and players said almost exactly the same things the characters in game were saying.If you are trying for full completion of achievements, keep in mind that your gold is common between all your saved games, so you can accumulate a good amount of reserves to equip the uber party you create for the 365/465 day completion achieve. This is probably the most elusive while the similarly rare 50 dungeon complete achieve requires no particular strategy except an appetite for doing the same thing over and over again. I've found resetting or upgrading a party which has completed the game and replaying the content at a higher level to be the best way of accumulating gold for such an attempt.Wait for a decent sale price and you will get at least 25hrs of entertainment for a reasonable sum.

												At it's core, it's a game of numbers. Press a few buttons, watch the numbers get bigger. With a thin veil of strategy layered over top.  That said, that thin veil of strategy is what makes the game enjoyable even with the skinner box design methodology. It's a game everyone should play at least once for the experience and it's a good game to keep in the backgrund of something else.			"

Grade: 96/100Difficulty: Easy.Pros: If you've ever played a tabletop game, this is a walk in the park. The humor and references make it fun to play. The variety of options adds a lot of depth to the game, and any one campaign will likely take you several play sessions to complete.Cons: It can be a real grind to earn your in-game gold to purchase game table elements or the player character gear and upgrades. There is an option to buy the gold, but I don't recommend it when a few rounds in a dungeon with adequate healing potions will do the trick. The music can also get redundant very quickly unless you learn to tune it out.Replayable: Yes. Very yes. Simple enough to pick up on a whim, immersive enough to feel different every time you play without becoming boring.			"

												If you're an old school fan of Dungeons & Dragons and don't have the time to play an epic RPG, this game is for you. You do NOT need to buy any microtransactions in this game as long as you manage you money ok (read the guides and use +gold bonus modifiers). I like the fact that you have the option to play in different screen resolutions as well as in a windowed mode where you can multitask.This game takes turn-based RPG to its roots. Newer gamers may not appreciate it, but it is right for older gamers with busy lives. It is sprinkled with pop culture and various references throughout the game. It may get repetitive at times, but there are various classes to keep things fresh.The game doesn't do a very good job in explaining that you can mine rocks in caves for grindstone, and then take the stones to a town to raise the XP of the blacksmith. I would not suggest attempting to level up weapons and armors until later in the game since the success rate is so low. Reading the tips and guides will make your experience more enjoyable and you won't be wasting your hard-earned gold (since gold is used for everything, including travel).			"

It does too much of the work for you, and takes away all your options.

												Allow me to preface this review by saying that I do like it and that this is an increbily fun game. That being said, there are big flaws that are constantly nagging at me, slowly becoming worse as I continue to play. I DO recommend this game, and also kinda not. I'll try to explain below.Let's start with the positives:- Each job feels unique. The jobs are varied significantly, each having their own abilities and ""hat"" that goes onto the player's. The players themselves each have a skill that they bring to the table and it's fun to min/max or switch out players with different jobs to see what they would work best as.- The art direction is classic and very colourful. The art direction reminds me a lot of the older FF games, and a few other sprite-based games that were brought out in the 90s and early 2000s. It's simple, colourful, and nice to look at. Nothing is too washed out and the colour choice isn't offensive to the eye.- Cute references to Sci-Fi and Fantasy stories.There are TONS of references to various shows, books, movies, ect littered throughout the game world. It's cute seeing the Tardis in the desert or fighting a Ninja Turtle in the sewers. I won't spoil any more for anyone reading this review, but I will say that if you don't mind referential humour then you will certainly enjoy many bits of this game.- The music can be pretty enjoyable.The music is simple, but not in a bad way. It feels a bit like the old Mario games in places. I'm afraid I can't really elaborate on exactly what I mean, sufficed to say that the music fits the areas that it's in.So what about the negatives? Well, I'm afraid that this is where a majority of my review is going to be focused. There are quite a lot of issues littered throughout the game that bug me and I'll try to elaborate on why that is.- The referential humor.Okay, I know what you're all thinking, ""Hey, didn't you just list that as a positive?"" Well, yes, and it is... However, I also feel it's a bit of a negative. This game is a little too busy referencing so many things that it's a bit hard to tell where the references end and the original content begins. For instance, most of the player characters are references to either real life people or fictional people. Which this doesn't bother me too much, I do feel like it wasn't really needed. Is it really so hard to come up with original player characters? Well, apparently not, I mean, there are some. So why did we need a Paris Hilton or Ramona Flowers allusion? Also, the ""Game Dev Gang"" joke was cute at first but it got old way too fast. I may be the only one that's really bothered by this but this is a bias review so... Yeah.- Job abilities.Simply put? There aren't enough/ They're too easily unlocked. The jobs -are- still distinct from one another, I can't take that away. However, there's something to be said about being limited to four abilities. That, of course, being ""why?"" I'm not ignorant, I know you can only realistically fit in so many on a game that was originally a mobile game- but, this isn't a mobile platform I'm playing it on, this is the PC edition. Why are jobs so limited? Some jobs have 2 passive abilities and 2 abilities you need to activate. That doesn't seem right to me. For example: The Cleric job has a focus heal, a group heal, a divine attack that restores HP, and a Attack down debuff that spreads to 3 enemies. Those are all fine and dandy, but why doesn't it have a manner of Dispel? How about a passive ability to not be harmed by Divine attacks or something along those lines? This may be a nit-pick, but this is what was nagging me as I use certain characters. Now, that being said, I also feel that being able to unlock any of a job's abilities at any level is... Questionable. Again, might just be a nit-pick, maybe it only bothers me.- Enemy Encounters.I'll keep this one short: Add a 'random' option to the 'enemy choice' screen. I get what they're going for, allowing the player to pick the enemies your group encounters so as to best simulate both the DM and Player experience, but I don't feel like you should -always- have your cake and eat it like that. Dungeons are good for random encounters.- Missing Dialogue/ Lack of Personality for the PlayersThere are moments in the various quests or on the world map when your players are either talking to an NPC or casually interacting with the ""DM"" of the group that, honestly, feel like they have dialogue missing from them. For instance, sometimes I'll have completed a quest and the NPC will say something along the lines of, ""Oh, thank you! You're so helpful."" I'll click to go to the next bit of dialogue, presumebly what the player would say to the NPC, but there's... Nothing. A blank screen that I click through to go to my quest rewards. What? It's even worse when there are times where an entire half of a conversation is missing- or the players don't react to what was said in any realistic manner. The grammar has mistakes on occasion, as well. So, the dialogue seems missing. That's a pretty big problem in-and-of itself, but then you couple that with none of the players, DMs, NPCs, even the enemies, having -any- kind of distinct personality? Well, that just rubs me the wrong way. In this age of having defined characters, enemies, and even monsters in our stories, this feels lazy. Hopelessly lazy.- A lack of any kind of multiplayer support.This game would be a MUCH better experience if I could get a group of five other friends to play with me, with someone to DM and actually create custom quests or something. Alas, that is not available here.So, before I continue on for a few hours, what am I saying with all of this? This game, in all honesty, is just decent. It's a decent game and I enjoy it, but it is weighed down by some pretty substantial flaws. I enjoy it for what it is and would play it again, even if a grain of salt has to be taken with it. If they fix these problems, then fantastic. This would be an excellent game. As it stands right now, I recommend it- but only if you think you can handle the flaws.			"

												Let me start off by saying that I actually liked this game. However, there's A LOT of small problems with the game that make it not very fun or enjoyable. I was really excited to play this and was pretty disappointed halfway through and was completely over it by the end.- The class and character systemThis had the potential to be really cool and in-depth but classes are limited to 4 abilities and never change. There aren't any skill trees or advancing skills, you get the same 4 skills from the beginning to the end, the only thing changing are the numbers tied to each skill. This got boring really fast. The unique character system is kind of pointless, characters range from useful, to slightly useful, to pointless. Who would you rather have, the guy with +3 attack or the guy who only has +1 attack? The guy with +5 health who's more likely to live or the guy who costs -50% gold to revive after he dies because he sucks? Most of them are just pointless, especially after you unlock the game devs and restart your game.-Lack of plotI know that this is supposed to be more of a comedy/parody type thing, and I appreciated the humor, but the whole lack of an actual plot just made the game feel even more boring when you tie in the tedious and boring gameplay.-Boring gameplayJust keep clicking on the same skills over and over. Fight mobs without any sort of auto-battle or anything to streamline grinding (and trust me, there's a lot of grinding). On a PC this is the worst thing. Obviously if you have a touch screen computer (like I do) or play this game on a mobile platform (which obviously isn't the Steam version) then it's not so bad but still. Sitting there and clicking the same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over gets boring really fast. The beginning of the game is fun because you're still new to everything and your skills and levels are rising fast, but everything plateaus equally as fast, especially the fun.-Gold systemEverything in this game costs gold except for leveling up. Consumables cost gold, accessories cost an obscene amount of gold, TRAVELING costs gold (this is one of the stupidest things ever), reviving your dead characters cost gold and most quests cost gold as a result of traveling (despite them usually refunding the gold, if you don't have the initial gold you will have to grind). Now, this doesn't SOUND like that big a deal, but grinding gold is unbelievably slow. You can spend about half an hour to grind about 1000 or so gold through the early to mid game. To upgrade all of your characters' armor from lvl1 to lvl2 would cost roughly 1000+ and that's assuming you succeed because upgrading equips usually has a 50% and below chance to upgrade unless you invest either MORE GOLD or grind mines to upgrade your blacksmith. There's upgrades that increase your gold income rate but they don't do very much. The whole thing is just terrible.There's not much the game does right, but what they actually DO right is pretty good.+BalanceThis is one of the few indie/joke/whatever RPGs that has actual balance. Most of them either don't try to have any semblance of balance and are too easy just so they can spout more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ memes. This actually feels like a really well done game and the battle mechanics were well thought out. It doesn't feel like there are any OP classes. Yeah, the rogue and hunter are really strong, but they're not overpowered. The game is decently challenging from beginning to end and never feels too easy or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hard. This is pretty hard to do so I have to commend the creators.+HumorThis is a pretty funny game, lots of humor and lightheartedness, but it's an actual game. There are way too many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ indie games that just try to shove unfunny jokes everywhere and lack actual content. This game has both and once again, the creators did a good job.Overall thoughts: I actually liked this game and had a good time playing it, it just has a lot of flaws. However, I also only paid about $4 for this and the DLC. If I had paid the full $15 for both I would have been extremely upset as this game does not provide for more than a couple of dollars worth of entertainment. As far as replay value goes, I don't want to ever play this again. It'll just remind me of how disappointed I was the first time playing it. If you can grab it for a couple of dollars (preferably the mobile version, avoid the steam version) go for it, but don't bother paying full price for this.			"

												Nice game with lots of in-jokes for whoever has ever played D&D in their life (plus a good amount of geeky references in general). The game is mostly combat though, and the combat is as classic a turn based RPG combat as it can get - any SNES Final Fantasy had a similar system with more depth. This, combined with the fact that the game is pretty grind-y, makes the gameplay rather repetitive. Buy it only in offer and only if you like the idea of the ""meta"" RPG jokes.			"

												A fun RPG styled after a group of people playing DnD.  There's a decent amount of customization with a good variety of characters and classes.  The writing is pretty good.  My main complaint is the game really drags on towards the end.  The entire game is combat and dialogue, and the combat doesn't vary much, so after a while it gets extremely repetitive.  I ended up skipping half the sidequests because I just wanted to be done.If you enjoy DnD I highly recommend this game.  Otherwise, it is a decent RPG worth paying a few dollars.			"

												Before I start, I must imply Ive played this game on my tablet so Ive no hours played on PC but its the same version.The majority of this game is well executed with a strong plot, side missions and with the moderate fun level of killing the baddie mansies. BUT..... After playing the game for at least 30+ hours I have found that a lot of areas are VERY FARMY to level up and by the time you get to the end the ""PLOT"" seems to disintegrate to nothing. To this date I CANT complete the end boss as am 20 levels lower than it and theres NO PLOT to level me to it. VERY SAD dissapointment, especially the second half of the game!! PS Missions are very irresponsably levelled, and I was left several times with no missions to do as I wasnt high level enough and no low level ones to do. "

Right now it feels like a really simple sandbox for turn-based RPG style fights with nothing else.I'll report back after playing more.			"

These upgrades increase the quality of your characters gear, or even buy new accesories for your room which grant passive bonuses to your group.

												Allow me to preface this review by saying that I do like it and that this is an increbily fun game. That being said, there are big flaws that are constantly nagging at me, slowly becoming worse as I continue to play. I DO recommend this game, and also kinda not. I'll try to explain below.Let's start with the positives:- Each job feels unique. The jobs are varied significantly, each having their own abilities and ""hat"" that goes onto the player's. The players themselves each have a skill that they bring to the table and it's fun to min/max or switch out players with different jobs to see what they would work best as.- The art direction is classic and very colourful. The art direction reminds me a lot of the older FF games, and a few other sprite-based games that were brought out in the 90s and early 2000s. It's simple, colourful, and nice to look at. Nothing is too washed out and the colour choice isn't offensive to the eye.- Cute references to Sci-Fi and Fantasy stories.There are TONS of references to various shows, books, movies, ect littered throughout the game world. It's cute seeing the Tardis in the desert or fighting a Ninja Turtle in the sewers. I won't spoil any more for anyone reading this review, but I will say that if you don't mind referential humour then you will certainly enjoy many bits of this game.- The music can be pretty enjoyable.The music is simple, but not in a bad way. It feels a bit like the old Mario games in places. I'm afraid I can't really elaborate on exactly what I mean, sufficed to say that the music fits the areas that it's in.So what about the negatives? Well, I'm afraid that this is where a majority of my review is going to be focused. There are quite a lot of issues littered throughout the game that bug me and I'll try to elaborate on why that is.- The referential humor.Okay, I know what you're all thinking, ""Hey, didn't you just list that as a positive?"" Well, yes, and it is... However, I also feel it's a bit of a negative. This game is a little too busy referencing so many things that it's a bit hard to tell where the references end and the original content begins. For instance, most of the player characters are references to either real life people or fictional people. Which this doesn't bother me too much, I do feel like it wasn't really needed. Is it really so hard to come up with original player characters? Well, apparently not, I mean, there are some. So why did we need a Paris Hilton or Ramona Flowers allusion? Also, the ""Game Dev Gang"" joke was cute at first but it got old way too fast. I may be the only one that's really bothered by this but this is a bias review so... Yeah.- Job abilities.Simply put? There aren't enough/ They're too easily unlocked. The jobs -are- still distinct from one another, I can't take that away. However, there's something to be said about being limited to four abilities. That, of course, being ""why?"" I'm not ignorant, I know you can only realistically fit in so many on a game that was originally a mobile game- but, this isn't a mobile platform I'm playing it on, this is the PC edition. Why are jobs so limited? Some jobs have 2 passive abilities and 2 abilities you need to activate. That doesn't seem right to me. For example: The Cleric job has a focus heal, a group heal, a divine attack that restores HP, and a Attack down debuff that spreads to 3 enemies. Those are all fine and dandy, but why doesn't it have a manner of Dispel? How about a passive ability to not be harmed by Divine attacks or something along those lines? This may be a nit-pick, but this is what was nagging me as I use certain characters. Now, that being said, I also feel that being able to unlock any of a job's abilities at any level is... Questionable. Again, might just be a nit-pick, maybe it only bothers me.- Enemy Encounters.I'll keep this one short: Add a 'random' option to the 'enemy choice' screen. I get what they're going for, allowing the player to pick the enemies your group encounters so as to best simulate both the DM and Player experience, but I don't feel like you should -always- have your cake and eat it like that. Dungeons are good for random encounters.- Missing Dialogue/ Lack of Personality for the PlayersThere are moments in the various quests or on the world map when your players are either talking to an NPC or casually interacting with the ""DM"" of the group that, honestly, feel like they have dialogue missing from them. For instance, sometimes I'll have completed a quest and the NPC will say something along the lines of, ""Oh, thank you! You're so helpful."" I'll click to go to the next bit of dialogue, presumebly what the player would say to the NPC, but there's... Nothing. A blank screen that I click through to go to my quest rewards. What? It's even worse when there are times where an entire half of a conversation is missing- or the players don't react to what was said in any realistic manner. The grammar has mistakes on occasion, as well. So, the dialogue seems missing. That's a pretty big problem in-and-of itself, but then you couple that with none of the players, DMs, NPCs, even the enemies, having -any- kind of distinct personality? Well, that just rubs me the wrong way. In this age of having defined characters, enemies, and even monsters in our stories, this feels lazy. Hopelessly lazy.- A lack of any kind of multiplayer support.This game would be a MUCH better experience if I could get a group of five other friends to play with me, with someone to DM and actually create custom quests or something. Alas, that is not available here.So, before I continue on for a few hours, what am I saying with all of this? This game, in all honesty, is just decent. It's a decent game and I enjoy it, but it is weighed down by some pretty substantial flaws. I enjoy it for what it is and would play it again, even if a grain of salt has to be taken with it. If they fix these problems, then fantastic. This would be an excellent game. As it stands right now, I recommend it- but only if you think you can handle the flaws.			"

												I grew up on the NES and DOS-era RPGs, but I have not played any edition of Dungeons and Dragons earlier than third.  That said, I am quite familiar with the mechanics and culture that this game is paying homage to.  It fits the feel of an 8-bit RPG and a 1980s homebrew campaign world quite well, with its crunchy (mechanics-focused) gameplay and cobbled-together story.I love this game so far, despite the grind, but it is most certainly not for everyone. I got it for Christmas, and if one can find it for $5 or less, it is worth buying if you like that sort of thing. I do, and they fixed their issues with microtaransaction elements, so I'm editing my review to reflect that.			"

												I can't remember why exactly i bought this, nor do i care. This is a great game. I bought the five dollar expansion almost immediatly after playing a few missions because i didn't want to miss a thing. The game takes after DnD in that your players are a group of nerds at a table, being guided through an adventure by a GM. This opens up possibilities for excellent 4th wall breaks and humorous diolalogue, something the devs took full adventege of. The retro styles is pleasing to the eye and, just when i though i had beaten the game, a ton more suddenly opened up. The open endedness of the game was a huge selling point for me. There are clear idicators letting you know which way the plot lies, but you are free to explore wherever the heck you please. Suggestions are given for how strong you ought ot be before you go to different locations so you aren't unduely surprised when your two level ten boys are jumped by a level 25 wraith. There are cons of course. Items and items drops in general are poor, but gold is very easy to get ahold of while still making you work for it, so you can purchase the good items with moderate hassle. There is a fair amount of grinding, but it doesn't have to be samey if you don't let it. Honestly, this is a very good game and extremely well worth the price. 9.5/10.			"

												This is a very nice casual game, as it manages to keep you entertained for quite a decent amount of time. You start with a certain party and then while you're advancing in the campaign, you get to unlock other classes or upgrades that improve the gameplay experience. It's worth to mention that the graphics are simple and the soundtrack is also very limited, but you might as well just turn off the music and listen to a radio station (something that I usually do). There're also the trading cards and achievements available, which is something that might add for the replay value factor. Overall, this is the kind of game to play bit by bit, I really don't recommend to experience for straight hours because it might start to wear down on you quite easily.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper is not a standard RPG.  But it is.If you ever spent time at a kitchen table hashing out battles between your elf ranger and heaps of orcs, you'll recognize 99% of what's going on in this game.  If not, the jokes may wear faster than Holy Grail references at your girlfriend's house.Fun, interesting mechanics keep the battles at varying levels of difficulty, and the party dynamics are interesting as well.  A great, fun rimp for RPG fans, and a special treat for tabletop role-players.  TL;DR: 10/10, would die during character creation again.			"

												Let me start off by saying that I actually liked this game. However, there's A LOT of small problems with the game that make it not very fun or enjoyable. I was really excited to play this and was pretty disappointed halfway through and was completely over it by the end.- The class and character systemThis had the potential to be really cool and in-depth but classes are limited to 4 abilities and never change. There aren't any skill trees or advancing skills, you get the same 4 skills from the beginning to the end, the only thing changing are the numbers tied to each skill. This got boring really fast. The unique character system is kind of pointless, characters range from useful, to slightly useful, to pointless. Who would you rather have, the guy with +3 attack or the guy who only has +1 attack? The guy with +5 health who's more likely to live or the guy who costs -50% gold to revive after he dies because he sucks? Most of them are just pointless, especially after you unlock the game devs and restart your game.-Lack of plotI know that this is supposed to be more of a comedy/parody type thing, and I appreciated the humor, but the whole lack of an actual plot just made the game feel even more boring when you tie in the tedious and boring gameplay.-Boring gameplayJust keep clicking on the same skills over and over. Fight mobs without any sort of auto-battle or anything to streamline grinding (and trust me, there's a lot of grinding). On a PC this is the worst thing. Obviously if you have a touch screen computer (like I do) or play this game on a mobile platform (which obviously isn't the Steam version) then it's not so bad but still. Sitting there and clicking the same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over gets boring really fast. The beginning of the game is fun because you're still new to everything and your skills and levels are rising fast, but everything plateaus equally as fast, especially the fun.-Gold systemEverything in this game costs gold except for leveling up. Consumables cost gold, accessories cost an obscene amount of gold, TRAVELING costs gold (this is one of the stupidest things ever), reviving your dead characters cost gold and most quests cost gold as a result of traveling (despite them usually refunding the gold, if you don't have the initial gold you will have to grind). Now, this doesn't SOUND like that big a deal, but grinding gold is unbelievably slow. You can spend about half an hour to grind about 1000 or so gold through the early to mid game. To upgrade all of your characters' armor from lvl1 to lvl2 would cost roughly 1000+ and that's assuming you succeed because upgrading equips usually has a 50% and below chance to upgrade unless you invest either MORE GOLD or grind mines to upgrade your blacksmith. There's upgrades that increase your gold income rate but they don't do very much. The whole thing is just terrible.There's not much the game does right, but what they actually DO right is pretty good.+BalanceThis is one of the few indie/joke/whatever RPGs that has actual balance. Most of them either don't try to have any semblance of balance and are too easy just so they can spout more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ memes. This actually feels like a really well done game and the battle mechanics were well thought out. It doesn't feel like there are any OP classes. Yeah, the rogue and hunter are really strong, but they're not overpowered. The game is decently challenging from beginning to end and never feels too easy or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hard. This is pretty hard to do so I have to commend the creators.+HumorThis is a pretty funny game, lots of humor and lightheartedness, but it's an actual game. There are way too many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ indie games that just try to shove unfunny jokes everywhere and lack actual content. This game has both and once again, the creators did a good job.Overall thoughts: I actually liked this game and had a good time playing it, it just has a lot of flaws. However, I also only paid about $4 for this and the DLC. If I had paid the full $15 for both I would have been extremely upset as this game does not provide for more than a couple of dollars worth of entertainment. As far as replay value goes, I don't want to ever play this again. It'll just remind me of how disappointed I was the first time playing it. If you can grab it for a couple of dollars (preferably the mobile version, avoid the steam version) go for it, but don't bother paying full price for this.			"

												I really like this game but the only thing that pisses me off is.... the blacksmith system!You cant craft anything early on in the game cause it will usually fail and then youve just wasted 150 of your hard earned gold! But if you can get over that, I think most people will enjoy this game. And also the D&D concept is kinda cool ^_^			"

												In this game, you play a player, who is in turn playing a character in a tabletop DnD style RPG game. Its a fresh, nearly original idea, and it is pulled off rather nicely. So far it has been very fun. Well worth picking up for any rpg fan out there looming for something new and fresh to play.			"

												KPP is a small, yet clever and fun game. You build your party of players, and let the DM take you through the magical, tedious universe of a classic D20 tabletop game.Travel to different areas on the map to battle monsters and complete quests. Collect gold and use it to buy items, equipment, even go meta and spend your gold on a pizza for the table. It's everything you might expect from the title.Overall, it's pretty straight-forward, simple, classicly repititve, and surprisingly charming. $10-15 is a little much, but definitely grab it when it goes on sale.Sidenote: Plays well on an x86 tablet, using only touch gestures.

												30% of this game is doing quests. You go to one place, learn what the quest is about, go to another place, kill a bunch of monsters on your way, go back, collect reward.70% is grinding. The main difference is that now you can choose by yourself what monsters you want to fight.The fights, which are the core element of the game, use simple old-school JRPG mechanics. It gets tedious and repetitive.Item management and skill upgrades are simple. There isn't much room for creativity.The main gimmick (the player controlling not an adventurer, but a DM with his players who in turn control their adventurers) is OK, but it's not utilised to its fullest. In-game 4th wall breaking is a storytelling device and not a game mechanic.			"

												This game is awful. I got it in a bundle. It plays like Dragon Warrior (the ultimate example of why JRPGs are bad) but with microtransactions. The whole ""real people playing a pnp RPG"" concept is paper thin. It just gives you additional stats that directly update your combat abilities (e.g. buy a new gaming table and get +1 to attack) and stuff like that. The microtransaction angle is really heavily pushed on the player.It's a pure progress quest. Choose to churn through monster type ""A"" until they drop enough coins to afford the sword that can kill monster type ""B."" These developers should be boycotted for all of eternity. I'm really disappointed in Paradox for publishing it too. This has to be the most shallow, unethically money grubbing game they've ever put their name on. I can't imagine their cut of the sales would compensate them for being associated with this trash.			"

You simply pick what classes you want and jump right into it - think final fantasy 1. It's got a goofy spin on it that I like: You are always playing from the game table even when fighting and can buy furniture, snacks, etc. for bonuses. You won't regret buying this game.

But, it's the same game (as far as i can tell), so it doesn't really matter - whatever suits you.In any case, it's a simple, well thought out, and fun game that was obviously made with care and love. That's not to say that there isn't some depth, but certainly anyone can play it and like it - on some level.Whatever the level of interest, it would be utterly unfair to slam a game like this. Any fair minded person would have to admit that it's quite good at what it's trying to do - excellent, in fact.I would also mention that the humor and inside jokes are amusing and add favorably to the experience.Recommended.

												I picked this game for the concept alone.  A game about characters playing a tabletop RPG.  While the premise sounds promising, it doesn't exactly follow that format which would have turned this game into a sim of sorts.  What it does present is an amusing Turn Based RPG game of the old days, from classics like Dragon Warrior to D&D.As someone who actually played D&D for a few years, this game was rather appealing.  Select your team of generic players and their class (and will wear a matching hat for said class) and start an adventure.  The game provides you what most RPG games tend to have: a sense of direction.  You're provided with the main storyline and a few side-quests to pick up some extra gold and exp.Be warned, this game has micro-transactions.  It is not a vital aspect of the game as you can earn gold by farming but it's only optional.  I personally do not approve of it but that should not stop other people from doing so.  Your money.If you are looking for a charming, turn-based RPG that is a bit out of the ordinary, check this title out.  I'm enjoying it so far.			"

												You can probably tell at a glance whether you will like this game. If you are a fan of the Pixel Art style and enjoy RPGs, then you will love Knights of Pen and Paper. Otherwise, move along. This game is quirky, entertaining, and more robust than a lot of people give it credit for. The last game I bought on Steam before Knights of Pen and Paper was Final Fantasy III, and I have to say, I actually think KoPaP has a better class system than FFIII. I certainly enjoyed it a lot more. There are six classes available at first, with another six that you can unlock for future playthroughs by completing side quests throughout the game. Each class has four abilities which you can upgrade over time as the character levels up. These abilities can either be passive (increasing attack power, critical chance, physical resistance, etc.) or active (dealing extra damage, buffing friendly units, etc.), and the variety of different classes and different abilities means that you can come up with different strategies and play styles on each and every playthrough.This game has a ton of replay value. Setting up a unique and balanced party is half the fun--the other half is learning how to make the most out of the combinations you choose. And since each of the twelve (or seventeen) playable characters has unique traits as well (such as extra experience, extra luck, or skill bonuses), this game provides way more variety between one playthrough and the next than you might think from the ""casual"" label the game has earned from a lot of people. Furthermore, KoPaP's gameplay successfully solves some of the problems inherent in turn-based RPGs--including Final Fantasy III. Turn order is determined at random at the start of every battle (bases on each character and enemy's Initiative stat), but it stays the same throughout the entire battle. Thus, the game allows you to strategize, knowing exactly which characters get to move when, but still introduces an element of randomness that makes every battle feel unique. Consecutive fights against the exact same enemies will play out differently and require slightly different strategies.Visually, KoPaP makes clever and effective use of the faux-8-bit style that's currently so popular in indie games. When characters from other Behold Studios games appear as part of certain quests, the humorously obvious contrast between the blocky KoPaP characters and the much higher-resolution guest characters serves to remind you that this game looks the way it does as a matter of choice--not of hardware or software limitations. The backgrounds in nearly every area you visit are loaded with minimalistically rendered pop culture references, from Lord of the Rings to Captain America. But these references get annoying quickly once they start working their way into the game's main plotlines. What is amusing as a background easter egg comes across as cheesy, clunky, and unfitting as a major foreground element. The game tries to spin these pop culture interpositions as an inside joke about how real-world RPG dungeon masters come up with their material, but the joke, in my opinion, falls flat. Therein lies one potential pitfall of the game: KoPaP derives most of its humor from stereotypes and inside jokes about real-world RPG players. Sometimes, the game strikes on some genuinely amusing and accessible ideas. All of the original twelve playable characters are pretty funny--from Hynx (the hardcore guy who came up with his own lame fantasy name) to Mr. John (the totally normal business man who plays in his scanty spare time) to Grandma (who doesn't know what's going on and wants everyone else to speak up). But after a few hours, you'll probably be pretty bored with characters complaining about stupid quests. Or asking for the hundredth time whether someone can order a pizza. Or worse, laughing at the game's own jokes. Self-congratulation is never funny or desirable in a video game.The game has other flaws as well. KoPaP was made by a Brazilian company, which is really cool. But the localization is really spotty, and--especially as you get closer to the end of the game--a lot of the dialogue is totally garbled and difficult to make out. Given how much of the humor and plot of this game depends on dialogue for delivery, that's a pretty serious problem. Also, outside of a single box of flavor text when you first create a character, none of the playable characters has any unique dialogue. Each character simply gets assigned different lines of text that are the exact same on every playthrough. And while it can be amusing to hear Grandma complain about why there aren't more hot girls in the game's quests, the canned dialogue gets old once you've already seen it once or twice. For the most part, the game does a good job ""scaling"" enemies so that you are always at an appropriate level to tackle  the main storyline quests. But towards the end of the game, more enemies gain powerful abilities that can make them much harder than their level suggests. You will face some frustrations from enemies that are pushovers in one battle and obliterate you in the next. The game also helpfully tells you approximately what level of enemies you will face in any specific quest. But there are a lot of mistakes--particularly on quests that have you going to multiple locations or that show up as a set--which can lead to you stumbling into difficult areas before you're ready (or abandoning a quest halfway through). Really, I can only see two truly ""casual"" elements to this game. First, you can save and quit at any point when you aren't fighting enemies. It's a nice touch, since it means you can play this game for five minutes or two hours. But, second, this game shows its ""casual"" nature in that you will probably start to get bored if you play for much more than an hour or an hour-and-a-half at once. For one thing, the game's story is pretty goofy and trivial--more entertaining than engrossing. And there are only so many variations on the ""go to X, battle Y"" formula that the game can throw you before it gets a little tiresome. Seriously. The gameplay in this game consists entirely of traveling to different areas and fighting different enemies. Of course, combat is fun and engaging, but the game is still better in small doses.If all that sounds appealing to you, then buy this game. I bought it on sale, and I have really enjoyed it. It's just fun!			"

												With a name light ""Knights of Pen and Paper"" and with a UI designed around the table top, I expected to have fun with this game. That was not the case.One of the big problems with this game right off the bat is that each character has only 5 things they can do. Each of them can attack and then each class has 4 upgradable abilities, but some of them are passive. The problem here is that with a small margin of exception, there's no strategy to the fights. You either hit attack or you use abilities until you run out of mana.The problem with the skills themselves is that the level scaling is frankly horrendous, so if you don't focus on one of the 4 skills, you'll quickly reach a point where you can't play the game anymore because you'll just get trounced during every encounter. This means that you really need 4 characters for each class by the end of the game because if you have a level 20 fire mage and you're up against fire resistant creatures, then you're probably going to get your party killed. Another problem I have is the grinding. For a game that's supposed to be just a short cute DnD knockoff, there is an obscene amount of grinding. Example: ""Collect 20 green apples"". Well, green apples only drop from venus fly traps that take off half your health per attack and killing one isn't a guarantee that they will drop. So to get 20 green apples, you'll probably end up playing 12 encoutners against 3 venus fly traps. And that's just the beggining. The upgrade system is also based on grinding. You need to visit special areas where upgrades can be found (usually caves) then you need to roll a 20 sided dice and hope you get lucky just for the chance of getting an upgrade item. Once you have about 5-10 upgrade items (for your first upgrade) you then take it to a blacksmith who gives you a %chance that your item will be upgraded or he'll just waste your upgrade items. You can upgrade the blacksmith himself so that you're more likely to succeed, but that requires double or even triple the number of upgrade items you already needed, so now you need go to back to grinding in the caves. Plus, each character has 2 items (clothes and weapon) and when you remember that you need multiples of each class, you understand that you'll need hundreds and hundreds of grindstones just for a chance of upgrading your party. You'd think you could just ignore the upgrading, but because the level scaling is so unbalanced, you have to upgrade to proceed. Its just an awful time waster with no sense of progression and I'm glad I bought it on sale because this is literally a ported mobile game.			"

												It was cute and clever and all. Fun for the first ten levels.And then everything gets grindy. Like, really grindy.There are, maybe 6, 7 classes all with 4 skills each (some are randomly passive, too). So it turns into a lot of grinding and not enough variety. Which might be good for them because they used to have microtransactions for gold. They might still have that option on the mobile version, too.There was also confusion because Steam will give you an acess code and tell you that the program will possibly need it. On the main menu of the game you will also see an option for inputting such a code. However, no matter how many times you try, the code Steam gives you is not the code needed to unlock the game, the game is activated upon perchase. What you are supposed to use with the code Steam gives you is registering for the game dev/publishers' website forms...ops. And the option to input a key is extra content that was given out during an event. So...yeah...thanks for the absence of an explaination, guys.So all in all, Good on the art, good on the humor, not so good on the gameplay.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper is a turn based RPG game that's pretty simple. Each character has four skills, you unlock more characters as you go, and you can pick a party of five and buy upgrades and stuff.The humor in it is pretty cheesey, so can be enjoyable if you like that sort of thing.Achievements are all very obtainable, although they will take you two playthroughs to get them all.First playthrough took me about 14 hours to beat everything, will probably take 8-10 if you dont. Overall spent 24 hours total to 100% the game and get every achievement. Was fun doing so. Expect to get 10 hours from this game without 100%, 20 hours with 100%			"

Damn it, I was actually right there, and this is a game that while hugely ""simple"" in design and all that, totally draws me in.  No idea why.  But as a ""not a gamer"" the having played over 13 hours of the game, and being actively avoiding it, in about a month is really a huge plus for the game.

												If you're looking for a quirky, fun RPG that simulates the basics of a game of Dungeons and Dragons, then this game is worth trying out. You are given a selection of players with different passive abilities, and are able to invite them to your game as the class of your choice. New players and classes can be rotated in, and you have control over everyone's skills, equipment upgrades and accessories, but not their base stats. You are able to switch Dungeon Masters, furniture, and table items that add bonuses to your game, as well as purchase perishable food items which give temporary bonuses to players.Fully upgrading your equipment and game room does require grinding for experience and gold, and the game is plagued by seemingly random difficulty jumps as the recommended levels for quests start to outpace your characters' growth even if you complete the optional quest lines. Despite this, the game is still quite enjoyable and charming, as long as you have a soft spot for old school RPGs. However those looking for a compelling narrative are going to be disappointed, as the game's dialogue is riddled with generic stereotypes and frequent grammar mistakes.So if you're looking for a traditional turn-based RPG with some D&D flair to spend hours slaughtering monsters and levelling up your characters, then this is your game. If that sounds boring and repetitive to you, or if you require an epic story and interesting characters, then you may want to pass on this one.			"

												Knights of pen and paper is a decent game for passing the time. For a ten dollar game, you get a cute little game full of references of both dnd and pop cultural stuff.Gameplay's can get tedious, the music getting rather grating after a while since it has a one 30 second music loop for a fight. It's definitly not a game for extended play.You're better off having a small party, around 3 people or so. Having 4-5 people in your party really punishes your leveling leading to a lot more grinding to keep up with the game's quick level pace.The game has microtransactions, though it's really bizarre why they decided to. You can buy gold for real money but I never really found myself short on money in the game for what I wanted to do.6.5/10			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition is a turn based RPG game set in a scenario that is a, well, table top pen and paper game, the game starts out with you choosing two starting party members from a specific selection of characters and classes, for example, a jock and a warrior, each character having their own little passive buffs, such as the Jock having a +1 to attack.Whilst the concept is nice, the gameplay tried and true, and characters, classes, and enemies all nicely diverse, and the quests a bit repetetive, you might begin to become a bit tired of doing the typical selection of escort, kill set number of enemies, or rescue quests, that is, only if you're not a fan of games such as this.Overall, the game is a fun one, with a humorous setting and story, I highly reccomend it if you're a fan of turn based RPGs, or RPGs in general, and even more so if you enjoy humorous games.

												The first thing that really impressed me about KoPaP+1, is that it recognised my eyefinity multi-monitor setup without skipping a beat and started in native resolution on my central (designated no. 1) monitor. The second is the pixel art, which is sumptious and extremely well done.This is a light and amusing game, paying homage to tabletop RPGs and early 90s cRPGs. If you have reservations in respect of the gold buying facility which is apparently a feature of the tablet versions, it is disabled in the PC version. At first I found the concept a little too meta and self-referential, but the humour grew on me to the point where I found myself laughing and recalling real pen and paper sessions where the GM and players said almost exactly the same things the characters in game were saying.If you are trying for full completion of achievements, keep in mind that your gold is common between all your saved games, so you can accumulate a good amount of reserves to equip the uber party you create for the 365/465 day completion achieve. This is probably the most elusive while the similarly rare 50 dungeon complete achieve requires no particular strategy except an appetite for doing the same thing over and over again. I've found resetting or upgrading a party which has completed the game and replaying the content at a higher level to be the best way of accumulating gold for such an attempt.Wait for a decent sale price and you will get at least 25hrs of entertainment for a reasonable sum.

												Knights of Pen and Paper has its charm, albeit it is not well-maintained throughout the game. The dialogues are funny, the characters and classes available for selection are varied, and its simple UI design makes it easy to get into. There are many features you can play around with, like the ability to decorate your room with items that grant bonuses to stats, and trying out different party setups after you've unlocked new classes and players. You also get to pick and choose which quests to do. The experience you receive from completing quests is also scaled according to your levels, so doing the lower level ones that you missed won't be a complete waste of your time when you're level grinding.On the minus side, the quests are fairly uninspired and they get repetitive. The battles eventually suffer from the same flaw as well. I only did the storyline quests and the ones that unlocked new classes. The story itself is also quite weak. There's nothing compelling or awe-inspiring to it. Having a great story is certainly not one of this game's selling points. Despite all the shortfalls, Knights of Pen and Paper can still keep you entertained for hours until the repetitiveness catches up and playing the game becomes more like a chore, where you're still playing because you haven't unlocked the other achievements yet.

												It is very good game for its price, cannot ask more!This game took traditional methods of classic table top Dungeon and Dragon (DnD) RPG with modern turn based approach. Just imagine playing Pokemon with DnD approach. The storyline is pretty much linear in my opinion, but I really like the writtings. Jokes and some references are pretty on point in this game (although not in Borderlands level). The sounds are mediocre, neither good or bad, it just suit the game. The pixel arts are pretty and fit with the game theme. Overall, is not a big RPG game like Earthbound or classic Final Fantasy, however this game offers compact gameplay and without hassle. I play this game in the mean time everytime I get bored with studying or programming for ~30 minutes. Definitely a worth game to play!			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper is a throwback to old school table top rpg's.  At least it presents it self that way.  You have a dungeon master that sits at a table along with your party.  He tells a story and provides quests for you to do.  It's a pretty easy game and fun too.  You can determine how the game is played.  You want to just solo it, bring 5 different classes along, fight just 1 monster or 7.. it's your call.All in all if you dig the graphics and of course like rpg's this game is a definite play through.

												I have played and finished this game and it's lovely. If you have played some dungeon&dragons-like games in the past, it will bring fond memories. Some of the phrases and quips of the characters are spot on, and it all brings you back to that D&D atmosphere very well.The game principles are quite simple, there is a number of characters, each character has 4 skills, you can loot or buy wearable items and consumables, you can upgrade your weapons. Battles are turn-based, one action per turn. Simple, but also enjoyable and sufficient to help you enjoy yet another D&D adventure.The questing is well done, there is a main story line, but in any place you have a set of pre-created generic side quests that you can activate at any moment in order to gain more experience or items. You can also set up a custom fight any time. When setting up a fight, you choose how many and which creatures you're going to fight with, and the reward reflects that. I very much like this approach.There are a few dungeons in the game, which force you to stock up some healing items in the inventory if you want to explore it all, survive, and kill the boss. Again, similar to the D&D theme.There is good humor in the game, I liked it. After some hours it gets a bit repetitive, but it doesn't hold you up. The music is a bit more of a problem, there are just a few songs in the game, so it gets old quickly. A few more songs would be nice.Please note I've played this game on an Android tablet, not a PC, so I'm seeing this in a bit different perspective. The greatest benefit of this game for me was that it is an enjoyable game that can easily be played in a public transport during commuting, therefore offline and turn-based. This is an ideal game for your phone or tablet. If you intend to play this on PC, you might expect a bit more complex game mechanics, because you're fully concentrated on the game and you have a big screen. In that case, my opinion might not apply that well.Highly recommended, especially if you plan to play this on a mobile device (not the Steam version, though, of course).			"

												TRPG translated into a computer game! If you are a D&D fan you will enjoy this for quite some time. Grinding starts at around lv 10 which is bad. I recommend this nonetheless.Don't forget to check out the android version if you obtained this game from humble bundles. This game is more suitable for mobile phones than desktop.			"

												The game is good and has a nice variety. It's certainly simple, but it has a short-term, addictive charm.The biggest problem by far is that it crashes far too often. I have two different PCs, both easily capable of playing a game like this, and the game has crashed well over a dozen times. The fact that the game doesn't have a save function unless you [save & quit] also makes it frustrating when you lose a lot of progress.With this bug, as of 5/22/14, I can't recommend it.			"

												This is a GREAT game! But thats only my opinion and because it was what I was looking for at this time in a game. Its funny. Its simpull. You can put it down and come back to it and not worry about forgetting anything or what to do. Its not graphics hungry so it can play on any michine. Its retro and brings back alot of memories for me of actually playing the game of pen and paper D&D. The humor is funny. And its cheap. Worth every cent.  Like my positive review all the negitive ones are only opinions of people who didn't look into what this game really was. Read them. there is nothing wrong with this game. Its got a great developer. And is already making a second game.  The only thing I would ask of the developer would be more dlc. That and a way to create your own caractor and even give the origianl caractors new names.EDIT! As of this time I can not recommed this game. After playing 30 hrs and rasing my characters to lvl 35+ an automatic update was applied and my saved game was wiped out! So far there has been no response from the company. I'm not sure I want to sink that kind of time back into this game. I guess it will all depend on how the company handles it and all of the upset players.  If they do well I will once again change my review back to positive.EDIT 2 !Company tried to fix problem with a Master Save. It was a very poor fix. As of right now I will not be playing this game any more or buying the new game. I will keep an eye on the forms to see if they lisen and try again.			"

												This is a fun and funny rpg that is loaded with parodies and references. I have only played the game for a couple of days, but loss of save files seems to be a persistent problem. An update definitely cause a loss of save, but my save file was again lost several hours later. The story and progress of the game are consequential enough that a save loss is significant. This game is not worth playing with a broken save system.EDIT: After making an account with Paradox Interactive, cloud saving does work. If you do not want to have to make an account, don't buy it. It is a game worth playing, but without a local save or even a Steam cloud save, I would say that the save system is poorly implemented.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper is a turn based RPG game that's pretty simple. Each character has four skills, you unlock more characters as you go, and you can pick a party of five and buy upgrades and stuff.The humor in it is pretty cheesey, so can be enjoyable if you like that sort of thing.Achievements are all very obtainable, although they will take you two playthroughs to get them all.First playthrough took me about 14 hours to beat everything, will probably take 8-10 if you dont. Overall spent 24 hours total to 100% the game and get every achievement. Was fun doing so. Expect to get 10 hours from this game without 100%, 20 hours with 100%			"

												My first impression was really good. Nice style, humor, cool idea overall. Not only you choose your classes, but also the ""people"" who play them.Sadly, after an hour or so of gameplay, it gets too grindy. It turns into a lot of very similar encounters without enough depth to them. Also the music gets really repetitive... The mobile roots can be noticed...I'd like to recommend this game, because the idea seems to have a great potential. However, it's just not fun for me after a couple hours, and still a long time before the end. I'd love to see a sequel with less grindy fights and more gameplay apart from combat. "

												Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition is a turn based RPG game set in a scenario that is a, well, table top pen and paper game, the game starts out with you choosing two starting party members from a specific selection of characters and classes, for example, a jock and a warrior, each character having their own little passive buffs, such as the Jock having a +1 to attack.Whilst the concept is nice, the gameplay tried and true, and characters, classes, and enemies all nicely diverse, and the quests a bit repetetive, you might begin to become a bit tired of doing the typical selection of escort, kill set number of enemies, or rescue quests, that is, only if you're not a fan of games such as this.Overall, the game is a fun one, with a humorous setting and story, I highly reccomend it if you're a fan of turn based RPGs, or RPGs in general, and even more so if you enjoy humorous games.

												Knights of Pen and Paper has its charm, albeit it is not well-maintained throughout the game. The dialogues are funny, the characters and classes available for selection are varied, and its simple UI design makes it easy to get into. There are many features you can play around with, like the ability to decorate your room with items that grant bonuses to stats, and trying out different party setups after you've unlocked new classes and players. You also get to pick and choose which quests to do. The experience you receive from completing quests is also scaled according to your levels, so doing the lower level ones that you missed won't be a complete waste of your time when you're level grinding.On the minus side, the quests are fairly uninspired and they get repetitive. The battles eventually suffer from the same flaw as well. I only did the storyline quests and the ones that unlocked new classes. The story itself is also quite weak. There's nothing compelling or awe-inspiring to it. Having a great story is certainly not one of this game's selling points. Despite all the shortfalls, Knights of Pen and Paper can still keep you entertained for hours until the repetitiveness catches up and playing the game becomes more like a chore, where you're still playing because you haven't unlocked the other achievements yet.

												As far as turn based adventures go, this one is one of the most creative I've played. Simple battle style, but plenty of mobs and heroes to choose from and lots to explore.

It's not meant to be taken seriously like a lot of fantasy turn-based strategy, which is what makes it so spectacular.			"

												Paradox Interactive and Behold Studios have created a labor of love with this little game.  This retro style RPG does an amazing job at bringing both the experience of a DnD session and a 90's style JRPG to you with plenty of toungue-in-cheek, modern humor to liven things up.  The classes are all very interesting and provide you with many unique ways to play their skills off of each other.  Battles are quickly paced and fairly designed; if you lose it's your fault.  If I had any critisism at it would be that the game is easier than it should be.  Granted, I grew up in the 90's so I'm a grizzled, RPG veteren at this point but I would still say a small difficulty spike would have raised this game to even greater heights.  If you have even a smidge of love for Pen and Paper style role play this game is a must purchase.			"

												I think I've played this game enough to give a basic review on the aspects of the game. Now, I'm going to go ahead and say that I like the style of this game, so I may be a bit biased. However, that does not matter as I will still be honest with this game.My reviews are typically divided into parts. Story, Gameplay, Music/Sounds, and Graphics. So let's get started!Graphics:I decided to start with graphics as they are the LEAST important when it comes to this review. This game is featured in 16 bit (I think) and looks quite good. In fact, you basically don't notice how old the graphics look after a while.Story:The story of this game is very simple. You are a adventurer. More specifically, you are a D&D player playing a character. You get to create your characters in this game, so you can mix and match until you find the ultimate party! You start with only two members at your table. However, you can pay gold to add three more party members. Each class has a different role. Paladin is the tank. Cleric is the healer. Mage is the support/dps and rogue is the 100% pure blood DPS. After you select your party members and their roles, you start by having your DM tell you that you are in a dark dungeon with no recollection of what happened to you previously. Now, I really don't want to spoil anymore, as fans of D&D (myself included) will have a very fun time with this game.Gameplay:This game features a turn-based system using ""initiative"", a real D&D mechanic. Initiative is rolled to see who gets to attack first. Say your character and an ogre were about to have a fight. Your character rolls a 15. The ogre rolls a 9. Therefore, you would get to go first, as you have the higher number. Not only is this game ROLLING in D&D references, it has it's own unique style. Locations are intresting, characters are hilarious and dialogue kept me laughing the entire time. For example, early in the game you have to kill some rats. The DM says a girl walks up to the party. One of your party members will ask, ""Is she hot?"" and your DM replies, ""Fine. Her charisma is 19."" See what I'm saying? So many tabletop references! I guess that's expected. You can upgrade your characters stats using ""table items"" like food or drinks. There are permanent table items, including a BK crown (which allows you to fight 7 monsters at once) and the Holy Grail (which allows you to have 5 members at your table). There are also ""room upgrades"". For example, on the left side of your room, you can have a suit of armor, which gives you +20 health on every character until you change it. On the right side, you can have a fridge, which makes your table items last longer. You can change your tables too. The gold table gives you more gold. The rock table gives you a larger crit chance. This game is full of customization!Music/Sounds:Music and sounds are, like the graphics, designed in a 16 bit fashion, delivering some tunes I've been humming since the day I got the game. The title screen is my personal favorite though!                                                                           OVERALL RATING:This game is a fantastic game with a lot of comedy. Over all I'd give Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition a 10/10 for it's effort to contribute to the D&D society and give you some good laughs along the way!Conclusion:I hope you enjoyed my review of Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition! The DLC for the game, Haunted Fall, is out now! I will be reviewing it once I get the chance to play the DLC! Cya next time folks!			"

												Interesting in the beginning and it does offer a lot of variation, but personally I would not play it again - the fights get boring very soon. Story seems OK. I like the transition between D&D fantasy world and real world of players behind the table. Some parts are hilarious and add flavour to the game. The crafting system IS HARD AS HELL and can make you ragequit.Although as a game for mobile phones this is very neat and reminds me of old Pokemon Gold I used to play.			"

												If you have EVER played a tabletop RPG (Dungeons and Dragons, GURPS, anything by White Wolf; or for that matter, anything where dice, paper and your imagination are required) you will be familiar with how this game operates.  Folks are around the table, One leads them in thier adventure and (sort of) asks them what they feel like doing.  The crazy part about this RPG, is that the DM and Characters are sitting around thier table as they go about thier adventure.Then, introduce EVERY NERD TROPE YOU CAN THINK OF.  Seriously, ALL OF THEM.  I saw a Tardis, Stargate and a Pyramid all in the same background.  Nothing is sacred and nothing is safe, and for that reason the game is a BLAST.			"

However, it's just not fun for me after a couple hours, and still a long time before the end. I'd love to see a sequel with less grindy fights and more gameplay apart from combat. "

												Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition is a turn based RPG game set in a scenario that is a, well, table top pen and paper game, the game starts out with you choosing two starting party members from a specific selection of characters and classes, for example, a jock and a warrior, each character having their own little passive buffs, such as the Jock having a +1 to attack.Whilst the concept is nice, the gameplay tried and true, and characters, classes, and enemies all nicely diverse, and the quests a bit repetetive, you might begin to become a bit tired of doing the typical selection of escort, kill set number of enemies, or rescue quests, that is, only if you're not a fan of games such as this.Overall, the game is a fun one, with a humorous setting and story, I highly reccomend it if you're a fan of turn based RPGs, or RPGs in general, and even more so if you enjoy humorous games.

												This game is great for a light hearted RPG. I started playing on my mobile while commuting on the train, then upgraded to my laptop for a transatlantic flight. The game can be beat leisurely in a few days, and is never frustratingly difficult. There is a certain quantity of grinding required as in most RPGs, but the true ""need"" to grind is pretty low. Money and XP are attainable, unlockable classes are fun, and the story is lightheartedly entertaining. I certainly recommend giving the game a chance if you want a light spin on the simulated DnD tabletop style RPG.			"

												The main knock against this game is the grind that ruins the entire experience. The whole game seems like it's built to try to get you to buy gold for real money with micro-transactions. Everything from the meager drops from enemies to the fact that you have to pay gold to upgrade the blacksmith to the fact that upgrading weapons and armor always has a failure chance requiring you to spend even more gold. Even the in-game methods of boosting your gold gain almost always come at the expense of experience which in turn prevents you from mitigating the one thing that you're most likely trying to escape from: the grind. The whole time I was playing this I could feel it reaching for my wallet... in spite of the fact that this feature has apparently been removed from the game.And this is really a shame because it's not a bad game in any other aspect. The combat is the core of the game and, while basic, it's pretty solid. I never found myself feeling overpowered or like there was no aspect of challenge to it; nor did I ever feel like the game had pushed me into a corner where I was helpless. Even though you have very few abilities to choose from, there is depth and strategy in how they're use. The pixel-art backgrounds are good and contain a lot of cool references. It's kinda cool and chilling when you go to an area to level-grind and notice after an hour that slenderman has been standing there the whole time. I personally found the humor a bit flat and irreverent... though also occasionally spot-on speaking as someone who's played the tabletop RPGs this game is supposedly an homage to.Bottom line: If you like level grinding or have a high enough tolerance for it to see the rest of the experience though then this is the game for you. For me, I've found the game too tedious to play at length and it's not worth spending hours farming gold for the meager amounts of story and the occasional chuckle. Maybe it gets better later on, but it doesn't feel worth it to me to spend the time slogging through it.And for anyone who says ""This is SOOOoo much like D&D""... no, it's not. At least, not if you have a good DM it isn't. ;)			"

												If you like turn-based RPG's and have fond memories of pen and paper roleplaying sessions with your friends: you're going to love this game. I'm not a big fan of the recent trend for retro pixel aesthetics, but this game suits that genre.If this game had been released in the late 80's, it would have been one of those legendary classics. I think it's better than the original Final Fantasy games because it doesn't take itself seriously (it doesn't flood you with a convoluted story) and the difficulty curve is fair (it doesn't destroy you within minutes of starting).

I beat every quest up until the boss, my characters are level 40 with maxed equipment. The boss one shots 3/5 of my party and then kills the other 2 on the next turn. The game was a decent rpg up until this point and sadly this ruined the whole experience for me.			"

												8.5/10 - An RPG focused on battlesThis is an interesting twist to the RPG genre: Battles similar to an RPG maker, but with a little more freedom. There is no exploration, just a map view, battles and quests. You can dictate the number of enemies you face and build a team up to (5) players.You can choose from 12 different classes which I found Rogue to be the most helpful(out of the starting classes)The game is ultra-focused on the combat but I still found it enjoyable but after about 4 hours of playing none stop you can get bored beware XD . I personally wouldn't pay full price for this game because its a bit short  but on sale it's worth the pick-up.Oh yeah almost forgot get the deluxe edition because it will be cheaper than buying the dlc separetly.

												Knights of Pen and Paper allows me to do something that I've always wanted to do in a fantasy setting.  I am able to control a few characters on one table with clear cut differences between them.  It is simple enough for almost anyone to understand, and it is a pretty good game to play if you like indie, small time games.  It has a lot of exploration that I haven't done.  Even though you repeat quests a lot, the quests are different every time with different people.The basis of the game is that you are playing against whatever the DM throws at you.  You are at your table, with your players and your classes they each encapsulate.  The classes are basic (Mage, Druid, Rogue, Warrior, Cleric, etc.) and the players themselves each have a special characteristic about them (the Jock has +? HP, the Alien regenrates +1 MP every turn, etc.).  It  Buying objects for the DM room, table, general location allows the players to get better points, experience, health, etc.  So instead of buffing singular characters, you are buffing all characters.  It's a fun game ultimately, and one that I will play frequently.If you don't like pixelated gfxs, or table top scenarios at all, this might not be your cup of tea.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper +1 is a “roleplaying game”, but in truth it has very little roleplaying in it; while this is common to many “RPGs,” this game takes it to an all-new level. The conceit behind the game is that you are sitting at a table with your game master with a group of friends, and that you are going through a campaign. The players are indeed all seated around a table, with the game master on the far side of the table dictating what is going on. It is a very clever idea, but unfortunately the game fails to execute on it at all; instead, the game is a pure hack-and-slash fest which tries to spice things up with humor and gaming references but falls flat because, quite frankly, everyone sitting around a table has already not only made all of these references, but done it better. The plot is every bad game of D&D you've ever played, every unoriginal campaign rolled into one, and it is played straight - sure, one could argue that it is almost comically bad, but it is painfully bad, like Batman and Robin, rather than camp.	As the gameplay itself is thoroughly hack and slash, purely about cutting your way through an extremely large number of monsters using extremely simplistic turn-based combat reminiscent of many JRPGs, with no real coherent or interesting story to speak of, there is little to recommend this game as anything but a time waster, and even there, you can do far better. There's nothing that this game doesn't show you in the first hour, and there's nothing in that first hour worth taking. While the basic underlying idea of having a bunch of players playing a roleplaying game is an interesting one, this game is a total failure at it. Maybe someday, someone will take this idea and do something good with it, but this is not that game.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper is an awesome game. It was so much more than I expected it to be. It gives you a totally unique gaming experience.Pros:- Play time (especially compared to price)- Customisability of the Experience (tactic, characters, path you take)- Lots of Humor- Story- Balanced Gameplay- Cute GraphicsCons:- Some grinding is includedI would give it a total score of 9/10.

												This game is somewhat casual and is, perhaps, a bit better suited for moble devices. I've played it on my tablet much more than on this format. But, it's the same game (as far as i can tell), so it doesn't really matter - whatever suits you.In any case, it's a simple, well thought out, and fun game that was obviously made with care and love. That's not to say that there isn't some depth, but certainly anyone can play it and like it - on some level.Whatever the level of interest, it would be utterly unfair to slam a game like this. Any fair minded person would have to admit that it's quite good at what it's trying to do - excellent, in fact.I would also mention that the humor and inside jokes are amusing and add favorably to the experience.Recommended.

												Lengthy RPG with no relationship to anything that makes tabletop gaming good (freedom of choice, drama, reactivity) which tries to sell itself by blandly satirising outdated stereotypes of PnP RPG hobby with all the scathing wit of a Half-Orc Barbarian. Tedious to play and seldom funny. "

												The game supposedly is a take on table top rpg, but takes all the fun out of it and fills the void with souless grinding. The mechanics are extremely simplistic and imbalanced (very little choice in levelling your characters, and the rogue will do most of the team damage while the paladin will show epic useleness). I don't think there is a scenario to criticize. And the humour ""look, we put a reference to a game you know!"" is not quite enough for me. Overall, prepare to be bored to death.			"

Most of the other characters are similar, though most have at least two good abilities. The only real way to do well is to grind like hell. 4/10			"

												I came into this game with relatively low expectations, and I am glad to say that KoPaP didn't disappoint.There's plenty of replayability and the in-jokes here and there are appreciated, but what really pulls it together is that it's actually a pretty good representation of (albeit loosely) a tabletop RPG. There's not a ton of grinding involved, but when there /is/ grinding needed, you definitely feel it. That was probably the lowest point of the game that I experienced, and even then I kept going because there was still something waiting to be explored.All in all, a very good game with a lot of untapped potential.

												Note that I write this review after i get the 100% completion, so the game is around 33.5 hours.Knight of Pen and Paper is actually just a role playing game. By ""role playing game"", i didn't mean those RPG games when you fight monsters and explore lots of places. By ""role playing game"", I meant the more traditional RPG, when you act as a character, imagining that you are in a different place, and do whatever you want. There are battles, of course, as it's crucial to this game.The first thing from this game that catches my eye is the art. I am a fond of pixel graphics games, and this one satisfy me. The pixels are made in a great detail. All of the assets are great looking, and the most important thing, there is no ""recolored"" monster at all (or i just didn't notice it), and fyi, there are tons of area to explore in this game, with different environments and monsters in most area. The music itself accompanies so well with the art, and i am never bored to listen it for long.There are tons of characters that you can choose, and tons of classes to play with, creating a party for up to 5 people, Each character has their own advantages, and each class has their own roles (dps, support, healer, tanker). You can costumize each class to your own preference because their skills can be raised with skill point which is gained every level ups. Because of this, choosing your party member can be crucial, because you can finish the game quickly or slowly depends on your setup. Also, some classes and characters need to be unlocked first, which limits your choice even more on your first playthrough. If you want to do a 100% completion, i advise you to make multiple saves, because the gold carries on each save. You can have up to 3 save slots, and although the gold is carried between saves, the accessories, equipments and levels are not.As for the battles, it's quite easy on the first part, and it becomes tougher and longer later on. You might need to grind a little or a lot depends on your setup, so make sure you get it right. Accessories also matters, because you can boost your characters quite well if you choose the right one. You can't really choose your equipments, but you can upgrade it with a success chance (well, don't worry because you can boost the chance to 100% if you have the money).Pros:- Tons of characters- Tons of classes- Tons of battles- Almost none random encounters; you can set up your own battle- Tons of maps- Tons of stories and questsCons:- Long battles- Tons of grindingShould you buy this game?If you love to grind and doesn't mind with the long battles, buy it.If you don't, then don't because it can be frustating.

												This is a great game all the way up until the end. Unfortunately the end is grind, grind and grind. I did every location 100% but had to start with recommended lvl40 fights when I was about lvl 33-34. When I was done with those I was around lvl39. And then the next quest is ""kill the bad guy in this dungeon"". I couldn't make it to the the boss because the boss lvl was 65. I realized that i would take hours of grind, and simply decided it wasn't worth it. I still got a great 17h from this game, so I'm still recommending it. Just wanted people to have a heads up. This game also doesn't babysit you with how you do things, most things you figure out by simply playing. Other than that this game had charming graphics, lots o references for the 90' kids. They offer a decent selection of classes to start with, but as you play this game you unlock more, up to 12 classes and 17 characters. all and all a great game but with, in my eyes one big flaw. 6/10			"

												8.5/10 - An RPG focused on battlesThis is an interesting twist to the RPG genre: Battles similar to an RPG maker, but with a little more freedom. There is no exploration, just a map view, battles and quests. You can dictate the number of enemies you face and build a team up to (5) players.You can choose from 12 different classes which I found Rogue to be the most helpful(out of the starting classes)The game is ultra-focused on the combat but I still found it enjoyable but after about 4 hours of playing none stop you can get bored beware XD . I personally wouldn't pay full price for this game because its a bit short  but on sale it's worth the pick-up.Oh yeah almost forgot get the deluxe edition because it will be cheaper than buying the dlc separetly.

You control a DM and players as you embark on a traditional adventure for glory (and xp and gold and loot).There are plenty of sidequests to give you a break from the main quest if you desire and you can even just sit and farm monsters if you prefer.The writing is funny and drops plenty of references.  It can be a little rough at times, as though it was translated or written by a non-native speaker.However, if you have a tabletop itch to scratch, this will surely satisfy.			"

All of the assets are great looking, and the most important thing, there is no ""recolored"" monster at all (or i just didn't notice it), and fyi, there are tons of area to explore in this game, with different environments and monsters in most area. The music itself accompanies so well with the art, and i am never bored to listen it for long.There are tons of characters that you can choose, and tons of classes to play with, creating a party for up to 5 people, Each character has their own advantages, and each class has their own roles (dps, support, healer, tanker). You can costumize each class to your own preference because their skills can be raised with skill point which is gained every level ups. Because of this, choosing your party member can be crucial, because you can finish the game quickly or slowly depends on your setup. Also, some classes and characters need to be unlocked first, which limits your choice even more on your first playthrough. If you want to do a 100% completion, i advise you to make multiple saves, because the gold carries on each save. You can have up to 3 save slots, and although the gold is carried between saves, the accessories, equipments and levels are not.As for the battles, it's quite easy on the first part, and it becomes tougher and longer later on. You might need to grind a little or a lot depends on your setup, so make sure you get it right. Accessories also matters, because you can boost your characters quite well if you choose the right one. You can't really choose your equipments, but you can upgrade it with a success chance (well, don't worry because you can boost the chance to 100% if you have the money).Pros:- Tons of characters- Tons of classes- Tons of battles- Almost none random encounters; you can set up your own battle- Tons of maps- Tons of stories and questsCons:- Long battles- Tons of grindingShould you buy this game?If you love to grind and doesn't mind with the long battles, buy it.If you don't, then don't because it can be frustating.

												The Definition of RepetitiveKnights of Pen & Paper has a nice theme going for it.  You are a bunch of people sitting down for a game of D&D.  Unfortunately, you have a terrible DM who fills the game with references and memes and little else.  It makes the story not only irrelevant, but obnoxious.  As an example, Nabe Gewell tasks you to get a crowbar because reasons.Moving into how the game plays, you start off being able to select a few characters and classes for you to control; more get unlocked later in the game.  Each character has their own ability and every class gets four abilities, some active, some passive.  You only get one free character to make but you can spend gold to get the full party of five.  It is recommended you do this as soon as possible since you always start at level 1, forcing a grind for them to catch up since they will easily die and dead characters gain no experience.This is where the whole repetition comes into play.  You go to an area around your level (moving areas involves clicking the area; that is it), select how many and what monsters to fight and go at it.  There are quests to complete but they are almost all kill X things or collect X things from monsters.  The rest are escorts that force a battle on every move you make, even if you vastly outlevel the area.  This is what you spend the entire game doing, even for the main quest.Good combat could have salvaged this but it is very basic.  Everyone gets a turn order slightly modified by your initiative and you end up spamming one ability per character until victory.  It is barely above the original Dragon Quest in how things operate.Even after all this, there are further glitches and issues the game has.  The quests all have levels so you can tell when they should be done, except there are several that require you kill things greatly higher than the quest level suggests.  Sometimes the quest level will even jump mid-quests, forcing you to abandon it and redo the parts you already did later.  I had level 6 quests task me going into a level 20 area as well as a level 40 area.While minor, even leveling up your own skills are slightly glitched.  I noticed several times where the game claimed leveling up a skill would give it four damage only for it to get three.  It gets even worse any time decimals are used where the game seems to forget about them in later skill ups.Knights of Pen & Paper had potential but it was ruined with its tedium and nonsense.			"

												I came into this game with relatively low expectations, and I am glad to say that KoPaP didn't disappoint.There's plenty of replayability and the in-jokes here and there are appreciated, but what really pulls it together is that it's actually a pretty good representation of (albeit loosely) a tabletop RPG. There's not a ton of grinding involved, but when there /is/ grinding needed, you definitely feel it. That was probably the lowest point of the game that I experienced, and even then I kept going because there was still something waiting to be explored.All in all, a very good game with a lot of untapped potential.

												A game that obliterates your grasp of time.  This game should not be initiated late in the evening as you will almost always find yourself still playing by one in the morning.  New players begin with five seats, but can only afford to fill two of them at first.  Choose carefully which skills your heroes will specialize in, don't make jack-of-all-trades; because even though you can 'usually' controll the strength of the mob parties you will fight, you can't afford to be unspecialized.   I'm loving this game so much I can barely elequate.Humor:  Casual, but usually satisfactory, 8-bit cliches and DM wit, 7/10Music: Fits the game, it's 8-bit rpg themes, what is there to say?  6/10Controls: Smoothe as giant moth fur.  In combat, whoevers turn it is, no need to click 'attack' and then select which enemy to attack, just click the enemy and, wham, a virtual 'rush' mechanic for mopping up weaker mobs.  The world map could've been given a bit more compensation room at the fringes because you click and drag the map to move it around and some locations ARE right at the edges, just a minor irritation there, could've been fixed with the ability to zoom out, but they didn't include that.  There were other things, but overall, deserves a 9/10Visuals: In an 8-bit tabletop rpg sim, all you can ask for is a great color pallete, and it's in there.  8/10This game is virtually always in Ironman mode, constantly autosaving, so even if you hit esc enough times to terminate the game, no need to freak for your progress' sake :)That's enough from me, enjoy, my comerade gamers, *drops the mic*			"

												I wish there was a 'mixed' review option. Or a 'meh' one. Overall the game is pretty alright (albeit a bit repetitive), but considering that and the fact that a number of achievements are bugged, I'm definitely leaning more towards negative. For example, I didn't get the one for having a party member reach level 15, and the one for getting all masters shows no progress despite having quite a few. And then there's the level 30 one that so many people have problems with.  I can't honestly recommend this game. It's been out for 2 years and I feel like those problems would be resolved by now. Maybe if the developers fixed all of that I might change my mind.			"

												First Off, This is one of the games I never thought I would enjoy, then 20 hours in, I'm still enjoying it!Pros : Very User friendly, easy to learn the mechanicsGood Leveling System, if you follow the storyline and do quests, you will level up without too much grinding.Multiple Upgrades and perks, Mixing the old with the new with multiple upgrades with equipment, items, and char perksCons: Small Map, though the gameplay is pretty good with the map, for the price you pay, i expected more than 32 locationsMore upgrades is possible, I believe there can be more upgrades avaliable to help with later gameplay.Overall:If you like 90's games with simplistic designs and gameplay fitted for modern times, this game is made for you.  I wouldn't say it is made for the modern taste of how RPGS are like but it's still amazing. Recommendation to Creators:I know that there is a second game that is out, But i really wish for this game to have editor edition for players who wish to create their own rpg, storyline, and quests. I am willing to pay for something like that !			"

Add to that the humor(ie  little quips between players and the DM, parody of movies, cameos, etc), the broadrange of customable settings and characters and the general light hearted fun factor and it makes for an enjoyable title.  Though as the game continues it does get rather grindy and repetitive; my suggestion would be to play this one in short bursts with breaks inbetween to keep it fresh.  7/10			"

												I have played this game for under an hour and I can already recommend it for those, who likes games that are easy to go to and from. Quests are quickly finished and you can basically leave game anytime. A big fan of the DnD vibe and how you set the difficulty by your own doings. You want harder battles? Fight stronger monsters. Want tougher quests? Go to a higher level place. It's easy to understand, even for people who doesn't have english as their first language.It might start out confusing for people who aren't familiar with the DnD system, but it is so easily learned.For now, I have no cons. Maybe the soundtrack could be more colourful but I think it is fitting as it is. The art style is cute and characters have funny comments up their sleeve to keep you intertained. DM is wellspoken too!I can't wait to get deeper into this game and explore more of its somewhat troubled world.Definitely worth my money!			"

Do go to the store and buy some exp bonus and the other store for attack bonus. The game is not really hard, but it is more of choose how many/powerful your enemies are. Choose to do side quests or explore the other areas. Just becareful of not going to the areas that are +5 level above yours or the battle will take a while. Other than that... I enjoy this game. If this game is over your price limit, get it on sale or bundled. You will enjoy it.			"

												Why the hell does this game have so many positive reviews?!The best part of A actual D&D game, is the feeling you get knowing you can do what ever/go where ever you want. Sky is the limit. Not the case here guys. You are VERY limited.:PROS:Cool Idea:CONS:You never touch A single Dice in Knights Of Pen And Paper. Every so often the game will suddenly role for meaningless nonsense, or role when clicking on location to location to determin if an enemy will spawn.Think NES game with FAR LESS story content. You CAN'T interact with the dungeon master at all. Your About as close as you can get to being locked into a set path without ""technically"" being locked into it. You do not make any choices in this game.There are A bunch of clsasses, which is awesome, but guess what? you can't use 70% of them unless you take the time to unlock them. So you can not even use the classes that you want to. The unlocking thing would be fine if Knights of pen and paper was A good game and engaging, but it is not. Instead you are left feeling bored/stuck with meaningless grinding, attempting to unlock your preffered class.Story telling is crap. No replay value. Not challenging at all.You never-endingly click on the map doing fetch and escort quests that are so far BEYOND boring they make me want to pull my hair out.Gold system is flawed. Farming for XP is not fun, and feels more like work. Fun is the reason we play video games. Could possibly be the shitiest RPG (wannabe) I have ever played. Gear crafting is joke. Pixel art is not very good.Music is even worse. Contains no creativity. No interaction or choices between other characters on table and DM. Very little customizationBoring Dialog, and very poorly written. :VERDICT:In no way is it A solo player D&D experience. Or even A decent rpg experience. All you do is click on sh-it with your mouse, hoping that the game will get better, but it never does.There is nothing special or unique about this game. Knights of pen and paper is not worth buying even if it is on sale. Do yourself A solid; grab some snacks, invite some friends over, and play some REAL D&D. To hell with this epic fail, wannabe, turd pile of A game.			"

												This game ate up an entire Tuesday and Wednesday for me.Seriously.  I haven't even moved.  Just sat here, playing.It's sad that some achievements are bugged and can't be gotten, otherwise I'd have 100%'d this gem.  There's micro transactions in the game but they're totally optional.  I completed the game without spending any more money on the game than the pennies I bought it for.If you like pen and paper RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder, you might enjoy this tribute.  Many gaming easter eggs, some laughs, fun storyline.  Replayability? Hm.. I don't know, probably not much.  I think you'd finish it twice but that's about it.If this comes on sale, give it a go, I bought it for £4 and was highly worth it.			"

												I've only tabletopped a couple times, & the oldest D&D edition I've used was 3.5, so I'm hardly the target audience anyway. I found the combat system to be more Final Fantasy, (which I've played even less,) than D&D.There's no apparent plot, which was even less than I expected, but not actually less than advertised. Of course, I like being at least double my opponent's level, so I wouldn't be following the storyline at the proper pace anyway. I only just found where the blacksmith is, perhaps now that I can improve my weapons & armour, I'll dawdle less. Just as soon as I get my gear leveled up sufficiently.Some reviewers have complained about the boring dialog. In my experience the dialog rarely displays for sufficient time to properly notice that it's even there, let alone read it. Maybe that's why I haven't caught the plot.Pretty good for filling a few unallocated minutes, or hours of meaningless hack-n-slash. Not recommended for when you want a strong story.			"

												Bring on some old school dungeons and dragons! This game is what you expect from a good D&D game, a GM with a sense of humor, wild unexpected weird adventures and an odd bunch of party members to travel with. The misadventures of unlikely heroes... just watch those dice, remember that one rule, your dice are out to get you.			"

												Very enjoyable, addictive little game. Funny dialogue, simple PC advancement, and lots of different enemies to fight. Can get grindy and repetitive but there are some truly challenging battles thrown in for good measure. I think you will enjoy this one. If it's on sale then you really should purchase it. If not, you will be paying for its true value, which is okay too. Unlock those other classes (barbarian, shaman, witch etc.) and enjoy some replayability value.			"
