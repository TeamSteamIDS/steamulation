												If Magic : The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons have a child, Card Hunter would be it.At its core, Card Hunter is a pen and paper RPG with a twist. You play all of your action through cards that obtained from equiping items. So, different items had different cards.Pro :1. Free to play with cash to speedup your progress.2. Excellent Multiplayer with automatic matchmaking, ladder, rewards, etc.3. Easy to learn, hard to master.4. Excellent Singleplayer/Coop campaign.Con :1. Currently only 3 class and 3 races. Based on D&D mechanic, this is rather small2. There is no way to gain cash currency for free other than joining guild (Five 5$ redeemable coupon that only guild master decide who gonna get it). You only get what they give it to you while doing tutorial (spend it wisely).3. Some dungeon are locked with cash currency. While there is no item that cannot be obtained by free players, the locked dungeon guaranteed to get an epic item for the first time completed.Some tips :1. Choose your starting party wisely. While you can change it anytime you want, it can be a hassle to level up it again. A popular combination is dwarf warrior, human priest, and elf wizard but I dont recommend it (see tips 2). My personal favourite is elf warrior, human priest and gnome wizard that kinda hard early on. Check the wiki for some insight. http://wiki.cardhuntria.com/wiki/Cardhuntria:Community_portal2. You get a free multiplayer pack at Renown 5. Try to raise your renown to that level by doing campaign first. The pack is consist of dwarf warior, human priest and elf wizard with reasonable equipment to get you started multiplayer. Multiplayer character is interchangeable with the campaign character, that is why I suggest not to take that character as your starting character because you get it free later. But, recruiting level 1 character is only 10 gold. So do what you seem it fit.3. A lot of people is asking this, so I gonna write it here. You can start selling your equipment at Renown 7. I dont recommend to sell equipment because you maybe need it sometimes later for the campaign.4. When you get your pizza, the game make you spend it at that time. Just dont ! Close the client and you get the pizza without spending it. You can spend it later for whatever seems the best for you.			"

												Part of me wants to give this game a recommend, and rate it about 8.0/10.  If you're looking for a good, fun board game/card game/strategy amalgamation, this is a pretty sharp little package.  The script is witty and funny, the gameplay is tight and well-designed, the game looks beautiful in it's simple cartoon style.  What's not to love?The problem is the way the financial end is set up.  Now, you can play through the single-player campagin and have all the fun you want with multi-player for free... but if you want to play the additional Treasure Hunt add-on content, through the base game and its two expansions, the in-game pricing is $20+$13+13, for a total of $46!  I felt bad about getting so much fun out of this game for free, and was looking to throw the developers some cash.  I also wanted to complete all of the Treasure Hunts and get the achievements for doing so.  But no way in hell am I paying $46 for it.  Somewhere in the neighborhood of $10-$15 sounds about right, and maybe $5-$10 if you could grab it on a Steam sale.But it won't ever be on a Steam sale, because the prices are all in-game.  The Steam page simply lists it as a free game, without the pricing tiers or the ability to buy it from Steam.And to be honest, some of the other the achievements are practically an impossibility.  It's pretty rare to get an epic item, and more difficult to get a legendary.  I have a handful of epics after 80 hours game time and maybe 2-5 legendaries.  But to get the hundreds listed as a part of the achievement?  Probably won't ever happen.  Especially if you're not paying a monthly membership fee on top of everything else, which gives you an additional piece of higher level gear with every loot chest.  It's a fun game... but it's not big or deep enough to keep me playing for dozens to hundreds of hours a month as a part of some subscription model.  It certainly doesn't have the scope that World of Warcraft did back in its day.The devs would have kept me playing longer, and spending some money, if they hadn't made the non-free full version so ridiculousy expensive.So enjoy the campaign, get what you can out of it, and be done with it.  If you really want to give the devs some money, you can always buy in-game currency to unlock a few of the Treasure Hunts or a couple of extra costume/characters.UPDATE:  I had originally given this a marginal thumbs down, but just recently changed it to a thumbs up because of the comments from Sgt. Buttersworth [308] below.  It turns out you can get all of the DLC for cheaper than the fees they charge in-game buying them separately as stand alone bundles.  My advice is to check out the game for free.  If you like it, by the time you start hitting the optional add-ins, the thing to do is click on the pizza slices at the top menubar.  Instead of buying the Basic Edition for $20, the AotA Bundle for $13, and the Citadel Bundle for $13, simply buy 690 slices of pizza for $20.You can then use those 690 slices of pizza (plus the pizza slices you get from playing the free part of the game) to purchase the treasure hunts in bundles at the following rates: 300 for the Basic Edition treasure hunts, 150 for the AotA hunts, and 150 for the Citdel hunts.  This will get you all of the expansion DLC for $20 instead of $46, and you'll still have some extra pizza left for a few costumes.  Certainly not as many as if you'd bought the DLC's separately, but they're all cosmetic & ultimately unnessary imo.  You also won't have access to the one-month Club memberships that will give you extra loot, but those are also not necessary.  If you want to spend the $46, you can, and the difference will be a bunch more figures/costumes, and three months of Club memberships (one month for each of the bundles).I'd say that $20 is more what the game is worth, and for that price you can pretty much experience everything the game has to offer.  You can always buy the Club memberships later with additional pizza.  80 pizza will get you a week (and if you don't buy anything else, you'll have enough pizza left for a week membership with the 690 you've bought for $20).  After that, it's about 300 pizza per month with pizza priced at 330 slices for $10.So to sum up... play the free game.  If you like it, buy all of the treasure hunts in pizza bundles after buying 690 slices for $20... which will also afford you a 1-week Club Membership.  After that, $10 will give you a month of Club Membership if you desire to keep it going, with some pizza leftover each month.Purchasing that way will give you a better deal than buying all of the bundles for cash at a total of $46.

												For people who are socially isolated enough to want to play D&D, but don't have any real-life friends.Amazing turn based combat, classic rpg elements, and the ""board-game"" art style is awesome.CO-OP campaign (3 players one char each) is SUPER fun. You will be laughed at.Only transactions are cosmetic, so no getting blown out the water in PVP when you go against a wallet warrior.			"

												Card Hunter was a browser-based game that uses digital cards and a board to simulate a role-playing experience. But this isn't just an adventure game with orcs, warriors, and a kingdom to save! you're literally playing a Dungeons and Dragons game with a modern day story and it's now on STEAM with Multiplayer and also FREE!  not PAY to WIN. Which make the game one of the best there is on steam right now, either you're new to this genre or not you will fall in love with this game like we all have back in 2013!			"

												I strongly recommend this free game, it's a high quality cards/strategy game with some RPG elements that offers a lot of content for free.It's not pay to win, you can pay to get some extra stuff like costumes, more challenges or some loot when you open chests but it doesn't give you any advantage against other players (well, you might collect some useful items a bit faster, that's all). I decided to pay (I got the Basic Edition) after 30 hours of gameplay and not because I need it but because I feel the developers really deserve it for this awesome game and I think I'll keep playing it for many more hours.Besides the long solo campaign it offers a great multiplayer experience with a simple but effective automatic matching system and a rating that gets updated after each battle. There are also leagues with different game modes.All in all, a fantastic free game that shouldn't go without notice.			"

												This is essentially a pay to win game. The tutorial is well done and quickly gets you into the game. The loot is varied and interesting. Which makes you want to play more. But as soon as you get into multiplayer, you quickly realize that you need to pay in order to compete. The prices are steep too. Balance is nigh impossible because of how the game is centered around card drops.Single player campaigns are a grindfest. Campaigns are well made, and the level design is well thought out. They are fun, interesting, varied and challenging. Unfortunately you need to pay to proceed to higher level campaigns. After buying the campaign you still have to grind, pay to grind. There is a 1 day cool down and wait to for all the campaigns too.This game has so much potential if it do away with the f2p model and just be a proper paid subscription game. After all there is no way you can survive without paying.			"

												tl;dr: pay to win.This is a decent concept held down by a pay to win system that undermines strategy and hours spent getting loot. Loot that is trumped by shop gear which costs you hundreds to thousands of gold to buy, but then is sold for 2... 2 gold.Another annoying ""feature"" is that players quit the game when you're winning and you have to sit there for 2 minutes waiting when it is clear that they aren't coming back.  The game has a 20 minute timer that is laughable. Most players are quick and every now and then you need some time to think, but then there are the players that spend what seems like ages trying to make up their mind on how to move... And this is even in the higher ranks where you're supposed to be playing against players who earned their way up in rank. But this could be another side effect of the pay to win mentality of the game.It grasps you for a while but then it just stalls at this pay to win ceiling that makes the game hard to enjoy, then you get the slow players that make you feel like scratching out your eyeballs. 4/10.

												Are board games your thing? Down with oldschool DnD? Love a touch of randomness in the form of card collecting? Does FREE get your rocks off? Stop reading and start playing. NOW!  Card hunter is very fun and free. It was a pet project by an looking glass dev that started as ios and just arrived on steam. Translates perfectly with a shallow learning curve and lots of depth. P2W isn't an issue and I actually want to spend money to support these guys. They did good.			"

												Pay to win.My first multiplayer game at level 6, my opponent made what I thought was a tactical mistake. He rushed in with one warrior against my entire team of three. I realized it wasn't a mistake when he moved 5 times in one turn with that one character, killing my own warrior using abilities and a lightsaber that took half my life in one hit, then jumping away to the control point so I had no chance to even hit him the next turn. Meanwhile I was hitting back with a stick that did 2 points of damage.It's just not fun to lose, even though I made no mistakes, because my opponent had paid money for cards and gear three times better than my own.

												As a game developer, I am very choosy about my games.  I prefer games that require analysis, meaningful choice, a strategic, non-frenetic pace and that offer enough surprises that the outcome is never certain. Card Hunter is a turn based delight; a success in all of these areas.  It offers deep mechanics, yet is easy to pick up.  It can be as serious or casual as you like and is great to play with your friends or kids.  Co-op is now in and super fun!Best of all, it is the rarest of unicorns: being truly free to play and NOT pay to win.  I do however encourage you to buy the expansion packs because supporting games and developers like this is the only way we get more games of this caliber.			"

												DnD styled RPG in form of a card/tabletop game. You build your ""decks"" by equipping your characters with items (equipping an axe gives you 3 Chop cards and so on)PROS- The game looks pretty, like an old school tabletop game.- Lots of items allowing for diverse deck building.- Fair progression system, makes you want to keep playing to get moar loot.- The game ain't too hard nor too easy. Good challenge!- Very cool ftp model. You can have tons of fun without spending a penny, even in MP.- Simple and effective UI and HUD, I appreciate how devs sped up certain parts and made the game smoother. PC card/tabletop games usually have those extra unnecessarry animations. Not here though.CONS- Currently there are only 3 classes (and 3 races). The game balances it by forcing you to regularly revise and rebuild your deck to optimize it for various scenarios, so it doesn't get boring too quick. Couldn't find any info if they will add new ones.- Because of how the base game mechanics work (SP), they don't work that well in MP, especially in Co-op mode. Only one player can play per turn, so it could get a bit stale for others. Still, if you play with friends you won't mind it too much.Definitely recommending, if you like Hand of Fate, Guild of Dungeoneering, Talisman - you'll love this. Tons of fun and FREE!EDIT: typos			"

												Genre - F2P (with optional paid elements) Fantasy turn based battle gameI have only played single player and my positive review is based on that. I am having problems with queue times of up to 30 minutes, but hope they will fix this issue soon, and will ignore this with my rating.I am a fan of board games but without a good RPG friend base, I have to turn to computer games to get my fix. This game manages to satisfy my cravings well. You will use three characters throughout (Warrior, Mage and Priest, but no Rogue yet...). You fight turn based battles as part of a series of quests. You gain loot and items after each victory. As your characters level up, you get to equip more stuff. Each item has a set of cards attached and these are used for each turn based batle. They will move, protect, boost, heal and attack in various ways. As a result you will develop unique characters with their own advantages and disadvantages (some negative traits have to be played). The game story plays as if you are playing a tabletop RPG (reminding me of the Knights of pen and paper). This works quite nicely and creates a more immersive experience. I wish that pizza girl would stop distracting the DM!A great game that gives enough enjoyment as F2P to justify you splashing a bit of cash to get extra quests and skins for your toons.			"

												For what it is, this game receives an odd amount of universal praise, and it's frankly strange there isn't more criticism. I suspect this is because most don't play more than an hour or two, which is when freemium games really start to reveal themselves. So here we go:Difficulty. The game starts off as a very easy ride, before suddenly gutpunching you with a huge difficulty spike when without warning you're going to find that you constantly need to customize your deck to each fight. This isnt necessarily a bad thing in itself, but chances are you simply don't have the options you need to actually carry out the strategy. Building a specific type of deck to counter a mission can become downright impossible because you simply dont have the cards to make it. The loot system is completely rng (though you can inject money to expidate the process).But hold, you can buy items from the in game shop! Too bad the in game currency to buy these items is also only obtained via rng. So you have to grind to obtain it. But you can only play each level once per day. So fine, maybe you'll go into that mission with only a couple of counter items. But whoops, you didn't draw the right cards. Back to the start for you.As the game goes on, it's clear that they gave up on any semblance of caring about balance and just throw a dozen enemies with hands 4 times the size of yours with blatantly overpowered cards. Maybe you decide you'll use a lot of cards that push your enemy back so you can avoid damage. Too bad, the enemy has all range cards and tons of movement along with armor cards. You need to reach the end of the board before the enemy can call for help? Build a movement heavy deck. Oh wait, the enemies inexplicably have cards that do 12+ damage. Guess you better go back and do more grinding. And if a single one of your party dies, it gives the enemy enough points to win instantly.But what's that? You got a piece of powerful gear? Too bad, you can't use it until you're a much higher level. And on the off chance you recieve more than one of these, you're gated from using them through 'power tokens' so you have to grind even more to use it. The level ups do not come quickly after you've played to this point.I hear tons of people claim that game is in no way pay to win. So lets go down the freemium checklist:-Forcing daily logins to make progress-Time gating content-Premium currency-In game currency that's worth far less than than premium currency to the point it's a joke-High amounts of content locked to free players-VIP Scheme-Guaranteed strong gear for paying players-Horrendous real money to currency ratioYou can try to excuse the gear issue as 'anyone can get the rarest gear', but it is an incredibly time consuming and rng process to those not willing to drop the excessive amounts of money the game wants you to. The game might well have been good, if they'd just bit the bullet and put a price on it. But as it stands, free to play claims yet another victim.			"

Gameplay is fantastic, the art style fitting and in case you wondered this is definitely no pay-to-win game. The devs are really dedicated to making this the best game possible. Example: After the game got released on Steam the game gained huge popularity, driving the servers to their limit and causing waiting queues for login. The devs reacted to this promptly (the same day) by upping their server capacity.			"

												SKIP DOWN TILL YOU DO NOT SEE MY IMAGINARY GUEST FOR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE F2P STUFF.What I was expectinga casual game that was attempting to jump on the DnD Bandwagon for people afraid of pen-and-paper and its complexity.I do not think I have been so wrong and so happy with that ever before in my life. I think I need assistance on this review, so let me nab this radish farmer to help me get my thoughts out.Originally posted by Gaming Peasant: Wha is dis den?Card Hunter is a High-Fantasy, Card-based TBS/Pen 'n' Paper RPG.Originally posted by Gaming Peasant: Den its' a casual bloke's DnD den? Why are yas playing dis?Ah, but that is where you are wrong. Yes, it's High-Fantasy, but that is not quite the setting. You are a guest in the home of Gary and Melvin. Gary is a beginning Game Master (GM), and Melvin is the assholish, but veteran, GM. Gary is the one hosting this game and running the singleplayer (according to my playtime spanning across two days), while Melvin is the prime definition of a neckbeard that needs to remember that games are supposed to be fun.Originally posted by Gaming Peasant: Roight, so it's not a standed computa game. How does it play?Good Question, my Linen-garbed friend! The game is sectioned into rounds. Each player takes turns, playing a single attack, movement, or spell card per turn. This continues until one player is out of action cards, and passes. If the other players have action cards, they can continue playing until all are out, which the final person to pass declares the round as ended.Originally posted by Gaming Peasant: Sounds simple. methinks there is more to dis den dat! You have no idea. There is a ton to manipulate and do and use to your advantage, from trapping floors and laying curses upon your foes, to Objectives within the field of battle. Adding to the mix are Traits and Handicaps, which can buff and debuff your team and your enemies to turn the tables in your favor!Originally posted by Gaming Peasant: Okay. Carry on, I need some amusement while I harvest me crops.At the beginning, you recruit three party members. You can choose from 3 races and 3 classes. This may seem a little lackluster, but this actually keeps things simple enough for the novice RPG player, and yet still adds a good amount of strategy to your party. Dwarves are very tough, but are slow. Humans are decent in both movement and toughness, while Elves are very fast and have the bone structure of a sparrow.Originally posted by Gaming Peasant: Wot of magic usage? Most of dese type of fings 'ave them differ in ability...That's the cool thing. All 3 races are completly capable of rocking out as a mage due to how the magic and attacks are handled. This leads me to the classes; The Warrior, the Paladin and the Mage. Sorry, thieves, the healer is more important, and Elf Warriors are pretty much the same.The Warrior is able to wear heavy armor, can wield THREE weapons (Maybe the dwarves have prehensile beards?), and generally hit like a speeding truck.The Paladin meshes Might and Magic nicely, heals and buffs their teammates, and can even lay down the smiting via curses!The humble mage is a master of long-distance combat, but shines when you can hurl opponents with Telekenetics, block pathways with lava flows, and fling all sorts of elemental bolts, among many, MANY cooler things!Originally posted by Gaming Peasant: How easy is it to pick up? me kin may try dis! All that is needed is a basic reading ability, and elementary arithmatic for planning.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now let me get to the F2P aspects:It is handled almost as good as Team Fortress 2 before the Robot Update. I♥♥♥♥♥♥you notThey introduce it throughout the campaign, but not only is almost all of it optional, but when they do? FREE IN-GAME CURRENCY IS DROPPED ON YOU AND YOU CAN JUST SKIP THAT♥♥♥♥♥♥OFTEN.Rather get a free week of club membership? DO IT.Like the standard look of your characters? PASS THE COSTUME SHOP.Rather test your luck on a bunch of chests than go do the treasure dungeons? GAMBLE AWAY!Even the Expansions can be attained from completing the Campaign (To my knowledge)! I cannot stress this enough: These devs know how to do the Free to Play model right, and when I get the spare dosh, I am definitely rewarding these people not only for making this wonderful game, but also for treating the consumer so well that you WANT to spend money on their free game. The only major hitch is that the voices can get annoying (Melvin, I swear to god if you keep being a douchenozzle I will give your hatchback a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hydrochloric acid bath), and that if you are not really interested in High Fantasy stuff, you are gonna be bored out of your skull.If those don't bother you, Give it a try.

												First, to address the sharkbear in the room; yes, this is F2P in the modern sense; some content is locked behind a paywall, there's a premium currency with which to purchase cosmetics, a VIP system, and there's systems to ""encourage"" daily logins.So it's not free?  Well, the price for all the paywalled content is not egregious, and if you believe game devs don't deserve any money at all, you and I are in fundamental disagreement.  The simple fact is, once you've paid for the extra adventures, they're available permanently, so that's fine by me.  The VIP system is nice enough that I've subscribed a few times, but considering the loot earned is so amazingly RNG-based, and the fact that some of the best items are easy to get hold of (bejewelled shortsword, I'm looking at you), calling the game pay-to-win would be lunacy.  As for cosmetics, well, if you've got spare cash and feel like supporting the devs, why not?  I'd sooner spend my cash on the VIP system now and again, but everyone's got their own priorities, right?Right, so, is it good?  Well, I wouldn't have bothered writing all this if it wasn't.  It's fun as a game, with a healthy dose of goofy self-deprecation in its writing.  The mechanics of the card game/board game crossover are well thought out, and while you'll definitely lose sometimes due to the RNG, you'll also have some lucky saves and hits (which won't stick in your memory as well).The community is generally positive, at least in cooperative PVE (I've barely touched PVP), and most people are helpful, rather than aggressive.About the only major issue is that there really is a degree of grind to this, despite the protestations of some long-term players.  As the loot is completely RNG-based, and many adventures (or even particular levels) require quite specific approaches, it's easy to reach a point where you simply cannot beat a board because the equipment you have is either massively inappropriate, or just too weak.  The only way to get the appropriate equipment is to repeatedly re-run earlier levels (or have a go at PVP).  I'd guess this is where accusations of P2W come in, but the bonus equipment merely expedites the grinding by a small amount.  There is a certain satisfaction in honing efficiency in different levels, particularly as you gradually get equipment that suits each level piece by piece, but I've sometimes found myself wishing to program a bot to re-run levels automatically.All in all, it's great fun, but sooner or later, you'll find that you can't progress without grinding (even with the VIP system), and at that point you may find the fun rapidly runs out, or you might enjoy experimenting, improvising and getting help from a good community to make further progress.  For me it was the latter, but I don't doubt that it's not the same for everyone.			"

												This is D&D: TCG.It is amazing and I've been playing it through their website for years.Short version is that you equip armor and weapons. these items will place new cards in your deck. You use these cards to fight and move. You go through mini dungeons, kill enemies, fight bosses, and get sweet loot.There is also co-op and PVP.All this for free. Hell yes! "

												Although a very fun and addictive game (coming from someone who NEVER gets addicted to any sort of game), it is not for most, as it basically requires you to pay in-game currency for fun around a 1/3 of the way through. The game immediately jumps up in difficulty to almost becoming an unfair point. If you want to play for a short time, then yes, it's for you. If you want to play for a long, LONG amount of time and are okay with lots of spending, monthly subscriptions and sorts of stuff like that, then yes. Card Hunter is for you.			"

												More frustrating than fun.   Too much reliance on getting good results from random rolls/draws/loots.  Frustrating as hell to be in a difficult fight, and your warrior draws no attacking cards for 3 rounds in a row, while at the same time your healer doesn't draw any healing cards. And when you do finally draw that much needed attack card, your opponent blocks it with an armor or shield card.  It's worse than bad rolls  in a real DnD game. Here you have to randomly get the right card, then if the target has armor or a shield, you have to randomly succeed against his block.  In DnD you can always move and attack, and even if your attack rolls were bad, you weren't hamstrung by not having a card that allowed you to attack.   If you were unlucky not get good loot drops, it makes your life even worse.  Your cards available to you are dependant on the loot you get. Also loot that worked well in one adventure, may not work well in the next one. The game won't let you sell usable items for quite a while into the game. Meaning you have tons of junk in your inventory that you'll never use and can't sell to buy stuff you really want. The sterotypical dungeon master schtick with Gary and Melvin is amusing at first, but after a few adventures you start wishing they'd just shut up.   The whole cardstock aesthetic has it's own charm too. Naturally being an online game you have to deal with full servers or servers being down.  It's worth trying for free, but I'd rather play a proper traditional RPG than this, personally.  It's kind of funny to me, that I feel like I would like this game better if I had never played actual pen and paper RPGs before.			"

												What a great game.  I've been playing for a couple years and I play it every day, at least once a day, to catch the Loot Fairy.  A game can take between 5 minutes and 20ish minutes.  You create a dungeon delving party of wizards, priests and warriors from the classic rpg races.  Then you equip them.  Your equipment dictates the composition of cards in your deck and your deck dictates how well, or poorly, your party performs in the dungeon modules.  Rewards for winning the adventures are stronger weapons, armor and items and, hence, better cards in your deck.  Of course your dudes level up and move on to more challenging modules.  I'm certain that if you played D&D, or any table-top fantasy RPG, in the 80s you will find this game very, very nostalgic and fun.  You will also immediately recognize your AI opponents, Gary and Melvin, from your youth!This is the only time I've written a review for a game on Steam and I play many games on Steam.What a great game.danntbilll			"

												A turn based strategic card game, with some RPG elements. This game is not for everyone, people with a bit of patience and love for strategy games will enjoy this. The concept of the game is simple, you have three races to choose from, with each race having it's advantages and disadvantages. Then you have three types of heroes for each race. Mage, Warrior and Healer. You get a set of cards for each of them and as you progress you get better cards. At the start of the round you are given random cards from you deck, that you can play out on the board. The campaign keeps you entertained, you can complete the story, but you can't complete the game 100 percent unless you are willing to spend money. Online multiplayer is pretty smooth and keeps you entertained with competitive matchmaking and rare item drops. Give this game a try once.			"

												Fantastic game made better by co-oping with a friend. Card Hunter is a turn-based tactical board-game, played by creating a deck of cards you get by equipping loot items. It's intuitive and simple to learn, even for people unfamiliar with this type of strategy game. There's a campaign story that is simplistic but entertaining, and meshes well with the cartoonish graphics. It's sort of a D&D parody, but not in the sense that it mocks the genre so much as it embraces the sterotypes.It is truly free-to-play, and though there are some paid aspects you can indulge in if you wish, there is no pay-to-win leaderboard aspect. Oh, and this game does have dice rolls. Some days you'll get lucky. Some days you'll get milumbarred. It happens.			"

												Card Hunter is a combination of a traditional collectable card game mixed with tabletop gameplay delivered to in such a wonderful presentation. Presented in the form of a tabletop game board, each campaign is several levels or floors deep. Pitting you up against different foes with different sets of cards.You are introduced to all the mechanics in a great way using the early missions as their conduit. You'll also unlock each of your starting party members one at a time over the course of the first hour or so of the game. Each of the character classes are: Warrior, Priest, Wizard and each of those can be one of these 3 races: Human, Elf, Dwarf. This gives you a chance to learn the basics with each one as you play. Tutorials tend to make or break strategy games, but Card Hunter does it in a simple and engaging way. The single player campaigns are all a part of an overarching story where the brothers Gary and Melvin take a tongue in cheek approach of the dungeon master and player roles. This makes each encounter feel like a real tabletop RPG, especially with the art assets and introductions for each campaign. Each of these campaigns is picked from an overworld map that looks like an actual paper map with little dungeons and shops that pop up as you progress. The attention to detail is one of the things I find the most fascinating about this game. Each character, game piece, card all look like real game pieces. Blue Manchu did a great job with the art direction on this and it shows.The gameplay here is the star. Mechanically it's very deep, with 1000's of items that alter your deck. Instead of the traditional collectable card game trope of opening card packs and building a deck. You instead must equip each of you characters with one of those many items. Each item is a set of cards for your deck. So as you outfit your party with better weapons your card pool will get stronger as well. These items are obtained from completing the single player campaigns, playing multiplayer, or purchasing chests with a paid currency.By making the deck building mechanic tie into the itemization of your party it makes you make decisions that normally you wouldn't do. As you progress, each character is given a certain number of major and minor power tokens, which gate the gear you can use. You will find some of the best loot requires some of these tokens when you're equipping your character. This prevents you from making a character to powerful. Much like traditional tcg's or ccg's would limit the number of copies of certain cards in a deck, this mechanic is essentially doing the same thing. Though what happens here is it forces you to make some tough decisions. For instance, do you equip the laser weapon with 6 awesome attacks or the divine item that gives you some extra heals. The way this customization works adds a nice layer of depth to the strategy of this game and one of the reason it has such replayability.Besides the free content there is also 3 versions of paid content purchasable from inside the client. The Basic Edition for $19.99, the first expansion Attack of the Artifacts for $12.99 and the most recent expansion Expedition to the Sky Citadel, also $12.99. Each of these packs adds new campaigns, new items (which means new cards), new enemies, and new costumes. In the newest expansion, Expedition to the Sky Citadel, your campaign is against the GM - Cardotron 2000. Adding content from levels 18-21 and also proving you with a level appropriate party in the event you are not level 18. This content is hard, at least the first of the six treasure hunts was. In my first attempt at it I lost several times. Hopefully I can get some more loot and try going at it again. I know this is getting lengthy but there is also a well integrated multiplayer portion to Card Hunter. With ranked leaderboards, custom multiplayer maps and a separate load out for your party. You can play individual ranked games to prove your worth or join a ranked league where you play a set number of games in a certain period of time for rewards. The multiplayer seems balanced, although I haven't played enough of it to be 100% sure.Overall, For a free to play game it can go one of two ways. Lot's of content locked behind paywalls, which make the game feel pay to win. Or a ton of content for free with paid options to progress faster. Luckily they went for the latter. It's always a plus when a free game goes that route, giving you plenty to do and then entices with new content to make you to want to support the game. Card Hunter brings a free, fun and unique card game/rpg to you and presents it in such a charming way.

												Do you like Card Games? Have you ever spent hours upon hours playing D&D along with friends? Then stop reading here, Card Hunter is the game for you!Card Hunter smartly mashes elements of both Collectible Card Games and Table-Top games, layering those with colorful characters and lots of humor, making fun of most common tropes about roleplaying. Finally, all of that is sprinkled with a myriad of references to gaming and pop-culture, resulting in a carefully crafted and absolutely charming experience.The Single Player campaign is well put together and satisfying: the lower level adventures serve as a basic tutorial to the most important concepts of the game, easing the player into the ins and outs of an otherwise complex and deep game. As you keep going through the Campaign's story, the game slowly ups the challenge level, so the player is presented with a rewarding experience without feeling too overwhelmed. Wanna know what's best? You can tackle the whole Campaign cooperatively together with up to 2 of your friends and other fellow players, so you're not forced into playing the game on your own even if you don't like PvP.Finally, if you like some good competition, you can jump right into Multiplayer mode and bring-it-on against other players. The MP mode features an automatic Match-Making System, so newer players are pitted against opponents of roughly the same skill level, making ranked matches much fairer.There's a ton to be liked in Card Hunter and, while this certainly isn't a game for everybody, I'd seriously encourage all Steam users into at least giving it a try. The game's free to play, and the devs really do get the f2p model right. Not only can you play the game without ever spending a penny, if so you desire, but you're never faced with artificial pay-walls. Some game content (a few adventures and skins to customize your in-game characters' appearance) is accessible by paying-customers only, but free-players can otherwise access every item and card in the game via regular play alone, no microtransaction needed, minimizing the pay2win issues most similar games suffer from.I'd also like to vouch for the indie developer making the game and the awesome community surrounding it. If you like your games to be frequently updated with bug-fixes and balance-changes, I assure you'll find all of that in Card Hunter. The devs also regularly work on new content to be added along with updates, with a big expansion usually being released once a year. If you try the game out and do like it, I strongly advise you visit the official site and join the forums there, as those are filled with great info and lots of people ready to help and very welcoming towards to new players.

												Some of these reviews will tell you about how you need to pay to get all the features. This is true, but for a free game, there is a worthwhile and in depth story line that harkens back to the old 1st edition D&D fights of yesteryear - where not everything was beneficial and luck was truly random. I would recommend that you do NOT spend any pizza that the game gives you until you have completed all the scenarios - about 25 hours worth - Then it will cost very little to pay for any expansions you may want.

												Great idea for a card collecting game. Its sort of based on an old school RPG dungeon & dragons  board game with a geeky game host character. This is how RPG games were played before the arrival of PC games. The whole idea of a virtual board game complete with cardboard cut out characters and quest book stories actually works very well. Its the sort of game you can drop in and out of which is great if you only have a little time to play. Now I would really like to see these guys make a kind of sci-fi theme version of this game.			"

												I started playing through this game a while back with my girlfriend. No purchases done, a two man out of three team. And we can get through the game pretty nicely.This game isn't ""hardcore"", but it isn't meant for casuals. Which are most of the players complaining that this is p2w. Because if I can get through this game without a complete team, then I'm pretty sure anyone else can too.It's a really fun game, and a great alternative to D&D if you don't want to go out and organise a complete session. It's not hard to learn if you take some time to read your cards, and adapt to the levels themselves. Play smart, and you'll have a blast.			"

												Game is fun for first 10 hours. Here's my fundamental problem with the game. You have WAAAAY too many items in thsi game. Instead of levelling a character and having him learn a skill, his usefullness and the things he does is determines by what weapons and armor you have equipped. If you don't have certain weapons or armor, you're not going to win, even when playing the solo campaign, thus forcing you to either replay all the previous quests over the course of 4 hours in an attempt to over level and possibly get a decent piece of armor. This game almost does a good job of convincing you that it's not pay to win. Don't reccomend unless you have a whole lot of time or a decent ammount of money to sink on this one.			"

												Cardhunter is the crazy love child of the 80s boardgame Heroquest and a simple card game.  The name is slightly misleading as there is no card collecting.  Cards are made available through many hundreds of items.  Deck building is done by equipping items to characters like any other D&D inspired game.  But unlike other D&D inspired games, the effectiveness of each item depends on how it synergises with other items.  An item with powerful cards will be balanced by also containing a number of weak cards.  All items are available for free and will drop randomly just by playing the game.  Many of the Steam reviews suggest this game is pay to win.  This is simple not true.  I became a top 10 player without spending a cent*.  I have seen some rich players dropping hundreds of dollars to fast track their item collection.  But you cannot buy any specific items.  So money gives them very little advantage.  Any seasoned player in the world chat will tell you the same.  You must grind your way to the top and this is a good thing.  The match making system makes use of Elo ranking, and will prevent you from playing against an experienced player that will definitely win.  Ignore the negative Steam reviews.  Instead go read the positive reviews on Kongregate - http://www.kongregate.com/games/bluemanchu/card-hunter/comments?sort=best*After a thousand hours of gameplay I did purchase content, but only to support the developers.

												Summary: Fun at first, I recommend palying it for a little while, but you will soon get bored. The prices are too steep, so don't buy anything, it won't be worth it. They missed too many simple things to warrant asking for purchases.Its fun at first when you play with friends but the grind is real. The prices are a little too steep for me for the what you get. The game missed alot of simple things that would help, such as  tile labeling for communicating with friends. The blocking cards on the AI are pretty OP, they roll a block at least 60% of the time and usually have 3 or 4 of them while none of mine really ever blocked. You reach dead ends that you have to grind 5 or 6 times before you can progress, which is around the 7-10 lvls. I havent gotten past lvling my group to 11, because I get too bored. I recommend downloading it for a quick go to game, but once you get into it a ways in you will get bored. If you buy any of the in game transactions you really wasted money. I could've seen myself spending $5 back when I thought the game was fun, but $20? LOL. I'm glad I don't have buyers remorse. I want to get to the higher levels featured in the screenshot, but theres absolutely nothing that will keep me playing this game for that long. The grind is WAY to grueling.A year later I remembered this game and picked it up again, they seem to have fixed the unfair rolling tables. I still find their prices extremely laughable. Plus for all the 'is it pay to win' confusion, it's a 'pay to not grind' so you get things much more quickly. All who find this not helpful are those that paid $100 and are salty about it lol			"

Posted: November 3, 2015
												I really want to like this game. I do. But I've hit a point where all I can do is repeat a handful of vexing missions against what seems like ridiculous odds and can't seem to advance anymore. I am glad I only put a little bit of money into it because I think I'm done with it. As an example, I am a full level above one of the Treasure Hunt missions but cannot make any headway- the enemies have an endless deck of huge area effects that generate difficult terrain and they themselves have Hover. It gives a hint- to get robes that have Hover! Well, that's great, but I don't have any and at the time, there wasn't any in the stores that I could find, either. On top of that, it only means my squishy Mage gets Hover, since that effect only comes in robes, and then only if I happen to get that card at some point during the battle while the mage is still alive. I constantly find myself with Warriors that have lots of movement cards but no offense, or lots of offense but no movement. Another Treasure Hunt mission has my characters two full levels above the level requirement and is a capture-the-flag type mission with one victory space. Only the defending monsters are ridiculous, two of them have a seemingly endless supply of poison dart ranged weapons, the other two fly, have twice as many hit points as two of my three characters (and have one-and-a-half times that of my fighter), and a huge melee attack they always seem to have at the ready. If I am lucky with drawing movement cards, I can get within a few spaces of the victory square before my last character dies, or I take a slow approach, keep my characters alive, but lose on points. Twice I actually got a character on the victory space, right before death, and both times by the time I had gotten there, killing that character was the last victory point they needed to win. What else am I supposed to do? There are two missions a level below me I have beaten and two missions a level below me I can't beat (not to mention the level 7 treasure hunt two levels beneath me I also can't beat). Is this it? I really want to like this. I love the old-school-DnD art and tabletop RPG look but the puzzle-nature of the game coupled with needing just the right cards (that you may not even have access to) puts this soundly in the ""dislike"" category. At least it is essentially free, though I did buy the Basic pack (and am regretting it now). I just can't recommend it.			"

												It's already been 6 hours?Card Hunter is an excellent tactical game in which you play a pen and paper game(Much simplified and game-y-fied of course) where you have a party of 3 heroes in a medieval/fantasy style setting. You go through questing modules and collecting loot to of course upgrade your own equipment and play through the storylines presented.It's a charming game with simple but good graphics, a solid foundation for gameplay, and plenty of quests available. You do not seem to be hampered or stopped by paywalls, which seem to only be there to allow you access to more loot, cosmetics, and at times to unlock some new adventures. Not that you -need- those adventures, you can do just fine without them, but it does seem like it would be a good idea to get them at some point.In game, you will find the movement and combat to be intuitive, with all moves being detailed on cards you play it is easy to look up what something does, and you won't find yourself blindsided by surprise gameplay changes. It's all about knowing your tools and using them well.For the looting fans, you can spend your gold to buy extra loot chests, and for those who love to optimise everything there is a good variety of equipment available that is sure to get you exactly what you need to build your dream team.While it starts a bit slow, it builds up quickly and gets in full swing fast enough to be comfortable without any moments where the difficulty hits you on the head.I haven't even tried the multiplayer yet, but with the solid base this game has, co-op, and ranked play I seriously doubt I would be disappointed.Edit: Checked out multiplayer, am not disappointed.Another edit: Not all is fine with this game. Login queues are a thing, and it seems to be online only. This wouldn't be a problem if they had a 'cancel' or 'quit' button on the queue, but ctrl-alt-del is the only way outAs a summary, Card Hunter is a great tactics game with good atmosphere and as opposed to many 'free' games, this is actually a game you can play for free and enjoy. It is certainly worth giving a try			"

												What starts out as a very fun game very quickly turns into a monotonous, repetative grind as you attempt to overcome the challenges presented you.  The randomness of the card based combat system has some appeal but in the end constantly losing battles simply because you didn't have any attack cards for two rounds becomes frustrating and greatly detracts from the potential appeal of the game.It's disapponting that the developers have chossen the ""freemium"" model for the game.  I understand the economic appeal of these types of games but, as is the usual for these games, the need/desire to drain the consumers of their money overrides any urge to make a truely enjoyable game.

												*400  or so with the non-steam version.Card Hunter is a Turn-based, Card Collecting, Tactical, Strategy Game. It does a lot and it does it very well.One of my favorite games of all time I have spent countless hours on this hidden Gem. The artwork, the story, the playstyle. All executed very well!Pros+ Great Old School D&D Flavour+ Is NOT pay to win at all+ Likable characters in the Campaign+ Fun competitive Leagues and online matches+ Tons of Cards to collect+ Opening Chest is super funCons- Lots of Grinding, lots (which to some people this is not a con!)- No Trading (Which they explained why)If you are a fan of Competitive Card Games, Board Games, Role-Playing games (although there isn't really any RPGing going on here). Give this game a try. With a beefy and fun Solo and co-op Campaign and an ongoing fun multiplayer environment with leagues, casual matches and custom made matches, there is a ton to do here. Best of all you don't have to drop a dime. (Although dropped a couple dimes here and there does support the development team)			"

												If you like some tabletop gaming but dont have the time or enough players nearby enough for the games any more then this is a great game for you.Fun card based game and the pay to win is down to a minimun with what ive experinced so far but suffice to say the game will try to get you to buy buy buy. If you just ignore it though its great fun in the free to play aspect with no actual 'need' to spend any extra cash.Con's are that the story during the adventures can be somewhat weak with a simplistic paragraph rather than any naarative and also the tutorial guy I believe was written as an attempt at humour but just comes across as all the nerdy stereotypes rolled into one utterly annoying only just bearable aspect.Fun game for single and multi-player worth a download and try for anyone into card based tabletop gaming.

												Card Hunter does f2p perfectly. The paid content is either completely pointless cosmetics (my favourite thing to waste money on), true extra content in the form of campaigns, or an actual ingame benefit that still remains completely balanced.I didn't spend a cent on this game but I would have no issues doing so later. The DnD x TCG gameplay somehow works really well, and it's fun to grab a friend or two and play a nice relaxing, yet also somehow very entertaining, campaign or two. Worth your time, worth your dime.			"

												Outstanding tactical turn based game with a DnD spoof that actually works, long term co-op and multiplayer opportunities. Extensive single player campaign whether you pay in or not. The ""pay in"" schemes work if you want them but you really don't need them. Imo this is as perfect as ftp gets. Try before you buy for free and you really have NOTHING to lose here. Between the PvP and the base campaign you have over 100 hours gaming (potentially infinite) without having to spend anything.			"

												Card Hunter is one of those games that look pretty boring and tedious, but once you start to actually play. You get into it and it becomes quite addicting.Pros -Not pay to win at all.-Good flow-Solid battle mechanics-Multi-player -Co-op (you can play along with friends)-No constant grinding for items-Easy to get rare-epic items-Plenty of itemsCons-In the beggining a pretty long queue-Really short and really long battles-Some exclusive items that aren't available without paying for for ex. costumes. (not really needed unless you wanna look snazzy)But overall Card Hunter is a pretty awesome game, with few cons but i've only played for a couple hours so im sorry if i missed any other pros and cons.

												Great game for a free option! I'm new to D&D type games so it took me a bit to get into it, but it's suprisingly addictive. It's easy to learn and there are a few downfalls to the novice out there.PLUS:- Free- Lots of items and frequently win rare/epic items in chests.CONS:- I sometimes feel like I'm always playing above my skill level. Some levels can be incredibly frustrating.- In order to have success, you have to rebuild your deck for each campaign/battle. Luckily the game will provide you with ""hints"" if you lose a battle.Overall, it has kept my attention for 10 hours so far and I'm not out anything other than time.			"

												A cute little distraction while you wait for the next big dungeon-crawler to play.If D&D and Magic the Gathering had a child, this would be it.Free to play, with cash options to speed things up, Card Hunter never ceases to challenge, change up enemies so you have to change strategies, and tickle our fancy with culture-references. (I saw zoidburg, the acrobat from the old D&D cartoon, and much more!)PROs:-Fun, grid-based combat wil static D&D minis and flat terrain on a table. Adorable!-Fast-paced, addictive, lovingly-crafted visual appeal.-Correctly balanced for challenge, it never felt unfair.-Enemy AI is more than competant (you CANNOT just charge in)-Use of chokepoints, bridges and terrain is necessary to win, making you feel smarterCONs:-You are at the mercy of the dice and deck you build. It WILL screw you over more often than you feel it should. You WILL be helpless sometimes, eating multiple attacks and spells without any armor cards. You WILL pin bosses in corners and have nothing to hit them with sometimes. You WILL get stuck on acid, spikes, or lava from lack of movement cards. A LOT of this game is left to things out of your hands. Hope you've made your sacrifice to the RNG gods before you boot this game up.			"

Felt like the 1980s...Cons:  The micropayment cash grab is gross.  You can play free for @30hrs, then you need to start buying access.Also: this game is a _very cheap_ strat game, with minimalist card building elements.If you want to feel the nostalgia - play for free.  Any other reason should be a pass.I give it a thumbs up BARELY and only for the story and feels.  The game is a grind - barely entertaining.			"

												Nifty Free to Play RPG game using cards as actions and turn based tactical combat.  Does have a multiplayer co-op system and pvp.  It worked, it has Good graphics and artwork that fit the theme, sound, gameplay.  Reminds me of my days of playing Dungeons and Dragons by pencil and paper.  You get the Cards from gear you are wearing, and you get the gear from chests in quests and vendors in-game.  You can play solo vs AI with a party of 3 members that you control fully.   Maybe Enough free material to get you to level 20, then you have to buy the store modules.  Might be a bit grindy.There are modules, pizza (store coin) and membership you can buy with real money. for more info:

												PRO's Gameplay is decent.Not P2W at all.There's a block button (I feel I needed to add this as a lot of games ive seen lately forgot to add a block ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s button)Con's The pay real money membership lies. You most of the time get a less rare item then the last item in the chest at the end of a dungeon.The A.I. opponents will ALWAYS roll a six 99% of the time. Ive never seen the A.I. roll a 1 or 2. ive seen exactly 3, 3's rolled by A.I. almost always a roll of 5 or 6 to the point enemies will get so many perfect armor/block rolls that games take an extra 20minutes longer then they should for perfectly outfitted players.Most games are 3 sections per area taking at minimum 20-60minutes each per section. mid-game are 5 sections taking around 3 hours to complete and later 10sections taking well over 12-24 hours if you even survive all the rounds. You cant complete a section? you start all over. No saving mid-way or stopping. You either spend 12 hours no wipes or you start over.60% community and ingame mod are cancer. (However ingame mod is level-headed enough to not just ban you for stupid reasons like other games.)			"

Posted: July 20, 2015
												There's an excellent film from 2013, called Zero Charisma, which anyone with even the slightest interest in so-called ""RPG"" gaming should surely watch.  Most of you are liable to HATE it, 'cause it ain't exactly ""flattering"" to gamers, but like Taxi Driver before it, it's one of those films which allows you to gaze at aspects of yourself unflinchingly in a mirror, and decide which bits you'd like to keep and which bits you maybe, just maybe, should try and change about yourself.      But I'm getting way, WAY too ""deep"" here, especially for the game I'm about to review.  So let's skip, if we may, to a particular scene in said movie, in which our anti-hero/""gamemaster"", named Scott, rants at some poor kid (who wants to join his tabletop gaming group) about the evils of video games which purport to be ""role-playing games"", when they lack what he believes to be the core ingredient of such games: ""Communal storytelling.""  Now, whether or not you agree with Scott over how important such things are in the grander scheme of life, there's no denying that no video game ever has had, or ever will have, the ""depth"" of storytelling and character which a bunch of people sitting around a table with pen, paper and dice can achieve.  No matter how advanced and ""clever"" computer programs might get, they'll never be able to improvise action or explore characters to the extent which a group of switched-on, imaginative, flesh-and-blood human beings can.      Of course video game ""RPGs"", however erroneously named, have absolutely no NEED to aspire to such heights, because they have OTHER things going for them.  They're more visual, more aural, more immediate...hell, you don't even need any FRIENDS, 'cause they tend to have single-player options.  Video games have a LOT of things going for them which old-school RPGs don't; just as surely as old-school RPGs have their own strengths when compared to video games.  So what does all this have to do with Card Hunter, the video game I'm allegedly reviewing here?  Well, I could let the devs themselves answer that question for you, but since you're stuck with me, I'll continue putting things in my own words.  But in order to do this, I shall also have to touch upon the ""evolution"" (or ""de-evolution"", depending on your point-of-view) of the (in)famous Dungeons & Dragons game.  Sure you've heard of it.  The people who made Card Hunter certainly have...    D&D began as the purest of tabletop ""role-playing games""; perhaps even the ORIGINAL of its species, unless I'm mistaken.  But what is even more important to note is that, since its inception in the 70s, D&D has gone through many different permutations (including the ADVANCED D&D, or AD&D, system), and while I've only ""seen"" and have not actually played more recent editions, the general inclination in recent years has been to make D&D more, I dunno, ""accessible"" to new audiences I guess, by pushing it in a slightly more ""board game""-ish direction.  Card Hunter takes things one step further still by adding even MORE blatant ""board game""-y elements, like, well, CARDS (oddly enough, given its title)!  And again, ""accessibility"" would seem to be a key word in their thinking herein.      They've also proudly played up - as opposed to down! - the ""nerdy"" aspects of such games, by...well, play the game and you'll see what I mean.  It's not subtle.  As for whether it's ""hilarious"" or ""cute"" or ""charming"", or simply ""grating"" or downright ""insulting""...well, that's up to the individual.  Scott from Zero Charisma certainly wouldn't approve...in fact, he'd probably put his fist through the computer monitor in rage.  But are we all Scott?  Of course not.  Me personally, I'm probably half-way between sympathising with Scott and thinking the dude should chill out a tad and GET A ♥♥♥♥ING LIFE.  Would he at least be right if he were to complain of a lack of storytelling and character in this ""RPG""-styled game?  Of course he would.  Card Hunter is, in essence, just a bunch of semi-tactical battles with a bit of buying and selling and character recruiting in between.  It does, however, lovingly ""frame"" said battles in D&D-styled ""modules"", which do go some way towards evoking Ye Olde Memories for soon-to-be nursing-home nominees like yours truly.  If you ever played or bought any old-school D&D paraphernalia, boy, are you gonna have flashbacks!  A lot of the titles of the ""adventures"" are even puns or variations on famous old D&D modules (""Black Plume Mountain"", anyone?), and the art style is also frequently spot-on.      So is this, ultimately, a loving ""tribute"" to, or a♥♥♥♥♥♥take/post-modernist revision of, those old D&D adventures?  Well...it's both, really.  Let me put it this way...you can choose to buy ""pizza slices"" if the Free-To-Play format gets too sluggish and ""grind""-y for your tastes (and you wanna, er, CHEAT, basically).  And there's plenty of other cheeky nods towards gamers and gaming culture itself, as opposed to trying to fully immerse you in a world other than our own.  Actually, the first thing you'll see when you start the game up is a title screen declaring this ""The Game Of Fantastical Adventure Limited Only By Your Imagination!""  Which is, of course, a complete and utter crock of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  Even the likes of the oldest-school D&D were pushing their luck when they made statements like that.  But I'm pretty confident that the Card Hunter devs KNOW this, and I'm more than happy to nod appreciatively at their constant and well-meant in-referencing.  Having said all that...do I LOVE this game, given that I believe that I understand precisely what it was ""meant"" to be?Well...""love"" is certainly a strong word.  I certainly like it, quite a lot.  But I've only played a bit over an hour, gotten one measly achievement, and for now I might just put it aside and come back to it when I'm a bit more in the mood (or after I've finished playing Darkest Dungeon, a game more defiantly up my alley).  But it's all up to the individual really, and your own individual sensibilities, and as long as you avoid the lure of the Pay-To-Win incentives, it's a pretty impressive game for the big fat sum of ZERO DOLLARS and ZERO CENTS.  It's fun, has a gob-smackingly beautiful visual aesthetic, inventive sound...there's absolutely no denying that it's a high quality game within the parameters it sets for itself.  But please, please, for the love of the Gods, and this is mostly aimed at all you ♥♥♥♥ing KIDS (under thirty) out there...pretty, pretty PLEASE don't think that this is what a ""role-playing game"" is.  No video game will EVER replace those, as they're actually about more than just statistics and combat and random number generation.  They really are (at least at their best).  Think of this more as a compromise between, say, super-simplified D&D and Talisman (the board game).  Or failing that, let's just call it a VIDEO GAME with light ""strategy"" elements and light ""RPG"" elements, and we can all just stay friends, whad'ya say?For now I'm done, but I'm sure I'll return to it in time, when I'm in the mood for a grind-y dungeon hack-er with meticulously ""cheesy"" aesthetics.  (Hey, come to think of it...maybe the ""pizza"" symbolism they came up with was pretty apt after all!?)  The game is free, doesn't take up much disc space, and in all honesty you may as well download it and give it a go if you've bothered to even OPEN this Steam Store page.  So why are you sitting there, reading this appallingly long and tiresome review?  Quick, before someone thinks you're a NERD, 'cause you like to READ 'n'♥♥♥♥♥♥..PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME!  You don't want people to think you're ""smart"" or some♥♥♥♥♥♥like that, do ya?!?  Verdict: 8/10.			"

												Right there are three ways about this game. 1. you can play all campains once and pray to rngesus for good draws/items and have a puzzle/gambleing game that's worthy of having an A* evilness.2. Do the campains multipul times and pray to rngesus for good equipment and grind your way to victory3. throw money at it and pray to rngesus.I did 2. at kongograte now I'm attempting 1. may rngesus have mercy on me.But seriosly very fun game for a f2p model just very hard.

												This game is essentially Dungeons and Dragons as a computer game... Which is weird... A computer game of a board game....Needless to say, this game is quite fun....If it cost money to buy, I still would give this a positive rating.Although parts of the game cost real money (I.E. Special loot and quests) the parts that cost money don't hinder the actual gameplay, and one can still enjoy the game without cash. Overall, I'd say it's definitely worth a look at.			"

From Blue Manchu comes the simple and fun free-to-play turn-based strategy game, Card Hunter. This Dungeons and Dragons-themed title melds customizable characters and roles with a combat systems that can be learned with very little play time. There are little-to-know pay-to-win features, utilizing the in-game currency (pizzas) for mostly cosmetic character items; pizzas can also be earned at certain points of the game, and players should not find it truly necessary to purchase theses pizzas unless they wish to support the developers in this admittedly fun title. This game can be quite humorous, and the dialogue and text can be quite interesting, so that is another plus.Here are just a few reasons to Roll for Initiative in Card Hunter:Gameplay - Card Hunter utilizes a grid in which to structure battles. Depending on which stage the characters find themselves in, hostile figures, obstacles, and backdrops will differ from previous encounters. There-in lies a question directed from new or potential players: what determines the actions player characters can make? Each character-individual forces when enemy non-player hostiles are involved- has their own deck of cards which define specific actions, maneuvers, and attacks that specific figure can perform. Once a player performs an action with a character, the enemy does so, and so on; these phases of actions continue until both sides pass their turns consecutively, in which both forces must discard cards until each individual figure has, at most, two cards each. This mechanic was likely implemented to entice players to commit to actions while not hoarding cards for later turns in a battle. The main objective, however, is to eliminate the opposing force by reducing each of their figure’s health to zero or below, or by other means described in scenarios within a campaign. There are also multiple races-humans, dwarves, and elves-in which players can add in any combination to their party, as well as varying classes that can be assigned to them.Items - You may have heard mentions cards and asked yourself, “Why is this not a card game? Why is this portrayed mostly as a grid-based strategy game throughout this review?” To answer these questions, Card Hunter does feature cards that dictate actions and a maneuverable gird to which to strategize, but cards are obtained much differently than in traditional trading card games. In-game items are given to players after each battle as loot and there are varying slots in which they can be assigned; they also retained individual rarities and levels so that players can grade and compare cards that can be placed in similar slots on the player’s characters.Character Leveling - As players complete adventure paths, their individual characters gain experience which boosts health points and possibly opens up item slots that allow characters to expand the card count and variability in their decks. For example, at level five my dwarven fighter now has the capacity to equip three weapons, as well as a martial skill and other helpful items which grant bonus cards and traits. Though leveling is a somewhat slow process, this is compensated by the abundance of quests that are granted to the player upon completing others; these quests also have a daily reset allowing players to complete them only once daily, but so many quests open up at once that this hardly presents an issue-after three hours of play I found no need to revisit on of my previously completed quests.Theme - Card Hunter is a pretty blatant Dungeons and Dragons-themed title. The game’s Dungeon Master is named Gary after the legendary Gary Gygax, dice rolls are mentioned frequently in accordance to mechanics within the original roleplaying game, each adventure path’s synopsis and art is based on classic modules; it is fairly obvious yet awesome.TL:DR - Card Hunter has a few features that could possibly mark it as a ‘fee-to-pay’ title, but after five hours of total play I have not utilized nor have I felt it necessary to utilize the paid functions of the game. This title is extremely fun, though I have not yet had the opportunity to experience either cooperative or player-versus-player online features; I cannot accept nor deny the credibility of the online community. Card Hunteris recommended for those who enjoy card- or grid-based strategy game. Also, if there are any new or existing players who would like to play cooperatively but do not know anyone else who plays, I would gladly join in. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews?

												It's a very fun game, similar to Final Fantasy Tactics.The game is also completely free to play. You can buy a few levels in single player if you like (and cosmetics), but it's possible to get the entire experience without paying a cent. Items that were introduced in those payed levels can still be aquired normally in the campaing.One thing to notice is that the game may look simple at the beggining but it is actually quite complex.10/10			"

												Despite what a lot of people might say about this game at this point in time, I think it's fairly enjoyable. I decided to start playing it because I wanted something somewhat strategical but not ridiculously difficult or with a lot of depth. I have little to no experience in this game's genre. I found a great balance in this game. I haven't actually played the multiplayer, but the single player (at least in my experience) is more fair than many people seem to be saying it is. If you're looking for some sort of story or an extremely well balanced game, you might not find what you're looking for. However, if you at least want a game you can continually return to and play whenever you're bored I suggest you give Card Hunter a try.			"

This game is an isometric , Dungeons and Dragons-esk game. In Card Hunter, you chose a wizard, warrior, and priest.In each adventure, you are left with different foes and map sizes. When you have killed all Monsters or Enemy humans, you open a chest and get loot, each piece of loot (Except for treasure) can be equipped and unlocks certain cards with differentDamages, effects, and qualities. There are also qualities to the items themselves, such as; Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. There are many game modes for Card Hunters as well, such as; Campaign, Co-op, Citidel, Treasure Hunter, and others.In conclusion; This was one of my favorite games on Steam, and I highly recommend getting it.

												It's free, it's clever, it's unique, and it's fun. Yes, you should play Card Hunter.Card Hunter does a truly phenomenal job of taking common trappings - turn based tactical combat, old timey D&D, deckbuilding games, Diablo-esque loot 'em ups - while both using their familiarity and also turning them on their heads. In brief: adventuring earns you equipment, each piece of which is represented by a combination of 3 cards that you use to move and act in battle. Leveling up increases your number of (and power of) equipment slots. Add that up, and you have a sneaky deckbuilding game, where each of your three units' decks are assembled with just a handful of actual selections. Combine that with an extensive cast of monsters that each have signature deck strengths, and you've got a thoroughly complex game that comes together pretty intuitively, especially since none of this would actually work with real-world cards.And it bears mentioning separately: the free-to-play elements are extremely subdued. The benefit provided by real money payments notable but far from gamebreaking, and the game avoids the typical problem of desperately showering you in ads.If there's a downside, it's that equipments tend towards side-grades rather than upgrades. While that seems like a positive at first glance, it does eventually mean that you'll be drowning in hundreds of equipment options that, while maybe not equally viable, offer a dizzying array of possibilities. It's an easy game to pick up, but a difficult one to get back into if you've been away for a while.Still, it's not like it'll cost you anything.			"

												Buffs1. Lovingly crafted homage to non-digital RPG gaming (PnP, TCG, and board games).2. Satirical story line involving noob GM, Gary and his hardcore older brother, Melvin is nostalgic and funny.3. Tons of free content.4. An editor allows you to create your own battles which can potentially be added to the game.Debuffs1. If even the positive reviews express frustration at the RNG then you know it's a problem. Forget about strategy and deck-building; getting a beneficial draw is so unlikely that I fail even in lucid dreams of the game (which after nearly 300 hours there are many).2. Distribution of the card types attached to equipment is made with neither rhyme nor reason, causing unneccessary limitation and imbalance. Your warrior can choose 1 of 52 different martial attack items which buff everything from bash, chop, and penetrating attacks to bash, chop, and penetrating attacks. Do you like fire? Lucky you; you can load your wizard with 2 staves and 4 arcane items providing fire magic cards to be buffed by your pyrocentric arcane skill. Do you prefer electricity? You can go to hell; there are some nice shocking staves but not a single 1 of over 200 arcane items adds lightning attacks.3. The game has been ensorcelled by dark magic to compel people to keep playing even as they rail against it. Even days after uninstalling I am plagued by images of bludgeon-resistant black oozes whenever I close my eyes.			"

												Been a long time Card Hunter fan and I'm glad it is finally coming to Steam! I probably have 1000+ hours in the game if you include the web version.tl;dr: Neat CCG game that is free-to-play and *not* pay-to-win. Extremely fun and unique game with a cool retro feel, but can be overly random, imbalanced, and frustrating at times. If you enjoy CCGs and some light RPG stuff then check it out.Obviously I'm a bit biased (both having played the game since beta and contributed published content), but I really enjoy the game and the unique things it brings to the Collectible Card Game (CCG) based format. Unlike many other CCGs, this game is absolutely NOT pay-to-win. In fact, some of the top rated players have never spent a dime. The content you purchase is really just for cosmetics, extra single player levels, or small boosts to collecting speeds (like 15% boost, which is not much at all). If you enjoy the game you should support it not so you get stuff, but so Blue Manchu can keep making new content.The game is basically a mash up of a CCG with miniatures. You use cards to control the miniatures in an arena combat. Levels will often have interesting challenges that you need to overcome, with unique cards that can drastically change how you need to play. There's a decent amount of depth in when to play what card, when to pass early, and how to manage character facing and position. There's a lot to love, a lot to learn, and a lot to master.While I do love the game, it isn't for everyone. It skins itself as an RPG, but it is much more a deck building / CCG style game. Some single player levels are extremely difficult and require you to rework your party just to overcome the challenges. Don't view it as an RPG where you get your stuff and slowly get better replacement gear -- almost every item has a use in some situation (even the super bad items are useful once you finish the game for Quests). This is both good and bad as it requires you to tailor your builds to the level, but also results in often playing a single player level just to immediately lose due to not having the ""right stuff"" equipped.Outside of that, my main complaints about the game is that it is a bit too luck based and imbalanced. There is the obvious card drawing element, but then there are dice rolls where a single one can make or break a match. Additionally, there are a few balance problems with some cards being overly dominant. If you're a hardcore CCG fan who wants to create an undefeatable build then the multiplayer game probably isn't for you. Yes, top ranked players are consistently top ranked (I was #1 for quite a while), but that doesn't mean you won't lose matches against bad players just due to sheer dumb luck.Overall, the game is very unique and fun. Since it is free there isn't much cost in trying it out. If you enjoy CCGs and have a nostalgia for old school RPG tropes then this game is perfect. I'd recommend people check it out even if you're on the fence. At most you'll lose a few hours, but at best you'll find a new love like I did.If you have any questions about the game feel free to contact me. Always willing to help out. =)			"

												I like card games, board games, strategy games, and rpgs. This games has a mix of all my favourite genres. If you have similar likes then this game should appeal to you.Its a free game and I like how the developers have made effort for it not to be a pay to win game. Play through the long campaign.  If you get stuck, visit the shop and buy some cheap common cards/gear and change your strategy. Certain cards work better than others on different maps. I played through the campaign without needing to grind. After that you will unlock quests which are more challenging. You can pay to unlock additional maps but it not necessary to experience the game.Plenty of multiplayer options including ranked matches, co-op and league matches. If you are stuck ask someone to help you out. IF you have poor cards then play a league match with fixed deck. If you want to do well in multiplayer I recommend playing through the campaign first to become familiar with the game mechanics.The more you play, the more you feel like getting some pizza.			"

												Card Hunter is a weird little game that mimics table top/roleplay sessions - including the young, aspiring pubescent GM and its older, rather condescending brother who interferes every so often.I've never found the ""real"" D&D roleplay events with dice etc of much interest (sorry but most people are horrible roleplayers and that destroys any immersion for me) but Card Hunters is surprisingly fun as a casual here-and-there-inbetween for me. The maps/campaign parts are quite tactic but not too difficult and the drawings, voice over etc nicely done: quirky, just enough realism to be fun.Recommended for sure. I'm just not convinced anyone would feel compelled to pay the membership fee that comes with it on a voluntary note as the benefits seem not enough at least for me.			"

												If you've ever opend a box of D&D with friends, you'll find a special place for this game. Very nostalgic, very nerdy, and very much perfect. The graphics are appeasing, The game play is intresting and well thought out. Theres so much to like here. F2P with a pizza cash store on the side if you want to speed things up a bit or get some extra cosmetics. Co-op, multi-player, and even the community seems to be helpful. If nothing else give it a try, the game itself is free. There are three ""DLC"" to open up other game levels/content that you can definately enjoy the game without. The prices range from $19.99 for the basic set which includes 11 quests a month's sub, and several cosmetic items. The other two ""DLC's"" are $12.99, and have a variety of quests and other goodies. Again, theres nothing you HAVE to buy to enjoy the game, just add on stuff and extra quests.Bottom line, dont pass this up if you like pen and paper table top games. Do your self a favor and get this FREE game and give it a try.			"

												I am honestly surprised this game is not more popular. It is easy to learn, with an excellent set of tutorials. However, although it is easy to learn, the combat can be surprisingly deep. The character development along with the card collecting elements make this game quickly addictive. The multiplayer is also a lot of fun.You can play through the entire game without spending a cent, and the microtransactions are kept in check. There is a slight advantage to paying, but skill still matters more than the small item bonus being a club member gives you. The game is free, you have nothing to lose by giving it a chance.			"

If you're going to spend actual cash on anything, spend it on subscribing to become a member of the Card Hunter Club.

												To say nothing of the mechanics, Card Hunter is a game with fantastic aesthetics of presentation that really enhances the experience of playing the game, so much so that I'd recommend playing it purely on those strengths alone. It's almost as if the developer has rediscovered a stage of game design that was largely lost to the ages - the tabletop RPG, transfered to computer, neither an 80s text adventure game, nor with all the glitz and flash of isometric or 3D graphics that came later, but a happy middleground with all the enjoyable tactile (!) gameplay elements of the real life game: cardboard minis, dice, cards, paper RPG modules. It *feels* fantastic, and by feel of course I mean that you can *almost feel* it all in your hands! Designers take note, this is how you do an immersive and yet functional user interface!Obviously a good UI only goes so far, and there wouldn't be much longevity if that was all there was to it. Luckily it's just one strong aspect amongst many others. This is a game that sets out to put a fun, faster-paced spin on the classic roleplaying experience, and it does so with just enough grognardy charm to pay homage, but at the same time, straight forward mechanics and quick campaign modules. The mechanics take the form of a cross-over of older D&D (distilled to its elements and given a unique twist) and collectable card games like Magic (itself, of course, an offshoot of D&D), with character equipment offering up cards which in essence build the deck you play with. To simplify it to such an extent doesn't really do it justice, though. It might seem like simple alchemy, but Card Hunter seems to have finely honed this design where other games (such as Mojang's Scrolls) more or less floundered. The story part throws you into an adventure led by your affable host and DM 'Gary', who is themselves apparently a relative beginner at that role. Part of the fun is being told a cohesive light, playful story in both realities, watching your party grow in experience just as your storyteller does themselves.Other games have tried a similar style recently, such as Knights of Pen and Paper. Although that game featured similarly strong writing and charming adventures, it was always quite cumbersome and fiddly to play, very much in traditions of the RPG and mobile-game genres. The PC release of KoP&P mostly just showed that, though a great game to play in short bursts on a train or in your lecture hall, it wasn't a game to play for long stretches sitting at your PC.Card Hunter avoids a similar fate by keeping things quick and straightforward with less toing and froing, and not requiring any great amount of repetition or grinding unless the player wants to do that. It is also quite moreish - so the opposite of KoP&P. You can get through campaigns quite quickly (within 30 minutes) in either solo or online coop, and characters make significant progress in stats and gear (and therefore abilities) within just a few campaigns. There's a strong sense that things will play quite differently in each campaign you play, purely based on character development, but additionally based on the enemies you will be facing. The various boards that make up each campaign seem to have been lovingly crafted, and are well arranged to provide a different gameplay twist each time out.All these elements combined add up to making Card Hunter an experience that plays well in short bursts and also in longer sessions, without ever feeling like it's taking up more time than you want. Surely the mark of dilligent game design is a game that keeps you coming back to play more, however much you've previously played it.I can't recommend this game enough, and I think that most people to whom the fantasy genre is appealing will have a good time playing it.

												Loved this game since I played it on Konggregate. I once mentioned to the developer that he should have placed his game on Steam and luckily he told he had plans. To think a tiny developing studio in Australia would create such an interesting game and make it free-to-play. The game ended at Renown 19 for me. That was the max one could go without paying pizza. Everything else must be paid for. Metallic Metropolis is the max free.PROS1. Just like DnDWhile there is no adventure core story, the simple narrative of Gary the DM, his older brother and the Pizza Manchu delivery girl does give an interesting side story.2. SimplicityEasy to learn and play. Pick up a cardboard 3. Multiplayer Co-opJust like DnD. I hope that the reference to DnD is not a negative notion but it's the most traditional frame of reference I can think of. Getting to play with others to complete quests is great.4. Variety of monstersSo far, I have yet to see size Large (4 square),  Huge (9 square) monsters. Perhaps, that could be in Card Hunter 2? Edit: I've seen a 2x2 (4 square) monster already.CONS1. Pay-to-WinI don't like the idea of getting an advantage over another player by paying Pizza (in-game currency) for an increase in the probability of getting better items. The argument that ""skill"" mitigates this advantage is flawed. E.g. Trying playing a game with the starting items versus someone with all Epics from paying Pizza.I understand that the developer needs to make money but I think it shouldn't be at the expense of the ""fun and fariness"" of the game.2. No Overaching Quest NarrativeHoping for a game story, not the DM's love interest. I think Cardtron seems interesting. The silly Melvelous (Melvin's in-game character) was fun too. 3. Limit of 3Hoping for a 5-man group. 5 is a great number versus 3. Perhaps, it might be more taxing to control 5 units but the developer could design 3-man quests, 4-man quests, 5-man quests. That way you can have ho-hum levels, medium levels and epic levels. 3-man just doesn't give the same excitement. Perhaps, in Card Hunter 2?4. MechanicsYou should look at a board game called ""Descent"" by Fantasy Flight Games. Cardhunter might want to incorporate things like activating switches e.g. Instead of the yellow VP square, blue switch squares to activate in-game mechanisms.5. Doors. It is really ridiculous to see doors get knocked back.			"

												If your familiar with board games like D&D and you love it, give it a go.To take out the typical question, no it's not p2w you can complete de campaing with 0€.PvP i never got matched with people WAAAAY better than me all my match's were fun and some very close.The manticore maps are really hard at least for me but really diferent from each other and some really fun to play. (especialy If you like playing with the enemy/monsters)There are extra maps where you need to pay for those if you wanna play, like dlc's if you really like the game and  well have money to spare i would say yes It helps the devs of course, and i think the prices are actualy fair to be honest. You can have a party of 3 each with only 1 character.WARNING:Strategy and a brain is a must in this game sorry if you don't have those or you don't like to think i don't recommend even trying, don't be like some people reviewing this game bad just because they tried, they suck and couldn't complete the campaign and claim it's p2w after...

												So, if you like board games & tabletop, grid based tactics or card games, check out Card Hunter (now on Steam).So far I have put a good chunk of time into it, and this game is a blast.Why?Pros:------1. Free to play.2. Not true pay to win. You can unlock extra missions and treasure hunts with pizza, which is purchased with real cash. There is also gold used for items and chests (which can drop random gear, including the best). They give you enough pizza to unlock quite a bit of the end-game treasure hunts just by playing through the campaign, if you hold onto it. Gear drops from chests at the end of matches, and it's quite random with the loot drops (RNG). Everything can be obtained without a single spent penny.3. Gameplay. Think your traditional grid-based tactics game... with cards. Instead of having set attacks, you draw cards each turn and that is what you have for that round. The cool part is that each character draws cards, and the cards in each characters deck are dependent on what gear you have equipped. Equipment in this game gives you various cards (which are your attacks and skills) instead of traditional stats4. Campaign is a bit entertaining, sometimes repetitive, but good. Once you finish the game, you can redo any mission with special challenges that must be dealt with. These missions give you good loot drops.5. Multiplayer: This game has 2 and 3 player co-op, as well as true 1v1 pvp. 2 player allows for an additional card draw per character to make up for the lack of numbers. It's an absolute blast. There is also true pvp multiplayer, which is ladder/elo based. In this mode, everyone is given 3 characters to use that are higher level (once you unlock them in the campaign), or your own characters once you finish leveling them. You get to use whatever equipment you have found as well. In my opinion, this is the true game. There are so many combinations between all of the gear, character race and class options that you rarely see 2 people of the exact same build.Cons:------RNG. On occasion, it hits you with a left on card draws & defense rolls, and finishes with a big right to the jaw on loot drops.- Boom$t!ck  /WARComm/  - War Gaming Community (check us out for more reviews and giveaways!)┏━━━┓ ┃┏━┓┃ ┃┃╋┗╋━┳━━┳━━┳┓┏┳┓╋┏┓ ┃┃┏━┫┏┫┏┓┃┏┓┃┗┛┃┃╋┃┃ ┃┗┻━┃┃┃┗┛┃┗┛┣┓┏┫┗━┛┃┏┓ ┗━━━┻┛┗━━┻━━┛┗┛┗━┓┏┛┗┛ ╋╋╋╋╋╋╋╋╋╋╋╋╋╋╋┏━┛┃ ╋╋╋╋╋╋╋╋╋╋╋╋╋╋╋┗━━┛			"

Fine...Pros- Beautiful artstyle- Fun writing (especially if you play paper RPGs)- Challenging enough- Can be played in co-op (in this mode you only play one character instead of three, afar from that the gameplay is the same)- Intuitive interfaceCons- It might become boring after a while, I didn't played enough yet to say that but so far it feels very repetitive- There's some P2W elements in it. I guess it's okay since it's not a pvp game.- Yes, the p2w elements are rubed in your face all the time- Only three different classes (maybe we can unlock more after a while?)I'll try to update my review once I'll have played more of it.

												When the only negative review on a game is ""I can't get in because there's too much people trying to play"" It says it all... I don't know how you can review a game based on not playing it. But I did play and it's awesome. COOP CAMPAIGN!!!! This game is a mixed between old school dungeons and dragons and Magic the gathering. The CCG part is pretty simple but it contributes to a very good strategy board game. Sadly there's only 3 classes and 3 races but there's so much card possibilities that you can make your cleric a ""Warcleric"" or your fighter a quick moving assassin. Oh and the free to play model IS AWESOME. No Pay To Win in a CCG is almost unheard of.Warmly recommand the game to anyone really. it's fun easy to understand yet hard to master. Lots of options for multiplayer pvp, pve. You can make the whole single player campaign without paying but if you do you get cool unique weapon (Not stronger just unique). And there's an option to pay for expansions and more quests. my rating 8.5/10 IGN Rating (11/10) yep better than GTA5.			"

												I've played this game for ~2 years on and off. It's a game that strikes a good balance between card and board game. Needless to say I enjoy it.It is also one of the few F2P games that I have thrown money at because I was enjoying it. Their F2P structure is quite fair. Most of it revolves around cosmetics which are really only for the cool factor. There is a subscription option that you can take for as much as 30+ days or as little as a week. Which really only gets you a piece of bonus loot at the end of a quest. Most of the times that bonus loot is OK but not mindblowing, so it isn't as if they are trying to bait loot you into subscribing. There are also Treasure Hunt maps that have a guarenteed one time drop when you first complete them. That one time drop will also show up as RNG loot throughout the game (quest level permitting) as well as cycling through the merchant shops for in game gold. I've also personally never been huge on most of the Treasure Hunt loot, I have personally fount it to be mostly OK but I seldom if ever use it. The Treasure Hunts for me are mostly for the fun of the quest.tl;dr, the F2p aspects of this game are in no way pay to win and don't feel forced.The PvP is even fairly fun, assuming you dont run into the flavor of the month team or have built a deck to counter said build. Ususally seems to be three dward wizards. I've found myself physically kringing when I load into a PvP match against them but there is something especially satisfying when you emerge victorious or better yet make them rage quit because your deck is set up to be viable vs other builds but almost completely shut them down.  PvP also has a pretty good reward chain. At least for the first 6 chests after which it really depends on if you are still having a good day or not.			"

												In short, this game is awesome.There is something of almost everything in it: RPG, turn based strategy, PvE-Campain, PvP-leagues, Co-op and collectibles thrown into a FREE game, which for once does not ♥♥♥♥ up one or multiple elements of the game to the point of annoyance, but not just keeps it all together, but does well so, which is just incredibly awesome.If someone told me about this, i'd probably be sceptical myself, that it's not just working, but working so well.So far you can combine 3 classes with 3 races to form a group of 3 members to go adventuring/ battling monsters, which seems ok at first, not a lot maybe, but as the game progresses it becomes clear, that this rather simple template provides enourmous custumization through the collectible items, which don't grant the usual stat improvements, but provide you with various combinations of action cards, which you can use during combat, making for almost infinite combinations and various stratigies to play with.And while the game introduces you in an o.k. pace, soon it'll test what you've learned, by mixing up settings, introducing combinations of big baddies, swarming you with little critters, or introducing something special every now and then, so you have to adabt your strategies, which not only keeps the game challenging and pushes you to steadily improve, but because of the collectibles and group system, also maintains replay value of already completed levels for the more enthusiastic player.The gameplay is solid, the whole theme is a quirky, fitting homage to classical tabletop- and P&P-RPGs and while the stories are negligible, they often provide a funny background.And last but not least, it actually is free to play, with reasonable paying options, not just a demo, not pay to win, but you can buy special campaigns, cosmetics, or an extra (random) item to loot after each battle, which shouldn't give anyone an unfair edge, but actually makes them good choices to potentially reward the developers, if you like the game enough.As the idea to play those classical RPGs with some of my friends seems to nerdy for them and my attempts to convince them with selfmade moduls failed, this transformation to the digital medium seems like a small dream come true to me.For anyone who might be interested in any of these aspects, i say ""happy card hunting""!

												Card hunter is a very interesting mixture of CCG gameplay with Tabletop RPG mechanics and an intentionally goofy plot that moves the player through its campaign. I started playing this game two years ago, going through the campaign on my own, having a blast customizing my deck to combat the various enemies the game throws at you while laughing at the tongue-in-cheek dialogue. After that, there was a whole other world to explore in competitive multiplayer with other players, with a system that matches the player up with opponents of a roughly equal skill level. Now with the recent expansion, there's also the possibility to go through the campaign cooperatively with up to two friends, or team up to play a multiplayer match against another team. There's something new to keep you coming back to the game every day, such as special loot rewards for beating certain adventures or 10-hourly leagues which offer completely new scenarios to strategize in.The variety of cards is absolutely huge, there's enough possible playstyles to accommodate anyone's tastes, and the constant collecting of new items and cards means you'll often find ways to adjust your characters to be even more to your liking.Card Hunter is easily the best Free-to-Play game I've ever played with the richest and fullest experience without buying any in-game currency. It's basically as far from a pay-to-win model a Free-to-Play game can be.Anyone, whether they have a casual or deep interest in the game, whether they prefer playing competitively, cooperatively or solo, whether they buy the in-game currency or not can enjoy this game!

												A mashup of collectible card games with D&D, plus a healthy dose of humorous nostalgia.  It's got an adorable art style, constantly shifting tactical combat, and a wonderful community.It's also Free-to-Play, but not in a bad way.  You could play through almost the entire game without spending anything, but you can pay for a set of *even more* adventures (~20 more on top of the 50-odd free ones), get a slight boost in the number of items that drop, or go for excellent cosmetic upgrades.It's the bestest!

												This is an game packed in content, for a free game it's very good. there is a very long story mode, of which i am currently not very far (only level 6), which is fun and interesting. Co-op in the game is very fun, depending on whether you don't mind waiting for a few seconds for a player to make his move. So i recommend grabbing a friend or two, and sitting down a killing a few hours kill monsters. Seriously, you can not go wrong with this game.			"

												Captivating cross between a trading card game and turn-based strategy games such as X-Com and Jagged Alliance. Has some freemium style trappings which of course may annoy. But, it's great for a quick couple of games if you're just looking to chill. I really love the art design also. Mixing slick visuals with homages to the great Gygaxian era of the AD&D days. Some cute nods to modules from that era also. Highly recomended!			"

												Welcome, bold adventurer! Card Hunter is an online collectible card game which blends together card play, deck building, tactical combat and fantasy role-playing in a way you've never seen before. Grab your cards, miniatures, dice and snacks, then journey to a new world of adventure on the tabletop of your Game Master, Gary. Build your party and set forth on a grand adventure in the massive single-player campaign. Each adventure will challenge your deck-building skills and tactical prowess as you battle horrifying Black Oozes, savage War Monkeys and more. Amass a collection of fantastical swords, shields and other adventuring gear. In Card Hunter's unique deck building system, equipping your party with these items builds your deck for you. Enter the fray on a grid based battlefield. Prepare for turn-based strategy where you must play your cards right to defeat your foes and be rewarded with experience and loot. When you’re ready, challenge other players in casual games, ranked matches or regularly scheduled leagues. Can you rise to the top of this month’s season? Can you and your undead minions triumph in the Graveyard Gambol league? Multiplayer Card Hunter is a never-ending challenge. Don't want to face the monsters alone? Adventure co-operatively with one or two friends and share the dangers of Cardhuntria as well as the rewards. When you're done with the huge core campaign, get ready for when robots and insane computers invade in the all new Expedition to the Sky Citadel set. Or, if you prefer your monsters from the murky mists of time, brave the challenge of prehistoric monsters and intelligent weapons in the fiendish Attack of the Artifacts.			"

												Have you grown older and miss the old days of D&D? Are your weekly Pathfinder games not enough for you? Are you having trouble finding a party of adventures to dungeon crawl with you? Look no further cause Card Hunter brings challenging AI and tactical thinking that will keep you entertained for hours, and it's all free to boot.create a party of three of your choice from from the following races and classes:Races: Dwarve, Human, ElfClasses: Warrior, Mage, PriestWhy not level each type that's a combo of 165 parties have at it!Loot is well set up each class gets specific gear the only ones that are in common are the Shield (which both the warrior and priest get) and Boots (whichs everyone gets) not to mention each class and race get special skill slot. The awesome part is gear is how you get your cards. You don't pick and choose cards individually like a deck builder, but you find loot which have 3 cards attached them them; unless they are weapons which have six cards. The play style for each class is tremindous I can't say on play style is better then the other but there is deffinitely synergy to make a character awesome. Personally I'm thinking of making a life steal dwarven priest, a dwarven mage that plays keep away with a card that causes them to take damage whenever they move and a elven warrior that is hasty to get in close and deal some heavy damage. What type of class you play may fall to lady luck depending on the items your able to find.I have yet to touch multiplayer I want to finish the single player first before I try it out, but single player and multiplayer is linked so that you use the same character and gear and levels are locked when you switch to multiplayer to create an even playing field.Long story short if your a fan of table top RPG adventures this is the game for you.

												It is an enjoyable game that explores the elements of the usual RPG and presents that in a style that anyone could enjoy. There are slow loading times but the gameplay makes up for it. However, the reason why I enjoy this card game over others is that it has character which makes me feel motivated as I build a stronger relationship with the characters I create and Marvin, who is a character I geniunely feel sorry for him as he is constantly being intimidated by his brother. With other games, you are given your cards, play a few games and then leave the game due to a dwindling interest. However, I feel like that this game would be interesting even without the stellar gameplay. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who has some time spare as it is a captivting game.			"

What type of class you play may fall to lady luck depending on the items your able to find.I have yet to touch multiplayer I want to finish the single player first before I try it out, but single player and multiplayer is linked so that you use the same character and gear and levels are locked when you switch to multiplayer to create an even playing field.Long story short if your a fan of table top RPG adventures this is the game for you.

												Captivating cross between a trading card game and turn-based strategy games such as X-Com and Jagged Alliance. Has some freemium style trappings which of course may annoy. But, it's great for a quick couple of games if you're just looking to chill. I really love the art design also. Mixing slick visuals with homages to the great Gygaxian era of the AD&D days. Some cute nods to modules from that era also. Highly recomended!			"

												Ever wanted to play a RPG board game but don't have any friends? Card Hunter will fix that by making a computer or real people fight you or they will be killed because you are a loser playing a RPG board game all by yourself and no one wants to ever interact with you.			"

												I was really surprised by Card Hunter. It is one of the most unique games I have played as of late, its some type of hybrid tabletop rpg/ collectable card game hybrid. The game comes with three modes, multiplayer, cooperative, and a detailed single player campaign.  There are tons of play styles and each battle feels like a puzzle in and of itself!  I am really enjoying what I have played of the game so far, and would definitely recommend Card Hunter!			"

Product received for free
												This free game is surprisingly well-developed and fun for many hours.  I love the 1st ed. AD&D aesthetic (done tongue-in-cheek), combined with turn-based party RPG and card-game mechanics.  It's a fun throwback to old Dungeons & Dragons play, but lovingly mocked for its geekiness throughout, and updated for simple but deep tactical gameplay. It's funny without sacrificing any of the actual nerd enjoyment of card-driven fantasy RPG battle tactics.  The perfect audience for this game is someone who loves these sorts of games yet also laughs at the dorks (always dorkier than ourselves, naturally) who played these games in the 1980s.  Beautiful graphics, extremely smooth lag-free play, clear user interface. In-game purchases available but totally non-invasive and inessential to success.  Worth $20, but the developers seem to be banking on the in-game purchases to make up for the excellent development.  No skimping here!			"

												Just experienced the game after it's launch in steam, it's a shame that we have to wait so long for it. I've played the game hundreds of hours before it comes to steam, it combines many features which are common in boardgame and ccg, if u play through the single-player part to the pvp mode, u can find more which seems trivia but actually gives more score to the game. Here's some obvious features u can experience even as a new player:1. Tons of collective cards which u can combine them with different strategies in game.2. Never feel boring and always being shocked by some new ideas or play-style in pve, especially pvp.3. Randomess and even some rpg- style makes the boardgame quite unique.4. Friendly community and interesting story plus nice pic and sound systems.5. Great dev. team always add some new things to the game and try to make it's a better world.There're more about the game, but that wait's u to find out. The game itself has a steep learning curve, one needs to learn lots to master the game system. However, in my opinion, I hope to see the game system much more complicated and more elements which can freely utilize in future. If u haven't try this, don't hesitate, it's free anyway.			"

												Card Hunter takes everything I like about turn-based RPG combat and makes it sing a glorious duet with the infinite combinatorial grace of a well designed collectible card game.  There is a MASSIVE amount of single player content for free, and the challenges (which reward rare loot for replaying each mission) completely alter the way you have to think, relative to your first time through. The  multiplayer, which I swore I'd never touch at first - sucked me in for months. The fiction is best thought of as a cute gift wrapper for the game design, but honestly - it doesn't need more. Finally, it just feels *patient*. You can feel like  you've made progress with only 20 minutes at a time, if you like, or binge for hours. A couple of years ago, as a new father with free time at weird hours, Card Hunter was a kind of refuge of clarity and safety-within-risk. But that was just MY reason to fall in love with it.

												Having played quite a bit of Card Hunter in my browser, it seemed fitting for me to play it through Steam, because it's a game that's worth sharing.  It's a tactical RPG that's not quite like anything else I've seen.  Rather than your available actions being dictated directly by your characters' classes and equipment, Card Hunter deals you actions from a deck of cards, he contents of which are derived from your characters' gear.  An axe might give you strong, close-range attacks, while a spear gives you weaker attacks with longer ranges.  Armor gives you cards that reduce damage from incoming attacks.  Mages and Priests likewise derive their spell cards from their gear.This opens up a whole mess of options.  Do you go for strength or reach?  Do you use items that offer reliable skills, or those with powerful abilities counteracted by the occasional disadvantage?  Do you forgo a stronger set of attacks in favor of some that have synergy with your other cards?While luck plays a role in the game, it's mostly your deck-building and tactical skills that will determine your success.  It's a well-designed game that offers a lot of options and possible strategies.  It also has numerous unsubtle references for long-time fans of tabletop roleplaying, but these are hardly necessary to enjoy the game.  Ultimately, Card Hunter offers a fresh, rewarding, and just plain fun experience.			"

												Ever wanted to play a RPG board game but don't have any friends? Card Hunter will fix that by making a computer or real people fight you or they will be killed because you are a loser playing a RPG board game all by yourself and no one wants to ever interact with you.			"

												Incredibly simple, incredibly addictive.This provides the great fun of adventuring with tabletop gaming, but allowing for people to find ""groups"" easily and to finish adventures in a short time.  You can easily spend hours in this (as I have already in a couple days) or just do short bursts and still really enjoy the game.The fact that you don't need to pay into it to progress is great, too... most F2P games add that curve onto the F.

												Practically dripping with unique style. This slightly Dungeons and Dragons inspired table top simulator is bound to wrap you up in hours of retro slicing and dicing. And I do mean DICE-ing. If you are a fan of games like D&D, you will love this title not only for it's similarity to those old games but also for it's own personal spin on the genre. I was expecting this game to be pay to win but it's not. Far from it. There is an option to use micro transactions to purchase ""pizza slices"" which act as gems, crowns, diamonds, etc. do in other games. You use the pizza to purchase what can be summed up as a randomized loot chest which will give you a neat little item but never too far out of your characters level. You can also join a fan club of sorts so that every day you get one more loot item after every battle that is always AT THE VERY LEAST as valuable as the most valuable item you oculd have gotten from that match at your level.This game is amazing and oozing content and style. Download it. It's free. If I could thank the creators personaly, I would.			"

												I have only been playing Card Hunter for a little over ten hours so far but this game is so good! It is super addicting but easy to pick up and put down as needed. It is also enjoyable to play on your own or with another friend or two. There are times where it is difficult to commit to campaigns and this really quells that craving to just build a character, step out into a fantasy world, and kick some serious butt.The experience and loot gained is satisfying; sometimes you may get a piece of bacon for a resale value of two gold but sometimes it is a really awesome weapon with abilities that make your deck shine. There is a lot of strategy involved and this game provides a nice challenge. As a free player there are plenty of encounters to enjoy but I have to admit that I am looking forward to purchasing some adventure packs in the future.The free model is excellent on it's own, but for those who like to invest a little and enhance their experience, it looks like Card Hunter has you covered there as well.I am definitely getting my friends to play this.

												Simple game,in a complicated way. Since most people read only short reviews then I am gonna sum up everything I have in my mind. Don't be deceived from the graphics,or the fact that this game platform looks more like a... board  ,this game is better than you think,more complicated and it has playstyle that probably you haven't seen it much around.  Most friendly community I have ever seen in a game  ,seriously like,I have been playing games 10 years,but I never found such a friendly community like this one. If you want a real challenge,then this game is suited for you  ,outsmart your enemy,use his move against him,engage and disengage succesfully to come out glorious. Last and not least,  this is a F2P game,which means that people who pay on this game,have a slight advantage,which is not even so much visible. In other words,you can have everything a P2W player has,with hard work,expect extra modules (adventures) and skins. Yes folks,no prenium items and bs like that. So consider this game F2P friendly one.For TL;DR go CoC yourself Make this game great~  "

												This has the potential to be a really great game. But if you do not want to spend money or grind old dungeons over and over for small rewards just to progress at later levels good luck. Higher level dungeons where you are at same item level as the dungeons or slightly below it all comes down to rng which kills the game. Whoever hits their armor rolls will win in battles making the game fustrating when you have to either grind to get over geared and over leveled to pass. Or spend money just so you do not have to keep praying to the RNG gods that the enemies always hit their armor roles and you never hit your armor roles. It truely kills a great game when it comes down to RNG later in the game if you are going the free to play route.			"

												So much is based on luck its annoying. Often the mobs are given unbalanced strength that some levels I can't even play. Others are predetermined sets that I have to play 20 times for the right lucky combo to come up to even have a chance they are so unbalanced. It was fun at first but not worth my time anymore. I stopped playing it for 6 months hoping things had improved but they haven't. Won't recommend this game to anyone.			"

												if you go into it like I did, as a casual gamer, you will enjoy the game for multiple hours.  That being said, some of the campaign progression is slowed to have to grind for items to equip your characters with.  This is where a minor pay to progress aspect comes in, but again, it is minor.  This is because you can essentially grind past that either by switching over to multiplayer for a handful of games for better item drops, or repeat previous adventures for  gold to buy better items.  There are reports that at higher levels the game slows even more, but I'm only at level 7 currently after about 8 hours of game play. Item prices in the shops are a little steep and just reflects on a pay to progress (more quickly) model.  I wish there was a better tutorial for new players, but it only took me a few games to get the hang of it. The game provides a new element to card game play by providing the boardgame, so it is a nice mesh between card dueling and boardgaming.The game has been losing players steadily and is currently only at 25% of its average players online at a given time compared to what it had when it released, only 6 months go, in July 2015. (per steamcharts).  Having that large of a drop over that short of a time should be an indication of the game's longevity.I would give this game a thumbs up because there is a good number of hours were it will provide enjoyment.  That being said, there is a lot going against it as far as mechanics go.  The random number generator style of card play can be frustrating.  Selling items is a joke as there is no difference in gp value for a level 1 item, or a level 18 item.  Pay to progress models frustrated me because you either have to choose to grind for hours, or pay real money to get the items faster.  It also seems the developers are not interested in keeping players by ignoring any criticisms that have been made.  This game could have been great if the developers balanced game play, improved their mechanics, and didnt require players to grind for advancement.  There are plenty of ways to incentivise purchases but pay to progress, and pay to win for multiplayer, are the least player friendly ways to go about it.			"

												An extremely unique blend of the tactical RPG, tabletop D&D, and MTG that comes together beautifully. It is smart, funny, and addicting.

I kept being surprised by new elements, like the PVP and Co-op. User-conceived content. Truly enjoyable storyline and even relatively tolerable fluff (for rehashed fantasy RPG stories). There's even a lot of really interesting unique story concepts and some really funny parodies too, if you're a tabletop gamer.I was just overall impressed with this.

The game really is absolutely free, not pay to win at all and you could play the entire game without even knowing there was the option to pay for anything extra. Unlike many other game developers there is no in your face obnoxious pressure to pay or subscribe or anything like that. In the end I ended up paying some real money into the game after completing the campaign because I feel like this is an excellent game that the developers deserve to be rewarded for. "

												Card Hunter is a deeply enjoyable game. It's a fusion of traditional Dungeons & Dragons tabletop and Magic: the Gathering style card game presented in a charming aesthetic that mimics classic D&D boards. The mechanics, while odd at first are quick to learn and work very well. There's a full suite of some 30 multi-mission adventures on offer, along with fleshed-out PvP that's accessible basically right off the bat in a competitive state.Oh, and all of this is free. Not bad, right?BUT - and this is a very big BUT - the amount of RNG involved in the gameplay is absolutely through the roof. Each character you control draws every move (up to and including actual moving) from an unseen, randomly shuffled deck of cards. The only guaranteed draw is the basic movement card which is always given to you at the start of each round. Absolutely everything else from attacks to healing spells to self debuff cards is completely random.It is maddening and sadly all too common for my fighter (big chap who hits things with a sword/club/lightsaber) to go several rounds in a row without drawing a single attack card, and then draw a single kind of crap one before going another round without. For a class that's supposed to be up close and personal at all times this is downright deadly, especially since in the campaign adventures monsters seem to have an incredibly strong chance of drawing their most potent attack more or less every turn. This also applies to the priest (healing and buff/debuff support) and mage (killing things from far away), who are also both often caught without anything useful in their hands in the heat of the action.Don't get me wrong, Card Hunter *is* a good game. The positives definitely outweigh the negatives by a fair margin. But I cannot stress enough that it can sometimes be an incredibly frustrating experience because so much of it is left down to the whims of RNJesus. The only thing you have complete control over is the positioning of your characters. Play it, but be very aware of that fact because it WILL bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥♥with alarming frequency.			"

However as I got deeper into the story the writing started using heavy handed sexist tropes and I lost a taste for the game. Maybe if I pushed through those issues would have resolved themseves (since this game tries to be self-aware and meta). That said, Card Hunter is still a pretty stimulating game so if you can stomach the male geek humor I definitely recommend it.			"

												Disclaimer: I've received in-game premium currency for playtesting and creating custom maps.Card Hunter is a free-to-play hybrid of collectible card game and turnbased strategy pretending to be a tapletop RPG. It has SP and MP modes, co-op, daily rewards, and a map editor. The big thing that makes it unique is the fact that you don't own individual cards; instead you're collecting items that contain 3 or 6 cards each. Each of your chars has their own deck created by the items they have equipped (36 cards once all equipment slots are unlocked) which they draw from during battles.Combat involves moving your chars around on a 2D map (handmade, every SP map is unique) made up of several terrain types, but their actions are limited to the cards in their hands. Attacks can have ranges, area of effect, damage over time, buffs, debuffs, or even create special terrain types. Victory is based not just on what cards you have but also your skill in positioning and timing (the order you play your cards or pass).It truly is free-to-play. Every card, item, race, and class is available for free. The only premium content are special character skins (purely decorative) and certain SP modules that give a specific item when you first complete them. But those items aren't the rarest or best in the game, and can be obtained from random drops and shops in both modes. The other main use of premium currency is Club Membership which gives an extra item every time you win a battle while a member. You can also use the premium currency to buy chests (booster packs) or convert to common curency for the shops, but those are considered to be wastes of money. There is no trading or direct purchasing of specific items you want, you have to wait for it to show up in a chest or shop.Why do I love this game so much? Why have I played it every day for over two years?1. Free. Singleplayer. Turnbased. You just can't find many games that fit all three conditions.2. Nice clear interface. Ben Lee's artwork is beautifully clear and distinctive, making it easy to tell my chars apart. The boards are flat so my chars are never obscured by walls. Lots of useful information when you hover the mouse over things. Ability to mute the music and ambient sounds (they're not bad, I just don't like them in my games).3. SP doesn't force you to play against humans. It's a huge campaign of 73 modules (5 tutorial, 38 regular, 9 fan-made, 21 premium) most containing 3 battles and you can play every single one of them without ever facing a human opponent. (If you'd rather play against humans, at about level 5 you'll be invited to MP and given a free premade party to get you started. Then you'll have to play one more game against the AI to introduce MP rules (timers, draw limits) but after that you can disable AI opponents and play only humans from then on.)			"

Then you'll have to play one more game against the AI to introduce MP rules (timers, draw limits) but after that you can disable AI opponents and play only humans from then on.)			"

												Card Hunter has some interesting mechanics worth exploring, all wrapped up in a well-exectued, if well-worn, theme. This is the first game I played blending a card game with a tactical RPG and it does so very well, with your character's deck being based on their gear - which makes it very easy for the RPG fans out there to ease in to the deck-building. Being an RPG fan myself, I can't say that this system does much for the deck-building fans out there, however.Over all, it's a fun romp and worth a couple hours of your time, if just to check out the systems in play. After all, it's free!There are a few microtransactions offered, but none are necessary to progress fully through the game. I can't speak to PVP or Co-Op, as I've only played the Campaign.			"

You can have a ton of fun and even become highly ranked without spending anything.  If you do want to do a few more adventures you can pay a totally reasonable amount of money for this.

												A surprisingly fun little adventure game where you can either play solo with a party of your own characters, engage other players in multi-player colluseum-style matches, or group up with two other players and tackle challenges together. Progression of characters focuses on loot (which gives you different actions) and health, but the game mantains a consistent level of challenge regardless of what echelons you've climbed.In terms of pay-to-play content, it exists, but seems to consist mostly of special adventures (with special loot no doubt) and different models for your characters, but nothing must-have in order to enjoy the general premise of the game.Definitely more fun than I thought it was going to be, and something I have no doubt I'll senselessly pour lot's of time into.

												Not a complicated game, but don't take that to mean that it's an easy game. I'll preface by saying that ""technically"" this is a freemium game, as you purchase ""pizza"" that unlocks character skins, ""epic""  chests (versus the ""normal"" ones you can unlock with gold, which is acquired for free.)That being said though, don't let that at all disuade you from playing this. Not only is it addicting in its simplicity, it's also one of those rare free games that doesn't hit you with a paywall (that I've seen in the total time I've played.) Brief summary: you play against a Game Master (AI) and choose between three classes, and three races (not a huge selection, but they are varied enough that it makes a difference.) Then, you select modules to play, defeat the mobs, and gain loot/exp, which allows you to buy better equipment. The only twist is, it's a card based game, so each piece of equipment (or lack thereof) corresponds with a set of cards that will be added to your character's deck.If you like time killing, and a bit of a challenge, there's honestly no reason to NOT pick this up, as you'll get countless hours playing it at no cost (though I'm going to toss a few $$$ the devs way anyhow, as I appreciate them not using the Canadian Devil's Freemium strategies.) You'll find yourself coming back to this game. "

												Even if I played this game for only 7 hours now and only in singleplayer, I clearly recommend it!- You can even feel the care this game was developed with. These guys must REALLY love playing instead of making money.- The graphic style is awesome. - The playability is - a very little bit monotone but - really easy compared to some otther boardgames in real and on PC. - At least for me it has just the right little ammount of Text for a PC-""RPG"". Even some funny little outgame-events are not missing.- There is sh!tloads of stuff to collect and to build up you chars: optical and gearwise.- Unlike in most of modern free 2 play games, I dont feel forced to spend any money for ""additional stuff"" at all (especially this fact could even cause me to do so or to donate). ...This game is awesome for everybody who loves real boardbased RPG but hasn't enough time or a playgroup in real. Its exactly how I imagined a PC-version of a board-RPG has to be.I bow my knee for you, my Heroes! Long live the Gamemasters!			"

The die rolls are rigged, the AI will get a 6 three times in a row, and I can't even roll a 3. I wake up in the middle of the night with a cold sweat, vividly remembering that this game still exists on this gay, gay earth. This is the kind of game Oprah warns your mom about.  This is the kind of game that Hitler would have loved. This is the kind of game that thought Prohibition was a good idea. This is the kind of game that screws you left and right, forcing you to pay. This game is like the  fat ginger kid that stole your legos even though he has more legos than you. Just draw some characters on napkins and break your fingers with a hammer, it's cheaper and more fun. This game is the awesomenauts of awesomenauts. Lord help us all.			"

												Even if I played this game for only 7 hours now and only in singleplayer, I clearly recommend it!- You can even feel the care this game was developed with. These guys must REALLY love playing instead of making money.- The graphic style is awesome. - The playability is - a very little bit monotone but - really easy compared to some otther boardgames in real and on PC. - At least for me it has just the right little ammount of Text for a PC-""RPG"". Even some funny little outgame-events are not missing.- There is sh!tloads of stuff to collect and to build up you chars: optical and gearwise.- Unlike in most of modern free 2 play games, I dont feel forced to spend any money for ""additional stuff"" at all (especially this fact could even cause me to do so or to donate). ...This game is awesome for everybody who loves real boardbased RPG but hasn't enough time or a playgroup in real. Its exactly how I imagined a PC-version of a board-RPG has to be.I bow my knee for you, my Heroes! Long live the Gamemasters!			"

												Having spent so much time reading up on D&D and never actually playing it with friends, seeing this made me smile a little bit. Definitely something worth trying out if you're a fan of card games, but don't consider it P2W because it has microtransactions. With daily adventures and random l00t drops, this is an addictive experience that can only be described as heartbreakingly awesome. Heartbreaking because this was the very first time I ever stumbled onto a card game that was so perfect.			"

												I absolutely hate this marinara stain on the white t shirt of gaming. This game revolts me to the highest degree. This game is worse than slavery. This game did 9/11. The die rolls are rigged, the AI will get a 6 three times in a row, and I can't even roll a 3. I wake up in the middle of the night with a cold sweat, vividly remembering that this game still exists on this gay, gay earth. This is the kind of game Oprah warns your mom about.  This is the kind of game that Hitler would have loved. This is the kind of game that thought Prohibition was a good idea. This is the kind of game that screws you left and right, forcing you to pay. This game is like the  fat ginger kid that stole your legos even though he has more legos than you. Just draw some characters on napkins and break your fingers with a hammer, it's cheaper and more fun. This game is the awesomenauts of awesomenauts. Lord help us all.			"

												Essentially, the game that I have been waiting for for a very long time. My only issue with it is the fact that there is so much stuff, so many different cards that it is hard to keep an overview. Indeed, less is more. Although it is F2P, it is easily playable (caution: I'm only halfway) without spending money: there is no grind, it is challenging (sort of, AI does not really stand a chance against base cunning) yet no need for the player to pay to win.

												It didn't take long for me to get hooked after starting to play. I don't do much PvP, as I am more of a PvE kind of guy. The coop is great if you have 1 or 2 friends that are willing to play with you. I like the concept of getting cards through the gear you put on your character as it adds quite a bit of variety to the type of cards you can get and the amount of items in the game. Unfortunately PvP would seem like a Pay to Win type of deal since you can buy pizza slices a.k.a. the currency bought with real money, and buy the epic chests in the store. Despite that fact, it's still an addicting game, solo or with friends. The game is quite challenging if you don't use some strategy/teamwork with your friends.			"

												Played a lot of it on Kongregate.Glad I could port my save from there.Cleaner than most free to play games I've ran into.Don't remember seeing a crash when I played on Kongregate.Game itself is a mix of deck building and loot grinding.Expect to spend a LOT of time grinding adventures to create a team of murder machines.Let's talk about the elephant in the room: Pay-to-Win.Some of the adventures are behind a subscription wall.Yes, you can buy your way to a great set of gear, but the conversion rate from pizza slice to gold is 10 gold for each slice, and gold is the only way to buy single items.

												Do you like board games?Do you like card games?Do you like RPGs?Do you like games in general?If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you should not hesitate in at least giving Card Hunter a try!Play the campaign, and lead your own 3-man party through adventures  told by noob Game Master Gary and stuck-up veteran Melvin. Don't want to play by yourself in your parents basement? Have no fear! Play through the campaign as a single character, and team up with both friends and strangers online!Co-op not your thing? You can test your skills against others in both Ranked and League games!Don't even worry about the community! Although it's still somewhat small, the Card Hunter people cover all personalities! Some people try to micromanage your every move, but others are just having a grand time and everyone praises Leroy Jenkins in the chat without a second thought for strategy. It's good fun.A few things to note is that YES, this game does have a heavy amount of luck. You may draw a hand with nothing but movement cards, and your opponent may just happen to get every armor and block roll in the game. But in a game using both cards and dice, that's something to be expected!And this games Free-to-Play model is certainly not a bad one. Use real money to get some different Character Pieces, or unlock a few ""Treasure Hunt"" adventures that are completely unneccessary. Either way, it's a good time.8.7 / 10 go play it.			"

												Worth playing for a few hours because the campaign is quite challenging and fun in places but probably not worth getting really into. It's got quite a good strategic element to it but it is quite heavily based on the luck of the draw. For instance in one battle against the final boss in a stage I drew nothing but movement and defence cards for three turns in a row and it was able to fully heal itself back up whilst I was left with no option but to run away, regroup and hope against all odds that my priest actually drew one of his dozen unusued healing cards still left in the deck and my mage would finally get a couple attack cards.Admittedly it was satisfying when I finally managed to kill it after running around the whole level avoiding it for ten minutes but then on the next boss fight my mage drew three powerups at the start and then all my most powerful spells on the next go and just nuked it immediately.It often doesn't seem particularly clear why this happens when my character's only have one additional movement card in their decks on top of the default one yet have a tonne of attacks and heals that rarely ever seem to appear.The strategy comes from playing the hand you have as well as you can and that is good but it can be a little too random and unbalanced in this regard. I'm sure the multiplayer would be very annoying as a result but then I also suspect it is simply a pay to win job and not worth bothering with at all.Like all 'free to play' games the in-app purchases are completely extortionate and not even remotely sensible. Rather than buying all the extra single player levels you could buy two or three good games on here which don't try and bleed you for money. If they were sensibly priced at $5 for ten levels or something I might be tempted to unlock them but the day I shell out $20 multiple times on in-app content is the day I want someone to shoot me in the face because I'll clearly be braindead...

Funny, charming and challenging this game has completely got me under it's ""spell"". Heh heh. The f2P model is charmingly obscured so it never feels like you have to buy anything to succeed.I believe a game that's good will make you want to buy additional content not because you have to but because you want to and that is where this game succeeds.Definitely a must try for anyone who likes strategy, fantasy, boardgames, rpgs and pizza.

The mechanics are well thought out and the game is nicely presented.So far I have only tried single player, need to tell my friends about this to get some co-op testing going. But as far as the SP goes this game is completely free. There are ways to make things a little more convenient using money, but there is no need to use them. The single player campaign is quite enjoyable without spending money.So far I fully recommend testing the game for yourself, since it's for free.			"

												Card Hunter is a fun game and will give you a good 2-4 weeks of game play for no pay, unless you binge it--then you won't get as much out of it. Meh, your mileage may vary. I plateaued after a week, so take that for what it's worth. What's it like? Well, for an old guy like me, it's a pleasant bit of nostalgia. For younger players, it's a throwback to the old D&D tabletop games of well, my childhood--late 70's - early 80's, though a lot of the genre trappings of late 80's - late 90's are present. Let me tone it down a bit and explain.You get three generic characters with basic item slots. Pick an elf, dwarf, or human for each, and pick a warrior, mage, cleric for each. Each item slot grants access to certain cards you will play in battle. Adventuring leads to better gear which grants better powers. There is a rough storyline in the ""real"" world of the game where you are reading the things that others say to you.. a game master, his brother, the cute girl, etc. Nothing heavy or great. Some funny stuff, but very light. You can alternatively play multiplayer for quicker loot and gear. I waited until I finished the main campaign to engage in multiplayer, but you don't have to. I forget, however, how soon you can start, and the nice part is that the game lets you know.Each adventure has a little backstory you can read, as well as a little backstory in ""real"" life you can read as well. You move game pieces around a battle mat, taking turns with the computer. It's all pretty self-explanatory unless you're completely new to this sort of thing. The game holds your hand just long enough to get you up to speed, so don't worry if you are new. It's worth a try if you think you might like to experience a taste of tabletop roleplaying, without so much roleplaying--actually none. It's all hack and slash. Not complaining, just saying.Most of the campaign adventures were way too easy, but still fun for the most part. Later level adventures get significantly more difficult and sometimes require strategy as well as luck of the draw to win, depending on your gear and choices. The last few tended to be annoyingly difficult, but I can overlook that. I actually was more disappointed that the campaign stopped when it did. I wanted more solo play. You may feel differently. I get the feeling that the last few quests were uncharacteristically hard because someone felt it necessary to downplay the fact that there is no more free content afterward. Could be wrong, but I doubt it.The game gives you gold for completing quests and selling treasure rewards. Gear can't be sold until you make a few levels to decrease the chances you'll sell something you later wish you had kept. The game also gives you some pizza, which is the game currency that you will have to pay real cash to get once the freebies run out. They want you to spend it a certain way, which I think is a complete waste. Just my opinion. Here's a pro tip for you: If you can manage to play a LOT for a week, spend your pizza to get a one week membership. That way you'll get to keep the best treasures you earn rather than just gazing at them before moving on to the next battle. Because that's how it works, you open a chest and items appear. One item appears in a special box that you can only open if you are a paid member. Usually that item is a really good one. Not always, but early on it is. And don't laugh, some of those low level rares, epics, and legendaries are worth holding onto for later. Trust me.Now, about multiplayer. I find this aspect of the game more fun than playing chess with human beings. Some of the players are very good. Some are very arrogant and irritating. It's a mixed bag, but no better or worse than any other online community. Actually, it IS better than some communities. Here's another pro tip for you--for every game you ever play: Stay out of the online chat. The game developers have some strange ideas about who can play and who should be banned. Their game, their rules. I get it. Just not what I would do. I have kids who'd like to play the solo campaign, but nobody under the age of 13 is allowed to play. In a lot of ways that can be good, but if a good kid wants to play the solo adventures, I'm not sure why that's a problem. Remember when I mentioned my childhood- late 70's to early 80's? I was between the ages of 8 and 13 at that time. Just saying. Keeping the next generation of gamers away from your game isn't the smartest or most community-minded move, but rather a way of keeping old farts like me happy and spending money. But I digress. Anyway, there's also co-op, but I haven't played it, so I'm not going to comment on it. I will say, as for the pay aspect, in multiplayer, you can pretty much tell who's either spending most of their life in the game or spending cash to make it look as if they are.Anyway, if you think you'd like an interesting card game that uses tabletop pieces and strategy against human opponents that is easy to get into, you could do a lot worse. My biggest beef, however, is the way you kind of get forced into multiplayer after you finish the main quest, because, really, that's about all there is to do unless you pay to unlock extra adventures in the caimpaign map. Those may or may not be worth the dough. My guess is they are worth it if you like this game because, with the exceptions I noted above, the free content seems pretty much consistent overall. I enjoyed the game, but I didn't like it enough to spend the cash. It's worth trying.			"

												I still recommend it, but this game does get frustrating as hell after the level 10 missions.Basically, each ""item"" on your characters is 3-6 cards added to a ""deck"" from which you can potentially draw for your hand each turn, and these items are generated much like loot drops in an action RPG. Some items will provide a good mix of AOE cards, some items will provide direct damage, most items will be an unholy and utterly useless mishmash  with junk cards that you won't want in any situation and one card that you really want but probably will never draw because it comes buffered with garbage.Around level 10 you start getting encounters that you absolutely have to base your party gear (deck) around, and loot is pretty sparse. I liked the game enough to pay for a starter back wich gave me extra loot drop for most of my playtime, and am currently stuck in a quest that requires crowd control but I still never managed to find any good crowd control items (no up to level fire staves or axe based multi target attacks,) the few items I have will have 2 of the attack I want and 4 junk cards that I'll be more likely to draw.Despite that, the cash shop isn't strictly predatory, between level requirements on items and the fact that said items are fairly cheap to buy (it's just extremely hard to find something you want at the merchants,) but there will be wasted days where you'll grind lower level dungeons until merchant inventory resets, and there will be be a wall where each new mission takes 2-3 days of grinding before you beat it.

												Card Hunter is a fun game and will give you a good 2-4 weeks of game play for no pay, unless you binge it--then you won't get as much out of it. Meh, your mileage may vary. I plateaued after a week, so take that for what it's worth. What's it like? Well, for an old guy like me, it's a pleasant bit of nostalgia. For younger players, it's a throwback to the old D&D tabletop games of well, my childhood--late 70's - early 80's, though a lot of the genre trappings of late 80's - late 90's are present. Let me tone it down a bit and explain.You get three generic characters with basic item slots. Pick an elf, dwarf, or human for each, and pick a warrior, mage, cleric for each. Each item slot grants access to certain cards you will play in battle. Adventuring leads to better gear which grants better powers. There is a rough storyline in the ""real"" world of the game where you are reading the things that others say to you.. a game master, his brother, the cute girl, etc. Nothing heavy or great. Some funny stuff, but very light. You can alternatively play multiplayer for quicker loot and gear. I waited until I finished the main campaign to engage in multiplayer, but you don't have to. I forget, however, how soon you can start, and the nice part is that the game lets you know.Each adventure has a little backstory you can read, as well as a little backstory in ""real"" life you can read as well. You move game pieces around a battle mat, taking turns with the computer. It's all pretty self-explanatory unless you're completely new to this sort of thing. The game holds your hand just long enough to get you up to speed, so don't worry if you are new. It's worth a try if you think you might like to experience a taste of tabletop roleplaying, without so much roleplaying--actually none. It's all hack and slash. Not complaining, just saying.Most of the campaign adventures were way too easy, but still fun for the most part. Later level adventures get significantly more difficult and sometimes require strategy as well as luck of the draw to win, depending on your gear and choices. The last few tended to be annoyingly difficult, but I can overlook that. I actually was more disappointed that the campaign stopped when it did. I wanted more solo play. You may feel differently. I get the feeling that the last few quests were uncharacteristically hard because someone felt it necessary to downplay the fact that there is no more free content afterward. Could be wrong, but I doubt it.The game gives you gold for completing quests and selling treasure rewards. Gear can't be sold until you make a few levels to decrease the chances you'll sell something you later wish you had kept. The game also gives you some pizza, which is the game currency that you will have to pay real cash to get once the freebies run out. They want you to spend it a certain way, which I think is a complete waste. Just my opinion. Here's a pro tip for you: If you can manage to play a LOT for a week, spend your pizza to get a one week membership. That way you'll get to keep the best treasures you earn rather than just gazing at them before moving on to the next battle. Because that's how it works, you open a chest and items appear. One item appears in a special box that you can only open if you are a paid member. Usually that item is a really good one. Not always, but early on it is. And don't laugh, some of those low level rares, epics, and legendaries are worth holding onto for later. Trust me.Now, about multiplayer. I find this aspect of the game more fun than playing chess with human beings. Some of the players are very good. Some are very arrogant and irritating. It's a mixed bag, but no better or worse than any other online community. Actually, it IS better than some communities. Here's another pro tip for you--for every game you ever play: Stay out of the online chat. The game developers have some strange ideas about who can play and who should be banned. Their game, their rules. I get it. Just not what I would do. I have kids who'd like to play the solo campaign, but nobody under the age of 13 is allowed to play. In a lot of ways that can be good, but if a good kid wants to play the solo adventures, I'm not sure why that's a problem. Remember when I mentioned my childhood- late 70's to early 80's? I was between the ages of 8 and 13 at that time. Just saying. Keeping the next generation of gamers away from your game isn't the smartest or most community-minded move, but rather a way of keeping old farts like me happy and spending money. But I digress. Anyway, there's also co-op, but I haven't played it, so I'm not going to comment on it. I will say, as for the pay aspect, in multiplayer, you can pretty much tell who's either spending most of their life in the game or spending cash to make it look as if they are.Anyway, if you think you'd like an interesting card game that uses tabletop pieces and strategy against human opponents that is easy to get into, you could do a lot worse. My biggest beef, however, is the way you kind of get forced into multiplayer after you finish the main quest, because, really, that's about all there is to do unless you pay to unlock extra adventures in the caimpaign map. Those may or may not be worth the dough. My guess is they are worth it if you like this game because, with the exceptions I noted above, the free content seems pretty much consistent overall. I enjoyed the game, but I didn't like it enough to spend the cash. It's worth trying.			"

Get rid of all the pizza that cost real money and all the things like that and this game would be a shoe in for number one for a long time.  There is no pay wall.  You can play the game without paying money but you miss out on a lot of little things that would make the game more fun.  Sure you could pay but it is not a one time financial commitment to unlock the game, it is a subscription based commitment.  So really you never really own the whole game.			"

												This is easily one of my favorite free to play games. The play system is a fun and unique blend of board game and card game and the storyline (I use the term lightly) is nerdily fun. I'm pretty sure anyone who has ever played real life D&D has had a ""Melvin"" in their group, and this game nailed it. Anyway the campaign is pretty extensive and is seeing new content fairly regularly and the multiplayer is fun with a friendly and helpful community. I can't recomend highly enough. So don't waste any more time, and begin the quest for more loot.			"

												Worth playing for a few hours because the campaign is quite challenging and fun in places but probably not worth getting really into. It's got quite a good strategic element to it but it is quite heavily based on the luck of the draw. For instance in one battle against the final boss in a stage I drew nothing but movement and defence cards for three turns in a row and it was able to fully heal itself back up whilst I was left with no option but to run away, regroup and hope against all odds that my priest actually drew one of his dozen unusued healing cards still left in the deck and my mage would finally get a couple attack cards.Admittedly it was satisfying when I finally managed to kill it after running around the whole level avoiding it for ten minutes but then on the next boss fight my mage drew three powerups at the start and then all my most powerful spells on the next go and just nuked it immediately.It often doesn't seem particularly clear why this happens when my character's only have one additional movement card in their decks on top of the default one yet have a tonne of attacks and heals that rarely ever seem to appear.The strategy comes from playing the hand you have as well as you can and that is good but it can be a little too random and unbalanced in this regard. I'm sure the multiplayer would be very annoying as a result but then I also suspect it is simply a pay to win job and not worth bothering with at all.Like all 'free to play' games the in-app purchases are completely extortionate and not even remotely sensible. Rather than buying all the extra single player levels you could buy two or three good games on here which don't try and bleed you for money. If they were sensibly priced at $5 for ten levels or something I might be tempted to unlock them but the day I shell out $20 multiple times on in-app content is the day I want someone to shoot me in the face because I'll clearly be braindead...

												I've played this game for hundreds of hours over a couple of years prior to its release on Steam.Briefly, it's a fun, charming, challenging turn-based collectible card game with a neat tabletop theme. You move your characters around a dungeon game-board, and attack enemies, using cards drawn from the deck of cards each of your characters has. The most unique twist Card Hunter has on this genre is that your decks aren't built simply by placing whichever cards you want into your decks, but by equipping your characters with items, each of which brings several cards to the table. This means you have to weigh the advantages of the stronger cards on items against the disadvantages of their weaker cards.  It starts simple but very quickly will require you to tailor your decks to face specific challenges - such as trying to maximise the number of longer range attacks you bring when facing enemies that like to dance out of range of short range melee attacks.The free to play model has often been called *too* fair; you can get a remarkable amount of game without ever spending a cent. It isn't pay-to-win, and there's no difficulty-paywall to make you feel that you can't progress without paying; tailoring your decks and strategies will see you through all the challenges that seem too hard at first, rather than forking out for subscriber advantages. To be frank, most people who end up subscribing do so as much because the developers have earned it as much as to access subscriber priveleges.There are several multiplayer modes, and the primary one is deep, complex, challenging and immensely satisfying. I've played a hell of a lot of Hearthstone and Scrolls, and my wins in Card Hunter are far more exciting and satisfying than in either of those games. Other multiplayer modes (primarily Leagues) vary from more casual and random to differently challenging games using the same core systems, and they're a lot of fun too. The community is, by the standards of such games, excellent. You'll rarely have trouble getting help and tips, and it's very rare that people don't win or lose with good grace.All in all, if you like strategic turn-based games, and/or CCGs, and/or tabletop games, or if you're just curious about any of these things, you owe it to yourself to try Card Hunter out. I think it's probably the best free game I've ever played.Oh, a sidenote about the latest expansion which launched simultaneously with the game's release on Steam: I already loved this game a lot, but hell, these are the best, funniest, coolest campaign maps in the game! The nods to System Shock 2 seem cool until you realise that some of the devs *worked* on SS2, then the nods become mindblowing. I couldn't stop grinning the whole way through!The Steam client seems to be fine.			"

												I hadn't heard about this game before it got to Steam. I think what surprised me most about it was just how polished it feels. The UI is very smooth, the combat log clears up any confusions about what happens, and the occasional nerdy banter and tabletop feel adds a lot of humor to the game. The gameplay itself is also fun, it definitely doesn't feel like a ripoff of MTG or other card games.			"

												A nice blend of turn-based strategy RPG and card game. It makes for interesting encounters that can vary based on the class makeup of one's party. Great artwork and in-game modules paying homage to D&D. The challenge is a gentle slope, and I never felt pressured to purchase any kind of boost from the store.There's a narrative that plays out within the back drop of a fictional table-top session - so it actually has a story (of sorts).

												The game has promise, but it really feels like a D&D session run by an amaturish DM such as the one the game depicts. There are three classes (fighter, mage, cleric) and three races (human, elf, dwarf), each with a handful of mechanics you can build to focus on. But the encounters in the game increasing feel like, ""there's one mechanic I want you to use this time, and by God if you don't abuse it, I will slaughter you."" If you try to buck the system and play your own style, well...After the umpteenth time of watching the enemy roll four sixes in a row, and then watching my team fail to roll more than a two five times in a row ... you get the feeling that the RNG elements in this game are worse than stuff like Xcom or Fire Emblem. Then it takes four clicks to get back into the fight after getting the shaft from the random number god. It takes even more to bail out on an adventure sequence in progress. (You have to forfeit up to three times in a row to exhaust your continues). An example of bad RNG and balancing: Monsters almost always come in groups. This means they get to share a hand. That means any monster in the group can use all the attacks. But wait! It gets worse: every creature in the group gets to use all of the block and armor cards. Over and over again if they are keep cards. And you can stack armor cards. As deep as you want. (Think wyverns with a 3+ to ignore 4 damage and immunity to electricity, three cards deep. That's only a 3.5% chance of getting through!!!) Add that to the fact that monsters have what seems to be a dozen card deck (as opposed to the ~30-40 card deck players have), they always seem to draw what they need. I'm pretty sure the computer cheats to make unrevealed cards in the computers hand exactly what they need if the computer is losing. And you're guaranteed to draw at least one move card, but not attack/heal/magic for your three classes, so you frequently find yourself inundated with move cards. This gets frustrating as you only have 2 retries on a level before having to pay in-game currency so you can't save scum your way through this.It's also disappointing that there isn't some pay this much and remove all F2P elements from the game option. You can buy stuff, but there's no one way to get everything and the timers on the shops and levels remain regardless. The fact that your card club or whatever runs out on real time days and you rebuy it with pizza (ie, real money) is quite insidious. It's actually a subscription. I at least enjoyed the classic D&D aesthetic.			"

												This could have been a good game.  I wanted to like it.  It has a sense of humor about old style RPGs, y'know.  Pencil & paper ones.But I can't like it.  The game play, while simple, is too frustrating.  In pretty much every single player scenario, luck rules the day.  You can design your gear as best you can, but drawing cards is random, and you can't save many from round to round.  Use em or lose em, regardless of any sense it makes to do.  Interestingly, while you get random draws, the AI seems to have a lot of very small numbers of options, so it -always- has exactly what it needs to kill you.Every time.So scenarios that claim they are for level 10 parties actually means you should be at least level 16 to have a chance of winning without trying it three dozen times, and it only lets you replay a certain number of times a day.  Then there's that pesky luck based award system that sometimes means you need to be even stronger than that.PvP is completely broken, with pay2win players dominating everything.  Even if you chance upon a less broken player in the completely random matching system, if you weren't lucky enough to have found decent equipment in the solo play, you are again screwed.  And when I say completely random, I mean it.  Your arena ranking number means absolutely nothing to the game and it will happily put you up against players who are far superior to your meager crap cards repeatedly.Good concept, good writing, wish I could see the rest of the story line, but I hate the game play too much to keep it installed on my computer.

												Card Hunter started out as a browser game and got me hooked before it's release on Steam.  It is a fusion of D&D and deckbuilding.  Every piece of loot you collect adds specific cards to each of your party members' decks.  You draw cards each turn and try to make the most out of your spells, melee attacks, heals, and movements.  Dice rolls are made with many of the blocking cards so there is an element of chance.  Other than that, the rest of battle is affected by how you build your decks.  This game is free so it's definately worth a try.  You can pay actual money to gain access to more loot, campaigns, and cosmetics.  If you like turn-based combat and/or deckbuilding, you'll love Card Hunter.			"

												To say this is a free game Card Hunter  is oozing with content. If you have a couple of friends who you know will enjoy playing a D&D esque game then you should download it instantly as you will have hours of fun and entertainment. While the character customization is basic it does give you quite a few options to make your character unique and suit your playing style. As im writing this review me and a friend have been playing this game for almost four hours straight and we are still only on the first island as the game does over a slight challenge but as long as you look at the map and work out how to manuver it without getting your self trapped in a tight spot then you shouldnt die too many times. If you couldnt tell i highly recommend this game and believe that it is worth your time.			"

												Yes I know, I've only very briefly played this game but hear me out. For starters there's nothing inherently wrong with this game at first glance, it looks nice, plays well, decent gameplay, leveling system etc etc, I was all set to love this game appart from one massive game breaking (in my case) oversight, no resolution options ingame or pre-load, this lead to everything being ""slightly to the right"" of where my cursor actually was and by slightly I mean a good centimetre or two and yeah I could of grinned and bared it but frankly it ruined the game for me then and there, I slugged through the first level, tried to sort the resolution issue and then came here to write this review. Resolution support should be a standard in games these days, for that reason alone this isn't getting recommended but for a free game it's pretty good, pick it up if your monitor can support it.			"

												I've played this for two years already via Blu Manchu's site. This is the only multiplayer game to date I've ever sank money into, mainly because I want to reward the devs for their hard work maintaining such a good game. But it's definitely not pay-to-win; I played free for six months before I decided to invest. The mechanics are simple, yet very deep in multiplayer, and there are multiple play styles and ways to win. There's a great community and the devs are friendly and approachable, and incorporate user feedback/content into the game. Get into it, it's great.			"

Real Money gets you cosmetic stuff, extra content and one extra loot for completing missions by subscribing to the ""Card Hunter's Club"" (loot which is randomly rolled, can even be a lowly common item, no ""exclusive"" items for paying at all), which in my book does not qualify for being ""Pay to Win"" by a long shot.The game is a mix of Turn Based tactical battles with Card Game mechanics. Beautiful and charming graphics, great personality and atmosphere.			"

												No, it's not like D&D (In any meaningful capacity, anyway) and no, the microtransactions most certainly AREN'T purely cosmetic. So where are all these reviews coming from that are saying that it is? Well, at least trying it out so you can be disappointed that it's an awkward mash up of turn-based RPG and a TCG to the detriment of the mechanics of both genres is totally free. So it has that going for it.			"

The luck component to the decks was just too unpredictable. It basically ruins the otherwise fun turn based game.			"

												This game is hilarious to the point of being fun. Personally I love the games that this one is making fun of (not in a bad way) and find myself going along with the gameplay. Card hunter combines a tabletop's strategy and card collecting aspect with the humor of a parody on the franchise as a whole.Gameplay is fun, though sometimes it could be said that it is repeating, and getting higher gear takes some time.Overall, if you are into table-top/car collecting/strategy/semi-RP games, with a more than just a hint of humor, then this game is definitely for you9/10			"

												Pretty coo, combines card games with the DnD style of RPG's.  Decks built by equipping armor wich have preset cards in them, adding to your deck! Pretty neat idea.  Theres loot after every level, instant gratification! having fun so far, doesnt seem pay to win, tho im only lvl 7 atm, but it is pay to enhance, it has a pay for membership, which all it seems to add is a free random loot bonus, it gives you 1 extra loot (which you can see if you dont have the service and u can purchase the service if u like the item on the spot), will match rarity if u get an epic, but completely unnecesary, just helpful. has co-op and versus modes!

												I have been playing this game now for almost 2 years.  It's a great mix of turn based tactical game and collectable card game.  It is a F2P title but the developers are very good at developing a model that avoids the pay-to-win syndrome.  You can spent money to get random loots faster, buy certain premium quest modules, and cosmetic figure outfits.From my prospective, one of the best part about this game is the fact that each game could be done in 10-20 minutes or less and there's no problem with taking a break.  So it's a really good game for people who are busy and can't spent more than 30 - 40 minutes at a time.All in all, this game has kept me entertained for a long time now, and I look forward to additional contents from the developer to keep this game growing.

												Neat concept, but before getting in deeper it hits you with the Pay2win mallet way to agressively. It seems that every other feature/item requires payment, which after two hours is a bit harsh. Maybe I would have spent money on it later on (as I have on other games of the same type - if I have hours of fun with it, I'm ok to grab my wallet), but this way it is just impossible to judge whether this will become a bottomless moneysink.Waste of a perfectly nice game, sadly.

												 Very fun aspects of the game. However there are two major issues that really limit it. First off the leveling system they have in place doesn't let you replay any previous dungeons if they are a couple levels below you. If you try your level will be drastically reduced, you won't get any experience whatsoever, and because of your artificially reduced level you will also now be too low level to use your own gear! So apparently you are expected to constantly lug around tons of worthless low level gear for your party just in case you want to play any scenario deemed below you (which is generally like 90 percent of them) and you will also get nothing whatsoever out of it. FUN! Second it's very micro transaction heavy. There are a very large number of skins, and now scenarios (including the new Penny Arcade ones) that you simply CANNOT play unless you pay. This is not an issue of paying to advance more quickly, this is literally walling off part of the game forever unless you pay up. I'd much rather just pay once for a full priced game than this nickel and dime b.s. Avoid until/if they ever figure out a better pay structure			"

												There are plenty of reasons to play this game, but I cannot recommend it due to the game itself.It's easy to end up with no way to move out of an enemy that is stacked full of attacks that will kill you, but because you don't have any movement cards you're screwed.Due to this it's almost definitly a good thing to play as Elves because of their long movement range, but I do have a feeling that the game encourages you to play different races with different abilities.Due to the games cards it's very random if you succeed or fail a hard level, sometimes you can get wiped one play and utterly massacre the next due to RNG, so if you like that, Great! If you hate it? Well we will probably agree, it's not a fun game because of it.Then there is the proof of ""Free to pay"" game it is where it offers you special games and extra loot if you pay for a premium currency, however it's based in IRL time and it doesn't matter if you sunk 500 dollars on it earlier, if you just ran out you will be left without anything in the future. Unless you pay more.			"

												This game is so much fun. It's a board game that uses card game mechanics for combat, the cards in your deck are set by the equipment your characters have. The combat is in small 5 to 10 (usually) minute chunks so you can invest as much or as little time per session as you want. It's also an homage to old school D&D, with many of the chapters fashioned after classic modules. It is free with a P2P element, but (at least initially) it isn't as in your face as a lot of games are. Some people won't like paying the approximately $10-$12 to unlock content (a special dungeons pack and 2 expansions as of this writing each cost around that price) but it seems like there is enough content even without that. Did I mention there is PvP and multiplayer co-op? If you like strategy board games, card games, or old school D&D, you will love this game. Highest recommendation.			"

												This is basically Dungeons and Dragons, minus some of the boring parts, -95% human interaction (if you multiplay), and none of your fancy dice. Each session is fairly short. Although grinding can be repetitive, the rarer item drops happen often enough to make it not too much a chore.I was very tempted to pay for extra campaigns, but the total cost would be too much and the monthly club thing is just silly imho. Will buy the campaigns when there's a discount. :) Highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the pencil and paper version.			"

												I am only in the early parts of the game but so far it is very enjoyable. The game is a nice mix between card games and tabletop games.The game takes a tabletop game similar to Dungeons and Dragons and adds in a cards that effect your hero's. The interface is well designed and the main story is well created.The game is simple but very, very fun!Also the only thing that you 'can' payfor is a membership of sorts which helps you progress faster. However this is not needed and you can enjoy the game without paying anything.			"

												A great game with nice ideas, destroyed by always online and pay to win sytem (each time you open a chest you won't get the great item unless member). The game would have been wonderfull if it was a full and fair game that you just buy for 20 bucks. but no here you need to pay pizza slices at outragous prices and you can become member for just 10 bucks... (price of some great MMORPGs) and that to have your game hang every 2-3 combats because of connection problems with their server while you play the solo version... good luck with that attitude, i just boycott these kind of ridicilous ways of doing business. I like compagnies that make games with love not greed, and it's getting very very rare.			"

												I played this game a lot for a couple weeks when it originally released as a browser game. Its a good concept for a TBSRPG that is sadly marred by some bad browser game interfaces and worst of all, horrendously predatory cash shop practices. DL'd the steam version hoping they were satisfied with what they've inevitably milked out of saps with a longing in their heart for the ol' tabletop. Evidently they are not. If you want to enjoy even the single player element completely it'll run you 30ish bucks for the 2 ""expansions"" plus an additional SUBSCRIPTION fee (lol). Even purchasing the 20 dollar (ON SALE!!) premium ""basic edition"" pack only gets you one month of their, frankly revolting, subscription based grind aid. Needless to say the multiplayer element is essentially pointless in any numbers game with a cash shop, so there's that as well.Ultimately, the gameplay is pretty solid. I would definitely recommend giving the single player a whirl for a bit if you feel interested. Just do not spend a single red cent on anything in the game if you have any respect for yourself or video games in general. It is truly a shame they didn't just release this game on a buy to play basis for steam, or at least let you permanently upgrade to a ""bought edition"" instead of keeping the micro-trans, and the ludicrous subscription-to-a-browser-game concept, firmly in place.

												There's really three aspects to this game - campaign, special campaign levels, and multiplayer.Campaign is entertaining for a few hours, before it becomes obvious how it's the same over and over. Then it's and endlessly repetitive grind. Also somewhat too easy on every level. Special campaign levels (Mauve Manticore) really goes the opposite way as the mother of all RNGs. You are forced into 30-50+ retries just because it was literally impossible with the cards you were given. Like you have 4 turns to kill an enemy and you are given no weapon cards, just block and move. As the special campaign levels are visible on the campaign map like every other level, I really want to complete them - but it's seriously idiotic how they are 98% RNG-dependent. Buying all the DLC is $45. Multiplayer I haven't tried.			"

												If your looking for a really great turn based Rpg? Then dont come here. Unless you prefer your games to be purely luck based and your a total masocist then this is not a game for you. It has a cool concept but extremely poor execution. The armor in this game is extremely broken and whenever your facing an AI the AI always roles perfectly and blocks every attack and you can never seem to block them. If your only interested in the Multiplayer then sorry, you still have to face an AI opponent first that starts off with gear ment for the middle or end of the campaign. This game was a constant frustration for the 4 hours i played this and it wasnt worth the few hours i did spend on it. All in all i'd give this game a 1/5, it had a good concept and has decent visuals but the gameplay is terrible and the ""story"" is mediocre at best.			"

Inventory is a mess, you have to spent 5-10 minutes to create decks for a specific adventure which can easily become disastrous thanks to the luck mechanics.If you have time, download free version but please don't buy anything.You'll regret.

												I started off liking this game, but as a fan of strategy games over time increasingly I found less to like about playing it. As you advance the game pits you against increasingly stacked odds. The problem is your cards are all drawn random, so if you do not get just the right draw combination on many maps there is no recovery and you have to start over. Not that random cards are totally bad, it is just that your opponent does not seem to follow the same rule. Your cards are random but the computer seems to have attack cards, move cards and defense every turn. Random cards for the PC would have balanced play but it does not appear to be designed that way.Some may like this style but to me anyway this totally negates strategy in the game, it comes down to random card draws and luck. If you find frustration and yelling at the computer when you need an attack card and get all move cards, die and have to start over, this is the game for you. Me personally it is being uninstalled. Nice idea to mirror an old table top game, but poor implementation.			"

												Game seems to get near-impossible starting at lvl 10-11, unless u start paying up for more stuff, sooo, there's that. Well they have to make money somehow, but i still didn't like it. Character progression is slow, the only stats that increases with level is hp and only 1 point every 2-4 lvls depending on your class and race. Also you cant grind, as missions that are 2 lvl under u dont give any XP, so you can never be overleveled. Items and damage don't seem to scale that well with enemy damage, difficulty curve is nuts, especially when enemies can get more cards than you and attack through walls/unlimited range.			"

												game is good for a few minutes, until you realize that it is just a money grab. as you progress LITERALY half of the levels are unplayable (locked) unless you pay REAL money to unlock them. the few levels that are unlocked get brutal so that they force u to play levels that you have already beaten OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER until you hopefully FINALLY get a level and can try to beat the game breaking levels pit you against enemies that can hit you from clear accross the map, and kill you before you can even make it near them. on top of that, the entire looting system is a grab at your money.. as they show you the loot that you COULD have on a pillow.. then, when u pay the money for a 7 day loot expansion or whatever, the quality of the loot goes down, in an attempt to get you to pay even more money for further rewards. i am so tired of people taking a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ decent idea.. then just ruining it with greed and lies. this game is in no way FREE TO PLAY. if anything, this game is 'free to attempt to play.' meaning that the game will force you into monotany if you dont give it cash. if you dont pay cash the level curves will force you to spend DAYS literally DAYS playing the same lower levels for SEVERELY reduced rewards. i have lost all faith in steam at this point.. every other game on steam is a pay to win game anymore.. riddled with bugs, released way before its finished, and constantly pushing for you to spend real money in game... it doesnt make any sense.. how has gaming become this? i used to be proud to be a nerd, and proud to be a gamer.. playing real games, like Azure Dreams, Final Fantasy Tactic, Star Ocean, etc.. now it is a sickening grab for cash, a disgusting expoitation of our love for gaming.. this isnt even a game, like most steam games, it appears to be a game, however, it is really just a machine that is designed to lure you in with lies, gain your interest, then exploit you for money if you want to experience the game properly.. im sickened.. truly sickened by this game.

												As a fun game to kill time, i can't recommend it, because it's Luck: The Game.Your cards are drawn randomly, so you can get, for example only moving cards when you need to kill last enemy, or only attack cards when you are far away from any enemy. And since you need to discard all but two cards in hand, at the end of the round, you can't do any elaborate tactics, if you lack the walking/attacking card.Also some (i mean most) cards have random chance to activate, eg: roll +4 to block attack; for some reason enemies can roll 6 all the time, which means your attack does nothing, while your block/parry get 1-2, means enemies get all the damage on you.

												Pay to winThe campaign is fun to play through the first time. The multiplayer is not fun. The futuristic direction made previous cards useless. The RWG on loot and during play gets old. The random generation generally doesn't give you enough rare cards in relation to how many times you have to win against players who simply bought their decks. There is rampant cheating and people taking advantage of leaderboard mechanics. Cheaters can see your cards and magically have a counter. People take advantage of the leaderboards by intentionally trashing their own rank in order to get ""consecutive wins"". The mechanics of how cards work is also confusing. Combinations are difficult to create unless you spend the time to understand the mechanics of a card rather than what it actually says.It was fun for a while but, it's not sustainable gameplay.			"

												Card hunter is a typical microtransaction game. Its very hard, not just hard, after lvl 10-15 you will find just impossibly hard adventures, skill not helps, nothing, just pure random. It designed this way. You will think better items will help so you will buy chests, but it doesnt. I imagine developers buff those adventures until they can beat it and if they werent able anymore they just laughing and they thinking something like: ""good, they will waste time and will still suffer, hahahaha"" Those adventures just way too hard this is a timesink RNG game. It could be otherwise as you unlock additional adventures with ingame purchases, i did so. Guess what? i wasnt able to beat even first adventure one of those DLC:-) and according to achievements it has a hard mode aswell, oh god, i dont want to know how impossible is that. I dont say these are unbeatable, but because of random you need a lot of try. I forgot to mention, you have 3 tries for 3 or more different level on a single adventure, additional tries cost gold.........			"

												Solid game that is, in my opinion, hurt by a reliance on luck.I may come back and do an expanded review later, but for now I'll keep this short. The game on its face is fun, but the combat relies HEAVILY on random dice rolls. A string of bad rolls WILL mean that you fail a mission, no matter how skilled you are or how well you've built your characters. Add to that the enemies seeming to get very powerful cards just a little ways into the game (rank 7 missions, and even earlier) and it can get immensely frustrating incredibly quickly. It may be that enemies have smaller decks than the player characters do, which means key cards (armor, powerful attacks, etc) come up more than they do for the player, or it may just be my poor luck, but at the end of the day, when no amount of strategy can win in the face of a string of bad luck, I can't recommend this game. In my opinion, a certain degree of luck in games is fine, but when the ability to even make an attack comes down to luck of the draw, I think that hurts the game. It's not a bad game by any means when the other components are taken into consideration (art is good, the tone of the game is humorous, and the mechanics for character progression and deck building are fun) but it is very frustrating when battles are won or lost based almost purely on RNGs.

												TL;DR I would not recommend CardHunter. The game mechanics are interesting and fun but it is pay-to-not having to grind and you are playing an RPG without story or immersion or atmosphere.It is such a shame that a really great idea for mechanics is wasted because of greediness (asking money for content and loot) and laziness (no story, animations, atmosphere).PROs:- Game mechanics are unique and interesting. It is basically a puzzle game (which gear to equip for which battle) meet tactical combat a la XCOM.- The whole ""meta"" aspect - you play someone who is playing a game - is funny (for about 15 minutes).CONs:- The devs ask you every 5 seconds for real money. Big portions of the game are only available when paying for it. Image that in The Witcher you are being asked to pay 4 Euros to enter this dungeoun. The game really is all about loot (cards). Every single action a character can perform - even to walk - comes from cards which come from equipment. Loot is everything, levels are nothing. Now, you can grind your way to victory over countless hours or simply pay cash to get loot. At the same time, the  price per month is about the same as for a triple A MMORPG, WTH?- Multiplayer is very asymmetrical, players do not get even chances because single player loot is used.			"

												The game is fun up until about level 5 level 6ish where you can't play any further due to lack of proper cards and gear. This is where the 'f2p' ends and you have to start fishing out real money to buy 'pizza' to buy gear or subscribe so you get the bonus gear in dungeons which is even MORE money. OR you can go back and grind a few dungeons, BUT this requires anything that you used a power core on to be removed because you no longer have that. So you lose equipment in order to redo earlier dungeons which makes them pretty much as difficult as they were the first time around FOR LESS EXP AND GEAR than the first time you ran it. So it is all pointless if you don't plan on spending money. On top of the fact that you can't really redo a dungeon unless you wait a day for it to cooldown in order to get as much as you can out of it. Its a good timekiller for about 30 minutes and then it requires cash. Would not play again, deleting it from my steam.			"

												 While a simple, funny tabletop tactical RPG inspired video game, (notably by games, like ""D&D"") this game is therefore, a LOT more simple, and costs less money, than having to pay for stuff, just to play tabletop ""Dungeons & Dragons"" with felllow gamers. While this game is nothing phenomenal, or anything special, it's best to play, if it's simply for free. At least I kinda prefer this, over tabletop D&D, which I actually got bored of, and QUIT, for reasons I refuse to explain; at least not in public.

												Card Hunter did make a decent first impression with the interesting table-top theme and selected mechanics.  Other reviewers have covered those well enough.I gave it a fair shake with over a dozen hours of play this week so I'm here to tell you that playing this game beyond the first impression is awful.  The table-top theme becomes very burdensome, limiting the maps to roughly 1/3-1/2 of a 16:9 monitor.  The fancy dice or whatever that you see in the screenshots are useless borders.The ""DM"" is a series of running jokes about pizza, pimples, living in Mom's basement, etc.  They provide ZERO atmosphere to the game but constantly interrupt the flow of your party's grind as you have to acknowledge each inane comment to continue playing.In addition to being tiny, the maps are exceedingly boring combinations of terrain squares.  The art is so bad that you have to examine each tile to get an understanding of the intended impact on movement or line of sight and good luck remember them all.  Once you've decided how your party will be built, you'll play every map exactly the same way.Multiplayer is immediately accessible since your multiplayer team is max level.  You still have to grind for equipment, however, although I see that you can purchase ready-made and equipped teams for multiplayer games.  One team is provided, armed and ready, for free.  Multiplayer, however, is exactly the same as playing generic campaign boards only with (sometimes) superior intelligence.  I enjoyed the handful of games I played, then watched a couple of more games, and never felt the need to try it again.Anyways, I wanted to love it but recommend giving this one a pass. "

Name: Card HunterDeveloper: Blue ManchuDate: 2013Genre: Card Tactics, CCGPopulation: AlivePerspective: 2.5D - IsometricTimeflow: Match-Based, Turn-Based, Fast-PacedSkills: BrainSetting: FantasyStyle: TabletopTags: RPG ElementsModel: F2PContent: Collectible, Microtransactions, SubscriptionPlatforms: PC, Mac, BrowserReview: Tabletop styled fantasy mix of tactics, RPG and CCG. You have a table, game master, plain paper battle map, different papers with stats, story and all other info; dices, decks, characters in form of plain cardboard tokens, and sounds that fit tabletop atmosphere perfectly. I mean the style is 11/10. It received ""PC Gamer: Most Original Game of the Year 2013"" award - I guess that was the main reason, because... gameplay is pretty boring as for me.	Every battle you control 3 characters: Warrior, Mage and Cleric. Each character has his own deck, and item slots. Each equipped item adds its cards to that character deck. Yes they don't give any stats, there are actually no stats at all (but hp) and no auto-attacks. Character levels increase amount of item slots and hp.	So, for example your Warrior deck has 40 cards. His Rare Sword gives him 6 cards, including 1 Rare Smash, 2 Uncommon Punches and 3 Common Strikes. Uncommon Boots give him 1 Uncommon Run, 1 Common Walk and 1 Common Weak Armor. Common Shield gives him 2 Common Blocks and 1 Common Armor. And so on.	Each round all characters draw 3 cards from their decks, with only exception that at least 1 card will always be Move card. So yes, there will be situations when your Warrior has drawn all Armor cards and won't be able to attack till next round at best. Each turn player chooses 1 card of 1 character and plays it. When all players passed the turn, all characters choose 2 cards and discard the rest, and next round begins.	Just like in any CCG, there are a lot of nuances like line of sight, direction the unit is facing, terrain types, armor and penetration mechanics based on dice rolls, buffs/debuffs, trait cards that have to be played at yourself at the beginning of round, terrain enchantments, knockbacks, damage types (crushing, piercing, lightning, arcane, etc.) and... well I don't know them all because I only played few hours :O	Campaign seems to be pretty huge - the map is, at least, and I only discovered several missions - a tiny part of it. Each mission has few battles on different terrain with different monsters and a (simple) story. And the loot, of course - you get new equipment and/or ""treasure"" items which are only good to sell. Go to the shop between missions, sell them and buy something you actually need. You can change equipment between battles and before the next try, if you lost. You only have 3 tries and then you have to restart mission. 	Surprisingly, goals don't always end up being ""kill everything"", some are interesting. There are also Treasure Hunts, which are only unlocked with premium currency which is Pizza Slices :p	Multiplayer should be fun as well, but I didn't try it since you have to level up your characters and get some cards in campaign first to get there, and I did not ;p There are dailies also, as far as I know.	Microtransactions are used for levels, cosmetics and items. I can't say for sure, since I didn't play much but the game doesn't look like P2W. Steam reviews also say it's not. With premium you get 1 extra loot item each battle, some hidden levels, you can buy more things in shop and therefore probably collect Rare cards faster. But just like in GOOD CCGs, luck with drops and patience decides much more.	So why my verdict here is No, and why is it No without doubts? 2 things. 	First, I don't like how Cards are drawn. I don't know if it's the style or just lack of talent, but this is just TOO simple. Check screenshots. I mean I could draw such art, too, and these are not empty words. I understand this isn't MTG with its several dozens professional artists, most of which dedicated whole life drawing fantasy. But come on, this is CCG after all. There is no way I am collecting cards that look like 10y.o drawing. Characters, monsters, terrain, illustrations - everything else looks fine.	And second - as for me, gameplay is boring - maybe original, but boring. There is no excitement when you do smart tactical decisions and win, which I have in Hearthstone or MTG.	P.S. Don't forget - there are ABSOLUTELY no animations in game, except poorly made spell effects. Since it is Tabletop-styled. You don't have much animations when you play board games, do you? Facial expressions don't count ^^Class: III - BreadVerdict: NoReviewed: 8.24.2015Approach: Steam - PCTime: Several HoursDeeds: 1 Achievement "

												at first it is fun, but then becomes increasing frustrating unless you're really lucky or plan to spend a lot of money on the ""free"" game.  After getting a party to level 5, I replayed the older missions for loot and experience.  A Lev 3 mission I replayed involved am orc chieftain who has an attack that either one shots or two shots my characters and has enough health that I can't kill him without losing at least 2 of my 3 characters.  I must have got lucky on my card draws the first time through because the mission seems impossible even though my party is 2 levels ahead of the mission....after trying a few times, I give up...stupid stupid game			"

												After playing this game a fair amount, I cannot recommend it...ever.Pros:- Great board look and design- Nostalgic ride to those days where there were no consoles or computers.- Simple to learn- Capacity to revisit maps for different loot- A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of loot variety- But that's it...Cons (here, the crap hits the fan really):- No tactics or strategy at all...just plain luck to win...IF you win.- Only 3 classes to play- You always draw cards that you don't need.- Much of the loot is useless- Pay to win at 100%- AI blocks EVERYTHING...you block nothing...- Grindfest- Repetitive- You are ALWAYS overwhelmed since AI has loads of npcs and you can nver have ore than 3 chars- Cards have random crap that has nothing to do with the class- The game makes you grind endlessly until you are actually capable of killing the next level npcs.- Difficulty is ridiculously high- I stress again the LUCK factor: no point in planning decks or strategies.- Low epic drop rate...mostly you will get garbage after a huge effort to finish a level.- It's like going to a Casino.- Avoid at all costs. If you want a board game type...this ain't it.			"

												Card Hunters features a lot of interesting ideas, but these ideas are bogged down by a wide variety of basic problems, the biggest of which is the fact that it is a pay-to-win game.Some of the smaller problems this game features include the fact that you can't sell gear you don't need for way longer than makes sense, the game is a grindfest that decides you can't grind at dungeons that don't meet the arbitrary level range based off your own level, and Melvin. Seriously, Melvin sucks. These issues didn't seem like such a problem to me when I first played this game on a flash games site, but as a steam game I feel like it's not up to snuff.Unless you really enjoy card-based combat featuring module art and other aesthetics that try really hard to look reminiscent of the first two editions of D&D, I wouldn't recommend Card Hunters			"

												There are good free-to-play games (e.g.- Dota2, Path of Exile) and bad ones (e.g.- anything by Zynga). Unfortunately, this falls squarely into the latter category.It's a clever concept, no doubt. And despite some trashy pitfalls (your ""GM"" is an utter unlikable fellow, and I'm sick of his voice already), the fundamentals like combat mechanics, pacing, and interface are decent. But it's the F2P ""features"" that weasel their way into the game that really suck the fun out of it.First, the big one: you can't repeat quests more than once per day. This is what really turns me off. Once you've run what's on the map, you're done. Go play something else. This is a direct result of their F2P model: it artificially limits your characters, and paying ""Pizza"" (their in-game currency) allows you to bypass this somewhat.Second, despite what others have said, there *are* pay-to-win features here. It's not all cosmetic.Third, they shove it in your face. There's a ""membership club"" (read: pay us for more items), which awards more loot at the end of dungeons. Regardless of whether you've signed up or not, they roll an item reward and lock it if you're not a member.I get it. Casual gaming is a tough market, and getting free-to-play right is hard. Too much and your game looks like a trashy ebay ad; too little and you don't get a paycheck. That said, they didn't even come close to the right balance here.I'll pass, thanks.			"

												Meh.   Interesting game play.  The graphics are about what you'd expect for a java based game, but if you're playing this game you probably are much more interested in the atmosphere and game play.Each dungeon is basically a set of room battles, and cards are dealt to both sides that they can use during the fight to move, heal, hack... etc.  The biggest issue for me was that after each room battle was completed, your health and card deck was completely reset, so worrying about future battles at all doesn't play into the current battle. Progression of your characters is somewhat stiffled if you don't purchase an extra loot ""slot"" that gives you an extra toy after you win a fight, increasing your chances of getting better gear.  The game has other areas littered with pay for play ""opportunities"", which in my opinion is never justified, although for a game of this caliber, is plain silly on a computer platform.  This game is belongs on I-pads or other such limited computing power devices, and is probably a little below average in those markets.  All in all, if you have an game pad, X-Box or are 12 years old, this game may hold some limited draw for you.  It's definetely not a D&D tribute, or even that in depth.   But for a free download, it could hold your attention for a couple days if you're an RPG or adventure fan.I do applaud the effort though.  We neeed more games like this in the genre, but a more depth and challenge would be nice for me.			"

												'Sunset. Or maybe dawn? Who knows..', Cuddlepie thought.It felt like days ago when he and his friends last saw the sky. They had been crushing and slashing their way through zombies and skeletons for too long, way too long. Mr Jingles had already fallen... Wouldn't be long before fatigue got the best of him also.  'Damn our luck..', he mumbled. Their cart crashed probably at the worst place ever. He just knew that cottage was bad news. He could feel it, and his fears proved correct when the dead appeared and never stopped coming. They had hoped it would be just a few, easy to get rid of. But that was just wishful thinking.Boppsy made a tough decision, but it was the right one. Perhaps someone else would have ignored the sinister laughs and the cries for help from the cottage and just run away. But not them. It was obvious that whatever evil lurked inside the cottage had to be dealt with, once and for all.  'By me beard, young lady, FOCUS!'. His thoughts were interrupted by Boppsy's fierce voice.  'I am trying, you silly dwarf! I already put that giant skeleton in the other cell, do you think teleporting others is as easy as swinging a hammer?' The wizard replied  'Perhaps you 'd like to do it then!', Boppsy laughed back, while breaking another skeleton in pieces. 'Cuddlepie, are you ready?'  'Always, brother', I replied.We had finally reached the last chamber of the cottage and I was staring at the evil necromancer for some time now, only few meters ahead of me, yet so far away. The lava between us was impassable. I was exhausted but I was also ready to strike with my most powerful combo. Boppsy was right behind me, succesfully holding off the endless waves of the necromancer's minions at the narrow corridor between the two jail cells. The young, imprisoned wizard was in one of the cells, trying her best to help Boppsy and teleport me next to the necromancer for the fatal blow.The necromancer was mocking us, throwing spells without caring if we die now or later...  'Finally!!!', I heard a faint yell. And time stoppedI tried my best to hold my senses. I had prepared my all out attack and now I also had the perfect block ready. My vision blurred and a split second later I was next to the evil necromancer. He didn't seem worried nor afraid I was next to him and he lifted his weapon to crush me down...No, I wasn't expecting that. In my surprise I desperately threw my shield up while dashing on the right. It blocked his swing and he lost his balance, and he wasn't ready at all for my reckless swing that hacked him from shoulder to bottom.The chaos had stopped.RNG, as much as I f#!@&% hate you, Card Hunter has also taught me to love you.

												Alright, as you can see I've put 90 hours or more into this game in just two weeks. Admittedly, some of that was me leaving the game on. But I digress.As others have said, this game starts off as fun, but challenging. Around the level 6-7 area is where the game actually begins to get more fun and challenging at the same time. it is a very fun and satisfying experience when you overcome a very stacked battle against your adventurers, but soon the tedium sets in and you start to see the unfair difficulty in spades. Soon you realize just how stacked odds are against you when you actually play and count the number of random dice rolls and the like in a fight and how the game *Perhaps* manipulates the battles and cards as you play.Example : You and your party are up against armor shredding enemies who have 2 space attack cards that go through armor and 1 space attack cards that discard all your armor cards. These enemies only pull 13-16 cards at the beginning of the match and they are for the most part 90% good cards. Enemies have ""Failure"" cards such as discarding all blocks, or discarding all attacks, which can mean you'll have an easier time for that round and perhaps the next. The problem is, that they usually have cards better than yours, and the game knocks you down levels so you can't come back with great gear.So you decide to run a party mix of warrior, priest, and mage. Positioning is VERY important in this game. You sometimes need to play ""Hold back"" or ""Aggressive"" in order to win. Look at the board, notice line of sight, basic strategem. Understood, right? Thing is, if you make ""one"" mistake, a party member is dead because it is usually 5+ VS 3...or in some cases 13-14 against 3. Albeit some mobs of enemies come as one...so its 3 goblins as ""1"" enemy who shares cards and usually have little hp.So you begin the fight, and you get your hand of cards. You stacked your priest for heals, you stacked your mage for long-range damage, and you stack your warrior for tanking/medium strikes. Your mage sees a mob in range, she/he casts a spell. The enemy mob has at least 2 block cards and 1 missile reflect on turn one. These cards have rolls of 3-4 to deflect, so thats a 50%-60% chance they will fail....but you have to roll all three times. After 90 hours of play, I know that these rolls are indeed not as random as they officially appear. And sometimes you want one to be blocked, but instead a lower chanced one will activate.I have recorded how many times my mages spells have been ""Reflected"" instead of ""Blocked"" by cards with far higher  chances. My spell will go under the missile block and be reflected...followed by a block. Now you may be saying ""Just go melee it, then?"" right? So I change the strategy, use my warrior....If I use all my movement to get my healer and warrior into position, my warrior backstabbing (Like a rogue) to bypass blocks and my healer being able to heal....the 2+ enemies who are stacked against you will indeed backstab your warrior in return usually wounding him/her down to 5-9 hp...or worse, killing them outright.The thing is, each round the game gives you a certain amount of cards from your ""Deck"" but I've noticed the deck gives you only 1-2 options for the approach to minimize damage/loss each round. Try it yourself and I am sure you will find the same findings. I've recorded how often I've been ""Punished"" by the gm for trying to finish off a mob when the gm (Ai) has decided ""You have done enough damage this turn. Pass now, or you will regret it."" and lost a match. The enemies somehow have ""just"" the right cards to screw your party if you do anything but what the game wants you to do.The game doesn't really have as much luck as you think it does. In my 70+ hours of play, I've noticed my party fails rolls around 33% more than enemies do. If you manage to bypass enemy blocks, and damage AKA....look at the game board, look at all the possible movement, and ""Hope"" that the enemy doesnt have 2 pocket moves/super smash/instant kill cards...and you'll win. That takes time, imagine if you had to plan every move in real D&D for 5-10 minutes to make sure your warrior won't get blitz krieged when you pass your turn or better yet, your warrior is in perfect aoe chop range....you stacked 12 chops in your deck...and none come up for 3 turns. I get 2-3 rounds in a row where I have no attack cards and an enemy has ~10-12 Hp left and it drags on to tedium. I stack my decks for builds, but my ""attack"" cards all sink to the bottom or when they do come up, I'm so far out of range that they're useless. There was once a fight where I had to occupy squares against 5 enemies, and even though I've beaten it consecutively since then, I once sighed in frustration because a ""Healer"" priest on the other side....was down to 10 HP. My warrior had a 14 damage attack I ""saved"" for 2 turns to finish her. My mage only had a sneak along walls movement, I snuck up behind her, occupied a sqare, force blasted her into my warrior's lap and....She pulled out a pocket Mighty Bludgeon, my warrior failed ""All"" 3 of his armor rolls with 1's and the match was over in a blink. Stuff like this happens ""Often"". Way too often. The only way to win this game? Put about 100+ hours farming purples from matches you've already beaten until you can ""Overgear"" for the new fight...and beat this crooked system. I can't even get my money back, but I did have at least some fun before the game got unfair.So please, login to the game, read the chat, you'll hear the same thing. Don't listen to people who have put in less than 20-30 hours into this. They haven't hit ""The Wall"" I climbed the wall, I've won against ogres, demons, cthulhu, and everything else....but its not worth it. its not worth the twenty dollars I put into this crooked game.

												This game requires its own set of login credentials on top of those required by Steam, defeating the point of Steam as both DRM and user authentication.The accounts cannot be altered or deleted, and because made a mistake when creating mine, I can't play, and the developers aren't interested in changing this behavior. The only redress is a long process in which I have to justify my reasons for asking for a new account (I haven't even played yet) in writing. This practice clearly wasn't considered. As a computer user I have dozens of authentication sets that I have to track without adding every single game I play. Every publisher that adds an additional login layer thinks that they are special - that I should make this exception for them. They give reasons that they think are sufficient to justify the policy. They're wrong. I wouldn't track extra logins for the other 190+ games that I own; why would I track yours?			"

As thematic and boring as THAC0Card Hunter's premise is that you are playing a pen-and-paper role playing game that is run by Gary, a novice game master, who is bullied by his neckbeard brother, and has a crush on the hot pizza delivery girl. These brief interludes before every campaign mission are easily the best part of the game. They do a great job of capturing the humor and nostalgia of every nerd's high school pen-and-paper role playing sessions. Sadly, these story sections don't really mesh with the gameplay. Gary introduces the missions, but there's never any dialog during the combat. It feels like someone wrote the story and then the combat system was farmed out to a different team. The gameplay just isn't as fun as the story.The first big problem is all those Cards you're Hunting. Each item that you equip adds its entire set of 3 or 6 ability cards to your character's deck. If you understand basic UI design (unlike the Card Hunter devs), you'd probably expect the game to have a character screen that clearly shows which cards each piece of equipment is adding to your deck. Maybe with a column of equipment slots, with each item's cards shown to the side. But they didn't do that. So maybe your second guess would be that all the cards in your deck are at least organized sensibly, so that if your mage's deck contains two Firestorm cards from his staff, and a third Firestorm from a magic ring, the devs would at least program the game to give you the OPTION of clearly showing those three Firestorm cards all together, presumably beside any other fire spells that are in your deck, right? WRONG AGAIN! This cool cards-from-equipment idea was handled in the WORST way possible - each item's cards are just squished against each other in the deck, without any sorting or clear visual boundary between the sets of cards. And to make things even worse, some missions will force you to change much of your equipment (for example, you'll need lots of attacks that hit multiple enemies for a mission that swarms you with goblins) but there's no way to easily switch between ""decks"" (equipment loadouts), so you're stuck wrestling with the terrible interface much more than you should have to.Oh, and when you're browsing a shop (there are several, presumably just to make shopping more frustrating, since there's no danger or cost involved in moving between stores) whenever you mouseover an item so that you can actually see what its cards are there's a cute little unrolling scroll animation before you get to see what its cards are. And no, it can't be disabled. You have to endure it every... single... TIME when you're just trying to slog through your mess of equipment. (Did I mention that I've put several hours into the game but still haven't earned the right to sell crappy equipment? I know you get to sell junk eventually, but it takes way too long to show up.) Cards have some basic numbers to show how much damage they do and their maximum range (although these don't increase to reflect passive buffs), but anything more complicated than that requires you to zoom in on the card to read a mess of confusing keywords that should have been replaced with icons. (The keywords are such a mess that some ""piercing"" type weapons do ""penetrating"" damage that ignores armor. Really?! You had to use two different terms that have the same meaning everywhere but in your game? You couldn't call them ""thrusting"" or ""stabbing"" weapons?)Next problem - movement! I like games where the position of your units is important, but movement is very cumbersome here. You can't move unless you have a card that specifically lets you, and you can't ""save"" some of its movement for later in the turn. Combined with the fact that you only get to play one card before the enemy gets a turn, you will often run into infuriating situations where enemies move just out of range, making your hand full of attack cards useless. Each adventurer does always get a basic movement card in addition to whatever cards he randomly draws from his deck, so you're not completely reliant on getting lucky and drawing a movement card, but it just isn't enough.It's crucial to know how much health each character has left, but the number is often obscured (There are lots of alternate skins for your heroes that you can buy with real dollars, but their appearance doesn't change to show how bashed up they are). You can see your adventurers' health numbers at the bottom of the screen, but it's not shown as a health bar or anything else eye-catching like that. Just numbers.Here's a bonus tip for slogging through this review of all the game's problems: Gary will give you pizza (premium currency) so you can get a free taste of stuff that normally costs real money (such as hero skins) but the game lets you spend the pizza on actual useful stuff like club membership for bonus loot.

												This game is just very bad.First, it will be interesting.But only for thirty minutes.I really dont recommend this game because it gets quite boring and time consuming.Another thing is it doesnt really explain things to you.For example when i went to multiplayer i was owning the guy.But then of course they didnt say a thing about you having to stand in the highlighted box and get points to win. I thought you actually had to kill evryone to win.This game is also very unbalanced.When i was playing multiplayer the guy hadlegendaries and epics while i had uncommons and rares.This shows how unbalanced the game is.It is also very pay to win.Dont get fooled by the free download.Pay to wins get extra slots in their treasure chests, and everytime it will be a non common item.They also can buy chests and better weapons.All in all, i wasted 1 hour of my life in this game and i dont want whoever reading this to waste their time too.

												I hate this s.h.i.t such a bad and misleading game. let me start with the beginning. Takes 3 minutes to download, but i don't recoment doing that, wanna know why? keep reading this to the end. You start playing a learn all the rules and you go for about 4 or 5 levels but once you hit level 6, I hope you're already a pro because its out of the frying pan and into the fu/ckin fire. The enemies get super tough with all their stupid good armou and most of them have ranged weapons that face fu/ck you from across the map and theres nothing you can do about that sh/it. The other thing is some levels there will be like 7 or 8 enemies and they'll only have like 8 or 9 health so it makes it look like the battle will be easy... but no... if you think that like i thought that no, youre in f me sideways land. you will get a new one ripped faster than you can say ""I hate this ridiculously unfair and misleading game."" dont make the same mistake i did, pass over this, get something else, you will hate this game, you will rage, you will want your time back, i wasted like 5 hours of my life with this crap. you have been warned procced with cation			"

												Literally one of the worst games I've ever played. The gameplay and graphics are so-so, but what truly and utterly kills this pathetic excuse of a title is the RNG. You get a deck of however many cards, and from that you draw MOVE, ATTACK, and DEFENSE cards. Well, you'd freakin think that a warrior would always get an attack card, a cleric a heal, and a mage a spell, right? WRONG. Darn near EVERY fight, I've had to re-play due to this game's absolute GARBAGE RNG. My warrior draws NOTHING but movement, or my cleric never draws a heal, or my freakin mage draws up the three physical attack cards in her deck of 33. That happens EVERY fight. Not some, not most, EVERY fight. And then, these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ creators also have the gall to make enemies have one-shot cards that can outright KILL a PC but you struggle just to damage them due to the completely unbalanced armor and shield cards. You end up hitting a dude for 8? Yeah, he's gonna have 4 shields, each of which let him draw into more shields, or attacks. This title needs a serious balance overhaul. I will NEVER play it again. PS: If you're gonna make a D&D clone, maybe you should actually bleeping PLAY D&D once in a while to see what it's like. Your game makes me recall that trash movie with the wayans brother.			"

To prevent cheating and hacking all game actions (every smallest action even in singleplayer mode) is calculated via online connection to server. And right now it means several minutes of queue waiting just to launch game and several seconds of lag after every single action. So I recommend to wait.

												I reccomend this game as another timewaster and something of a decent quality. I do not however reccomend it as a game with any connection to what it satirizes. The gameplay is nice, the art is pretty decent, the humour is kinda bearable, but do not expect anything more than a grind and some story. They could have done much more, but they chose not to. There is no choice involved at all, no character customization beyond choosing 1 of the peices they sell and equipping gear with no visual component. The DM characters constantly remind you with bad jokes that your not playing anything resembling the games initial appearance. Its all fighting, getting gear and leveling up.If you want a game where you play levels, something like angry birds with a bit more stuff going on, then go ahead, its well made for that.If you had hoped for anything more, such as rolling a 20 sided die or any die, making choices with saving roles, etc, this is not that game. Its not even a card game, so dont expect that either.So im not saying its bad, im saying its not anything special and i dont reccomend mediocrity. Ill keep playing till im fed up, just to make sure i didnt jump the gun, but i doubt i did.			"

												This game is nothing but a huge disappointment:1. There's zero tactical depth and variety in this game because all kinds of damages are just direct damage (DD). If you're looking for interesting creature spells, you'll just be disappointed. Most attack cards in this game are either ""Melee attack dealing 2/3/4/5/6/etc damages with a range of 2/3/4/5/6/etc tiles"" or ""Magic attack dealing 2/3/4/5/6/etc damages with a range of 2/3/4/5/6/etc tiles"". Honestly, there's no creativity at all in card design.2. Ugly card artwork unless you think cards like this (http://wiki.cardhuntria.com/wiki/Cards/Stab) and this (http://wiki.cardhuntria.com/wiki/Cards/Strong_Stab) are eye candies.3. 100% Pay-to-Win: If you don't pay real money to buy chests that offer powerful items (in the forms of ""rare"", ""epic"" and ""legendary"" items), you won't have any chances at all to win in PvP. Yes, you might still beat low level PvPers equipped with cheap items. However, you'll definitely be killed by high level players who have spent hundreds of dollars on buying powerful gear. People who say this game isn't P2W are just blatantly lying. 4. Stupid storylline: Every quest is just ""kill this evil character (insert name) to obtain this valuable item (insert name)"". 5. No in-game deck builder. No in-game item and card database. Good luck wasting your time on Google.6. Mentally ret@rded AI: If your character has just 1 HP left and an AI enemy with attack cards in hand is next to him, don't worry! Because the AI enemy will just end the turn instead of using the attack cards to kill your character. The AI in this game is just dumb as hell. The developer only uses numerical advantage as the means to make AI enemies difficulty to beat in this game.7. Extremely slow development progress: Currently, there're only 3 races (human, elf, and dwarf) and 3 classes (warrior, priest, and wizard) available for team building. The player community has been asking for the 4th class (e.g., rogue) for over 1 year already, but the developer has done *NOTHING* at all in widening the range of class or race. Instead, the developer has only kept churning out adventure modules that offer stupid storylines and more powerful items to milk players' wallets. After all, as I stated above, the only way for you to stay competitive in PvP is to maintain an arsenal of powerful items. 8. The game server can be down without any explanation or prior notice from the developer. They're probably using a toaster to host the game.If you're looking for a digital card game with tactical depth and variety, go play Magic The Gathering Online. Don't waste your time and money on this sub-par title. I wish I could request a refund for the money spent on the campaign modules. According to the stats provided by Steam Charts, the number of peak players has tumbled by over 80% (a loss of around 5000 players) since the game was released on Steam a month ago. This hard fact is another strong evidence that Card Hunter is just a huge P2W disappointment.			"

												I wanna recommend this game... but no. I fail to see what makes it worthy with the other games on steam. The baordgame style is enjoyable, the tutorial is thorough (even if it does a bit much of the hand holding). It fails in it's disguise of of free to play. Sure you can play for free but it quickly points out the things you won't get unless you pay. Even still, I don't have a problem with this system. You  get to play and see if you like it and just not buy if you don't find it enjoyable. What I have a problem with is the insane price jump for simple stuff. For $19.99 you get the actual game plus 100 pizza (in-game premium currency). That's crap when considering the game isn't worth $20- No voice-overs just odd sound effects for dialog pop-ups, no live action, pretty basic boardgame style play with nothing all that new brought to the table, and certainly nothing compelling for a $20 game and this title has the nerve to push for a monthly fee (that is optional but still thats some bs). I'm a frugal steam gamer. Thanks to steam sales, I've been able to enjoy amazing titles with little more than $20 (I tend to burn too much of that on beer and use the change for videogames :-() in my pocket at any given time. But this game will never compete with those deals (most recently Depth >$10 for a full game and crap my pants fun!). The price for pizza is between $4.99 to like $98.00 (150 and 3,800 slices respectfully)! That's insane! This can be used for premium gear as the game quickly points out 3.5 hours in. I have mobile games that are more cost effective than this with better graphics and sound.  Short and simple is this, if this game advertised itself as a $20 FULL game on steam it wouldn't get a 2nd look but I'd at least have more respect for it. There are waaaaay too many titles (especially the random badasses that go on 80-90% sales for no damn reason other than that the sun came up that day)  it can't compete with with at the same relative cost. This game hides it's price tag until play it and when it shows itself it is a bloated mess of cost. I would never recommend this game to my friends because with this cost structure they'd laugh at me, tell me to play Path of Exile, and to take note of how a real free to play game is suppose to be setup. Woof!			"

												The mechanics are fairly weird. A player may play one card (move OR attack OR other) on one of his characters, then the enemy does the same. Repeat until both can't do any moves any more (because they don't have moves left and the enemy is not in range for any attacks). As soon as a stalemate is reached and both players ""pass"" a new turn will begin (and you get new cards). If just one player has to pass, then the other can still burn through all his cards until he is done (and with the way movement is handled this happens a lot (more often to the enemy, but that's boring too)).And since moves are cards, with the way it works right now, you are really trying NOT to move up to the enemy and let them come to you, so that you can first strike.If your three guys fight against one enemy, then by the time all three had a chance to do something, the other guy will have had three actions. Right in one of the first fights there is an enemy who covers the ground in acid. And you have no way of getting out of it. He uses an aoe spell that puts more than one of your guys into acid. And if you use a move action to get out of the acid he just uses his skill on you again (because if it is 3v1, then he moves three times as much as you do). The fight is still very winnable. It just feels idiotic.I didn't enjoy this at all. Natural flow or pacing didn't develop at any point.And, of course, what everyone else said: pay2win.And a time waster game. You won't take anything from this that could be useful.Unless wasting time is what you are going for.			"

												I gave it a shot free-to-play, trying to see why it had such good ratings on Metacritic.  I played for about 6 hours across 2 days and so far it's like watching corn grow, when it's not trying to sell me something...which is EVERY single time I play.  Cards are linked together in items, often include negatives, are repetitive, and do no damage to speak of.   Having the cards linked to items seriously hampers the deck-building aspects of the game. The dungeon playboards are extremely repetitive and having to repeat them to level another character is very tedious.Having to join a ""club"" to get additional loot items is also ludicrous.  I also note that more often than not the better items wind up being in the ""club"" slot.If you're into watching grass grow, being irritated by odd DM's, and restrictive repetitive cards then you might like it, but I'd advise everyone to step away from this one.

												Terrible game misleading people into thinking they care at all what the fans think. When the most balanced aspect is player vs player your game is terrible and you are an insecure little boy who needs to ""win"" against the fans putting food on your plate. It's pretty disgusting.There's no other way to describe it other than you'll just go through a trial of annoyances, frustration, and broken game mechanics until eventually you progress only to have it happen more. You see unlike most rpgs, levels don't mean anything. They cap, and thus it's rigged to where you will have to do this over, and over, and over again... about the only favorable advantage you can get is rare items accumulated at some undisclosed point in time because you have to complete all the missions of an adventure module to obtain loot or money to get loot at the stores or... it's just one scoop of aggravation on another. At what point in this shotgun wedding style of gameplay does this sound ""fun""?Also the developers are despicable and threatened me when I brought all this up.

												This game has weird mechanics that leave you saying 'Oh come the ♥♥♥♥ on' way to many times, especially the fact that you can't move your characters without a move card. As you are only likely to get 1 move card per draw for the character, you will often find yourself stuck in the same position as enemies just walk away from you and you are unable to follow having used up your move card and you don't get new cards until you end your turn. This becomes very annoying when enemies start cover the floor with damage over time spells.The lack of the ability to move your characters around without a card to move is really, really annoying. Pure and simple. The fact that the enemy's constantly move away from you makes it even more annoying. The fact that some enemies make standing still punishment for you even even more annoying.Of course all your attacks also come in the form of cards. You cannot reuse them. You can have a character use up his 1-2 attacks and not really be able to do anything against the enemies around him unless you end the turn to redraw cards. Half of the games I played featured my dwarf sitting there doing nothing while being attacked simply because I wanted to use my other characters.I cannot stant the mechanics. Maybe if you only controlled 1 character at a time it would be more workable, but having your party stand around and do nothing but get hit while you're moving your mage around to do something, then having them hit again as you launch off a couple spells without doing much of anything isn't an enjoyable system.I do not recommend this game.

												This is a greast RPG with the board game style from Fire Emblem. This is a really fun game to play, especially wit a freind in co-op. There is not much to say about it because it is like Fire Emblem and it has a random move card thing going. Still a lot of fun and a great game to have if you are looking for Steam RPG's or just a game to play with a friend.8/10Its fun			"

												Tl;dr at the boottomWhat it is : Card hunter is a tactical tabletop simulator focused on combat with Rpg elements sprinkled on top of it. How does it play out : You control an adventuring band of 3 heros ready to face all the dangers the land of cardhuntria has to offer. Your character's equipped gear determine the skills ( cards ) that can be used in battle, those skills ranges from moving cards to blocking cards to healing to utility and attack cards with merged cards that allow two actions i.e( attack and move ) . Said gear can be equipped in slots that you gain when you level up your characters. That gear is sperated into 5 catagories ( common, uncommon , rare, Epic and legendary ) with the rarer varity gaining you powerful skills, said gear is also further seperated into gear that require power tokens - which you gain from leveling up - power tokens are also seperated into minor and major power tokens, they serve no purpose but as a prequiste to equiping gear.Is it P2W : No, it is not. Spending money on the game yields you cosmetics and extra content, represented in more campaign modes i.e. ( citadel in the sky, attack of the artifacts) and treasure hunts that yields you a single Epic class gear.Is it fun : Extremely.Does have any flaws : Yes. As with all fun games you want more. I would have liked if it had more classes ( rogues , scouts..etc. ), out of combat focus even if it was just yes or no choices and steam work shop support for player created campaigns.Verdict : Very fun game to play with amazing content to match 8/10      Tl;dr : Xcom meets D&D in a weird card game like manner , easy to play hard to master, free to play , turn based , amazing content , paying unlocks more amazing content , wish it had more things to do other than combat.

												Tactical combat, card game skill mechanics, a vast array of collectibles, all wrapped in a candy-coating of old school D&D nostalgia... As a long-time tabletop, pen-and-paper gamer, I was instantly drawn to Card Hunter. If you fondly remember The Keep on the Borderlands, if you can recognize art by Erol Otus with your eyes closed, or if you can state how many sides a certain polyhedral die has without counting them, you'll respect what this game is trying to do.I say ""trying"", because although I really enjoy it, it doesn't capture the D&D experience unless your GM was all about plot-lite combat scenarios. As such, it doesn't really match the description or the cute commercials it has. But it doesn't have to; it's still a fantastic turn-based, fast-paced strategy game. The core of the strategy is about matching your equipment to your play-style for your 3 party members, a mixture of humans, dwarves, and elves who are either warriors, clerics, or mages. (It would be nice to see a halfling rogue in the mix, with stealth moves and backstabbing and whatnot, but they're easy to overlook. Har, har!) Once you've geared up, you take your party through a number of cleverly-illustrated modules to gain experience and loot, which give you both more equipment slots and better cards to choose from during combat. The design works well, and gives you ample opportunity to try out new strategies to get past scenarios that are challenging for your current build.There is a bit of a grind-wall, which requires you to replay the same module several times to level up enough to get through the next tier. However, I'm willing to admit that might just be my stubborn adherence to my party's current build. Maybe I didn't have to get to level 8 to get through the level 7 modules. I could just suck. :) That's also why I steer clear of the multiplayer -- you get rewards that you share with your campaign characters, but in a game that doesn't *require* PvP, I give it a pass. From the little of it that I played, the other gamers seem polite and helpful, which is nice to see.If you fondly remember the early years of D&D and are looking for an engaging turn-based game, and if you love filling your characters' inventory with countless possible upgrades, definitely give Card Hunter a try. And while you're at it, bust out your original copy of the Monster Manual and give your Rust Monster a hug today!			"

												Likes: The table top feel, the battle mechanics, the quest writing and enemies, the card system, the loot, and where and how they ask for money.Dislikes: The narration is getting old. While I may want to play a table top game, I don't want to listen to the supreme beta king of all beta's try to be my virtual buddy. Clicking his stupid face has become a mini-game of wacka-mole for me, as it's the only way I can continue playing without feeling like I'm in someone's mom's basement.With that said, I've downloaded and tried a lot of games like this recently and this one really stands out. Give it a shot.			"

So thought I'd give it a go since it had so many good reviews.Not gonna lie I was expecting not to like it (It's not usually my type of game this) but I actually quite liked it. I like the simplicity of it and it's easy to pick up and get into to. Supports Mac and Windows which is good Alls I want from them now is Linux Support :)			"

												This is one of the very few games I had to quit cold turkey. Other such games include Diablo II and League of Legends.So you know you're in good company.This game gives you a party of three heroes, a bunch of tactical turn-based missions (a la X-Com), a tongue-in-cheek campaign, a pvp mode, and way too much loot to customize your dudes and dudettes.It's free to play, but the monetization is fair, and you don't have to pay anything to play. People who pay get 4 loot items instead of 3 at the end of every mission, and it's not that big a deal. Full disclaimer: I've paid this game some money, but it was fair, square and fairly cheap to do so. I paid because I wanted, not because I had to, and that's important.Overall this game scores three stars out of three: it has swords, elves and pvp.And yes, you can equip swords on your elves to hack other people up.Come on in, the water is fine.

												This game is amazing! It's a mix of RPG,TCG, and Xcom. If that makes you at all excited then try it out! If not, then try it out anyway! It's Free! I have had so much fun that I decided to pay $20 for the Basic Pack to support the devs. The only con so far is the connectivity issues, and those are already being worked on. I would recommend to play the game with friends. However that doesn't mean that the singleplayer isn't fun, I often will hop in to the singleplayer inbetween Co-Op sessions to level my characters and get more loot. The community is friendly and helpful, and the devs have been friendly (haven't interacted with them myself but a bit of browsing the steam forums for this game proves this). I have yet to be frustrated with this game, even when RNG wasn't with me on the card draws I wasn't raging, I was figuring out how to kit myself better for the situation. Just... Check this game out!!			"

												This is a great casual game to play. I really enjoy the pacing of the game. It allows for excellent strategy and planning. The combo table top/CCG style is very enjoyable and brings a nice warm feeling of the days of D&D, Magic the Gathering, and other random games I have played. They did a really good job in creating an atmosphere of what real gamers enjoy.Sometimes I'm hesitant to jump right into free-to-play games. I go watch videos, read reviews, etc. Not with ""Card Hunter"". I read the description and the steam reviews and blammo i was hooked. As im writing this review ive only played briefly, and have yet to even delve into the multiplayer aspect that makes this game really interesting. Im still leveling up my heroes and getting a feel for the game, but so far its really fun. They have woven in just the right amount of humor in the game. Its not over the top, but just enough to garner a chuckle or two when you hear the announcers sound just like your buddy who had gotten a little carried away with his DM role. 8 out of 10. +1 for free-to-play.

												The game is all about luck and rarely how well you use tactics. Often times the game will force you into needing some type of skill from an item  but only after you've failed. Cards on the enemies are far superior to your own cards even to the point where you can rarely draw decent attack cards while the enemy gladly enjoys 2/3 their cards being attack cards and it isn't explained what or how they have access to the large pool of abilities.The paid benefits are also not worth the cost of what they request. I never had a good benefit from it and laughed every time it gave me the same crappy common item that was 1/2 my level.Game would be fun if there was more choice. The items are too limited with orbs and level requirements that force you to go with a crappy build that feels like the same build you've used the entire game-- HOW BORING. I want to be able to level up my character and gain skills that I dont need cards for.. or at least give me the option to unlock cards w/o level requirements.			"

												Ok, so maybe I played it a little too short to rate it yet, but this ""review"" should just be a simple reccomendation. If you like role playing games and are a bit corious about the ""old days of gaming"", when there were tabletop games and pen and paper instead of epic pc versions of role plays, than you should give it a try.Its free and just makes you feel good while playing it, if you even just like it a little bit. Now ... any arguments to not play it? No? So, here you go. Download these 200 Mbytes and play a tabletop roleplay with Gary ;D			"

												Ok, lets get this straight to avoid any confusion.  This game has nothing to do with roleplaying games, but what it does have a lot to do with is classic fantasy boardgames, like talisman, dungeon, or heroquest.  Unfortunately this is marred by the whole having to pay to unlock certain features and bonuses, and in the pvp section this really does show as to who pays and who's here just for fun. There are a few stereotypes which immediately feel out of place, especially as this isn't 1986 and games like this are far more mainstream these days, so the depiction of everyone who plays this as a nerd hurts more than helps.Ok, on to the game itself, past the cringe-worthy imagery.  What I will say here is that everything that follows is why I gave it a  positive thumb waving.They have for the most part, got themselves a really good package here, with board based tile movement and card based combat.  You fight all of the fantasy stereotypes of goblins, orcs and other such things.  The combat is resolved by using cards for each adventurer that you have until you find you can't use any more, due to running out, or just not having the right card at the right time, like in the video where the guy says 'I cast a lightning bolt!' etc.  At the end of every round the adventurers and remaining monsters get to draw new cards.  This can be a little difficult to catch when the game uses the terms 'rounds' and 'turns' applying htem to what they want.  Movement can only take place if you have movement cards, and I don't see any indicator to show when you're arriving at the end of the round.  So tactics like waiting for the monsters to move and expend their cards for movement/attack before you make your decisions aren't really possible.  If you do try to estimate that, then you could end up in a poor position, as if you have over two cards per adventurer left at the end of the turn, then you have to discard them until you have the sacred number of 2 for some reason.The amount of money you gain is determined by how much treasure detritis you find after each battle, which usually comes in quite low amounts, so most of the time you will depend on the other treasure items you find to equip your adventurers.I would recommend this game, but only if you want a very superficial experience and aren't looking for anything with more depth than your 12 year old brother might be looking for in a fantasy board game.   Maybe good for an hour on the weekend with your favourite intoxicant/food-snack while still wearing your p.js perhaps.			"

												I'm a tabletop RPG player, so I recognize the tropes that have lovingly been parodied here. Card Hunter has a satisfying gameplay loop; a turn-based combat punctuated by loot, amusing characters, and options. The card-based mechanics are great, and provides a fresh take on the combat you find at a D&D table. I can't recommend it enough for anyone who has loved, does love, or might love Dungeons & Dragons.			"

												Excellent game, best ccg around NOT P2W. It will take more time to get the chests required for the epic loot. This is easily done by doing leagues in multiplayer, if you win zero matches out of zero...thats right, you still get 3 Gold Chests!! which cost nothing to open. Place first and get an Epic chest which always has good gear. I have spent 20$ for dressed up player pieces...after 90 hours and still love to play and probably will for awhile. You can spend nothing..and get the same experience. IMO they deserve my 20$....			"

												This game was exactly what I was looking for. I love card based games in the real world, but don't always have others to play against. This one will sometimes really make you think, as sometimes the cards you get won't be ideal - just like any real stategist game. Work with what you have. Cards available to each character will vary depending on what is in the deck for that character, and that is based on what items are equipped to the character. Because of this, no scenerio will ever play out exactly the same, even if you've already played that level before. Levels also follow storylines, so if you like to feel like you're fighting for a specific cause, you'll have one. Stop those gnolls from eating the villagers!			"

You can have plenty of fun for free, and there's no need to spend any money unless you want to speed up your progression (useful but not necessary to complete the campaign) or unlock the expansion content. The developers are also very open to the community on social media, and I like to feel that I contributed in a small way by helping to get the original war monkeys nerfed!			"

												   Tons of fun for those who find nostalgia in games like Dungeons&Dragons and Magic: the Gathering. Although the game is free to play, i do reccomend the ""Basic Edition Bundle"" that will grant you a 1 month subscription, giving additional loot with every mission, as well as gold for items and chests, Several alternate skins for your characters, and some ""Pizza"" to spend on rare chests and even more skins!   My One gripe is the subscription model, after paying $20 to unlock most of the missions and the collectables i want, i was able to beat the game within the month of subscription, making me unlikely to revisit the game after my subscription ends.

												An amazing little turn-based tactical strategy game with an old school fantasy RPG flavor.  Position your adventurers on a grid map and do battle with monsters using the spells and fighting techniques represented by cards that your adventurers get from the equipment you choose to equip them with.  It has a decent competative MOBA multiplayer as well as a 2-3 player co-op campaign.  The purple prose of the modules provokes just the right amount of nostalgia to invoke OG Dungeons and Dragons.  The competative balance ebbs and flows with each expansion, but is generally pretty good.  The difficulty of the singleplayer/coop campaign varies WILDLY depending on the specific scenerio, any handycaps you may choose to apply, and how you spec your toons.Expansions/DLC are fun and flavorful if somewhat short and occationally punishingly hard.Overall a very nicely designed TSG with a good deal of depth and a strong competitive following.  Can be a little hard even for a vetern of the genre in places, the campaign does get stale after a while, and it can be frustrating to grind for a single high level item among the multitude of random drops, but these complaints pale in comparison to the game's many charms.

												Best TCG-RPG I've been playing so far.Started about a month a ago, and this game really hooked me up til now.Pros:- Free! not p2w. you can get every items/cards without paying any $$ (except treasure hunt map, just the map. you can still get the treasure hunt items from normal loot). But I recommend you to buy 1 of any bundle, it will make your card collecting progress faster. (+supporting the dev!)- So many builds you want to try em all.- Helpful community.- Long Single Player Campaign.- very balanced, nothing OP, every builds has their counter. and it really depends on your luck + skill.- Leagues. if you're bored with normal mp games.- Co-op.Cons:- No matter how good your build, if RNG god hate you, you'll lose.

												Wow, what a cool little game and it's great that it's free (with in game payments if you want to do that).This is a game all about quick tactical combats while your group of fantasy adventurers are out making their legend.  The game revolves around the CCG element where you use certain cards to do different powers.  The cards you have are dictated mainly by the gear you find and equip which you earn from doing questsYou can choose from three races (Human, Elf, Dwarf) and three classes (Warrior, Mage, Priest).  It doesn't sound like much considering that so many games have so many optionsYou can play solo, co op with friends or other randoms or even play ranked vs others you don't know. I honestly thought I'd just get this and go yeah it's free and kill a few hours with it, but I quickly became addicted.  It's fast, fun and I love the way combats flow.Give it a try.			"

												For those of us who were nerds and played the classic D&D, AD&D, and all the other iterations of this genre, there is so much that's familiar with it that brings back memories.  For those of us who were into Magic when it came out and are still involved w/ it or it's various forms, this game should be very comfortable w/ you too, since it is a card based combat system that is driven on the type of gear that you have.  This makes you want to collect everything since the mini-campaigns require you to customize your equipment loadout so that you have the cards to succeed in them. Lastly, for those of us who have played a bizillion  F2P games, this game should be one of your favs b/c of the minimal in your face, hard sale, micro transaction, premium status type models that you so commonly see. All in all, this game is a great combination of all three, that imo combines many of the great traits of the above mentioned game types w/o bogging you down.  It ties everything together w/ a lightly humourous, sarcastic campaign narration and a very engaging game play system that hooks you and threatens to destroy human relationships b/c you're hooked on trying to complete that next mini-campaign or do the next PvP or co-op. :p  The entire system is relatively simple to understand and is easy to get into quickly.  That is it's best and worst traits.  Limited with a 3 character party, with 3 playbable races, and 3 playable classes; there are calls about expanding party size, race and classes.  If this happens, like in any developing game that starts out great and fun, game play and balancing issues will inevitably occur.   As it stands though right now, it's a great and fun game to play either in PvP, Co-op, or campaign settings  that entices you  to actually pay for the premium account so that you can unlock expansion campaigns and extra loot.

												Overall a good game, I haven't tested multiplayer so I cannot give a 100% accurate review. My only complaint wtih the campaign version is that it feels slightly like a mobile game; with experience lockouts and lowered item quality on the dungeons which can be completed once a day for full gains and any time after for lesser rewards.

												Card Hunter is a turn based pen & paper Rpg (dungeons and dragons) with a twist. the twist being you attack and move using cards that are gained by equiping diffirent items. overall i enjoy it a lot and here is whyPros-looks very nice-main game is free-very fun-pretty easy to earn, yet hard to master-good singleplayer and coop campaign-very fun multiplayerCons-3 races and 3 classes, a very small selection-certain levels locked behind paywall-microtransactions (could be good or bad, dependsalthough these ones arent to bad)overall i would say it is a very enjoyable game and one of the only games i wouldaccept microtransactions in as the game is free and the microtransactions arent horrendus. get this game if you like RPGs and atleast try it if you dont,just F***ing get it ok?

												Having never played a table top role playing game before I I had some misguided expectations. That is I expected this game to suck.In reality it is a very addictive, and fun game. It mainly focuses on combat and party optimization. People complaining that the cards they draw are too useless simply dont know how to deckbuild and probably max out on armour but use only crappy weapons. The community seems pretty friendly and helpful so far and there is lots of low level player so you wont get trashed as soon as you start.I wouldnt take anything out of the exisitn game but I do wish that they would add more classes are you are currently limited to 3. I would also like it if you drew a card for each item you had equipped rather than a set number of cards.			"

												A very enjoyable single player game, and even more fun when you get to play with a couple of your buddies. This game brings the fun and joy of card games to your computer. When I play this, I get the feeling of DnD as well, especially with the special mission boards they give you. The game also has very good humor and jokes mixed in. Anyways, here are the basics. You can have fun playing as three different characters, a healer, a mage, and a warrior. From there, you can pick different races for the character, such as an elf, a human, or a dwarf. After you create the character, you get various equipment to put on your character to give them different cards. This is the general gameplay and setup and it's so satisfying trying to come up with strategies with the cards you have to win your matches. With this game being free and such, there is nothing lost at least giving this little gem of a game a try.			"

												This game is very fun. Paradies the classic DnD feel while loaded with humor and a good story. The play is turn based but the game isent the same over and over again. Cards, make it a worthwhile game to play . Some Items have cool interactions with other cards for crazy combos. Its like DND MTG and Munchkin had a threesome and came up with this. Single player is the better option starting out and then when you get to the higher levels online play is okay. The only down side is that Online play's UI is very confusing so ask other players or consult youtube before playing it. Other than that the game is highly addictive and very thought out.  8/10			"

												This is a challenging pseudo card game.  You have 3 characters which level up through the use of treasures that you win at the end of battles.  The treasures may be class specific and will assign an assortment of cards to that character's deck.  Characters draw cards from their decks during battles.  This mechanic helps ensure that battle play a bit differently each time you try them.I have only played the solo campaign so far, but I have found the level of challenge to be just right.  I plan on supporting this free to play game.			"

												Pretty decent as far as turn based strategy RPGs go. The combat system is interesting since every action is determined by your cards, which are determined by your gear. A weapon might give a character more damaging cards, cards with more range or cards with special effects, armor works the same way for defensive and movement skills. All in all, it's ok to play in short bursts. The free to play model errs on the more expensive side, which is unfortunate since the genre isn't one where paid content would offer much over the free stuff.			"

												OK, when i first saw the game in PCGamer or something, i thought - ""This game is probably full of microtransactions, as every free-to-play game. It looks childish, the genre is not my type... this is gonna suck"". Before you know it, the game is installed. So i start it expecting to quit after 5-10 minutes. So we go to battle, i get a dwarf or some sh*t, who by the way walks like a retar*ed penguin. Next we have a magician who thinks he's Dumbledore. And we have a priest, or shaman or whatever. Ok this is like D&D, maybe it'll be fun. After like five turns not knowing what i'm doing, i'm like ""i don't see myself playing this, probably gonna uninstall after the battle"". So now i get the game, but guess what: i'm surrounded and i'm like ""HEY! get away from my priest you a hole!"" So i break the encirclement like the Ivan at Stalingrad, using the dovahkiin-looking warrior, mad dumbledore skills and fus-ro-dah teleportation skills. I WON! Maybe this isn't so bad after all. Next i face a big-as* dragon. Full of confidence i'm like : ""Give me you best shot young Alduin"" So now Alduin is spiting some sh*t on me, cant move, slowly dying. He approaches and now i'm like ""fus-ro-dah motherf**ker"" as i teleport him, i finish him off with my Tyrion Lannister-looking kind of guy. Battle is over and i scream: ""In your face Alduin, who's the dovahkiin now, huh?"" So my brother asks me: ""What are you playing? I didn't know you had Skyrim installed"" - ""No, it's some D&D kind of game, i just rap*d Alduin"" He loked at me with a strange, somewhat terrifying look, and after few seconds said ""OK"". My mom called me and asked if i was feeling alright.So yeah, this game turned out quite different than i expected, don't look at my playing time, i will definitely play a lot more of this game. You might think as a free-to-play game it must have microtransactions. Whell, acutally no. You can buy different types of versions that get you something, but nothing that changes the gameplay or give any significant advantage. If you have five minutes or wan't a marathon game, play it. It's free, fun and fair, which is not that common this days. this game was made because the devs love the games and the genre, making a very good game, try it.			"

												Do not let my short play-time fool you: I have been playing Card Hunter since it was first released as a browser-based title, and have logged hundreds of hours into grinding several adventurers and digging for loot. There are few games I can stand behind so much as this one - all the best features of turn-based tactical games and collectible card games come together to make this epic design that has sucked away countless hours of my life. The campaign mode is bar-none excellent, and PVP is far more elegantly balanced than one might think. Epic and Legendary cards aren't necessarily more powerful than the rares and uncommons you can pick up as a free player, so a clever player will PWN ALL in PVP if your build works well and you're able to out-think your opponent in play.This is not some make-a-buck-fast TCG or some unbalanced Tactics cash-in. This is a game that belongs on every computer, and I stand behind what I say here. You will not be disappointed; it is endless hours of awesomeness.			"

I would recommend to play the game with friends. However that doesn't mean that the singleplayer isn't fun, I often will hop in to the singleplayer inbetween Co-Op sessions to level my characters and get more loot. The community is friendly and helpful, and the devs have been friendly (haven't interacted with them myself but a bit of browsing the steam forums for this game proves this). I have yet to be frustrated with this game, even when RNG wasn't with me on the card draws I wasn't raging, I was figuring out how to kit myself better for the situation. Just... Check this game out!!			"

												I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who grew up playing Dungeons and Dragon or who enjoys tactical board games. The art direction is perfectly suited for the medium and every card, icon, and character is easy to comprehend. The adventures are cleverly written to evoke the classic D&D style with a subtle sense of humor. From a gameplay standpoint, Card Hunter scratches that itch for meaningful descisions with the random card elements. By equipping different items before each battle, you can stack your deck with specific cards more suited to overcome the challenges. This will be essential to be able to continue as this game is quite challenging and most maps will require careful turn-by-turn planning and a bit of luck to be able to win. Don't hesitate to re-equip or shop for new items if the enemies are immune to a damage type or have a gimick attack.As a free game it scores major points for not including any obnoxious elements like a limitation on play. The cash shop currency is optional and you can complete the singleplayer adventures with the default rewards. Overall this is easily the best tactical board game available on Steam.			"

												Even thought its a fairly new game, I feel that it is pretty good. I enjoy this game because it doesnt take that long to figure it out. Its also great because you dont have to pay to win. The game runs well on my crappy computer and overall I give it a  9/10. Another great thing about it is that I can see it expanding and having more content like a map editor and player made content. Lastly, if you like D&D youd probably like it. "

												This is the best free turn based strategy game I've ever played.It has solo, 2-3 player coop and versus. So you can enjoy it however you want.The best part about the game is the item system. Each character have a deck of cards like attacks, armor, move, block... This deck is made by the items your character has equiped. Each item gives between 3 and 6 cards. But, it's all or nothing. If an item have 5 great cards and an handicap, you have to deal with it. This makes for very unique character building that can be optimized in a lot of ways.There is also 3 classes and 3 races for characters that all have items that can exclusively be equiped to them.There is a freaking lot of items in this game and, yep, it's free to play, you can buy more items. But it's not really a problem to me. You will lack some items in the begining but if you play through a good part of the campaign, you'll have a lot of them. If you want to help the devs your options are : timed subscription for an extra item after each fight, buying individual chests with guaranteed high rarity items and new side-missions with guarantee item the first time you complete it. None of those are required to truly enjoy the game. There is also some character reskin you can buy that doesn't affect gameplay at all.(If you want to buy the missions, the bundle isn't you only option. If you go on the lock mission, you'll be able to unlock it for some paid currency which is a better deal if you don't care about the rest of the bundle.)The campaing itself it very fun. Each mission is a different challenge with unique opponents. I've yet to complete it. The missions get harder and harder, often requiring you to change your items to match specific opponents. I've started it again with a friend and it still is a blast to play.But, the story is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't expect anything from that part.An amazing strategy game that gives you a lor of options and always harder challenges. Solo, coop and versus, all are amazing!			"

												I've been playing this game long before it came to Steam, back when it was still just a Web Browser game. I liked the game from its initial creation and they've only been improving it since then. If you like tactics games, this is definitely worth a try. If you like collecting things, there is plenty to keep you invested. If you're a fan of D&D, there are plenty of fun personalities and in-jokes aimed at having fun with the subject material (rather than making fun of it).And ultimately, it's free, with tons of content even if you don't want to pay a dime, and the payments themselves are reasonably priced, non-intrusive, and well worth buying.I've had a blast with the year I've spent with this game, and I'd definitely recommend it.

												An interesting combination of 2 types of game: tactical role-playing and card game will drown you into a fantastic adventure. At first, you will think this is a childish game like me but you will soon realize that without the strategy, calculation and a little of luck, you will stuck at a place. Play with friends in coop-mode or play single game in campaign. And remember “it is a free game”.			"

												I admit I expected nothing from a free game but a couple of unrewarding hours of obsessive compulsive looting and lots of micro-transaction requests. Instead, I found an amazingly fun, well balanced and TOTALLY NOT Pay-per-Win gem that I can't get bored of.In these times of crappy cellphone-like games copying each other shamelessly, it's so refreshing to find such an original twist to the classic collectible cards and board games. It has a soft learning curve but, as new cards and enemies appear, the strategies to play multiply fast.The campaign and challenges are extremely fun to play, and the multiplayer is designed so you will not be abused by richer users, even if you never paid a cent. It's just one of those games that will have you playing ""just one more level"" all night long.Damn, I love this game!			"

												Quite a fun game. I play it because it runs on my school computer (which means it will run on damn near anything). Would be nice if the in game purchases could be seen in the steam DLC section of the store page to let people know that you do have to pay to get to higher levels. My one complaint is that there is not really a penalty for your characters dying, They still get full rewards and then just pop back up next mission.			"

												As someone who LOVES Dungeons and Dragons and never gets enough of it, I have to recommend this game to anyone in the same boat.The Dungeon Master is adorable, the game itself is easy to learn, requires a little bit of grinding previous levels, but all in all is worth downloading. You'll have hours of fun fighting against all kinds of typical RPG monsters, goblins, imps, kobalds, etc etc.And the item collecting is just as fun, and gives you so many options to work with. Not to mention it's a neat twist on equipment that I've never seen. 10/10, I'd even recommend buying some of the extra DLC.			"

												Seemed really good at first, but turned into a P2W very quickly.  Even on solo, around lvl 7-8 you hit a brick wall that you cannot pass without paying.  Up until that point I was hooked.  The game does play well and reminds me of the 80's with the friends in the basement rolling dice.  Take out the P2W and balance the solo past lvl 7 and this could be a good one.  For now, the way it is set up, thumbs down.  I'll check back later and see what happens, it is very new.			"

												So far (62 hours played) this is one of the most enjoyable games I have played.Likes:- Well-built, runs smoothly and no crashes.- Looks good, original artwork that suits its slightly wacky style.- Entertaining gameplay in matches.  Most are challenging enough to be fun without being frustrating.  Some are very challenging, making you think carefully about team build and every card you play.- Interesting party building.  Three classes, three races and a huge number of loot cards gives enough variety to make your parties feel unique.- Good value for money.  I bought one expansion, which gives me a months club membership and few other bits, but I am quite certain you can play the campaign without struggling for free.  Multiplayer does have the capacity for being influenced by spending money, but at my level I've not seen any of that.- Fun PvP.  Played about 10 matches so far.  All players I have met have been friendly and only one or two matches have been one-sided.  The others have been nicely balanced and very entertaining.- Awesome humour.  If you every played much PnP Dungeons and Dragons, this game will make you smile and chuckle constantly.- Good community.  The world chat is mostly good-natured.  For a competitive game there is a surprising lack of leetness and rage.Dislikes:- Literally not found any yet.  I suspect that if I get to high-rating PvP, balance issues might start to appear, but none so far.			"

												This game is surprisingly fun and great for a relaxing 3 player experience. The only gripe I can give the game is that even though you can play 2 players it is a bad idea, because each player can only bring 1 character which means you'll always be a person down. Some of the levels become ridiculously hard when you are limited to only 2 classes.Else single player is also pretty fun.There are 3 races and 3 classes making your total number of combination to 9 characters.It is free to play so there is nothing to lose if you want to try it out.

												I have to say I really like this game.  Lots of nostalgic feelings from my old D&D days of pen and paper play.  It has a neat system which is easy to learn but has some room for learning to become really good at it.  I play with my friends and it is a blast, especially when you get defeated by a scenario and have to rethink strategy and card deck to over come it (hopefullY) on the second, sometimes third, try.  I truly think that the negative reviews are from people that just arent very good at this type of game, or just arent very bright.  Luck is a part of it but not as much as some people say.

												My mom kicked me out of my basement and now my friends and I have no where else to play Cardhunter except at the local comic book store. The manager told us to GTFO or else he'll the cops on us for loitering. We then went to the park and played Cardhunter but then everyone made fun of us. Then I found CardHunter on Steam and now no one makes fun of me at school anymore. Thanks Cardhunter Steam Version!			"

												Fantastic, balanced, and addictive.  Great humor and gameplay. Challenging encounters, fun tactical battles, and just a good time. Your characters basically level-up by virtue of upgrading their card-decks in the form of captured treasure or purchased treasure. It's more interesting and varied than I thought it would be. I'm shocked this is free. There's a whole micro-transaction thing (which in general makes me sick), but at least they aren't bombarding you with the concept or creating impossible situations that require the microtransactions. I like the game so much that I was tempted to pursue the microtransactions just to give props to the designers. I didn't. I settled for writing a positive review.			"

												I enjoy this game alot not only because I like turn-based strategy games; but that the system itself is fairly balancing (items tend to have upsides and downsides), there are clear strategies for defeating different types of enemies and that its not exactly pay-to-win.The club membership itself does get you more items; but from what I've seen, they arent usually as good as what you get in the chest anyways, but that still helps you make some extra coin anyways from selling the stuff (which honestly is way better than the club membership items being so good that you feel like you have to join)Im usually not the type of person to invest money in games; but I've purchased all the DLC for this game because our how much I enjoy it.I highly reccommend this game.As a side note, the DLC not only adds the new quests; but the cards featured in the new sets start popping up in random loot chests, so its definetely worth investing in to see all the unique cards.

This game has an extreamly simple UI and very basic graphics/animations, but they gameplay makes up for it tenfold. You don't even need to be a fan of D&D or any type of role playing board game to get somthing out of this game. It has a lighthearted tone and some funny dialogue to keep things fun.If you have the patience to learn a fairly in depth combat system and enjoy role playing/strategy games even a little, you should try this game.

												This game is surprisingly fun and great for a relaxing 3 player experience. The only gripe I can give the game is that even though you can play 2 players it is a bad idea, because each player can only bring 1 character which means you'll always be a person down. Some of the levels become ridiculously hard when you are limited to only 2 classes.Else single player is also pretty fun.There are 3 races and 3 classes making your total number of combination to 9 characters.It is free to play so there is nothing to lose if you want to try it out.

												Card Hunter is an awsome game. You can play it solo, coop, and PvP ; all modes are fun !  It looks like an DnD adventure, where you have rounds, an you and the enemy take turns to play. You may play cards from you're hand, which changes every turn (since you draw), and those cards come from the build you give to each characters.This kind of building allows you to create a lot of different possible options, which makes running the game over and over again, like if you'd played for the first time ! :)You can play the game without paying anything, though the dlc gives more maps to play through, which is kind of fun.If I could suggest any buys, I would recommand the first ""Basic Edition"" game, and the other AI Bundle (5,99$). This way, you should make enough pizza to buy all the other maps from Citadel (require only when you reach max level) without paying (if I'm not mistaken). Though buying the second dlc gives another subscription month and some kool figurines. You're call ^^Whatsoever, this games has my vote ! Always fun to play, mostly coop, with friends or people online. Enjoy !			"

												I am not great at reviews.Card Hunter is basically a tactical-board game where you have three characters who each have their own deck composed of items that you equip to them and the character's race (of Human, Elf, Dwarf, I would be happy to see more, but I have played this game since before it was on Steam and it has only ever had the three).I am unaware of any pay to win aspects in the game. There are microtransactions, but they are cosmetic, or for expansion packs, which I am okay with. Most of the stuff you can buy seems reasonably priced to me, your mileage may vary.The game itself can be frustrating at times, as there is a lot of rng-madness going on. Some games you'll draw non-combat card after non-combat card despite having a deck on the character that consists of a great many combat cards. Other games you'll get a plethora of combat cards, but not enough ways to actually move to opponents, which leads to having to discard all of your lovely cards.Most matches run fairly well though, I have had many good runs where I felt everything went well, but when playing with rng, you are going to come up to points that are frustrating.The art style of the game is clear and enjoyable. The campaign story isn't terrible, though the meat of the game is the tactical combat, so the story isn't a major focus.I recommend the game, it is a good pick-up-and-play game, lightly casual, but with enough depth to sink into.

												Great game with many collectibles and different strategies. Really gives you the D&D experience while you play alone or with friends. Game has great synergies between characters and/or cards.Only downside to this game imo is the low playerbase. During the day in EU zone there are hardly any players online to play  with.			"

												This is a bit of a mixed bag, but not for the reasons you'd think.As a freemium title, you'd expect it to be rife with pay-to-have-fun features and short on content. It is neither of those things. What you get instead is a fun little throwback to old school AD&D, complete with a perfect mimicry of the art and writing styles of that era of game design. And my god, it even plays like old DnD - just a simplified, reasonable version, dressed up with some crunchy deck-building mechanics. It's accessible, it's charming, and above all it's fun. It's a gem of a game.So, why is Card Hunter a mixed bag? The answer to that is Gary and Melvin.Campaign mode in Card Hunter is basically a three-character story. Gary is your GM, Melvin is his older brother, and then there's a girl from a pizza place. The pizza girl is totally fine as a character. Gary and Melvin make me writhe in my chair. Imagine, if you will, a hobby shop. Imagine this hobby shop is in a crappy part of your city. Imagine its windows are so heavily plastered with comics and action figure ads from the 1970, all of which are faded and peeling and stuck on with tape. Imagine that you've gone inside this store, wrinkling your noise at the powerful funk of old books and spilled snackfood that fills the cramped, dirty space within. Imagine there's only one customer, fat and unwashed, paging idly through Bikini Mail Magazine. And now imagine that behind the cracked, ancient counter, lounging in a pool of his own adipose folds, is a forty-something man in a pit-stained old t-shirt and sweatpants, hyucking softly to himself as he optimizes his WoW build on his laptop.Now imagine you've collapsed that entire experience into a single person. That person is Melvin.Gary is not much better. Thanks to Gary and Melvin, Card Hunter is a wild roller coaster of highs and lows. You'll fight a sharkbear, and that'll be pretty cool. Then Gary will say something cringing and miserable and you'll want to claw your own eyes out. You'll perservere, though, and get to see some righteous module art about cannibal yetis living in a blizzard. And then Melvin will open his mouth and you'll dream about just punching him. Punching him until he stops moving. Punching him FOREVER.I've never seen a game ooze social awkwardness like this one, and it's a damn shame, because everything else about it is great. The devs clearly are familiar with old school DnD. They get what tabletop culture used to be like.And then they choose to make the faces of Card Hunter a distillation of all the worst parts of the people who play the hobby.Maybe they hate themselves?

												Card Hunter is a very unique experience; i would very loosely call it a mix of D&D, TCG to an extent but omitting the trading part of TCG and Chess. The graphics are not next generation and on the loading screen it says ""A game only limited by your imagination"" which is very true; if your expecting some next generation graphics this aint the game. Card Hunter's main premise is build around loot. You can dungeon for loot, battle other players online for loot, enter a league with special play/win conditions you wont find anywhere else for even better loot if you do well and as well you can buy loot, using the in-game currency known as 'Pizza' delivered by a pizza company donning the name of the development company, 'Blue Manchu'. I myself have bought a little bit of loot and the pay to win aspect you'd expect to be present gets kind of drowned out by the skill actually required to play the game and assemble an effective deck; in the time it will take you to learn the game, you will have earned probably the same amount of loot as you would just buying some off the start and not playing much of the content it has to offer and so in this sense, the game is not pay to win. When you get loot from dungeons or online, there is a loot club you can also sub to, using pizza, to get an extra roll off the chest; You can easily afford the 7 day membership to this club with the free pizza your given in-game throughout the beginning of the campgain and then finish the campgaign and get all the member loot you would miss if you didn't have it, but again, your use of whatever you get from these free rolls will only be dictated by your skill at the game and time spent, so its not really pay to win.The battles themselves are, by many who play this game, considered to be 'mentally taxing' and it is true, in battle your margine for error is very low. Basically, most maps will have a 'VS' or victory square, to which you can move your character to, and your character will sit on these points and control them; at the end of the round, if you control more points, you get a 'VP' or victory point, stating that you control the points, you get a single point. If he kills one of your chracters however, your opponent will get 2 'VP' and so although the 'VS' or victory squares are important, character management is far more important and these two factors working together in the game serve to create a very intense experience with low margine for error if you want to win. There are 6 VP's to gain in total and 3 characters on each team, so if you wipe his team, even if your losing on the Victory Squares, you can still come back and win.The races you can choose have a profound effect on the board; Elves are movement based and usually get 2-3 movement cards rather than just the standard 1 movement card every turn, but have the lowest HP of all the races. Dwarves have higher hit points, but are the slowest race. Humans are dynamic and have commands they can use to make their team members move, or draw cards and are considered to be the average race with average health and average movement. Getting in depth with classes is not necessary; there is the warrior, cleric and mage. Very simple. How you play these classes in context to what race you choose to play the class as will basically define your experience in the game and is a big choice to make right off the bat, considering you'll have spent no time playing the game before initially making this choice to choose race/class. Considering this game is free, it is a steal of a deal and i highly recommend you atleast try the game out; yes there is content that is behind a pay wall, however if you enjoy the game and think its well thought out and created, maybe 'Blue Manchu' deserves to make a little cash off it, huh? =) "

												I have to say I really like this game.  Lots of nostalgic feelings from my old D&D days of pen and paper play.  It has a neat system which is easy to learn but has some room for learning to become really good at it.  I play with my friends and it is a blast, especially when you get defeated by a scenario and have to rethink strategy and card deck to over come it (hopefullY) on the second, sometimes third, try.  I truly think that the negative reviews are from people that just arent very good at this type of game, or just arent very bright.  Luck is a part of it but not as much as some people say.

												Long before Card Hunter arrived on Steam, I was obsessed with it. It's a perfect combination of an old school dungeon-spelunking aesthetic and a newfanged deck-building card engine. You can have plenty of fun for free, and there's no need to spend any money unless you want to speed up your progression (useful but not necessary to complete the campaign) or unlock the expansion content. The developers are also very open to the community on social media, and I like to feel that I contributed in a small way by helping to get the original war monkeys nerfed!			"

												Strikes a surprisingly good balance of fun vs profit for a pay2win game.The single player campaign is well tuned and will leave you wanting more, which is where the independently purchasable modules come in. Since you're purchasing actual content, it doesn't leave you feeling sullied when you hand over the cash, even if the individual purchases ultimately add up to the cost of a AAA game.The power token system ensures that even very early game loot will have a place in your end-game party builds. Higher level gear requires more and more tokens, you'll never possess enough tokens that you can deck your character entirely in high level gear. It's a clever idea, and well implemented.I haven't touched the multiplayer, but this is where, I imagine, the pay2win issues are a little more at the forefront. There are no item rarity restrictions, and legenday / rare items are a very powerful and central part of many pvp builds.Protip: When starting out, you'll be given pizza to spend on costumes and chests. You don't have to do so. Spend that pizza on card hunter club membership instead, it will make playing the campaign much more enjoyable.			"

												Tl;dr at the boottomWhat it is : Card hunter is a tactical tabletop simulator focused on combat with Rpg elements sprinkled on top of it. How does it play out : You control an adventuring band of 3 heros ready to face all the dangers the land of cardhuntria has to offer. Your character's equipped gear determine the skills ( cards ) that can be used in battle, those skills ranges from moving cards to blocking cards to healing to utility and attack cards with merged cards that allow two actions i.e( attack and move ) . Said gear can be equipped in slots that you gain when you level up your characters. That gear is sperated into 5 catagories ( common, uncommon , rare, Epic and legendary ) with the rarer varity gaining you powerful skills, said gear is also further seperated into gear that require power tokens - which you gain from leveling up - power tokens are also seperated into minor and major power tokens, they serve no purpose but as a prequiste to equiping gear.Is it P2W : No, it is not. Spending money on the game yields you cosmetics and extra content, represented in more campaign modes i.e. ( citadel in the sky, attack of the artifacts) and treasure hunts that yields you a single Epic class gear.Is it fun : Extremely.Does have any flaws : Yes. As with all fun games you want more. I would have liked if it had more classes ( rogues , scouts..etc. ), out of combat focus even if it was just yes or no choices and steam work shop support for player created campaigns.Verdict : Very fun game to play with amazing content to match 8/10      Tl;dr : Xcom meets D&D in a weird card game like manner , easy to play hard to master, free to play , turn based , amazing content , paying unlocks more amazing content , wish it had more things to do other than combat.

												Likes: The table top feel, the battle mechanics, the quest writing and enemies, the card system, the loot, and where and how they ask for money.Dislikes: The narration is getting old. While I may want to play a table top game, I don't want to listen to the supreme beta king of all beta's try to be my virtual buddy. Clicking his stupid face has become a mini-game of wacka-mole for me, as it's the only way I can continue playing without feeling like I'm in someone's mom's basement.With that said, I've downloaded and tried a lot of games like this recently and this one really stands out.

												Card Hunter is all of the fun of Dungeons and Dragons with none of the hassle of dice, rules lawyers, bad role players, metagamers, that one guy even the geeks want to smack about, cards, pens, paper, character sheets.  It very much reminds me of the years I spent as a table top RPG player with none of the drawbacks. It's easy to pick up and play. Free or pay it's an awesome game either way! Grab it. The worst you'll lose is a few hours of your life without a dime out of pocket. Best case scenario, it becomes your newest guilty pleasure addiction.  Either way as a steam gamer you win.			"

												I recommend this game but with reservations.  Lets start by saying I really enjoy(ed) this game.  Its a very cool idea.  I love the way they made it a turn-based, RPG, table-top looking game and integrated it with a card collecting game.  Very unique and a breath of fresh air.  The graphics are absolutely wonderful.  Game play is challenging but still very easy to pick up.   But...and there's always a but...I don't believe in playing games with in-app purchases.  The best I can tell, you get your characters to level 8 and there is no more new content without paying.  You can revisit old dungeons or create new characters and level them up to 8 but, if you don't want to pay then the game stops at level 8.  I know what free-to-play means, it just would have been nice to have a no-frills, no-pay option.  You know, complete the game for free or destroy everything in your path for money.  Anyway, I still recommend this game because it was a ton of fun getting them to 8 but truthfully I uninstalled it shortly after that.I should add I didn't try the multiplayer and hated the special impossible dungeons.  Maybe the multiplayer ones would bring more fun to the ""table"".  LOL, see what I did there?			"

												This game is charming and very interesting. If you are a fan of tabletop games, such as Dungeong and Dragons, I would recommend getting this. They have a card member club feature that unlocks more content, and after playing for an hour I am thinking of joining the club, and it also allows for you to buy different increments of the club membership including a 7 day membership, which I think is pretty cool. You don't have to commit to a 30 day membership. The games graphics are not complex, but they are charming and work for the genre, and the dialogue is rather funny.The combat system is based off of card draws from a deck, and it is rather intracate. I can tell it was designed well, and I did not find any bugs. I did however find some frustration in the right cards being drawn from the deck each round, but I suppose that is all part of enjoying a deck card type game.I would at least try this out.			"

												Card Hunter exemplifies my favorite kind of RPG--that which feels old-school and nostalgic while having modern and/or interesting mechanics. The banter between dorky DM and his nerdier older brother contrasts with the sword-and-sorcery adventures your party goes on, bringing back memories of Friday nights in high school, while the gameplay itself aims to emulate, but not copy those games and the offshoots like Baldur's Gate and Pillars of Eternity.One might argue that the free to play aspect makes this incomparable to those full-fledged CRPG's, but I personally prefer it. It is easy to jump in and out of the game, going on small adventures instead of dedicating several hours to progression. They really have nailed that aspect of playing D&D in person without cleaving to the social commitment a pnp game requires. I don't know if I personally will throw up the cash for pizza slices (the IAP premium currency), but I haven't gotten far enough in the game yet to need them.My only complaint with the mechanics so far is that there isn't a print-and-play version available to try Card Hunter in meatspace. I don't think it would work nearly as well as this version, but I do hope more pnp RPG's take note and try something similar in the future.			"

												Ok, Think D&D. Though it seems to have some type of magic the gathering qualities as well. You do not get to draw a card every turn so you need to think about your moves before you make them. I really enjoy this, growing up I played a lot of magic and D&D with my parents. This really takes me back. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for something different. Its balanced, a joy to play, easy to learn, fun and exciting to get new loot. The bad.

												I was a little unsure at first about a union of D&D and cards.Never have I been happier to be wrong.  This game is exactly what I didn't know I had been looking for.The game perfectly and seamlessly blends the tabletop feeling of dungeons and dragons, with the amazing combat system this game has created.  The AI is somewhat intelligent - I'm still pre level 10 - and while I wish it was a little more challenging in terms of the enemy health and skills. In terms of abilities, I would like to see a larger pool of abilities, and less of the repeats from weapon to weapon.  Once again though, I am still pre level 10, so it may change down the road.  Fast paced, fairly good storyline so far (the younger brother of a DM attempting to DM for the first time) makes for a few laughs every now and then.i would very much reccomend this game to anyone, familiar or not with the tabletop gaming world.  10/10			"

												As a person who has put a fair amount of time into the game I have to say that this game was something I really wanted to like. It had many components that you would think would fit perfectly well, but the main problem with this game is: The game has this repetitive grind to it because it makes you fight the RNG (random number generater),especially near the end of the campaign. The missions/modules/enemies always seem to have a major advantage. Never have I seen an enemy without at least one attack nomatter what when they draw while more than likely I seem to go for rounds without getting anything but move cards. Enemies sometimes come in hordes which seem not bad since most hordes just share form a single deck but the problem start to arise when you notice that while you take a whole turn to move one character, for the enemy actually takes one turn to move everyone.Theres also the fact that the enimes have better cards than you most of the time which don't make much sense for the levels sice you can only come in within certain levels and if your overlevelled then you have to lose some cards and power tokens to make it ""fair""The game rolls seems rigged. I can't tell how many times that this game gave me a hand that could comlete annilate a foe but for some reason ALL its defence cards block everything, even when my cards have stuff like ""hard to block"" or they have ""bad luck""(it essentially makes it s the dice roll goes down by 1), it gets so lucky and procs each and every block card.I mean theres one level in particular which is called ""Return to the Astral Shrine"" which essentially is impossible for me because even with armour destoying cards, bad luck and any other cards that make enemies lose cards, the enemies in that room just make it impossible because thay always have a card that blocks 5 damage, they only need to roll a 4 ad it doesn't matter whether is works or not they keep that card. But the problem with that is that they seem to always have one of those cards in there hand no matter how many times you destroy it! I mean I once save two cards that did 14 damage each so I unleashed it on one foe and it happend to have two armour cards which successfully rolled a +4 for both of the attacks I did, which lead to my attack that had the chance to do 28 damage to do a total of 8.Overall, I think that this game has it's charm but the fact that even though it's free to play, it feels like it tries to rig the game and force you to buy so that you can actually progress.

												Overall I love Card Hunter. They were able to successfully blend my favorite aspects of gaming into one epic package. Between the campaign mode and multiplayer, I could easily see myself logging hundreds of hours into this game if I had the free time to do so. The only reason I can’t give this a solid 5/5 is due to the micro-transactions along with the expansions and club membership. They are just being a little too greedy when it comes to sucking money out of the pockets of fellow gamers, and games like these are hard for me to recommend on a moral level. If someone who respects my opinions got hooked onto this game and ends up spending thousands of dollars due to micro-transactions, I couldn’t help but feel slightly responsible. If you are not someone that is easily suckered into this business scheme, then I highly recommend this game. You can enjoy Card Hunter without ever spending a dime, or at least never buying any Pizza. If you are someone that can’t help but spend money in a game in order to gain the upper hand or speed up the grinding process, I urge to you to stay away from this game, and any others that condone this set-up.Check out my full review on our site, and feel free to let me know what you thought of my opinions!  http://www.steamfirst.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=10267&action=edit "

												Since my original negative review I have changed my mind on this game to a positive recommendation. If you love Strategy, Rpg or Fantasy/Adventure D&D style video & boardgames this is a game that might peek your interest. It plays like a digital dungeon crawling boardgame, has good geeky humor. Its challenging, fun, and loots of lot. As of now though the game begs for additional character classes and races as there are only 3 classes and 3 races to choose from. It would also be great to see additional skins for your characters.(07/15) Original Review:Server lag and update problems. The game has potential to bad it is flawed due to developer incompetence.

												Don't get me wrong it's a nice concept, a simplified version of DnD without the hastle of trying to learn how to build characters through an ocean of content. But the way it is now some things need to change. Most situations feel like they need to be handled by more then 3 team members and the game overwhelms you in later missions with large amounts of NPCs that are both small damage and large damage leaning more in the favor of large damage enemies. Usually ending with you trying to prioritize the high damage enemies but taking too much damage or losses to consider the exchanges worth while.Pros:Simple:Easy to learn, your abilities are based on the equipment you have, enemies aren't overcomplicated time bombs you don't want to go near, races are genericly balanced, and classes have designated equips.Great Fun with Friends:Co-op with friends is a blast, makes everything twice as fun.Comedic Writing:The game can be funny at times making it feel more worthwile to play through the campaignEquiment:Easy to understand, a little hard to obtain without grinding lower level missions, and equipment is balanced with major and minor power tokens so you aren't a complete god against the AI.Easy to Change:You don't have to stick to one party, you can buy new party members for a low cost of ingame currency and interchange party members at any time to fit your play style.Cons:Classes aren't what they seem to be:The classes can be built one of two ways, either all aggression or complete support roles. There are no effective in betweens because you're either losing out on damage or don't help the other members in your team.Wizards aren't at all DPS, most spells at a wizard's disposal are weak or are easily snuffed out by enemy armors/blocks. Also most beginning damage spells are close range that deal no damage, meaning you have to sit in damage range just to do damage and this follows you well into mid game depending on your load out. The wizards that can control spells that manipulate the battlefield have no damage what so ever. Priests are squishy supports that can't stay in combat very long for the same reason, they do almost no damage. With the all aggression priests they have almost no support and once again can't stay in combat because they can't take a hit.Warriors are either high damage DPS with no range or medium DPS with range. Warriors aren't tanks either considering most NPCs will just chip off 50% or more of your member's HP without even trying. Warriors either move into range and then have the target immediatly move out of range afterwards or do little to no damage with longer range attacks.Equipment:It will screw you again and again, most equipment is either okay but nothing substantial. Anything that's good either has terrible draw backs from using them or require so many power tokens you can't use anything else that's good until you're high level. Your equipment is determind by RNG so you might just get a bunch of stuff for warriors or priests, but get nothing for your mage. Essentially making that unit completly worthless unless you do a grindfest or buy new overpriced equipment. Main issues with equipment is you're forced to use low level equipment even though your other gear is leagues ahead of it and it's mainly useless in your missions. There isn't any scaling in gear level, you have your low level gear that doesn't require power tokens, mid range gear that requires minor power tokens, and high grade gear that requires either major power tokens or both major and minor power tokens. At max level team members, you only get 4 major power tokens and 4 minor tower tokens. Which you have to try and prioritize certain equipment slots over others, making you weak extremely weak in one department and strong in another. The Warrior class has 9 equipment slots, Mage 10 slots, and Priests with 10 slots. With most late game gear using 2 major power tokens you're already missing half your stock for only one equipment item. So now you're stuck trying to build for pure DPS or pure support for certain classes. There is no effective inbetween for both offensive and defensive builds, they both work against each other and flood your hand with either or, not a mixture of both.Gold/Shop:Making gold is stupidly hard uphill battle of RNG and selling extra equipment for almost nothing to buy new equipment. To be actually able to sell back items you don't use you need to get a renown of 7, probably about 8 or so campaign missions. Their main reason in doing this is to have players build a good amount of equipment before going and blindly selling off equipment they aren't using. Main issue with this is once you get to sell items they aren't worth much of anything unless it's rare or legendary equipment which still sells for a crappy amount of gold. Common equipment is usually worth around one to two gold, where rare and legendary sell for around 50 to 100 gold. Selling one legendary piece of equipment gets you enough gold to buy one mediocre item from the shop. Your main way of making gold is selling common extras of equipment and cheap treasure with your occasional semi-precious treasure.NPCs and RNG are jerks:NPCs won't move unless you do most of time making it hard to determine how to plan for a situation, most times the NPCs seem to be well aware of what you possess in your hand. NPCs seem to just get cards that undermine everything you try to do. They either have so much armor and block you can't do anything or their rolls against you and for themselves feel rigged in their favor most of the time. Most of their saving rolls are 4+ and they seem to get the rolls they need flawlessly at most points in time. My armors and blocks have a saving roll of 2 or better and I still end up failing them 90% of the time.Races:The different races don't work well together at all. Dwarves are all tank but no movement which makes them pair terribly with humans and elves because they just leave them behind in the dust. If you're going to play with a dwarf you might as well make the rest of your party dwarves and play defensivly. The only good time to have one dwarf is as a mage because they don't have to be front line. Humans are a balance of both health and movement making them your go tos for optional play styles and are able to switch between aggressive and passive play styles. Elves are all mobility with no health making them get in and out characters or complete avoidance characters. You're not staying in combat with elves, you're either dashing in to do a little damage then dashing out or attacking from afar. Elves don't pair well with other races because they just leave the other races behind and end up over extending themselves.Little to no hand manipulation:There are barely any card draws and some of them punish you for trying to get new cards that are better for the situation. There is little to no enemy hand manipulation unless you can specificly build for it and land the ability through the NPC's/Player's saving roles. So far the only enemy hand manipulation cards I have seen remove their oldest block or all of them or remove armor cards. Enemy NPC's will most likely do this to themselves before you even know what to use to manipulate their hand.My current stand point with this game is neutral, I love the concept but hate the way the game is going at the moment. I'm left here to hope they change some of these glaring issues before I loose all interest for a game that punishes players for trying to build for multiple utilities. If you want to play it for fun's sake with friends you'll probably enjoy this game for a few sessions. But if you want to seriously play all the way to the end power to you, because this game is brutal with it's RNG and rolls for saves. To be able to continue to play for me there needs to be a serious rebalance with how classes work, how card draw works, and how the rolls/RNG work. "

I dont normally leave comments of recomendations for games but this game is fantastic and well worth your time to check it out, if you like it play it if you really enjoy it support the developers and purchase the in game DLC.

												An amazing little turn-based tactical strategy game with an old school fantasy RPG flavor.  Position your adventurers on a grid map and do battle with monsters using the spells and fighting techniques represented by cards that your adventurers get from the equipment you choose to equip them with.  It has a decent competative MOBA multiplayer as well as a 2-3 player co-op campaign.  The purple prose of the modules provokes just the right amount of nostalgia to invoke OG Dungeons and Dragons.  The competative balance ebbs and flows with each expansion, but is generally pretty good.  The difficulty of the singleplayer/coop campaign varies WILDLY depending on the specific scenerio, any handycaps you may choose to apply, and how you spec your toons.Expansions/DLC are fun and flavorful if somewhat short and occationally punishingly hard.Overall a very nicely designed TSG with a good deal of depth and a strong competitive following.  Can be a little hard even for a vetern of the genre in places, the campaign does get stale after a while, and it can be frustrating to grind for a single high level item among the multitude of random drops, but these complaints pale in comparison to the game's many charms.

												Card Hunter is all of the fun of Dungeons and Dragons with none of the hassle of dice, rules lawyers, bad role players, metagamers, that one guy even the geeks want to smack about, cards, pens, paper, character sheets.  It very much reminds me of the years I spent as a table top RPG player with none of the drawbacks. It's easy to pick up and play. Free or pay it's an awesome game either way! Grab it. The worst you'll lose is a few hours of your life without a dime out of pocket. Best case scenario, it becomes your newest guilty pleasure addiction.  Either way as a steam gamer you win.			"

												Card Hunter is a very unique experience; i would very loosely call it a mix of D&D, TCG to an extent but omitting the trading part of TCG and Chess. The graphics are not next generation and on the loading screen it says ""A game only limited by your imagination"" which is very true; if your expecting some next generation graphics this aint the game. Card Hunter's main premise is build around loot. You can dungeon for loot, battle other players online for loot, enter a league with special play/win conditions you wont find anywhere else for even better loot if you do well and as well you can buy loot, using the in-game currency known as 'Pizza' delivered by a pizza company donning the name of the development company, 'Blue Manchu'. I myself have bought a little bit of loot and the pay to win aspect you'd expect to be present gets kind of drowned out by the skill actually required to play the game and assemble an effective deck; in the time it will take you to learn the game, you will have earned probably the same amount of loot as you would just buying some off the start and not playing much of the content it has to offer and so in this sense, the game is not pay to win. When you get loot from dungeons or online, there is a loot club you can also sub to, using pizza, to get an extra roll off the chest; You can easily afford the 7 day membership to this club with the free pizza your given in-game throughout the beginning of the campgain and then finish the campgaign and get all the member loot you would miss if you didn't have it, but again, your use of whatever you get from these free rolls will only be dictated by your skill at the game and time spent, so its not really pay to win.The battles themselves are, by many who play this game, considered to be 'mentally taxing' and it is true, in battle your margine for error is very low. Basically, most maps will have a 'VS' or victory square, to which you can move your character to, and your character will sit on these points and control them; at the end of the round, if you control more points, you get a 'VP' or victory point, stating that you control the points, you get a single point. If he kills one of your chracters however, your opponent will get 2 'VP' and so although the 'VS' or victory squares are important, character management is far more important and these two factors working together in the game serve to create a very intense experience with low margine for error if you want to win. There are 6 VP's to gain in total and 3 characters on each team, so if you wipe his team, even if your losing on the Victory Squares, you can still come back and win.The races you can choose have a profound effect on the board; Elves are movement based and usually get 2-3 movement cards rather than just the standard 1 movement card every turn, but have the lowest HP of all the races. Dwarves have higher hit points, but are the slowest race. Humans are dynamic and have commands they can use to make their team members move, or draw cards and are considered to be the average race with average health and average movement. Getting in depth with classes is not necessary; there is the warrior, cleric and mage. Very simple. How you play these classes in context to what race you choose to play the class as will basically define your experience in the game and is a big choice to make right off the bat, considering you'll have spent no time playing the game before initially making this choice to choose race/class. Considering this game is free, it is a steal of a deal and i highly recommend you atleast try the game out; yes there is content that is behind a pay wall, however if you enjoy the game and think its well thought out and created, maybe 'Blue Manchu' deserves to make a little cash off it, huh? =) "

												Great game full of nerdy D&D fun. There are plenty of pay to players out there, but due to the ranking system you don't have to fight them if you don't want to pay to play. The whole game depends on giving your characters equipment that works together, making an effective strategy in the match, and perhaps most of all, pure luck. I have beaten players many ranks higher than me, and have been beaten by players many ranks lower than me. This game is designed well enough to separate the pay to players and the casual players. Anyone who gripes about pay to players probably just doesn't know how to strategize effectively or work with the cards they're given. The league matches with prebuilt decks are where a players true colors show. Many times I have beaten higher ranked players when given even playing fields.Overall its a really fun game if you don't take it too seriously. Also there is an editor where you can build your own maps and scenarios which is awesome.			"

												A fun, laid back, yet deceptively deep and addictive experience. Card hunter plays like a board game complete with cut out characters and your own decks to build. Your character can progress in level, but the main way to get better is to equip better gear. Every piece of equipment puts different cards into your deck. These cards are then payed during the turn-based sessions. Complete those and you'll get loot and money to improve your characters. Nice and easy, but still fun.Best of all is that this game is free. You can pay for additional campaigns or different skins for your characters, but everything is optional. As far as I can see, this is no pay to win. I can't speak for the mulitplayer portion however.			"

												Fantastic, balanced, and addictive.  Great humor and gameplay. Challenging encounters, fun tactical battles, and just a good time. Your characters basically level-up by virtue of upgrading their card-decks in the form of captured treasure or purchased treasure. It's more interesting and varied than I thought it would be. I'm shocked this is free. There's a whole micro-transaction thing (which in general makes me sick), but at least they aren't bombarding you with the concept or creating impossible situations that require the microtransactions. I like the game so much that I was tempted to pursue the microtransactions just to give props to the designers. I didn't. I settled for writing a positive review.			"

												This is a pretty addictive game and enjoyable, don’t expect the depth and richness of something like magic as it’s simpler than that but that’s part of the charm.IMHO I wouldn't say it's a pay-to-win the reason being the currency, being pizza and gold, can be earned through the single player campaign. The only advantages of paying include: > Getting more items – You get more items during the campaign, there are treasure hunt adventures that can get you more items, and you can get more gold to get more items.> Cosmetic – You can get additional avatars> League games – You can join multiplayer leagues games, and if you win you can actually get gold, pizza and items anyway.This basically means that you can get items faster, but you can always get items playing the FREE multiplayer 1v1 anyway, and that you can play the league games which are enjoyable. Overall it’s worth a go. "

												Firstly, I want to say that THIS is the way Free To Play should be. I have not spent a cent on this game and I do not need to! The game is that good that I will most likely spend $10 on it just to show my support to the devs. The main thing is that you DO NOT need to spend any money, the option is there if you want to buy pizza slices (to buy chests and character figures) but you can buy chests with in-game gold as well as you get heaps of loot after each adventure.Highly recommended if you llike card collecting/battle/strategy games like Magic but with rpg elements and LOTS of LOOT.9/10. Great fun!*EDIT* The only problem I have encountered with this game (once) is when I tried to login, I was 870 in the queue (wait time 20mins). As the content is dynamic (daily refreshes etc on adventures/loot) it requires you to be connected to their servers and by the looks of it they need more! Hopefully they are on top of this.			"

												now it's not often i put money into a free game.  the only Free 2 Play game i've put any money at all into was Warframe and that's only because i didn't want to get rid of my stuff (collection nut here :P ) but Card Hunters is just so fricken great that i'd put money into it.  it mixes tabletop DND with a deck building game where your character's equipment decides what cards are in your deck, then when you've equipped your characters, it tosses you into battles where you're literally looking down at a board with your characters as little, old-fashioned, flat cardboard pieces on plastic stands.  it's so damn cool!  as a 90s kid i grew up playing board games with pieces like that so this is a total throwback, but at the same time it's fresh, new, and just so god damn cool!  there's nothing else to say.  out of 5 stars, this gets 1,000,000!  some may say this is a bit over the top, but i just love this game!  plain and simple!  just love it to little bitsies! *squee* and i'm done.

												Been playing for a few weeks and game is great. I am playing it as a casual player and just recently through some money at it because I like it  so much. Not that this is a Pay to Win as the epic and legendary items are not always the best items depending on your build. Some of the best builds going use no legendary items. If you have any remote interest in this game it is worth the download and a few hours to see if it is your thing. I wasn't sure I would care for this type of turn based game but seems I do. And it brings back memories of when I used to play board games more often. Community is helpful online and ingame, just needs more people to get hooked. Developers are active which is great to see.

												I'm a fan of deck-building games, but this isn't really recommendable.This is fun for the first 6-8 character levels.  There is a nice table-top RPG flavor with the nerdy Dungeon Master commenting on the little adventures.  It is a little taste of nostalgia for those who used to play D&D in the old days.I can't recommend this because outside of the nostalgia hit with light humor this isn't much game here.And while it was entertaining enough for a few hours of entertainment, if you do not have a perfect internet connection the game will drop you and force you to reconnect to the server.  Repeatedly.There is seriously no reason an extremely simple single-player campaign game like this needs to be connected to the server at all times.  It smacks of blizzard's implementation of the new Starcraft, except this game is free.It is hard to lose at lower levels, but as you get to around level 8 dungeons suddenly things get ridiculous.  A shark-bear ate my cleric in the first round with three bites, destroying her armor with the first bite.  A shark-bear is mildly humorous... but, meh.Then I went back to the board and my question asking, ""Why is there a ridiculous constant internet connection requirement?"" was removed from the board.I read the negative review stating that around level 10 you need to start buying the in-game pizza currency with real money to be competitive.Then I deleted Card Hunter from my game library.  It was kind of wacky and mildly fun for a bit, but that's it. "

												I'd never been a fan of tabletop games, or even card games, prior to being introduced to Hearthstone. Now, it seems, I can't get enough of the latter. Card Hunter combines everything that there is to like in CCGs (although here you have loot that gives cards rather than actual card collecting) with everything there is to like in RPGs, and the end result is something really special. The game is constantly rewarding, and you're never left feeling like you HAVE to spend cash on Pizza (the premium currency) to keep up. The campaign is fun, with the distinctly tabletop chunks of text describing each mission. Missions can be either a sort of campaign, where there are some interconnecting bits of story, or dungeon-crawling treasure hunts with a guaranteed high-rarity reward. The multiplayer (I've only played a few games of it though) is far more rewarding than any other free-to-play game that I've encountered. You get a reward chest for every win 1-20 DAILY.Did I mention there's coop?			"

												I played this game a lot during closed and open beta.  This game has that fun yet frustrating feel to it.  Blocks and Armor cards that your enemies carry can ruin your best laid plans.  Don't take this game for a technical and customizable strategy game like Final Fantasy Tactics.  This game is probably 50/50 luck to planning. Imagine Final Fantasy Tactics if each character in your party has a Hearthstones deck. That's this game.  It's free to play, so the price can't be beat.  The premium mode purchased with in game cash, aka Pizza, gets you an extra item after every battle.  If you plan on playing more, that extra item is really useful.  Many times that item matches the best rarity of the item you got from your chest. Got 1 epic in your chest?  Now you might get 2.Pros: Short battles (most of the time)Customizable strategiesFlexible partiesLots of cards and itemsEasy to learnCons:Stupid, no reason lag, especially after playing a card.Only 3 party members per teamtimegated (sort of. It's still gated, but barely.)Enemies sometimes feel OP. "

												I'm going to start off by saying that I really love this game! Even though it may seem repetitive, I have not yet become even the slightest bit bored at any point, and I currently have a level 10 team, so not too bad so far considering I've had the game for two days! Campaign Mode - Okay, so with this mode, we're accompanied by Gary and Melvin, two 'CPU' versions of the card/board game competitors. Some of their lines are actually really funny, and they've not annoyed me yet which is surprising consdiering everything annoys me haha. Basically, what's great about campaign is that, at first, it's really easy to win and learn how to play, but once you start to get the hang of things, it becomes more difficult - to the point where it may take more than one attempt to beat the level - and this is obviously a technique to prevent boredom. The levels are of course possible, but they are challenging and require you to be strategic, which I love. There are many shops with many different types of weaponary and equipment, most of which are affordable. The characters have great customisation, including names which I think is a great detail, though it's small. It really feels like the team is yours and you know everything they can and can't do. Speaking of the characters, there are three per party. A warrior, mage and priest (healer). I'll explain the main pros and cons of each that I've noticed.Warrior: Pros - Good attacks and defenses, Cons - You have to be up close to use the attacks which makes your warrior vulnerable to attacksMage: Pros - Attacks from a distance, Cons - Low health, no armourPriest: Pros - Can heal the whole team repeatedlty, Cons - Not a lot of good attacks and defensesBut yeah, overall for campaign, everything is really great - characters, equipment, weaponary, levels, difficulty, even the dialogue is fun haha.Multiplayer Mode - I haven't played too much of this mode, but overall I like this too. You're always matched against someone on a similar multiplayer level as you, which makes the match fair, and everyone's team is levelled to the exact same also. Since in this mode your team is at the highest level, you can pretty much use whichever weapons you want to, whereas you can't do that in campaign as the level you are at limits what you use to fight with, which is understandable levelling. But the weapons you use in multiplayer mode are what you own in campaign mode, but both parties are different in each mode if you want them to be. So yeah, I definitely recommend getting this game if you like this kind of thing, and hey, it's free, what do you have to lose?			"

												This is a great game that does F2P right. The game is a blend of turn based Dungeons & Dragons style battles with a collectible card game. Blue Manchu has managed to combine the two types of game quite well. Each piece of equipment you attach to a character has a set of cards associated with it. This allows the player to quickly change their deck without going through and micromanaging every single card. In battle, the cards are drawn randomly from the pool each character has and are used to take actions. Movement, healing, attacking, and other status effects are all invoked by cards. This makes battles dynamic, interesting, and random.There is quite a bit of content for free but the game can get a bit grindy at higher levels. Several expansion modules have been released that can be purchased in game. There are also a few other perks that can be purchased, such as an increase in loot drops and additional character images. None of this is necessary to enjoy the game and there is plenty to do without paying a dime. Blue Manchu has balanced the difficult task of having a free game that is not pay to win and is worth paying a few dollars for for players who really enjoy it. I would recommend getting the additional modules, as they are pretty fun and help level up a bit quicker.I first played this game when it first came out so my Steam playtime doesn't represent my full playtime. I had taken a break from it and saw that it was added to Steam. With the Steam release is the new co-op feature. This allows a person to each control a character and take turns. This has been a lot of fun with friends and adds another element to the game since it requires focusing on a single character rather than the whole team.I would highly recommend this game for RPG and CCG fans. The two genres are blended perfectly to create a unique and engaging experience. There's nothing else really like it.			"

This game is free and you can certainly get through it without spending anything but I loved it so much the first time I played that I had to throw down money to support it. The game play remind me a bit of MTG. I enjoyed the strategy of it - having to really think about what weapons to bring into battle and the best way to play your cards. No battle is ever the same and different enemies require different equipment. I LOVE the look and feel of this game. The random objects lying around the table are a nice touch. This is the best free game I have ever played on Steam and one of the best strategy card games I've played.			"

												Oh boy, this game is great. It's a dungeon crawler/card game in the style of old tabletop RPGs. As a fan of both turnbased combat and cardgames, this is right up my alley.The core gameplay is really satisfying, and with the hundreds of options for equipment (which determines what cards are in your deck) it can keep you hooked for hours on end.The best thing is, it's free! Even though there are things to buy (adventures, skins, 'extra' drops from chests), I've never once felt like I needed to pay up to continue enjoying the game.			"

												As someone who doesn't get around to playing actual DnD, this game is pretty amazing. It's a lot of fun, and grinding gets pretty addictive. Though I wish they'd have more classes, you can't have an adventuring party without a rogue. So get on that, and it'll be perfect.			"

												So far, I have enjoyed the game, but one glitch has prevented me from fully enjoying the game. For me, every button is misplaced, but the graphic for the buttons are not, causing me to have to click to the left of the graphic to be able to click the button. I believe that this is caused by my screen being fairly small, while the game requires a bigger screen. I have come to this conclusion because some parts of the game are off-screen, even the Shift+Tab Steam pop-up. I don't believe there is a way to change the size of the game's window, and if there is, I can't find it. Any and all help would be appreciated.P.S, I reccomend this game, just make sure you're screen is big.			"

												Seemed really good at first, but turned into a P2W very quickly.  Even on solo, around lvl 7-8 you hit a brick wall that you cannot pass without paying.  Up until that point I was hooked.  The game does play well and reminds me of the 80's with the friends in the basement rolling dice.  Take out the P2W and balance the solo past lvl 7 and this could be a good one.  For now, the way it is set up, thumbs down.  I'll check back later and see what happens, it is very new.			"

Captures the feel of actual tabletop combat with a system that is simple enough to be intuitive and accessible but complicated enough to promote tragedy and gear building.

												I wanted to like this game, but once you get past the introductory campaign (and even somewhat during it), it effectively becomes pay-to-progress, as you get effectively zero money from drops, and you can't sell the majority of what you DO pick up until ""later in the campaign"", which does you no good when your inventory is full of crap drops (and a few that you can't use untill you either level or get a new character).  Battle system is...passable, but that's part of the problem - you need boots that get you more, longer movement in order to catch an enemy type that likes to retreat, but those cost upwards of 150, and since you can't sell things you no longer need you have no money except for the rare ""treasure"" drops (which aren't labelled as rare half the time, BTW), you're stuck either with a full inventory or shelling out real-world cash for in-game cash in order to buy the thing that lets you catch the enemy.  Or both.			"

												I'm a tabletop RPG player, so I recognize the tropes that have lovingly been parodied here. Card Hunter has a satisfying gameplay loop; a turn-based combat punctuated by loot, amusing characters, and options. The card-based mechanics are great, and provides a fresh take on the combat you find at a D&D table. I can't recommend it enough for anyone who has loved, does love, or might love Dungeons & Dragons.			"

Also for the the rng of the game not going that way for some I belive that after a update late last year even that problem out and you can't say that the game is unfair because you have to account for it when playing a game with deck building  like this.

												Cute little game idea, really funny spoof, but I'm not motivated to spend money on it.  F2P burns out quickly, which is ok by me.  The art, spoofing old D&D stuff, is well done.  The cheesy gamer-dork characters are funny, for the most part.  The cards from equipment idea is a well done through the games mechanics, but feels unbalanced, or hindered, in some way.  But it is free, I can’t trash them for that much.  "

												I admit I expected nothing from a free game but a couple of unrewarding hours of obsessive compulsive looting and lots of micro-transaction requests. Instead, I found an amazingly fun, well balanced and TOTALLY NOT Pay-per-Win gem that I can't get bored of.In these times of crappy cellphone-like games copying each other shamelessly, it's so refreshing to find such an original twist to the classic collectible cards and board games. It has a soft learning curve but, as new cards and enemies appear, the strategies to play multiply fast.The campaign and challenges are extremely fun to play, and the multiplayer is designed so you will not be abused by richer users, even if you never paid a cent. It's just one of those games that will have you playing ""just one more level"" all night long.Damn, I love this game!			"

												This game was exactly what I was looking for. I love card based games in the real world, but don't always have others to play against. This one will sometimes really make you think, as sometimes the cards you get won't be ideal - just like any real stategist game. Work with what you have. Cards available to each character will vary depending on what is in the deck for that character, and that is based on what items are equipped to the character. Because of this, no scenerio will ever play out exactly the same, even if you've already played that level before. Levels also follow storylines, so if you like to feel like you're fighting for a specific cause, you'll have one. Stop those gnolls from eating the villagers!			"

												Once you get past the mandatory tutorial (which may seem a bit long, but will help you grip the mechanics of the game) this game is a treasure gem in recent RPGs.The graphics are really nice with their comic touch and also allow low-end computers to enjoy the game.The vast inventory of items that you can acquire is pure awesome.It is fun and addictive, and still very challenging. I found playing co-op with some friends really made the game even more awesome.While I would like more costumes (customization <3), those that are is quite cool. Downsides include the quite annoying ""game master"" that jumps around every now and then. He is fun in the tutorial, but we should be able to turn him off later on. The notion that you can pay to earn better gear is not good, but still doesn't break the game IMO. This is not a pay-to-win game, but it does give you an advantage in the beginning.			"

												Very cool game about a game.  D-n-Desque single and co-op that has a nice interface and unique (at least to me)  game play.  Basically you are playing against the DM on various maps and the goal is to complete 3 missions per scenario.  Each mission is progressively tougher.  It is your team against the DM.  In turn based combat you cast spells, attack, or move about the board to defeat the oponent or achieve specific goals.  You do this by drawing random cards from your deck.  Your deck is built, based upon the type of equipment you are wearing or using.  So a certain shield might give you three cards, two of which are defence and one offence.  A certain sword would give you 5 attacks.  As you get higher in level you are able to use better equipement and get better cards.  This is an excellent, simple, well put together game.  And it's free!  Of course you can make micro-purchases which I have done.  It helps get better equipment and scenarios (free game has a ton, though).  Mostly I made the purchase to support the developers.  An excellent and fun game that is worthy of earning some real coin.  I see some comments regarding a need to pay to progress.  Not true.  I have played solo and with freinds (max 3 per group so far).  We just now, at lvl 9+, decided to purchase items and only as support of devs.  Maybe this need is true at higher levels but even so, considering the time we have into it, I'd say the cost is very reasonable.

												A Dungeons and Dragons-type, isometric, overhead, retro, tactics game, Card Hunter has consumed about 3 months of my life. Players compete against AI and other humans over Steam or over the Browser and play cards to move, deal damage, heal hitpoints, or change the rules of the tiles players stand on, in a 3v3 or 3 vs bot arenas.  A simple overarching storyline tells the tale of Mary Mymax's game (a nod to the great Gary Gymax from Dungeons and Dragon's fame.)  A second expansion came out last summer.  There are halloween items and a christmas store, and new battles are fireing every 30 seconds successfully against players.  Come join the thousands of people to play this game. Personally, 4 out of my 6 rarest achievments out of 1600+ achievements are from Card Hunter, so you're taking the advice of an addict.			"

												I am far from finishing this game, but what I have played is very charming.  I like the fusion of old school paper and pencil (and miniature) role-playing, and collectible card game mechanics.  The cards in your deck, and the actions you can take, are all determined by the gear your character equips.  Everything in the game is touched with a humor that lightly mocks gamer culture nerdiness, while obviously also being a love letter to the same.  I like the art style, which kinda skirts the line between Munchkin art and classic old-school game art.  The most important thing is that it actually plays well, and is a lot of fun.Oh, also, its free to play.  So try it.			"

												This is the best free turn based strategy game I've ever played.It has solo, 2-3 player coop and versus. So you can enjoy it however you want.The best part about the game is the item system. Each character have a deck of cards like attacks, armor, move, block... This deck is made by the items your character has equiped. Each item gives between 3 and 6 cards. But, it's all or nothing. If an item have 5 great cards and an handicap, you have to deal with it. This makes for very unique character building that can be optimized in a lot of ways.There is also 3 classes and 3 races for characters that all have items that can exclusively be equiped to them.There is a freaking lot of items in this game and, yep, it's free to play, you can buy more items. But it's not really a problem to me. You will lack some items in the begining but if you play through a good part of the campaign, you'll have a lot of them. If you want to help the devs your options are : timed subscription for an extra item after each fight, buying individual chests with guaranteed high rarity items and new side-missions with guarantee item the first time you complete it. None of those are required to truly enjoy the game. There is also some character reskin you can buy that doesn't affect gameplay at all.(If you want to buy the missions, the bundle isn't you only option. If you go on the lock mission, you'll be able to unlock it for some paid currency which is a better deal if you don't care about the rest of the bundle.)The campaing itself it very fun. Each mission is a different challenge with unique opponents. I've yet to complete it. The missions get harder and harder, often requiring you to change your items to match specific opponents. I've started it again with a friend and it still is a blast to play.But, the story is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't expect anything from that part.An amazing strategy game that gives you a lor of options and always harder challenges. Solo, coop and versus, all are amazing!			"

												This is a great game. Card Hunter is mixture of a bit of Final Fantasy Tactics and a bit from Dungeons and Dragons. I'd say the game's pros are that you can name and pick your party members. Each party member can use different skills and weapons based on their class and race. You can change your characters look for a bit of in-game currency but its purely cosmedic. Cons of the game can have difficulty spikes between dungeons so you have to grind for levels and weapons at older dungeons. I'd recommend this game for fans of board games but mostly for Dungeons and Dragons fans.			"

												As a big D&D gamer back in the day this game brings back a ton of welcome nostalgia. For a free to play game it's pretty damn fantastic what you get, but I'm sure I'll be sending some money their way when I can figure out the different tiers of purchasing. The only thing I would love to see is a game just like this but instead of card based you get to roll some virtual dice.			"

												So far (62 hours played) this is one of the most enjoyable games I have played.Likes:- Well-built, runs smoothly and no crashes.- Looks good, original artwork that suits its slightly wacky style.- Entertaining gameplay in matches.  Most are challenging enough to be fun without being frustrating.  Some are very challenging, making you think carefully about team build and every card you play.- Interesting party building.  Three classes, three races and a huge number of loot cards gives enough variety to make your parties feel unique.- Good value for money.  I bought one expansion, which gives me a months club membership and few other bits, but I am quite certain you can play the campaign without struggling for free.  Multiplayer does have the capacity for being influenced by spending money, but at my level I've not seen any of that.- Fun PvP.  Played about 10 matches so far.  All players I have met have been friendly and only one or two matches have been one-sided.  The others have been nicely balanced and very entertaining.- Awesome humour.  If you every played much PnP Dungeons and Dragons, this game will make you smile and chuckle constantly.- Good community.  The world chat is mostly good-natured.  For a competitive game there is a surprising lack of leetness and rage.Dislikes:- Literally not found any yet.  I suspect that if I get to high-rating PvP, balance issues might start to appear, but none so far.			"

												This is the best free turn based strategy game I've ever played.It has solo, 2-3 player coop and versus. So you can enjoy it however you want.The best part about the game is the item system. Each character have a deck of cards like attacks, armor, move, block... This deck is made by the items your character has equiped. Each item gives between 3 and 6 cards. But, it's all or nothing. If an item have 5 great cards and an handicap, you have to deal with it. This makes for very unique character building that can be optimized in a lot of ways.There is also 3 classes and 3 races for characters that all have items that can exclusively be equiped to them.There is a freaking lot of items in this game and, yep, it's free to play, you can buy more items. But it's not really a problem to me. You will lack some items in the begining but if you play through a good part of the campaign, you'll have a lot of them. If you want to help the devs your options are : timed subscription for an extra item after each fight, buying individual chests with guaranteed high rarity items and new side-missions with guarantee item the first time you complete it. None of those are required to truly enjoy the game. There is also some character reskin you can buy that doesn't affect gameplay at all.(If you want to buy the missions, the bundle isn't you only option. If you go on the lock mission, you'll be able to unlock it for some paid currency which is a better deal if you don't care about the rest of the bundle.)The campaing itself it very fun. Each mission is a different challenge with unique opponents. I've yet to complete it. The missions get harder and harder, often requiring you to change your items to match specific opponents. I've started it again with a friend and it still is a blast to play.But, the story is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't expect anything from that part.An amazing strategy game that gives you a lor of options and always harder challenges. Solo, coop and versus, all are amazing!			"

It's a worthwhile adventure, often difficult, with significant replay for those who want to collect the vast variety of loot available. Moreover, the game is mostly free, with only a dozen or so side missions gated behind a paywall. Try it out for free, and decide later if you want to buy those bonus missions!			"

												The game is fine, but progression is slow, feels repetitive, and it lacks the type of customization and character building that a game like this should have.  Why must we be unable to choose the gender of our characters, and be forced to use warrior, mage, and priest.  Also, the card style is rather odd; but I understand why they would go with it.But you know; it's a free game, and it's pretty fun for a while.  So you might as well give it a try and see if you enjoy it.  Just don't go into here thinking from all the other reviews that this is anything close to a real D&D experience; because it most definitely is not; and that type of thinking will just make you disappointed.Also; it feels like poor practice that they rub it in your face every time you complete a mission that you do not have the paid subscription.

												Card Hunter.Judging from the reviews this is a game most people either love or hate. So, what is it like?Well, first off it's turn based strategy with a game board theme, so don't expect tremendous graphics, or RTS action. It's played on a board, with cardboard-style characters. If you've played classic table-top D&D you'll have the general idea.The player has a team of 3 characters. I chose all dwarves, which seemed to work fine, as they have plenty of health and their lack of movement can be compensated by giving them extra movement cards. Warrior, mage, cleric, all good in their own ways. The player start with 5 movement/attack cards and draws 3 more each turn. The draws are random, so expect to lose a few boards because you get terrible draws. Generally, though, the boards are testing and interesting, but not strategically hard, as long as you equip your people with sensible weapons, armours, and abilities. It's not the same game as, say, Wesnoth, obviously, but is at around the same tactical difficulty level. Blocks and armours do matter, and as you play more, you'll begin to see how the mechanics work, what cards you need to keep, etc.I tried multiplayer - it was good fun, and you get much better equipment, to ensure a level playing field.Card hunter is 'free to play'; I haven't felt the need to buy anything so far -  up to level 14. That of course may change, as the challenges get harder.Try it for free - if you don't like it, play something else; after all, it doesn't cost anything to try! "

												I recommend this game but with reservations.  Lets start by saying I really enjoy(ed) this game.  Its a very cool idea.  I love the way they made it a turn-based, RPG, table-top looking game and integrated it with a card collecting game.  Very unique and a breath of fresh air.  The graphics are absolutely wonderful.  Game play is challenging but still very easy to pick up.   But...and there's always a but...I don't believe in playing games with in-app purchases.  The best I can tell, you get your characters to level 8 and there is no more new content without paying.  You can revisit old dungeons or create new characters and level them up to 8 but, if you don't want to pay then the game stops at level 8.  I know what free-to-play means, it just would have been nice to have a no-frills, no-pay option.  You know, complete the game for free or destroy everything in your path for money.  Anyway, I still recommend this game because it was a ton of fun getting them to 8 but truthfully I uninstalled it shortly after that.I should add I didn't try the multiplayer and hated the special impossible dungeons.  Maybe the multiplayer ones would bring more fun to the ""table"".  LOL, see what I did there?			"

												This game is charming and very interesting. If you are a fan of tabletop games, such as Dungeong and Dragons, I would recommend getting this. They have a card member club feature that unlocks more content, and after playing for an hour I am thinking of joining the club, and it also allows for you to buy different increments of the club membership including a 7 day membership, which I think is pretty cool. You don't have to commit to a 30 day membership. The games graphics are not complex, but they are charming and work for the genre, and the dialogue is rather funny.The combat system is based off of card draws from a deck, and it is rather intracate. I can tell it was designed well, and I did not find any bugs. I did however find some frustration in the right cards being drawn from the deck each round, but I suppose that is all part of enjoying a deck card type game.I would at least try this out.			"

												A fun, laid back, yet deceptively deep and addictive experience. Card hunter plays like a board game complete with cut out characters and your own decks to build. Your character can progress in level, but the main way to get better is to equip better gear. Every piece of equipment puts different cards into your deck. These cards are then payed during the turn-based sessions. Complete those and you'll get loot and money to improve your characters. Nice and easy, but still fun.Best of all is that this game is free. You can pay for additional campaigns or different skins for your characters, but everything is optional. As far as I can see, this is no pay to win. I can't speak for the mulitplayer portion however.			"

												Card Hunter is one of the best co-op turn-based strategy games in existence. Enough said there.Given there's no true pay to win or catchup mechanisms, however, PvP tends to be won by the guy who's been around the longest. Since this PvP is what most would consider the endgame, this means that the game eats itself as it ages. Attempts have been made at making the game more evangelical. Leagues, particularly limited format ones, are incredible, and maps you create can be added to the game in the Mauve Manticore dungeons, which are finally firing once per month like they stated when they first devised the idea. Further, Aloyzo's Arsenal allows players to submit custom items which can be added to the game.The issue here is that none of their evangelical work gets to the heart of the problem, which is that their loot design denies new players the ability to try entire categories of strategies - burst mage and vampire priest being the worst offenders - for their first months of playtime. And if a set of ranked maps favors these old-player builds for that month, well, Card Hunter likely has lower new player retention that month.Basically, the game needs to ensure that there's no exclusivity. Stay to win is almost as bad as pay to win.Still, play the PvE. It's incredible, and you'll have a blast.			"

												The chances of getting the cards that you need in battle is almost impossible, which renders deck building a moot point. You will spend most of your time just chasing around the mobs that will just continually walk away from you.  Its frustrating to say the least. Neat concept for a game, good for being free. But just to irritating to play on the regular.			"

												Fun little game! Kinda like D&D and MTG had a love child. I love the overall humor of the group of gaming nerds playing this game and using their brother's cards and characters at the beginning. I also dig the old school D&D-style module art! Cool game, highly recommended!			"

												For a free game it offers you a little bit of that D&D magic you can enjoy. Its simple, fun, fair and quick addictive especially if you have friends. I played this a lot on the browser version but the Steam one allows you to play with two friends and really go on your own little adventure of quests. For free its a definite try I say.			"

												this could be easily one of the best games on the market.but they are kinda making you pay money for better dice roll and better cards.so if you don't pay money.. sometimes it's hard to play since you die very easily.ITS JUST PAY TO WIN LOLat first i liked this game very much, but then you encounter problems with not being able to play simply because you didn't pay and don't have the equipment..also.. RNG picks cards with no sense of logic whatsoeverinstead of card being picked from categories as in RNG for Moving cards separetly from RNG for offense cards and separetly RNG for defense cards..this game picks all cards randomly from one pool of cards and you end up with 5 moving cards and only one Offensive cards and no defense. Or sometimes you have 5 offensive cards one move and  no def and then when you can't reach an enemy with only one moving card then you have to descard good cards.In other words.. this game has a great concept like a lot of board RPG games..but they messed it up with the mechanics of the game. literally it gets very annoying when you don't get some times of cards at all and not able to play the game to the best of your ability.this is a great concept mixed with developer's greed = failed game.i don't get it.. why would they make a game.. waste so much time on making it.. and then just mess it up with Pay to Win system and illogical cards picking system.i'm trying to play it.. i'm only level 12 and it's hard as hell to pass missions over level 12-13 and even lower levels since i don't have uber strong cards and the card picking system doesn't give me needed cards.sometimes it looks like at crucial moments when you need some type of card you don't get them at all. and enemy seems always to have the right cards. they hit you with the same attack every timeTHE ENEMY HITS YOU WITH SAME ATTACKS EVERY TIMEand you can't use same attacks or even structure your tactics because you don't recieve the cards from each category.it's kinda stupid.but the game is fun though,, but really messed up.don't play it if you don't like tedious grind.if you decide to pay.. then you will have great equipment but still you will encounter problems with card picking system			"

												Card Hunter is a fun and smart game offering an intriguing mix of strategic combat and loot collection. It's a worthwhile adventure, often difficult, with significant replay for those who want to collect the vast variety of loot available. Moreover, the game is mostly free, with only a dozen or so side missions gated behind a paywall. Try it out for free, and decide later if you want to buy those bonus missions!			"

												This game was exactly what I was looking for. I love card based games in the real world, but don't always have others to play against. This one will sometimes really make you think, as sometimes the cards you get won't be ideal - just like any real stategist game. Work with what you have. Cards available to each character will vary depending on what is in the deck for that character, and that is based on what items are equipped to the character. Because of this, no scenerio will ever play out exactly the same, even if you've already played that level before. Levels also follow storylines, so if you like to feel like you're fighting for a specific cause, you'll have one. Stop those gnolls from eating the villagers!			"

												The game starts off well enough, and is Thoroughly enjoyable. But by the time you hit level 6 you'll start noticing power discrepancies. By level 8, it has become a major annoyance, When you start getting close to level 10, you will find yourself consistently out numbered, starting in bad positions, against enemies that can deal far more damage than you can consistently and with defences that negate entire swaths of cards, and healing abilities far above your own. Eventually, it becomes unplayable.Worse, this is not the fault of bad gear and cannot simply be bought out of as with so called pay-to-win games. Good gear is abundant, you just can’t use any of it due to the horrible pedantic power node system.Looking at the game’s pedigree, including staff from Irrational Games/Looking Glass studios and advisers from Magic the Gathering, one of two things comes to mind. You would either expect the game to be phenomenal, or you still have painful memories of Bioshock: Infinite and Modern Format. Sadly, I have to say that it starts as the first and quickly moves towards the later.			"

I like the idea of weapons providing different cards for you to draw but I just can't find enough variation in mechanic to make it fun. maybe i'm not high enough level to see anything cool yet?			"

												this is a great game and its free are you serious? the game style i like the ONLY bad thing i can say is the classes are very limiting. i mean no archer? that makes a  certain block card far more useless. however the game is great i just find soemtimes its better to leave a slot empty keeping weaker cards of of the deck and allowing better cards to be drawn that mechanic i feel waters down the excitement of getting new items.however love the co-op aspect grealy approve but would love to see larger sessions like maybe 4-6 player matches throw us some real mean monsters and have fun. this type off game is much better PvE than PVP in my opnion.

												Great game full of nerdy D&D fun. There are plenty of pay to players out there, but due to the ranking system you don't have to fight them if you don't want to pay to play. The whole game depends on giving your characters equipment that works together, making an effective strategy in the match, and perhaps most of all, pure luck. I have beaten players many ranks higher than me, and have been beaten by players many ranks lower than me. This game is designed well enough to separate the pay to players and the casual players. Anyone who gripes about pay to players probably just doesn't know how to strategize effectively or work with the cards they're given. The league matches with prebuilt decks are where a players true colors show. Many times I have beaten higher ranked players when given even playing fields.Overall its a really fun game if you don't take it too seriously. Also there is an editor where you can build your own maps and scenarios which is awesome.			"

												It's a good mix between a Magic card game and old-school turn-based D&D games. This is the best free game I've ever gotten from Steam. There are so many bad games in this niche. This is a good one. The early encounters are fairly simple, but it rapidly increases into challenging but well-balanced strategic combats.The setting is a childhood D&D tabletop game so it's light-hearted but the game is extremely strategic and many of the encounters in the single player campaign are quite challenging. A couple seemed nearly impossible at first but then I took the time to change my gear to specifically meet the needs of that fight and I prevailed.   Very good game.			"

												Card Hunter is a pretty fun TBST (Turn Based Stadegy game) that dosent take itself too seriously.Pros:+Fun, somewhat relaxing gameplay+A good sense of humor+An easy game to pick up and play.Cons:-At only 2 hours in, I'm already seeing it's ""paid prividges"" leaking through it's free to play skinSo mainly my problem with the game is that their are a lot of things I'm seeing the devs tring to peddle to you as a way for you to spend money, but really, the amount they ask for isn't too much. I mean, the pizza slices (the ""premium cash"") seem overpriced, but I havent really sunk my teeth into the paid part of the game yet, so I don't know, maybe 10 dollars for 330 pizza slices isnt that much, and 10 dollars to play more maps dosent seem like much anyways. I would reccomend this game to anyone who wants a nice casual experince with a mix of D&D like graphics, card gameplay a little like hearthstone, or just a casual tbsg.			"

You dont need to pay to win at all. two things i noticed is that if you close the game, computer crash, or you have a black out during a mission it counts as a fail. the other thing is that even though you compete the mission and it says it will be reset in a day. its like how long is a day? its been two days since i have completed the mission and the icon is still saying its on cool down...other then that havent tried the coop or multiplayer, but i think they will be awesome.

												My buddy and I got this game because it seemed like an interesting little time-waster that we could get a psuedo pen-and-paper feel from. It ended up being more strategically interesting and pretty damn good fun to play with a little bit of the rebel yell in your system (that's whiskey). We haven't given multiplayer arena a shot, but for a free game we didn't have too many complaints. If you play co-op campaign though, and you don't have a third person (and you or your buddy are now drunk on said whiskey) it can get a bit more challenging. You do get more cards with two people, but you can't diversify as well. There are some adventures that benefit more from three medicore charcters than two very good ones. A lot of reviews claim this game is too hard, especially with terrain effects. I think those folks are getting frustrated because they can't play the game in a SPECIFIC way. We banged our heads against those maps a little bit, but generally found that we could do just as well with a little creative thinking, and more whiskey.			"

												Barely recommend because it's free to try and you might just like it.It's a good design but just too much grinding the same levels involved if you don't pay for more loot options.Also connectivity problems because every turn happens on the internet server (permanent connection needed).But it was fun for some hours...

												This is a really fun, really unique game. I am personally a fan of tabletop games, and enjoyed this. The combat is rather well done, and the game very much feels like an actual tabletop- if a little simplistic. HOWEVER. THere are issues. I cannot tell you how many times the game has become stuck in the short time I've played it. It will feeze during attacks, during movement, hell, half the time it gets stuck on an infinate loading screen going to the MAIN MENU when you START UP THE GAME. And for the record, while my PC is in no way a top-of-the-line gaming machine, it can run most other games I feel the need to play on the highest graphics settings. This may be a problem that I alone have experienced, but it had sadly made the game needlessly difficult to play. Thankfully, there is an autosave feature every turn, so if you have to exit out of the game when it gets stuck, it will put you right back where you left off. I still reccomend this game, but I also feel obligated to warn you about these very troubling issues that I, personally, have experienced.			"

												This game took me by surprise. It's more or less a D&D knockoff and as a kid I played an actual board game that was similar to D&D. To anyone that is skeptical of the game, just give it a decent go and try to reach level 7 and try to play with friends before deciding that you don't want to play this game. Card Hunter is a game with simple graphics and a simple idea that ends up being really fun in the end, you can sit back with your friends and play through the campaign together in co-op mode or you can go through it solo, or you can join the mulitplayer arena and do some PVP.

												The game is a dreamy short session TBS crammed with excellence in the gameplay and in its character. The online community is great and I had a lot of fun with both competitive and co-op play, after finishing the campaign, which was quite a ride and has many difficult challenges for repeat play.Small caution - the forum community is a clique and in my experience, very much best avoided if you want to enjoy the game. I don't play it anymore explicitly because I feel sick thinking about some of the forum behaviour, particularly one of the developers, but if you can ignore it and you probably can, the game itself is a masterpiece.

												This is a great game. Card Hunter is mixture of a bit of Final Fantasy Tactics and a bit from Dungeons and Dragons. I'd say the game's pros are that you can name and pick your party members. Each party member can use different skills and weapons based on their class and race. You can change your characters look for a bit of in-game currency but its purely cosmedic. Cons of the game can have difficulty spikes between dungeons so you have to grind for levels and weapons at older dungeons. I'd recommend this game for fans of board games but mostly for Dungeons and Dragons fans.			"

												I really enjoy this game, that being said, there are things that can be better.  There seems to be an extreme amount of lag or delay while playing the campaign.  I click on a card to play it and it sometimes takes as long as 4 minutes to complete the actions of that card, but during the CPU's actions, there is no delay.  Is it because the game requires you to me online at all times?  I get that for multiplayer, but that does not make any sense for the campaign.  Fix those delays and the game is a 4 out of 5 for me, while its still broken, its a 2.5 out of 5.			"

												Since my original negative review I have changed my mind on this game to a positive recommendation. If you love Strategy, Rpg or Fantasy/Adventure D&D style video & boardgames this is a game that might peek your interest. It plays like a digital dungeon crawling boardgame, has good geeky humor. Its challenging, fun, and loots of lot. As of now though the game begs for additional character classes and races as there are only 3 classes and 3 races to choose from. It would also be great to see additional skins for your characters.(07/15) Original Review:Server lag and update problems. The game has potential to bad it is flawed due to developer incompetence.

												Don't get me wrong it's a nice concept, a simplified version of DnD without the hastle of trying to learn how to build characters through an ocean of content. But the way it is now some things need to change. Most situations feel like they need to be handled by more then 3 team members and the game overwhelms you in later missions with large amounts of NPCs that are both small damage and large damage leaning more in the favor of large damage enemies. Usually ending with you trying to prioritize the high damage enemies but taking too much damage or losses to consider the exchanges worth while.Pros:Simple:Easy to learn, your abilities are based on the equipment you have, enemies aren't overcomplicated time bombs you don't want to go near, races are genericly balanced, and classes have designated equips.Great Fun with Friends:Co-op with friends is a blast, makes everything twice as fun.Comedic Writing:The game can be funny at times making it feel more worthwile to play through the campaignEquiment:Easy to understand, a little hard to obtain without grinding lower level missions, and equipment is balanced with major and minor power tokens so you aren't a complete god against the AI.Easy to Change:You don't have to stick to one party, you can buy new party members for a low cost of ingame currency and interchange party members at any time to fit your play style.Cons:Classes aren't what they seem to be:The classes can be built one of two ways, either all aggression or complete support roles. There are no effective in betweens because you're either losing out on damage or don't help the other members in your team.Wizards aren't at all DPS, most spells at a wizard's disposal are weak or are easily snuffed out by enemy armors/blocks. Also most beginning damage spells are close range that deal no damage, meaning you have to sit in damage range just to do damage and this follows you well into mid game depending on your load out. The wizards that can control spells that manipulate the battlefield have no damage what so ever. Priests are squishy supports that can't stay in combat very long for the same reason, they do almost no damage. With the all aggression priests they have almost no support and once again can't stay in combat because they can't take a hit.Warriors are either high damage DPS with no range or medium DPS with range. Warriors aren't tanks either considering most NPCs will just chip off 50% or more of your member's HP without even trying. Warriors either move into range and then have the target immediatly move out of range afterwards or do little to no damage with longer range attacks.Equipment:It will screw you again and again, most equipment is either okay but nothing substantial. Anything that's good either has terrible draw backs from using them or require so many power tokens you can't use anything else that's good until you're high level. Your equipment is determind by RNG so you might just get a bunch of stuff for warriors or priests, but get nothing for your mage. Essentially making that unit completly worthless unless you do a grindfest or buy new overpriced equipment. Main issues with equipment is you're forced to use low level equipment even though your other gear is leagues ahead of it and it's mainly useless in your missions. There isn't any scaling in gear level, you have your low level gear that doesn't require power tokens, mid range gear that requires minor power tokens, and high grade gear that requires either major power tokens or both major and minor power tokens. At max level team members, you only get 4 major power tokens and 4 minor tower tokens. Which you have to try and prioritize certain equipment slots over others, making you weak extremely weak in one department and strong in another. The Warrior class has 9 equipment slots, Mage 10 slots, and Priests with 10 slots. With most late game gear using 2 major power tokens you're already missing half your stock for only one equipment item. So now you're stuck trying to build for pure DPS or pure support for certain classes. There is no effective inbetween for both offensive and defensive builds, they both work against each other and flood your hand with either or, not a mixture of both.Gold/Shop:Making gold is stupidly hard uphill battle of RNG and selling extra equipment for almost nothing to buy new equipment. To be actually able to sell back items you don't use you need to get a renown of 7, probably about 8 or so campaign missions. Their main reason in doing this is to have players build a good amount of equipment before going and blindly selling off equipment they aren't using. Main issue with this is once you get to sell items they aren't worth much of anything unless it's rare or legendary equipment which still sells for a crappy amount of gold. Common equipment is usually worth around one to two gold, where rare and legendary sell for around 50 to 100 gold. Selling one legendary piece of equipment gets you enough gold to buy one mediocre item from the shop. Your main way of making gold is selling common extras of equipment and cheap treasure with your occasional semi-precious treasure.NPCs and RNG are jerks:NPCs won't move unless you do most of time making it hard to determine how to plan for a situation, most times the NPCs seem to be well aware of what you possess in your hand. NPCs seem to just get cards that undermine everything you try to do. They either have so much armor and block you can't do anything or their rolls against you and for themselves feel rigged in their favor most of the time. Most of their saving rolls are 4+ and they seem to get the rolls they need flawlessly at most points in time. My armors and blocks have a saving roll of 2 or better and I still end up failing them 90% of the time.Races:The different races don't work well together at all. Dwarves are all tank but no movement which makes them pair terribly with humans and elves because they just leave them behind in the dust. If you're going to play with a dwarf you might as well make the rest of your party dwarves and play defensivly. The only good time to have one dwarf is as a mage because they don't have to be front line. Humans are a balance of both health and movement making them your go tos for optional play styles and are able to switch between aggressive and passive play styles. Elves are all mobility with no health making them get in and out characters or complete avoidance characters. You're not staying in combat with elves, you're either dashing in to do a little damage then dashing out or attacking from afar. Elves don't pair well with other races because they just leave the other races behind and end up over extending themselves.Little to no hand manipulation:There are barely any card draws and some of them punish you for trying to get new cards that are better for the situation. There is little to no enemy hand manipulation unless you can specificly build for it and land the ability through the NPC's/Player's saving roles. So far the only enemy hand manipulation cards I have seen remove their oldest block or all of them or remove armor cards. Enemy NPC's will most likely do this to themselves before you even know what to use to manipulate their hand.My current stand point with this game is neutral, I love the concept but hate the way the game is going at the moment. I'm left here to hope they change some of these glaring issues before I loose all interest for a game that punishes players for trying to build for multiple utilities. If you want to play it for fun's sake with friends you'll probably enjoy this game for a few sessions. But if you want to seriously play all the way to the end power to you, because this game is brutal with it's RNG and rolls for saves. To be able to continue to play for me there needs to be a serious rebalance with how classes work, how card draw works, and how the rolls/RNG work. "
