												My wife has played through every race/ class combination possible, hence the 1300+ hours on record.  She has replayed the dwarf and human noble origins repeatedely just to know all possible outcomes (her favorite seems to be a dwarf rogue).  She is so good at playing the game she can run through it up to the final battle over a weekend (friday night, saturday, done sunday noon)  i was only able to write this review because she is at work.  ...I miss my wife, can i have her back yet? I guess i should recommend it because she plays it so voraciously?EDIT: 4/8/15: HOLY FRAK PEOPLE! :D  for those of you thave have commented: Yes the wife thinks i am like Alistair sometimesYes i have a beardYes she slays the dragons in the family...so far... but I am slowly catching up. (well she doesn't slay them directly per se, but she sets up the dragon to be slain by some warrior/fighter, typically Aveline, Fenris, or Iron Bull) DA 2 was just as time consuming as DA: O (but with only 700-ish hours gameplay over 2014; less choices with char-gen means less replayability for her, only 6-8 characters made this time instead of 30-40) DA: I ( which i just got for her in Feb. as a late X-mas gift) has totally consumed her time (AGAIN!) but with her new job she has only managed 300 hours (i estimate about 25 of it are my two characters) She is frustrated she cannot romance Varricshe loves Iron Bull  (who the hell doesn't he's got the best lines, along with Sera) i told her no DLC until the main storyline is finished,  she gave me puppy dog eyes, i haven't cracked...yet... I may be a bit biased but yes i do believe she is very awesome and I can geek out with her without her eyes glazing over, alternatively i dont Glaze-out either when she geeks out at me.  ...so, hooray?  for totally life consuming video games...?

												Disclaimer: This is my favorite game of all time, so I apologize for any obsessive fan-girling that may occur within this review.tl;dr Pro's and Con's list at the bottom.Theres so many things I could say about this game, I love it so much.  A majority of my time playing is on console, where I easily have 500+ hours, as well as every achievement in the game as well as additional content.  I'm not much of a reviewer (this being my first lengthy one), so to keep it simple I'll seperate it into sections.Character Creation/Leveling-     There is a fair bit of customization when you create your character.  There are 3 races to choose from (Human, Dwarf, and Elf) which all give different bonus stats.  From there, you will pick your characters class (Warrior, Rogue, or Mage).  All of those classes expand at later levels, with your choice of sub-classes for each (unlocked at levels 7 and 14), which are unlocked by doing different things in the game, or learning them from certain characters.  So no, you aren't born with the ability to magically understand how to be a Bard, or a Templar, you need to actually be taught by someone, or learn the knowledge elsewhere.  Visual choices are alright, standard RPG things like different hair, different eyes, all of which will be covered by a helmet/cowl anyway no doubt.  Either way, you could always grab a mod or two for more character visuals, but I'll try to keep this review on the base game alone.  When you level up there are hefty decisions to be made.  Not only are there abilities for you to use in combat, there are also different abilties for out of combat purposes.  Are you going to put that point into your combat knowledge, unlocking the next tier of weapon abilites?  Or are you going to put it in lockpicking?  The next dungeon might have a door you can't quite pick yet.  Choose carefully...Story-     The best thing about this game is the enthralling story!  From character creation, based on your race, and class even changes how your story begins.  Are you a human noble, living cozy in your castle?  Perhaps a dwarf whose fallen on hard times, and has gone down a life of crime.  Maybe even a mage, stripped from your family and sent off to the Circle of Magi to be watched by the Templars.  In most cases, different events from your ""Origin"" story come back to either aid/hinder you based on how you handled them.  This game is full of heart-wrenching decisions, where you need to decide between being the good guy, or getting something that would be extremely helpful on your quest/not put you in danger.  There's a fair bit of situations where there is no clear-cut decision to be a good guy, someone is getting hurt and it will be your fault, and you can be sure it will change how certain people treat you/your story in general.Characters-     I might have lied about the story being the best part, because the different characters in the game are amazing.  I could go hours talking about the different personalities characters have, but I'll stick just to your party in this, because that's who you'll spend most of the time with obviously.  Your party as it starts getting full, is a ragtag group of different people, with various different outlooks on things. Literally, you might have an apostate witch, a templar, a chantry zealot, and a drunken dwarf all at once.   Each party member has a relationship bar, which goes up or down depending on your decisions and how you talk to them, which in turn effects how they treat you/open up to you.  You could make someone spit in your face and leave the party for good, or even turn and attack you, or they could open up to you about their past giving you a special quest to help them with something personal.  On top of balancing decisons on how it will effect you, and the world around you, you also have to think of how your party members will react to it.  Each character in you party has a lot of diologue opportunities, and if you pay close attention you might be able to find them a gift relevant to something they have said, or perform an action they mentioned.  You can even have relationships with some of the characters, and watch a blooming love grow, as well as listen to the rest of your party snicker and banter about you and soandso last night in a tent together.  If one party member is growing affectionate of you, you can see them get jealous when they discover your relationship with another.You know characters are a big part, when some of the ADD ON CONTENT IS FOR THE CHARACTERS.  Some of the additional content in the game focuses on a certain characters past, and another on his/her events after the story.  Of course based on what you did in the story, it effects it as well.Gameplay-     If you played Dragon Age 2, don't expect this game to be as hack and slash as that one was.  This is by far much more tactical.  One of the coolest features is allowing you to set up your party members tactics in certain situations.  You can set a condition where if 4 enemies are clumped together, your mage shoots a fireball in the center of them, or if your tank gets below 20% health, your Warrior activates an ability to take aggro off of him.  On harder difficulties, you might find yourself hitting the spacebar key pretty quick to pause the game, so you can asses the situation, and assign party members specific orders.Difficulty-     If your new to the game, start on the easiest mode for sure.  This game is brutal on harder difficulties, and while the ability to set your AI party's tactics is beneficial, you will need to be able to know what abilities do what, the different sub-classes to branch down..etc.  Even on easy, you'll find yourself in some situations pausing, and getting some much needed healing done, or think on how to take down a challenging foe.  (Seriously, f*** Revenants).  And remember to be careful when setting your Mage's tactics, there IS FRIENDLY FIRE with mage abilities.  That fireball you just set to go off when the enemies clumped?  You killed them, but your rogue with them.Glitches/Bugs-     There are of course some glitches in the game, scaling from minor textures on occasion, to something that could ruin a combat situation and make you die.  Some of the notable ones include:-Enemies not spawning in missions if you leave a set area/charge their spawn-Your attack speed going back to default if it gets insanely high-Your character not being able to get good placement in combat, making him run in place-A certain party members arm getting stuck in place like she's waiting for a bird to perch on it-Gifts not giving the appropriate amount of points on the relationship barAnd you might find a couple others.  Fortunately, the major ones are fixable by mods that are readily avalible on sites such as Nexus mods.  However as I said before, I'm reviewing this based on the base game.Pros and Cons-Pros:-Amazing story!-Heart-wrenching decisions, some with no clear-cut good or bad answer.-Characters and how they react to what you do!-Your party cast, and the relationship bar!-Manageable AI tactics for your party!-Harder difficulties are brutally challenging.-You can wrangle nugs!Cons:-A few glitches/bugs.  Nothing that ruins your gaming experience for more than a few moments.-The lack of sun you'll be getting isn't good for your complexion.-After playing this Dragon Age 2 is a big let-down. :(My rating of course, is a 10/10!  While there are a few bugs and glitches, they aren't so notable that it ruins your gaming experience more than just a few minute, if that.  The story is just phenominal!  The game is challenging, on the harder difficulties each battle you win feels like an achievement, and you find yourself stocking up and using everything you have on boss battles, most of the time narrowly making it through.  This game is a must play if you haven't already!			"

												Words cannot describe how much I love this game, so allow me to describe it in words. Crafted by the same studio that has made some of my favorite RPGs of all time, Dragon Age answers the question of whether or not Bioware can create a compelling medieval fantasy RPG that isn't D&D based. The answer is a resounding yes. While containing many of the trappings of past RPGs like Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age works its own magic by offering three classes that can be customized by an almost infinite amount, six different origin stories for the player character, and doing away with the traditional good/evil morality mechanic in favor of one based on individual party approval or disapproval of your actions.Each character in your party is believable and compelling, likeable for different reasons, and some can be romanced or change their outlook depending on how the story progresses. Every major questline can have different outcomes depending on player choices and it's this feeling of agency in the world that keeps the replay value in this game. Dragon Age has often been called a dark RPG and rightly so, as the story is much less straight forward than a typical RPG. Often you will find yourself having to deal with choices where there is no clear cut ""good"" or ""evil"" outcome which is part of why player choice feels so meaningful.And on top of all that, the game is a lot of fun. I remember the first time playing this game and saying ""this is the game that Neverwinter Nights 2 should have been!"" It still holds up, probably even more so against its sequel which in some ways is unfortunate. If you love western RPGs and loved the past work of Bioware, you will love this game. I give it two severed darkspawn thumbs way up!			"

												Dragon Age: Origins, debatably the last good game of Bioware's making, is a very intricate and detailed, although at sometimes cliche, foray into an action-adventure medieval setting.Gameplay - Personally, this was my favorite part of the game. I loved the real time with pause system, and always have with other games such as KOTOR. My only complaint is that melee and ranged did not seem to shine as well as the magic system, especially with mana versus stamina. Often, I played as Morrigan instead of the Warden just because it was much more fun. The tactics system is well-done but the AI could use some more work, especially with rogues - even though they were supposed to go behind enemies for backstabs, more often than not, I had to do it myself. I feel as though the wide amount of abilities would easily allow for a just-as-fun second or third playthrough.Story - The overarching storyline of the Blight was predictable, but I feel as though the game shines in the whole adventure there (as you don't ""directly"" deal with the blight until the ending) was much better. The characters involved in the story were well-written and the many dialogue options involved with most major NPCs was refreshing, although expected of Bioware's team. One of my favorite parts of the game related to story was the lore behind the whole games. As a TES fan, especially Morrowind, I really enjoyed the codex and each of its entries. The Fade was a unique concept which, although tedious in-game, was a great concept and a take on the supernatural that I hadn't seen in any game.Characters - I should preface this by saying that my main party consisted of myself, a human noble, Morrigan, Sten, and Shale. I opted for Shale instead of a vanilla character simply because I wanted a tank in my party. I tried to talk to each character a lot individually though, besides the secret companion, who I opted to not join my party. I romanced Zevran and Alistair (in order to take the throne) and felt that the amount of dialogue options and their own quests were really well-done. My advice for the game, if you want to be much more into the story and characters, is to set it to easy/normal and play with whom you like.That about wraps it up. You can easily spend 50 hours in a single play-through if you do more of the quests than I did, such as the rogue mage group, chantry quests, and each of the unique quests that your party members give you (Sten's sword, Flemeth, etc). It's very worth your time.			"

												Dragons Age is well a put together RPG that will immerse you in the story and you will invest time in developing the characters that accompany you on your quest.  The biggest downside to the game is the story is tried, tired and done a thousand times over.  You the hero are on quest to destroy the dark spawn that is wreaking havoc on the land.  This being its biggest downfall does not make this a bad game at all.  I had over 70hours in one play through and with all the decision making you encounter this game will surely keep you amused for multiple plays.  One of the best combat systems I've seen  you can not only setup the AI to have your companions on the quest do what you like but you can fully take control of them which in my opinion is a huge advantage.  The combat system is a little bit of learning curve but once you get the hang of it you will love it and enjoy the simpleness of how your characters act and follow your directions in the heat of some best battles you will see in an RPG.  Bioware did an excellent job in creating a game you can fully plunge yourself into and get behind.			"

Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingOverall Rating: 9/10Gameplay Rating: 9/10Accessibility Rating: 8/10Overall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and accessibility (how the game includes deaf/hoh gamers).Overall GameplayDA:O's game format is very much in line with similar games by Bioware, ranging from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic I/II, Mass Effect, etc.  If you're familiar with those games, you will understand the controls of this game.  If you haven't experienced those games, I would suggest each of them in addition to the Dragon Age line.These tend to be very story-rich games, and DA:O is no exception.  Starting out, you create a character in a very scaled-back Dungeons and Dragons format.  You decide between male/female, elf/human/dwarf, and warrior/mage/rogue.  As you progress, there are further specializations you can pick up, such as a rogue bard or a mage healer.At almost 30 hours of play, I am around 15-20% complete with the main storyline, so there's significant play time for the cost of the game.  Further, replay value comes from different character types, gender, and race, as well as modified slightly by the abilities of your character, such as intimidation or persuasion abilities.I am enjoying this game and will continue to play it beyond one playthrough.General AccessibilityDA:O primarily uses QWES to strafe/move and A/D to turn the camera.  I tend to hold right click to manipulate the camera and just use W to run forward.  The complexity of games like this require more keyboard use than an FPS, so different windows, HUDs, and menus can be accessed by various keys.  All keys can be rebound, making it a little more convenient for mobility-related issues.In line with all games of this type from Bioware, the combat in the game can be paused so that you can issue orders to your party members.  In combat, you can pause as often as you need to, which helps balance the game experience out for all gamers, regardless of needs.Subtitles & CaptionsSpeech is captioned in this game.  Important text is captioned so that you can read it readily and up-front and ambient speech (such as NPCs or banter between supporting characters in your party) shows up over their heads and can be read as you do other things.  Captions do not use color-coding, but conversations happen sequentially rather than simultaneously, and display the character on screen so you know who is talking.One complaint is that these background conversations, captions may be missed entirely, depending on the camera angles.  These are usually interesting or funny conversations that help develop the characters and their relationships, but, more than once, I have only caught the end of them.  Part of the draw of games like this is getting immersed in the environment, but this is hard to do when the mechanics of the game do not permit it.There is nothing in the game that requires being able to hear or hear well that I am aware of.Chatting/CommunicatingDA:O is single-player.No rating.

 “Dragon Age: Origins is simply one of those games you have to play no matter if you like that genre or not.""  TL;DR:  Buy it. Please. Note: This review doesn’t contain any spoiler. I did in fact play the DLC, but this Review only focuses on the main game.  Feel free to add me on Steam, if you have questions about DA:O!    Graphic 7/10 I guess that’s the weakest aspect of DA:O, and it still is better than many games of that genre. Animations are quite okay, nothing fancy here, but the atmosphere of the game is unbelievable. You’ve ever dreamt of a battlefield that actually looks like one? Here you have it. Even though you’ll come along some weird animations, bad textures and some bugs (typically for such huge games), you won’t be disappointed. It’s still beautiful. Sound 10/10 You may can say that it’s not the best looking game, but you can’t argue with me that it doesn’t sound awesome. First things first: Yes, every character is voiced and every actor did a pretty good job. I couldn’t remember any bad one. The background music is excellent. You’ll immediately fall in love with it. I could list 100 things about the sound part, but I guess a 10/10 stands for itself.  Story: 9/10 Story is always a hard one to judge. It’s often personal preference if you like it or not. If you see the deeper meanings or if you actually care about the background of everyone around you. The story is damn well presented and is overall superb. If you break it down it in fact would come down of being just another “We got invaded by some f*cking weird boss monster and you have to save the world bla bla” and even if it may look like it is just that, it really is more. Just explore it on your own and you’ll see how good it actually is, if you just spend enough time.  Gameplay: 10/10 Let me give you a little bit of a backstory here for all of you undecided ones: I NEVER played a round-based game before DA:O and I had my reasons for it. I always thought it’s boring, repetitive and focuses too much on that strategy part instead of action. Oh boy was I proved wrong. It was so easy to get into that game but you had so many features to find your style of playing. I don’t even know what I should tell you first about. You can create your own little party by choosing which companions will accompany you throughout the game. You’ll meet most of them during the game and you can interact with them to the fullest. And I mean to the fullest. (You can date almost all of them.) In conversations you can choose which answer is the most suitable. But be careful: You can even loose the chance to recruit a companion if you chose to just not let him / her come with you, kill him / her or you just forgot to complete that one quest. If you ever wanted to try out a Game like this, do it. It’s the best by far. Difficulty: 4 up to 9 As I said before: It introduces you quite well and I as a beginner never felt overwhelmed. There are many difficulty levels to choose and the hardest one is just pure pain. And that’s the way it should be. For my first playthrough I chose “Easy” and there were still some hard fights that require you to pause (By pressing spacebar) and think through your strategy. It’s for everyone.  I really recommend reading some class guides (There are a lot on youtube if you’re too lazy to read like me)!!  Only the DLC gives you the option to reskill. Or you have to download the mod. Notable: - I won’t say that there aren’t some bugs. You can’t expect a game this big without some minor bugs. But there wasn’t a single game braking one.- Good for newcomers to the genre- Runs smoothly - Complete Edition costs less than 10 bucks on Sale.- I completed it in around 70 hours. (And another 20 spent on the DLCs). You WILL spent a lot of time in this-  One of THE best games I’ve ever played so far  Conclusion: I BEG you to at least try it out. I didn’t like those games too, but DA:O changed my mind and became my favorite game. You won’t regret it! Thanks for reading, if there are any questions leave a comment below. Feel free to add me if you want to chat about the game, my other reviews or just for fun. Have a great Day!  "

												Great story, great graphics, and a great game. Dragon Age is a phenomenal RPG that offers an extensive and vast story that really sinks you into it. The expansion packs only add to this. Non-linear and full of side quest to keep you busy when you decided to take a break from the main quest. It's a beautiful game with lush environments as well as great voice acting. The combat is smooth and the ability to pause and coordinate your attacks is brilliant. I had a wonderful time with this game and I have gotten a lot of replay ability with it. One of the best RPG games I've played.			"

												Excellent game with high replayability. One of my all time favorites. Still, I'll be honest and list the flaws. First, the level editor is nowhere near as intuitive as Neverwinter Nights, but given that these days a prepackaged editor is rare enough as is, I suppose I shouldn't complain. Awakenings is buggy as hell and Witch Hunt is far too short, although I rather liked Ariane and Finn as companions. The ""hard choice"" at the end of Origins feels contrived to me, although I can't really get into why without spoilers. For what it's worth, I highly recommend the Dragon Age Redesigned and Improved Atmosphere mods. Also, there is a mod avaliable to skip the Fade. You'll probably want to install that after the first playthrough. Still an excellent game, and you should buy it before Dragon Age Inquisition comes out. From what I've heard, you'll also probably want to skip DA2.			"

												The Dragon Age-franchise and The Elder Scrolls-franchise are the main reasons I love gaming. They are works of art.1st playthrough (incl. DLC's): 100 hours!To me this Dragon Age game is one of the best RPG's of all time, because: - of the wonderful story- of the excellent music- of the loot- of the great choices you are able to make in conversations- of the tactical combat choices you have to make- you can have relationships with your companions... ;) Not at the same time tho, because they get jealous ;)- I'm a completionist- I love a well-thought-out game and the choices you make really matter- I love a game that is thorough-going- of the magnificent voice-actingRecognize yourself in this list? BUY AND PLAY THIS GAME :)			"

 “Join us, brothers and sisters. Join us in the shadows, where we stand vigilant!”Dragon Age: Origins is an excellent role-playing game with a truly epic campaign and great tactical gameplay. It offers a rich and vivid world, loads of mature themes and memorable characters. The storytelling and dialogues are witty and engaging, the music is inspiring and you will be deeply involved in the compelling gameplay. The different decisions and conversation options in combination with your individual character background allow you to proceed through the game in several ways resulting in a high replayability. Amusing quotes:  “We now have a dog and Alistair is still the dumbest one in the party.”  “Let's show them our hearts, and then show them theirs.” Trivia:Dragon Age: Origins is often considered the spiritual successor to the Baldur's Gate series of games, which took place in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting of the Dungeons & Dragons franchise.Achievements:The game has no Steam achievements.

												After owning this and playing the hell out of it on the PS3 I decided it was finally time to see how well the PC version was made and get a couple DLCs I hadn't played. Right off the bat I noticed a massive difference from my console version in the load times. The PC version is a blink of an eye compared to my PS3 sounding like it was ready to take flight playing this with load times becoming increasingly annoying as you play through it. The graphics and performance overall are far superior as well and the mouse/keyboard controls are nice. It does take a little bit of getting used to rotating the look with either the keyboard, or the mouse (you have to hold down the right button to look around), but you get used to it fast enough. Not to mention the ability to quicksave and not wait 5 seconds like on consoles.As for the game itself, this is one of my all-time favorite RPGs. Mostly because I love the adult and mature content that it provides with the characters. No I'm not talkinng about sex, although you can hook up with other characters in your party and even have some grand old same sex encounters. The dialogue and writing in this game feels very realistic and not childish like most RPGs you will play. A lot of good dark humor as well as some smart interactions with the characters. This is what I love most about this series and what I loave about Bioware games in general like Mass Effect.It is fun to mix and match your party as you walk around exploring as they all talk to each other while you walk and have different things to say based on who is in the group. I would highly recommend this game to ALL RPG fans and would suggest buying the Ultimate Edition so that you can get all the DLC on Steam without the hassle of having to go through the Bioware website and getting shafted. The DLC is worth the few extra bucks for a completely new character (got this as a pre-order on PS3 I believe) that adds a lot of humor and their own character quests to the game. The story is farily well done and has a lot of character quests like most Bioware games that addsdepth to your party. The DLCs expand on some of them and add even more story. Plus you get new items, skills, and characters that can be used in the main campaign. The PC version also offers a decent modding community which can add a lot to the game, or take away some of the tedious things you dislike. This game for me is an easy 9.5/10.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Dragon Age: Origins Original Release: 2010 Genre Tags: RPG; Strategy; Fantasy; Story-Rich; Epic My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 60-150 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Epic RPG enthusiasts REVIEWDragon Age: Origins is an immersive action/strategy RPG with a deep, intricate story and the potential for hundreds of gameplay hours.  If you like plunging yourself into truly epic RPGs which can keep you glued to your computer for days on end, this is one of the best games to play. Right from the start, the massiveness of the game assaults you. Making your standard start-of-an-RPG choices of character race and class will determine which of six origin stories you will play through to open the game.  Each of these stories can take several hours to beat.  And if you are like me, you will need to play them all before deciding which character you will anoint the chosen one which you will play as for the entirety of the campaign.  Who you choose will also affect certain conversations and quests in the main part of the game.Continuing with the theme of massiveness, the narrative and lore elements are truly epic and expansive. The main narrative is well written with great pacing, telling an interesting tale rooted in classic fantasy themes. The characters are diverse and interesting, and each one is given an actual presence in the world. And if you enjoy immersing yourself in the nuances of fantasy gameworlds, you will be pleased to know there is a plethora of lore and backstory. There is so much to learn about.As for the gameworld: it is atmospheric and mystical. There is no gigantic overworld to freely traverse, however. But the locations that do exist are very well designed and are expressive of the setting. And the graphics succeed in painting the picture that is intended, even if they may fall behind the curve as this game begins to age.The gameplay mechanics and the battle system are intricate and elaborate. On the higher difficulties, deep knowledge of interactive effects is necessary for tough battles. Luckily on the lower difficulties, you can get away with only a rudimentary understanding. But as you unlock new abilities and new characters who offer new playable classes, experimenting with different party combinations can help spice up the combat. For any game that lasts over 100 hours, that can be a welcome feature.One of the headlining concepts at the heart of Dragon Age: Origins is the decision system. I alluded to this earlier when I mentioned the diverse origin stories. There are a multitude of decisions to be made throughout the game, most of which have some sort of impact on the gameworld— be it large or small. And to make it better, most of the decisions have no clear “right or wrong,” so you’ll really have to make choices (and not just choose what you know the game wants you to).It is beginning to age, but true quality cannot easily be eroded by the sands of time. If you are a fan of truly epic RPGs, this one is a must-play for you. My only warning is that it is quite verbose and grand in scale, so if you are someone who easily loses interest then you may struggle with the sheer magnitude of the game.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Dragon Age origins was No 1 and the best .... an absolutely brilliant game! Six character backgrounds to choose to start with and all could be played through for the whole game. Several vastly different endings depending on choices made through the game. Fantastic and witty dialogue with all your companions that you were able to take with you on your adventure. Interactions between the companions that you had with you at random event places. Love scenes with characters that you had started to have a relationship with .... which needed to be be done slowly and well over a long time being aware of three way jealousies and confrontations with other companions.... Brilliantly worked out! Massive Boss battles ... an AI system where you could set up how your companions would automatically react when certain conditions are met. Tough battles that you needed to be strategic about to survive... with a combination of four possible followers fighting with you and needing all the skills of magic, rogue and fighter to make it past all areas.DA Origins had an expansion called Awakening to which you could take a save file from Origins to take you into it ... and you needed to as the enemies in Awakening were at that level and a new game started at awakening started with the same gear you would have had in Origins. So anyone wanting to battle level 30 enemies with a rusty dagger and a robe.... good luck. The Awakening was a good addition a couple of your companions made the trip and could join you if you did all the right things. Certainly it is a smaller game than origins and a different one. But a worthy addition using the same game structure and similar dialogue ... although not as good as origins.The Dragon Age 2 game actually doesn't really have anything to do with the first. Some of the lore is the same ... and from some of the decisions you made in DA O will be represented in some vague background stories. The dialogue was tweaked further but is became convoluted  ... but none of the characters really felt like someone I could relate to. DA 2 had three chapters I completed the first and after 5 -6 tries eventually defeated the massive boss battle in the deep roads against the ARW (Ancient Rock Wraith) This battle was immense! For that the resulting Treasure was a major Disappointment!!!! I had played as a mage up to that point and the robe in the treasure wasn't much different than anything previously. The only character who had decent armor was the dwarf (narrator of the game when cut scenes happened)  who's Armor leveled as he did ... so you would think this dwarf was the protagonist. Then you supposedly won a massive income from your trip into the deep roads such that you bought a house for your self and your companions ... (that I didn't care about) but had no money left, to even buy potions. The only part of DA 2  that I did like was the combat! How they had you fight numerous enemies and the way spells and melee attacks worked was great. But hopeless story and characters that I couldn't care about .... and nothing to do with DA Origins at all very disappointing.			"

												This is it, right here. This is the RPG to define all other RPGs. Dragon Age: Origins, is personally my favorite RPG of all time. Between the huge amount of hours that I have logged on Steam and the countless hours played on PS3, I have experienced pretty much all you can experience within the game. I guess you could say I'm kind of a big deal. Dragon Age: Origins is one of the best written RPGs ever made, showcasing BioWare at its finest. With a deep and intricate story, varied and memorable characters, and deep gameplay using the d20 system. If you like fantasy at all, then you will enjoy what this game has to offer.			"

I was one of the Crows you hired to kill the Grey Wardens.Loghain: I thought you looked familiar.Zevran: Well, I just wanted to report that I failed my mission, Loghain.Loghain: You don't say.Zevran: I'm terribly broken up over it.Loghain: Hmm.

												I heard about this game a lot, having seen it on several ""Top RPG's of All Time"" lists and knowing it to be a personal favourite of many people. Suffice it to say, I was pretty excited to give it a run. I went from being  sorely dissapointed  to  becoming a big fan , so I thought it would be helpful to share my experience.  Note: I haven't finished the game or all of the DLC's yet, so this is a tentative review.  Early impressions Graphics sucked (even with beautification mods), combat was okay but certainly not ""tactical"", what the hell is this?I kept coming back to the game because, a) I heard so much about it, and b)  every quest has a really well developed narrative to it . Even in what would typically be fetch quests I was invested in participating because I knew the back-story (i.e. You meet a kid who's mother died, and find a quest on the notice board to locate her remains and bring back her amulet, presumably for the kid). It could have been ""kill three sewer rats and report to the tavern"", but it wasn't and that was amazing.Also, right off the start, you're thrown into a pretty epic story. Mid-game impressions After 20 hours in-game, your combat abilities are more fleshed out. Combat begins to feel  a lot  more tactical, because you have several variations in taking on enemies, and you need to use several abilities to win against increasingly difficult foes.Several quests really stand out relative to other RPG's, for instance when I -  begin spoiler -sacrificed an heir-to-the-throne kid's mother so that I could travel to a soul-realm, to battle a demon that was possessing him - making the kid murder people and summon monsters to kill townsfolk - using an outlawed form of magic through a guy I just busted out of a dungeon (because he MAY or MAY NOT have attempted to kill the kids dad/lord), - end spoiler - I was like, damn that was amazing.Little things in this world really come to the fore when you invest the time into it. Certain weapons have entire histories associated with them; codex entries come together to paint a really worth-while narrative picture. Also, you meet a pretty sizable list of interesting characters along your journey. Late-game impressions Not there yet, but I'm sure I will be. TL;DR This is an excellent RPG. Pros+ Awesome writing, even for simple quests+ Interesting history to discover+ Epic story+ Interesting characters throughout+ Decent mod support (but they do not help the dated graphics issue that much)Cons- Graphics are poor, but are sometimes really well done (inconsistent graphic quality?)- Takes a long time before combat is tactically engaging			"

												This game right here is a prime example of what Bioware does right. The story is rich and even is presented to you differently throughout the game depending on your ""Origin Story"" and choices you've made in the game. The character's all have interesting back-stories and will behave in meaningful ways, depending on your relationship with the character. Even the most boring character for me, Sten, was still interesting enough that talking to him about his past and race's history didn't feel like a chore. Combat is simple enough, and while it doesn't have the same level of involvement or 'Flare' as some other games, it's strategic and satisfying. Graphics are pretty good, and with mods and a decent computer, you can really improve the atmosphere of the game.The amount of content is impressive, even by RPG standards. I got roughly 60-some hours on one play-through, and I didn't even bother to complete all the quests. While on that topic, side-quests in this game are well-done as well. Each side-quest usually has some kind of back story, and more often than not, rewards you with some kind of armor or weapon that you couldn't find in the vendor stores. One of my favorite side-quests (and I'll try not to spoil it) is when you battle several different Revents, or Corrupted Warrior Spirits, toretrieve this bass-♥♥♥ armor set called the Juggernuat. The rewards and backstory of the quests made it feel like it somehow tied into the actual story, making it much less painful for those 100% completionists.Dragon Age Origins is one of Bioware's best works (my personal favorite), and makes me wish Mass Effect took more from Dragon Age in terms of storytelling and interesting quests. If you're a Bioware fan, RPG fan, or even just looking for a good game to get immersed in, look no further... Dragon Age is worth wasting hours of your life away.  "

												Dragon Age: Origins is old-school. Before achievements and trophies, a role-player's greatest achievement was working the system to build the most broken, overpowered character possible within the constraints of whatever edition of Dungeons & Dragons the game was based on. Origins is a solitary experience; you'll isolate yourself from the outside world, staying up nights and well into the morning because when this game grabs you, it simply won't let go.This is a game that's been in development for what seems like forever, and it shows. BioWare's own Mass Effect was far more visually impressive, particularly in the dialogue sequences, where Dragon Age's facial animations and character models can seem stiff and wooden. Then there's the odd decision to go so over-the-top with the blood. Blood plays an important role in the world's unique fiction, but watching your characters relay meaningful lines of speech while splashed with more blood than the prom scene in ""Carrie"" borders on the ridiculous, robbing such scenes of any potential sense of gravitas.That isn't to say that this is an ugly game, by any means. Dragon Age: Origins' landscapes and dungeon interiors are rife with detail and a joy to explore. Combat animations in particular are impressive, as your characters will set themselves before enemies and go through complex motions, with rogues jockeying for position to backstab and warriors forcefully slamming their shields into faces. Colorful kill animations result in dismemberments and decapitations, rewarding you for critical strikes in a far more memorable manner than just a bigger damage number. Then there's the sheer scale of this undertaking. You can easily log a hundred hours exploring every inch of this world, with plenty of incentive to come back again to approach the tale of the Grey Warden from a new perspective and origin story.Your character's origin story, the first steps in your adventure, plays a significant role in how this tale plays out. The tropes of fantasy fiction lie intact, with Dwarves dwelling underground and elves living in the world's forests on the outskirts of human civilization, but these societies are still fleshed-out and made unique. Dwarves have a complex caste system, with the nobility focusing on political advancement while the casteless underclass live in ghettos, struggling to eke out a living as part of the criminal underbelly. Elves who live in human cities reside in closed-off alienages, destined for a life of servitude to the human nobility. Magi live secluded lives of research and study in their towers under the constant watch of the order of Templars, a religious sect tasked with ensuring that magic does not lead to demonic infestation.While your own story is important, the companions that join you play an equally important role. The Grey Warden Alistair, the witch of the wilds Morrigan, and the mysterious minstrel Leliana are your primary romantic options and the game's main supporting characters, though other characters like Sten, the taciturn warrior, are nearly as interesting. Even the dog companion is a full-fledged ally worthy of bringing along, complete with his own inventory and unique abilities. The quality of the voice work ensures that you'll rarely skip through the frequent conversations and inter-party banter. You'll spend lots of time wading through interminably long conversations while getting to know the members of your party, in an effort to improve their approval ratings. Fans of Dungeons & Dragons-styled role-playing adventures may be annoyed that there are only three core character classes and three race options, but there's remarkable depth to the character development system. Each class has a variety of talent options, and four specializations to choose from: Warriors can go weapon and shield or two-handed, Rogues can become archers or dual-wield, and Mages can master a wide variety of spell options. Dragon Age: Origins also provides countless opportunities for challenging, riveting combat sequences where strategy and tactics win out. Again, it's the decisions that make Dragon Age: Origins such a thought-provoking experience. I've played through the game twice now and I still have trouble choosing which companions to take with me on any given adventure. The story has a way of dropping situations in your lap where any of a handful of different options seem viable, with no clear-cut option standing out as the right one. This is due in part to Dragon Age: Origins' lack of a clearly defined moral alignment structure. Characters are generally complex, defying the unrealistically simplistic labels of ""good"" and ""evil,"" and the game is the better for it.There is so much more to Dragon Age: Origins I just don't have room to explain here. Simply know that there are tons of weapons and loot to find, craft, and coat with poison, thousands of quests to take on, storekeepers to intimidate, and NPCs to persuade. If you're a Western-style, fantasy RPG nut, or if you love a great tactical challenge, you simply can't go wrong with Dragon Age: Origins. BioWare has outdone itself once again.			"

												From the brains of the guys and gals behind Baldur's Gate, Jade Empire, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect emerges this game - Dragon Age: Origins. BioWare certainly knows how to pull off a good RPG, they are clearly not afraid to implement whatever they please to make it a superb experience. Dragon Age: Origins is no different. The game is set in the fantasy world known as Ferelden. A land that for long has been safe from war and suffering and looks like your typical fantasy land with elves, dwarves, wizards, maidens and of course - Dragons.The peace is not to last though, peace is a pretty bad setting to make a game in to be honest. A dark force gathers in the outskirts of the Kingdom and soon the faith of humanity (or what species have you) solely rests on your shoulders. In other words - like every single damn fantasy RPG out there. But hold your unicorns, that does not mean the game is bad does it? No! Making a game in the stereotypical RPG/Fantasy is never a bad thing. As long as it's up to standard with implemented unique features that successfully intertwine with a very good story.BioWare themselves described the game as the spritual successor to Baldur's Gate, at least in the sense of the atmosphere and game setting. I have not played Baldur's Gate, so I can not answer to this. I can however say that the game reminds A lot of Mass Effect and Star Wars: KoTOR, combine that with the general fantasy setting (like Skyrim), some intriguing story and this game is set to blow your brains out. My experience with this game has sadly been... shattered, though. I have throughout the years seriously tried to set my mind on RPG-mode, and just sink myself into this adventure. But I have only finished the game once, and have probably played the start 10 times. I am attracted by the setting and gameplay, but I always seem to end up forcing myself through the game, because I feel that the game MUST be good. Unlike with Mass Effect or any of the Elder Scrolls games for example, I pretty much ended up disliking the game because of my issue. I had the same problem with Bioshock, but this is just me, so it does not make the game any less good. You just have to crave for some RPG goodness, and not rush through it.Just like most BioWare games, you are but one character in a squad/company, and most of the gameplay are dependent on this as a strategic mechanic. It is possible to just ignore the other characters in your company, but this would require your main character to completely carry every fight, which is not optimal. Again, as with all Fantasy RPGs, you get to pick a class; Warrior, Mage or Rogue and build your character from scratch. In Dragon Age you also get to pick race and background, giving even more options as well as unlocking different storylines. This is to make every playthrough a unique experience compared to the previous. Overall BioWare are known as masters at extensive and complex dialogues for their games, often to make you choose a dark or bright path and reflect your options into the upcoming events.What I however Did enjoy about the game was the enormous background history to build the series on, the grim setting, the interactions between the main character and NPC characters, some adult scenery and romance interactions, the depiction of cracks in a fictional society that may or may not be referring to real life scenarios. As the majority of this game attract me I feel that it deserves a positive rating, even though I will probably not play it again due to lack of patience and time.If you love BioWare's games, Fantasy RPG's and are ready to sacrifice dozens of hours for a grand adventure, then this game is likely to entertain.

												This game is like crack minus the tooth rot and risk of imprisonment!  The combat difficulty will leave some hardcore RPG'ers wanting, but this game does allow you to pause during battles so that you can think and strategize and I really enjoy having this ability.  The story behind this game is what really sells it.  The loot, so far, is kind of blah, but I am sure that will improve the further I get into it.  Game runs great on Win 7 64 Bit and I am very pleased with the interface.  I believe I picked this game up during a sale for about $5.00.  Ever tried to get some crack with $5?			"

There are about a dozen gender/race/class/background choices and a great many combinations in forming your party. The armor and the weapons are exceptionally made and everything shows on your characters. And the graphics are truly beautiful!

Sten (a game companion) steals cookies from children ""for their own good""Hailed by many as the best Dragon Age title ever made, this bad boy is the spiritual successor of none other than Baldur's Gate, therefore fans of the aforementioned series will enjoy this game a little bit more than usual.DA's plot is extremely rich with details that unfold slowly after hours and hours of exploration and gameplay. Wishing to keep this review spoiler-free, I will not reveal too much about it, except the general concept which you can still avoid it, if you want. The general backstory is about a race of tainted creatures, the Darkspawn, that occasionally awaken one of the dragon gods and corrupt him to their benefit. Then they proceed to invade the land, Ferelden, in an event known as the Blight. You have to stop them. The country of Ferelden has huge amounts of backstory elements about religion, wars, kings, races and more. You will not be bored finding out every bit and piece of information you come across. Despite its vastness however, plot tends to become repetitive at times. Even though every region and city has unique events and quests for you to fulfill, they tend to circle around the same principles: murder, assassination, betrayal. The results of your actions may indeed vary and have different consequences in the world, not every city should need a hero to rally everyone behind him and settle their differences like cities full of children.Your character's race and class will also allow you to choose one of the several starting stories you have. You can start as a noble, a common citizen, a member of the mage's circle or a member of a nomadic tribe. This creates a link between the player and your character, giving you a motive to drive the story forward. You might return to the lands you hailed from and everyone will remember you, or, depending on your standings, people you meet will react to you differently, either by addressing you ""my lord"" or with total racism. Your party members can be recruited from around the world (Le Daft Punk reference) and they can be kicked out anytime you want. They will also present you with side quests that involve them, like finding Sten's lost sword or helping the difficult relationship between Morrigan and her mother. Their skills can be customised and you can even select a second class for them if you want. Choosing the right members and getting to know them is key, since they have different personalities, backstories and opinions. That means your actions, like destroying a demon or making a pact with him, has corresponding results to the way your companions view you. If you do many things they consider them preposterous, they might even turn on you and try to murder you. This gameplay element is simply exquisite and so well made, I don't recall encountering anything similar, ever.Combat has several approaches you can take: you can fight in real time, by pausing and issuing orders or assign tactics that will determine the battle style of your companions. A combination of those means your party will be able to crush with ease the small groups of enemies you will encounter, forcing RPG veterans to buff the difficulty to Hard or Nightmare level. Micromanagement is key during battles, which adds to the tactical feel of the game. It tends to become repetitive quickly, however, especially since there's a limited number of tactics slots. Not only that, but sometimes, your companions tend to ignore their tactics or the commands you give them, resorting instead to use basic attacks instead of abilities and skills. Plus, their somewhat slow-minded AI makes them step on traps they could clearly see and disarm or avoid. Sooner or later, you will want direct control of everyone, after realising your mates can't do anything properly on their own.In the end, you can't help but enjoy this game, regardless of its flaws. You will have a good laugh as your companions jest and annoy each other, revealing this game's deep and complex character development and relationships, all set in a fractured world where civil war and mass extinction are threatening everyone.And remember to keep Sten away from cookies, and Morrigan with Alistair apart. Or not. Your choice.RATING:Gameplay: 8/10Presentation: 9/10Story: 9/10Unique Factor: Character Development: 9.5/10OVERALL: 8.8/10 "

												WARNING VERY LONGI suppose I should write a review, since Inquisition's story has finally ended, now begins my watch, for the next Dragon Age game.INTRODUCTIONDragon Age Origins was first released by in 2009 and was met with great acclaim, for its fantastic world design, setting, story, basically it was one the best RPG games of the decade, i say ""one of"" and not ""the"" mind you. Being released between both fallout 3 and new vegas, Dragon age had some considerable competition. Luckily it hold its own and more, with great storytelling, characters and some great gameplay.It definitely was not the prettiest game at the time, I mean the character looks can be anywhere from pretty and handsome in rare cases almost exclusive to companions, to plain old ugly appearances. There isn't much variety in customization, armours are simple recolours for the most part, weapons and bows too. Honestly the looks are definitely one of the worst parts of the game, just too little uniqueness in armour and weapons to make you and you party stand out from any other ordinary grunt, unless of course you enjoy that sort of thing.STORYI’ll try not to spoil too much, as many choices affect not situations and the ending in this game but also in the sequels too.You will have an origin story, by choosing your race and birthplace, either being, human, elf or dwarf, and being birthed in the slums, nobility or mage. Oh and the singled out dalish elf. Each of these will affect some dialogue options and give racial traits, it can also make some things easier or harder depending on the quest at hand. With these picked you will take part in a battle as a soldier in the Grey Wardens, an ancient order of protectors whose sole purpose is to defend life against the darkspawn and blights.After the being defeated at the battle you find out you're one of the last surviving members of the order, and is up to you to gather allies for a new army for one last battle, or the spawn will overtake all of thedas. Thus begins the main quest, along the way you will help out random strangers, groups of mages and mercs, decide the fate of magical order and dalish clan, find a lost piece of ancient dwarven history and find the remains of the bride to the Maker, the creator of life in the known world.So this is a huge story with many quests and side jobs, they can be incredibly drawn out each main segments easily takes out a hour or more depending on difficulty. But you use this time to stockpile potions and arrows, find the best weapons and armour for each of your 9 companions, all find additional support for your army. All of it eventually paying off in the epic finale at the end of the game were it all comes into play. This is one of the main reasons why this game is so great still stands today, as a great piece of storytelling.GAMEPLAYThe game play likes a old fashioned RPG, where you will control a party of characters assign specialties and classed, equip them as well. So it mostly strategy based combat, assigning orders, positioning, setting priorities and tactics and more. Alongside this combat is alose magic and consumables which also affect your allies if they are caught in in it area of effect making for carefully planned attacks. Through your character's skills, you can buff and debuff units, effectively controlling the battlefield. It is very difficulty explaining it completely, but such examples can very easily be found online, or if you have played it's much like Baldur's Gate.DIFFICULTYThis is another main great point of the game, it is naturally hard, even on the easiest difficulty. The game will often throw a number of enemies at you either being a small horde of easily dispatchable grunts, to a mini boss or two, as well as mix of troops. Magic is also your worst enemy as if left unchecked a mage will destroy your team single handley.As for the difficulty settings, it changes it artificially, increasing unit health, damage and defence, as well affecting certain other stats.  But despite all of this, even on easy there is plenty of leeway in how you can build your characters, but as you go up you will have to plan your builds accordingly or suffer a painful, live die and repeat scenarios.COMPANIONSI feel like I should bring these in as if you get into the game, you become invested in their story, to the point like many other people, you consider them Friends/Family for you Warden. Here's two examples of my favourite ones. Leliana, she's an assassin  Bard turned religious sister. She's confident but sweet, very calm and has an interesting backstory and quest to boot as well has her own origin DLC story, where you can gain a an amazing set of armour for you or her.My second is a dwarf warrior exilce called ohgren, hes allways drunk and allways randy, constantly trying to get it on with your female compainons or you, and trys and excuse to talk about the dirty stuff.There 8 of them in total, 3 Warriors, 2 rogues and 2 mages and a dog, there is also a unique dlc companion who is a stone golem, and is very interesting one at that. Also depending on your game choices you can get another warrior to join your party at the expense of another.  These characters are lovable and hateable in their own ways, each can be customized and leveled individually, each have their own speciality for combat. Through combat they can sustain injuries and if not treated or treated, will lead to their eventual death. Doing they don't like too much, or do something that goes completely against them, will make either leave or attack you.They all have extensive dialogue and backstory each will have their own personal quests that will give them bonuses or special weapons and/or armour. If you take an interest in them and start improving their approval of you, they will get bonus their base skills like constitution furthering a specialty.CONCLUSION Okay the graphics aren't great, the environments are vast and empty ,customization is limited, overall game is difficult and has many unpatched bug that can break quests. But this is a tiny proportion to what you’re getting, a huge world of fantasy, filled with a few hours worth history reading, rememberable characters, epic story and potentially almost a hundred hours worth of fun. There are many little thing I haven't mentioned yet, like how there is a modding community, DLC’s offer post game content, that will give rewards for your next playthrough, how actions caused here will affect many details of the next game, and the actions of the sequel will affect the sequel-sequel.This is definitely worth a look at the very least, or even just a read of the timeline or sotries embedded within the game.

												Compelling, epic story. Great graphics (starting to look dated in '14 but still beautiful). Rich characters. Masterfully crafted ending. Solid gameplay. This game's got it all, and I insist that you give it a chance if you haven't already. I've beaten this game more times than I care to admit on Origin and bought it here on steam just so I could uninstall Origin.The only downside to this game, and yes there is one - is that once you finish it, you'll be left excited and drooling for its sequel... but we all know how that turned out. You'll be left with a craving which you will never be able to fill.			"

												After nearly 600 hours of this game, I can say that Dragon Age: Origins is one of the best games I've ever played. It may not be as flashy or next-gen as the third installment of the series, but it doesn't matter! Great, simple story, well-witten characters and quests, and everything feels to be in its own place. Also this is one of the most difficult games I've played.Oh so many times the game has made me rage-quit. In the character creation.Thank you, Bioware.			"

												Dragon Age: Origins is a fantasy R.P.G. developed by Bioware and published by Electronic Arts. You are a Grey Warden, one of the last of this legendary order of guardians. With the return of mankind's ancient foe and the kingdom engulfed in civil war, you have been chosen by fate to unite the shattered lands and slay the archdemon once and for all. Explore a stunning world, make complex moral choices and engage in bone-crushing combat against massive and terrifying creatures. This title is yet another masterpiece from the fine people at Bioware. If you love roleplaying, fantasy or story-driven plot thick games then you will simply adore this title. From the beginning of Dragon Age: Origins to the very end, the adventure that your Grey Warden embarks upon will keep you enthralled as you follow the path of destiny in this wonderfully crafted land of R.P.G. goodness. The story, characters and lore all come together here in perfect increments to create a truly fantastic gaming experience that no fan of this genre should pass up.Besides the epic story, Origins gameplay/combat is the next big feather in this titles award winning hat. You have the option to engage in combat in either a third person view or the more popular and fun overhead tactical view which, in my opinion, is the best way to truly enjoy the game. One can choose to set parameters for battling and let the A.I. handle combat as you watch from the sidelines or you can opt to have complete control over the action and dictate every move that your party makes as well as what weapon, spell or potion that they use. The game implements a combat pause system that allows you to immediately stop the action and examine the battlefield to determine what commands to issue to your party members. Dragon Age: Origins definitely has some of the best tactical combat that you can find and it is just such a joy to play. I can still remember having my warrior unleash ""Warcry"" at the beginning of a battle quickly sending out a wave of force and knocking every enemy around me onto their collective bottoms pardon my french....ah good times. The best roleplaying games always give you many ways to customize your characters and Origins does a fantastic job of handling this requisite as well. Besides having the option to choose your race, gender and other physical features, there are also a variety of character classes to pick from and each of those can branch off into different subclasses or specializations futher improving the character customization. Also as in any typical R.P.G., as one gains experience points and level up you will be able to spend them on a number of abilities to enhance your parties combat prowess as well as their interactions with N.P.C.'s during dialogue as the story progresses.Graphically, I really like the look of Dragon Age: Origins. In my opinion, it does an absolutely wonderful job of truly capturing the ""Sword and Sorcery"" theme. Elves, dragons, magic, a love story, epic battles...this title manages to hit every bulletpoint that a great fantasy game requires. As the story unfolds, your party will trudge through murky swamps, dense forests, immense dungeons, towering cityscapes and beyond during your questing. The many locations that you visit are also quite diversified and have a unique look of their own from the dwarven thaig of Orzammar to the majestic towers of Denerim. The character models used in the cutscenes, be they human or non-human still look great to this day although some of the animations can seem a bit stiff at times. The sound quality is also exceptional and the game features a very memorable soundtrack as well.This title and it's expansion packs are well worth the money spent as it definitely is not a game that you are going to pick up and finish in just 10 hours...be prepared to spend many days or weeks in Ferelden depending on your particular style of play. The excellent main storyline will keep you intrigued from start to finish as you also find time to take on a number of nicely written sidequests and other various objectives. There is also an abundance of lore in Dragon Age: Origins in the form of books, scrolls and stories that you will hear from N.P.C.'s so if you're the type of gamer who enjoys this then be ready to spend plenty of time just reading as you game. Also, once you've finally finished the title for the first time I recommend that you start your second playthrough with some excellent modifications from the Nexus. Once again the wonderful modding community continues to prolong the replayability of yet another classic title...hooray! To summarize, I can honestly say without hesitation that Dragon Age: Origins is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for roleplaying gamers and players who just love a strong narrative in their titles. Your R.P.G. library is vastly incomplete without this spectacular addition from Bioware.			"

												It's a good RPG with a very rich story and some interesting locations, but there's also a good amount of things that aren't that great.The presentation is flawless. The locations have a nice amount of detail and all feel unique. The music is great and the voice acting ranges from solid to excellent.The story will drag you in and give you many choices. There is a lot of flavour text to read and you can easily spend a couple of hours just wading through optional dialogue. There are also weaker quests and predictable subplots, but overall the story is good.Now to the not so good things: The combat system isn't bad, but you'll struggle with it quite often due to it being kind of delayed. Which in harder fights were every second counts can be very annoying. The game isn't overly hard, but there are fights that will really drain your patience because they aren't exactly well balanced.Next problem is the design of especially the later dungeons in the game. They are just stretched out way too much and filled with pointless time and resource consuming fights. In combination with the subpar combat system it's tedious to push through them.Lastly I have to say that the setting couldn't be more generic. There's nothing in this game that you haven't seen before (maybe except for some demons), but overall it feels like the team had a lot of ideas about the story, but none about the background. This is just a minor complaint though.I recommend the game, but mainly if you enjoy the story in a game more than actual gameplay.Edit: I just finished the expansion (The Awakening) and found it important to add a few lines about it as well. One complain about the main game was that it wasn't original enough in terms of setting and I have to say that this expansion really does a good job at correcting that mistake. It's nowhere as obvious what's going on as in the main game and there are unique non-human villains this time. Also due to the shorter nature of the expansion the dungeons don't drag as much as in the main game. I really enjoyed the expansion and would even go as far as saying that it's slightly better than the main game. This is more about the overall gameplay and not about the story. If you want to play the game you should really get the ultimate edition to get the full experience.			"

												It happens that after a few hours of navigation between a beautiful forest and a dark dungeon, dozens of meetings and a number of stories related to these places enormous evocative power ultimately, to arrive by the group of werewolves that so much has been done to kill them, to know the personification of the forest that takes care of them in some way, educates them to check their bestial instincts.

The dragons of the good times andatiDragon Age: Origins is so, what has been billed as the spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate is an enormous adventure, a prism that allows you to enter one of the many facets that make it up out of it every time in a thousand different facets, wearing the clothes of characters called to a heroic end but imprisoned in a world that has lost the moral alignment usually BioWare titles in favor of a complex of interpersonal relationships is amazing how vivid, able to tell at best the many dramas and the few joys offered by a world on the brink of destruction, but still dominated by self-interest, greed and then by the tragedies of each individual. Long, fulfilling, deep and playable in at least two completely different ways, Dragon Age: Origins is the pinnacle of a certain way of playing role, very classic and maybe not perfect, but certainly wonderful and fulfilling.

												Dragon Age: Origins is the best game I've ever played in terms of role-playing. The Origin story system allows you to create characters that feel unique every time, and make every playthrough completely different. The interactions between your character and your companions are incredibly complex and engaging, and allow you to really develop your character's personality. The storyline is very long yet entertaining, and gives you many options as to how to proceed through and eventually complete the game. Often times, there is no right decision, and your actions will have far reaching consequences, and will also affect your companions' opinion of you.As for the gameplay, it is different to many RPGs in that it is very strategy based, and when playing on Normal or harder, you will have to actively manage all four members of your party in order to succeed. The combat can be very punishing and is perhaps too difficult, especially early in the game. Warriors, the front line of your party, will die very quickly without high stats and equipment. However, if you use your party's abilities well, and make good decisions as to which abilities you unlock, you should be alright. The game is open world, though to travel between areas, you must watch your progress on a map. The textures of the NPCs are good enough that they don't affect immersion, yet many of the textures of the environment are rather low-res. However, the game is pretty old now so that is only to be expected. I did not find that it took away from my role-playing experience. The voice-acting is superb, and while like most games you get used to the same voice actors, each NPC does seem slightly different.Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone, and putting in the hours to beat the storyline is extremely rewarding. The various expansions provide a significant late game, or you could just make a totally new character! Even after two playthroughs, the game says I have only completed 54% of the content. Buy this game!			"

												Literally the best game series i've ever played. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for:1. A great story - This game offers one of the greatest storylines I've ever played. It will make you feel emotions you never thought existed. I laughed, cried, gotten frustrated, been happy, been sad, and everything else in between and I have no regrets.2. Replayability - One of the best things about this game, in my opinion, is the replayability effect. This is one of the only games i've ever played where you can play it over and over and over again and still be able to find new things in each and every playthrough. You can't just play this game once and expect to learn all of its secrets. It never gets boring.3. Crossover Choices - What I mean is, when you make choices, these choices will ultimately effect the next game you play. Your choices effect and shape the way your story will turn out and the way characters act and react in the next game. Choose to be moral and have integrety and you will be remembered that way. Choose to be that guy who screws everything up and your followers will have something to say about that. Awesome, right?There is so much more about this game that I haven't even metioned here because I want you to go and figure out all the awesome-ness this game has to offer. So what are you waiting for? Stop reading this and go play this game! This game is still worth $60 in my opinion so you are getting an amazing deal here! Have fun!			"

It is a great game with fantastic characters (well the party members and maybe a few others), great choices, and a great world to explore. After compleating the main quest as a Dwarf and then going through all the dlc as the same character I really did not want it to end. It was very sad to finish the final dlc and end his journey.

												Let me say that I avoided this game for years, Inquisition is better I thought, look at Origins, it's ugly and the animations are dull. What a stupid mistake on my account! Dragon Age: Origins is a masterpiece of a game, a fantastic world, amazing characters and dialogue and a story in which I felt involved personally. In Origins you're not exploring the world as a character, this character is an extension of you, it's you. This game has a soul and I guarantee that if you have played the sequels without playing this one and you think they're better, trust me you'll rearrange their places quickly. I recommend this game as it's one of the best RPGs I've played.			"

												I LOVE this game. It is easily the best $30 I have ever spent. The characters are memorable, the story line is engaging and the atmosephere is spot on. I have played the game through on multiple occasions on multiple difficulty settings and I can honestly say that I hated going through the Deep Roads every time. I will admit, some of the DLC's are overpowered. Some of the gear you can get make the game laughable but still rewarding. Most of the gear cannot be obtained without compelting different achivements in Lilliana's Song, Darkspawn Chronicles and Golems Amgarrak. All of these give you different rewards for being a completionist. The majority of the dlc released (those listed above) including Witch Hunt are different campagines that do not effect the main story. I'm going to stop here, because if I don't i'm going to end up spoiling the game and you would be reading an eight page article and not a review. Here's my advice, buy the Ultimate Edition if you can, it's $10 more than the base game and you will get EVERYTHING. Each DLC adds 5-20 hours of addition game play to an already 100+ hour game. Currently I have logged 313 hours onto this game and I find myself coninueing to enjoy it.			"

												Took me beyond 85 hours to finish a single campaign mode, which is impressive!The game itself is very complex in terms of decision possibilities. The story is very deep and intriguing with hundreds of lore. I haven't even touched the expansion and content packs outside the one integrated with the main campaign. The voice acting is awesome! Probably one of the best.If you want to bring out the best of this game, do not forget to use some mods. Here is the list of mods I used in my 1st playthrough.- Improved Atmosphere- JB Texture- Dragon Age Redesigned- Realistic Look- Natural Body- Faster Combat- Lock Bash- Morrigan Restoration Pack- Personal Annoyance RemoverI got this in summer sale for $7.49.

												I originally owned this on a console, so really my time with this game is close to 1000 hours I would think. After all that time, I have 3 conclusions:1. Mages are OP, whether as NPCs, teammates, or your own character (probably most so as your own character)...but isn't that what magic is supposed to be?2. Swooping is bad.3. This is one of the best RPGs of all time. The writing, characters, gameplay, pacing, customization...everything, is just top notch. This is BioWare at its finest. Plus, after all this time and so many playthroughs, I still get surprised by funny banter between party members I had previously never really paired up before, such as this gem from my last playthru:     Shale: So here is a question for the painted elf...    Zevran: Painted elf? Oh, that's me! I do like that.    Shale: Am I to understand correctly that the painted elf is a ""crow""?    Zevran: Not literally, but... yes. I am a Crow.    Shale: As in a bird.    Zevran: Is there another sort?    Shale: So the painted elf assaults helpless statuary with its feces?    Zevran: If given sufficient cause, why not?    Shale: That is outrageous! The painted elf will stay away from me. Or else.    Zevran: (Sighs) I get a lot of that. +Epic story with rich lore.+Awesome characters all around.+Multiple origins and endings keep things interesting with a new playthrough.+So much replayability+Requires actual strategy to your team building to not get massacred at key points.+Unlike so many other RPGs today, you actually do start to feel stronger and more heroic as the game progresses, but it still stays challenging. +Awakening expansion is nearly as good as the main game-General BioWare RPG gripe: it's always pretty lame how you so easily get wrapped up into awkward, immersion breaking conversations because of how the romance system works. Namely, unless you're mean to--or outright ignore--a romanceable party member, they're going to fall in love with you.-Minor gripe: wish there was a sell junk button in the PC version (but I'm sure there is a mod for that).-No griffons.Even if the combat style is not quite your thing, you would be remiss to skip such an expertly-crafted game.

												This is without a doubt one of the best RPGs ever made. in a sense it's the perfect RPG. tons of choices, deep character creation, different playstyles, an amazing plot, great characters, and more. i have put about 300 or more hours into this game, since I got it on console way before PC and poured tons of hours into my console version. This game has a unique and great plot that will immerse you in a fantasy world unlike any other, with a combat system that is tactical and fun, and characters that you will become emotionally attached to. it has a great soundtrack, the main menu song is incredible and there are some scenes where characters will sing to you and the voices are beautiful. the graphics aren't anything special but there are mods that can make the graphics better. However this game is not about graphics, even with all the cool new games coming out with their high definition graphics i still come back and play this game, and still believe it to be one of the best. it has plenty of exploration and side quests, lots of loot, and nice armors and weapons. the classes are all varied and offer unique combat styles and are all very fun. this is just my personal opinion but this is the best out of the 3 Dragon Age games, none of the others quite capture the true nature of an RPG like this one does. The main story is great as well, with multiple endings and romance options that are all very fulfilling. Overall this game is very well rounded and there aren't many ways it could be improved. there are very few bugs and the game runs great. all in all if you want an amazing RPG to pour hundreds of hours into then this is definitely the game for you, i cannot reccomend this game more highly. I have hundreds of hours of playtime and i still discover somthing new every time i play it which is incredible. The DLC are all pretty good as well, some are better than others but none of them are bad. Bioware has a long history of amazing RPGs and this is one of them. SUMMARY:Story: 10/10Characters: 9/10Combat: 9/10Music: 9/10High ReplayabilityThis is a game you definitely do not want to miss out on, and is well worth your time and money.			"

												An absolute gem. Masterpiece of the Dragon Age series (haven't played Inquisition yet), tons of replayability, memorable characters and amazing storyline, infinite routes to go in terms of character development. For me this game easily qualifies to be one of the best RPGs of all time, a fantastic example of what Bioware can pull off with enough time and resources.The combat is satisfying and challenging at the same time, it will appeal to the tacticians as well as the people who aren't well versed in that sort of combat system. You can make amazing combinations with your character's attacks and the game rewards you for being intelligent. One example is if you freeze an enemy then use a crushing attack, the enemy will instantly die by being shattered, giving you an effective combo when you come upon a tough segment. There's a lot of combinations like this, and I encourage you to find them all for yourself.If you want to experience Bioware at their greatest, pick this up, with all the downloadable content. You'll sink so many hours into this game that's it not funny (ignore the time I have on Steam, used to have this on Origin and now I Family Share it with my brother-in-law, I have easily over 100+ hours on this game).

												   Dragon Age: Origins is an oldie but goodie. It has quite the replay value - the game changes somewhat depending on the particular character origins; the character choices throughout the game impact its progression as well. The story itself is interesting - its dark tone doesn't get overwhelming thanks to occasional comic relief (sometimes unintentionally in the form of the enemies).     The game's strongest draw, however, are the well-written and expertly voiced companions - their attitude towards the player depends on the particular interactions resulting in either animosity, friendship or romance. The background banter between companions can be quite hilarious.   On the downside, the combat can get repetitive for those who are not quite the strategic thinkers (like me), although I grew to love it. The character creation is rather lacking, however the problem can be easily (and with great success) solved with the use of mods. Tl;dr: Whether you want to fall in love with one of the charming companions or get mentally scarred for life by the hideous boob monster, you're in for a treat.			"

												Such an amazing experience. Probably my favourite RPG of all time alongside Star Wars: KOTOR and The Sith Lords.+ Good main quest.+ The game is pretty hard on hard/nightmare settings and it will give you a challenge unlike many newer noob friendly RPG's with their ''press X to win/do something amazing"" gameplay.+ Amazing soundtrack.+ Likable companions with interesting side stories.+ The origin stories! A lot of replay value here for just seeing how the diffrent origin stories start out. Also every origin story offers some unique dialogue options later in the game.+ Some great DLC like The Awakening (20+ hours of gameplay).+ Very funny party banter ( Allistair vs Morrigan is my favourite... or when Wyne and Oghren talk about beer in the Deep Roads )Really can't think of one thing i dislike about this game. Played all three Dragon Age games and this is by far my favourite. DA2 i hated with a passion while DAI i found pretty good, but not Origins level good. Sad we don't see more games of this type, and that the few RPG series we even have are going for more of an action/open world type gameplay, and less focuss on interesting story and actual RPG elements.

												So in 2009, Bioware decided to return to its roots of making RPGs in the vein of Baldur's Gate with Dragon Age: Origins. What resulted is a very engaging and thrilling tale of a band of misfits that come together to defeat the evil Darkspawn and their leader, the Archdemon. I wholeheartedly can recommend it.The story of Dragon Age is a pretty good one, with a good mix of political intrigue and dark fantasy themes. There is some really expansive lore in this game available for you to read in the codex, which would take you hours to read. I assure you, however, that reading all of it is worth it.The party members are all unique characters, and well-written. Some would say a few are weaker than others as far as being interesting (looking at you, Sten), but they all have decent backstories and are really fun to hear banter between each other. That's another thing; the party banter is hilarious and worth stopping to listen to.The combat in this game is beyond thrilling. You can pause combat at any time to issue orders to your four-member party, and after unpausing they will act out the order. You can play the game either in third-person or an isometric view. I prefer the isometric for tactical reasons and for that classic Baldur's Gate/Planescape feel. You can also set up tactics for your party members so that they will use certain items/abilities when a condition is met. This can get as in-depth as you like, and its one of the coolest features of the game in my humble opinion.Graphically, the game doesn't look too bad for how old it is already, but there are texture mods to spice it up, if you're interested. Be aware, however, that this could cause stuterring due to the game engine not really liking textures being TOO large. Otherwise, the graphics are servicable, but nothing to write home about. I don't really care about them, but its up to you to decide whether or not they bother you.tl;dr Dragon Age: Origins is a return to form for Bioware RPGs and a great 100-or-so-hour romp for RPG nerds like myself. Buy it if you want to experience one of the better games to come out in recent years. Its worth it. Good story, good characters, great game.			"

												It’s not easy always being at the cutting edge, and that’s why I’ve decided to review this Dragon Age game, and not the new one which people are currently interested in.DA:O is a few years old now, but it has taken a few attempts for me to actually stick with it, and it with me. Hence, tardy review. But, let me be clear, right off the bat. It’s as good as everybody said it was, all those years ago! Sure, it has a somewhat off-putting generic fantasy shell, and the designers needn’t have limited themselves to just four colours (brown, grey, green, and reddish-brown) when they were painting this grand adventure. You might say it’s more realistic but sod realism, this is a fantasy game, and it’s all a bit too “trad”, at least at first blush.However, I can only speak personally. There are many people who adore trad fantasy and all its trappings, and who don’t like change. More power to them, but for me, at first glance, there doesn’t seem to a lot of originality here, in setting or theme. I persisted, peeled back those crusty brownish-grey outer layers, and found something truly engrossing. This game has a lot of humour, and a lot of heart.When it was first released, there was a lot of buzz about DA:O being a spiritual successor to the Baldur’s Gate games, which meant there would be swords, dragons, magic, derring-do and loads of fighting. This is all true of DA:O. There was also a lot of hype for the “Origins” system, proudly displayed in the title, which meant that instead of having one single starting sequence (location, npcs, events) you’d have a different one based on your race and class. You might find yourself a poor elf in an alienage, forced to get by on your wits and the point of a knife, or a stalwart dwarven noble in a monumental underground palace, and all the intrigue that entails. Where you come from also affects how you’ll be perceived by party members and other important characters in the game. It was supposed to make you feel more of a connection to your character, and I think it really works and actually helps give the game a decent amount of replayability. From my own experience the balance of the game is probably weighted about 60/40 in favour of combat over conversation, which is okay. It’s not great: there have been times when I’ve been exploring a temple or an underground cavern and become completely fatigued with having to fight the same enemies again and again, with the only difference being that this time it’s archers instead of mages standing at the back. It hasn’t happened often, though, and because the game is relatively free-form, you can always go and do something else. If you’re the type of player that prefers diplomacy over fistcuffery, beware: more often than not, quests end in big fights.Combat takes place in real-time, but you can pause the game to issue commands, and watch them play out when you unpause. There are tons of spells and skills, so you’ll want to make sure to use the right ones at the right times. I’d say that on any difficulty above Easy, you will need to pause quite regularly and be prepared to micro-manage to some degree. The other option is setting up tactics for each party member, which are like little scripts for them to follow. You might set up your tank to immediately engage the strongest enemy, or tell your mage to cast an AoE if enemies are standing near to each other. This takes time to organise, and tactics which work for one fight may not do so well in another, but generally this feature will reduce busywork and it can be satisfying to spectate as your team dismantles the enemy without you lifting a finger.Fights can get quite busy. You will almost always be assaulted by many foes, some up close and some at range, and there will be bursts of fire and magic bolts flying. It can be hard to keep track, so it’s a good thing the devs included a tactical camera. You can flick the mousewheel to pull the camera back into the ceiling, just far enough that you can see who is who and where people are positioned. It’s pretty useful, and entirely missing from the console versions. Pat yourself on the back for owning a PC.I mentioned before that I’ve bounced off this game, and this has been because of difficulty spikes. Depending on in which order you choose to approach the three (or four, I forget) “main” quests in the game, you may find yourself running up against enemies which are too tough for you, or battles which seem to go on forever, where enemy waves continuously spawn. Case in point, Redcliffe, which Alistair, a party member, specifically advises you to tackle first of all. This questline is good fun, but very combat heavy and has a one particular fight where waves of enemies just keep on spawning, so you need to keep party members safe all the way through the fight. From a storytelling point of view it makes sense: Alistair cares for the Arl of Redcliffe, and can’t have known about the danger before telling you to go there. But as a player, it’s a harsh lesson to learn at an early point in the game. As I said, don’t be afraid to go and do something else if you keep getting hammered. Will wrap up with the most positive points. The writing is frequently excellent, particularly with regards to the banter between party members. The lore is deep, and the in-game codex completely overflows with interesting entries to read about the history of the land, the people and the places. It looks good! Faces are a bit “uncanny valley” at times, but mostly well animated and  believable. If you’re in the market for a deep and fairly complex RPG to sink your teeth into, then get Dragon Age: Inquisition. But, if you’re poor like me, get this one.			"

												Pros:- Combat is not just hack 'n slash. It relies heavily on strategy and tactics.- Character development like no other game (of its time). Not just your own story, but your party members too. The level to which you can interact with them - and even them with each other - adds a whole 'nother dimension of entertainment to the game.- It's easy to switch your party members around. If you don't want to use someone, they don't 'go home' or leave forever. They just wait for you at camp.- Main plot line and side quests suck you right in.- Depending on the race you wish to play, there are different beginnings to the game. And depending on your choices throughout the game, you will have different outcomes, even a different ending. So there is plenty of replayability enjoyment!Cons:- I think I thought of one the other day, but it escapes me...All in all, one of the best RPGs I've played.			"

												Dragon Age: Origins is a spectacular edition to the fantasy genre. It has a lovely story of good vs. evil, and graces you with a lovely story with each waking. The companions, while not plentiful, are memorable. Each  one of them has a distinct personality, and react to different situations differently. Bioware has their trademark beautiful talking cutscenes, and depending on your group, and standing with them, they will jump into conversations on various occasions. The six varying ways to start the game adds a lot of diversity, and replayability for that matter. It's gameplay can be compared to WoW if you are familiar with it. A skill bar at the bottom for abilities and items, though a twist comes in. You have a party of four to control, you and three companions, and you have the ability to control each and every one. You gain even more control with the ability to pause the combat, and issues orders to be done when you unpause it. If you don't like strategizing, and have a console, you could pick it up on the Xbox or playstation for a more combat oriented gameplay.TL;DR, Overall, this game is a must-buy for anyone who enjoys the fantasy, spell-casting, and shield-bashing genre that this game falls under. In my honest opinion, this game is a 10/10. Great characters, good gameplay, and good story.			"

												Don't get me wrong this game is great. There's nothing else in the genre that can mess with it, no matter what anybody else tells about it.What is making me feel really, really angry and soooo sad about this Steam Release is, that it deleted my previous Dragon Age Origins save games,  and btw. also my Dragon Age 2 save games while it overwrote the MyDocuments\Bioware folder without any prompting.

												Instead of reviewing one game, it would be more useful to discuss the trilogy. I would recommend you get them from Origin—unfortunately, there is no franchise bundle—though you can transfer saves between clients. Dragon Age shows BioWare's creativity by redefining the CRPG experience of storytelling as well as role-playing design. Each game provides subversions in fantasy, and even in BioWare games, that shows their best quality. Unlike Mass Effect, this trilogy has little direct relations, choosing instead to expand upon the lore. In many ways, DA uses aspects of past series (ex. Baldur's Gate, even SoD) to focus on the strengths of each game. The result, as often seen by fans, is a series divided by various camps thinking one game defines the franchise.  The truth is what defines DA is more a collection of shared interests: A title granted to a hero, and a story of world-building and of companions. Each game should be evaluated as its own take, which means if one game doesn't interest you the others may be more favorable.  Dragon Age: Origins	DA:O is often considered the best DA game. Looking back on Origins, it's hard to imagine that DA would be BioWare's most innovative series. DA:O is mainly derivative of their previous games of BG and Neverwinter Nights. You just have to look far beneath the surface for their differences.Though the lore is free from the D&D influence, choosing a Judeo-Christian-like fantasy religion, the mechanical complexity of DA:O is reminiscent of CRPGs. It's more streamlined and story/companion driven than their older games, but if you raise the difficulty it provides just as much challenge. It helps keeps a steady pace.As someone who was put off by BG's beginning, I relished returning to DA:O where companions only die in plot-related moments. The AI in BioWare's games have always been finicky, so the lack of punishment for random behavior is easier to tolerate. However, the difficulty can sometimes feel cheapened—especially in DLCs—if you don't maximize every tactical element, even on Normal.Gameplay, however, isn't DA:O's strongest aspect. The combat scaling can feel random, coupled by the slow pace of attacks and the limited variety of enemies. Like other CRPGs there is a lot of pausing to micromanage required to win. However, the combat is not what people come to replay but its narrative design.DA:O uses a modular design where there are multiple paths for each required section of the plot, but how you choose to resolve them and how they affect the future events is what is important. Some chapters have higher skill requirements, but your paths stay as player-driven as the city in BG2. The influence of past events, your character's identity and origin, and companion responses offer replayability. It all almost works.The origins of DA:O is where it struggles. The weakest introduction is probably the Dalish elves, which is odd because they have the most lore. The Human noble, City Elves and Dwarf stories are simple revenge/justice hooks. Only the Mage stands out as the most unique. Whatever your choice, it becomes irrelevant after the intro as the world takes the stage. Personal affiliation with the protagonist, as a result, becomes the weakest part of DA:O.  Dragon Age 2This flaw feels like the main source of refinement for DA2, and it's why I enjoy this game the most out of the series. The story of the Champion and of the personal narratives of Hawke's family and companions feels the most tightly written, unique story I've seen from BioWare. (Especially with Varric's liberties in the plot.) Even though Hawke is about as bland as Shepherd, the agency for how s/he reacts makes the player feel like this is his/her Hawke.Unfortunately, what was achieved for a greater personal narrative came at the cost of what many enjoy, replayability. Hawke can only be a human, and the only important choice is whether or not s/he is a mage or not. The storyline offers the illusion of agency similar to BeamDog's SoD where the ""role-playing"" is choosing how to respond to a predetermined fate with some greater consequences to decide. It's an experience I think story-driven/lore players would relish more than DA:O die-hards, and the way the issues raised (the Quanari's Qun influence, the Templar vs. Mage conflict and the Kirkwall refugees) are more grey than DA:O's binary options helped me immerse myself into DA. Especially the Templar vs. Mage conflict, which the game heavily reminds you of in almost every other quest and as it's a focal point for the setting of Inquisition.That repetition can also be seen in the gameplay. The best that can be said is how more visceral and fluid the gameplay has been enhanced over DA:O, and the unique setting of Kirkwall is far more memorable over the blandness of Fereldon. Most complaints are levied at the reused locations, which could be fixed if Kirkwall was one massive city like in DA:I. The other issue is the overused Templar vs. Mage conflict.This latter issue I find intentional as the reoccurrence of the possibility of blood magic and other mage-issues may change your mind whether or not you believe mages should be given total freedom. It may instill a prejudice and show character growth towards even hating mages, and I've yet to see another game be as effective as DA2. However, I will admit that DA2 suffers from its quest design and reused assets, which wasn't as much of a problem in DA:O. It is from this misstep that BioWare would learn to address in the next game, DA:I. Dragon Age (3): Inquisition If DA:I asks one question from you, then it is this: What is content to you, and what is it worth? DA:I is by far the most massive of all BioWare games, but it's also the most padded if you're a completionist. If you accept not doing everything, however, then you can find just as an enriching personal experience as DA2 and as a experience driven by player agency. Though of all three, this game lacks consequences.It's strange to complain about lacking consequences in a game that gives you total freedom, but this game does its best to think there are risks. DA2 also suffered from this issue but the guise feels more transparent here. You may lose a character or decide the fate of some NPC in places. The problem is how much of your time is spent doing one-solution tasks vs. player-driven choices. You will never see the same extent of options as much as the amount of choices from past games influences this world.This isn't to say I'm against the base-building mechanics. They are resources that offer many diversions to gain them, including when you're not playing the game, and the grind towards progression helps make the plot feel grander. However, you can easily get caught up in 20+ hours of fetch-quests only to enjoy the story-bits that offer something different. This design does succeed by making the Inquisition feel like our Inquisition (with companions).Companions have never been an issue for BioWare. While I didn't enjoy every single character in DA:O (Sten and Dwarf-Dude) and DA2 (Fenris and Carter), I do like how BioWare has innovated companions for non-squad members. The War Room members, reoccurring helpers (Scout Harding) and other familiar faces lends a lot of close ties in all parts of the organization. The amount of effort to write that much content, let alone program it, speaks volumes for how much BioWare cares for their story-content.Unfortunately, DA:I sacrificed the one thing that made DA so wondrous for me, the excellent pacing, that makes replaying it more daunting than other games.Conclusion & Other Issues with the SeriesIf it isn't clear, I love all these games, but not for the same reasons. However, the biggest issue is its DLC practices (see below).			"

												I bought this game quite awhile ago, but I never got into it (didn't really get far into it at all either), even as a HUGE fan of the Mass Effect series (Mass Effect 2 being my favorite game of all time). I have absolutely no clue as to why i didn't get into it so much earlier on. As my Semester just ended, I was extremely bored and i didn't really have anything else to play but this. And now,I finished Dragon Age Origins in less than 3 days completing as many quests as possible and I had one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. This game is truly a masterpiece, with extremely well-done story telling, awesome characters, good character development and a very RPG-feel combat system to go along with it. Ever since I finished this game a 2 weeks ago, I've since then finished Dragon Age 2, and I'm even almost done with Dragon Age Inquisiton. Although both these 2 games were also great, they don't compare to Dragon Age Origins when it comes to story telling. I'm glad I was able to play this game, as it has become one of my favorites ever. A True MUST-play for any RPG fans out there			"

												Dragon Age was my first real experience with a computer game. I saw someone else playing it and wanted to give it a go. I ended up buying a PS3 and the game on console and played it through from start to finish twice (that's over 200 hours of playtime right there). Starting an Origins game is a bit of commitment, often I lose track of what I was planning for a character if I stop playing them for a while, so I start over. Rinse and repeat.At the time I can genuinely say that this game changed my life. How it holds up now is a bit harder to say for sure. I find the combat slow (which was great when I had never played a combat game before) and in fact the whole game is a bit on the slow side by today's standards, but if you can get past older graphics and a slow pace, I recommend giving it a go. Especially, when you can buy the whole lot on sale for so little.It has romance, humour, friendship, betrayal and so much more. The lore of the Dragon Age universe is deep and there is plenty to read if you're interested in a world with a lot of depth. The main story arc remains the same no matter what you do - for the most part - but you can surely mess with a lot of people's lives along the way, including your own followers. Will they find happiness? Love? A horrible death? Sometimes they will even break your heart.Also, there are 6 totally different starts to the game depending largely on race and class. If you find starting the game as a human noble a bit boring, try being a circle mage or a dwarven commoner or dwarven royalty or a city elf or a dalish elf. Each start is different. You will find yourself in a different location with a different tragedy establishing who you are. A few hours in all the stories converge to the main story arc, but you will never forget where you came from and where it placed you in the world. No amount of ""this is your backstory"" can have the impact of experiencing it. Even better is that you can import your save game into DA2 or use the Dragon Age Keep to recreate (or rewrite) your story for Inquisition and the choices you made will change both of those games in many small ways! You can have a continuous history over all three games. It's a beautiful thing.As for the content packs, some have more in them than others. One of my favourites is The Darkspawn Chronicles. Have you ever wondered how the final battle of a game would go if you were playing as the enemy? It was awful, having to defeat my own beloved companions in the final battle, but also really interesting. There were cutscenes and all. I may have even cried a little.Awakenings starts to move more into the style of Dragon Age 2 and introduces a very important character or two. It's a fairly substantial bit of extra content, maybe 20 hours from memory?All the way back then, I would have given the game 9.9 out of 10, now... it's still a great game if you can get into it, a classic even, but it's dated. Of course it is.If you have never tried a combat game before, but want to start playing combat games? You couldn't get a much easier introduction as you can pause combat (in all the DA games) and apply tactics - or just catch your breath. Difficulty can be ramped up if you want a challenge or right down if you want a cakewalk.Made me think, made me laugh, broke my heart, changed my life.On PC there are also plenty of modding options, Nexus mods has over 2000 files. I never really modded Origins due to playing it primarily on console, but I like the idea.			"

												If you're willing to get past some of the antiquated designs (mainly combat and inventory), DA:O is one of the best RPGs you could ever play. You could spend hours just talking to your companions, who are written fantastically and really draw you into the game. The intense struggle of uniting Fereldan and its conflicted peoples against the Darkspawn is a one of a kind adventure. There can be some lulls in its pacing, which generally come after completing a major quest (I'm looking at you, Deep Roads), but if you can power through and continue with the game, you won't regret it one bit.

 RATING: 9.5/10 - Legendary Masterpiece of Gaming ===Alright, i felt i needed to get this review done after finishing this game again, this time on Steam, and all the DLCs. Like you probably guessed by the score i given to it, this game is near absolute perfection as far as role playing games are concerned.So, let's start the usual way...=== Pros & Cons  + Pros + + Absolutely great story, with tons of dialogue options, romance possibilities, all fully voice-acted and very well-written.+ A huge world full of quests, discoveries to make, enemies to defeat and secrets to reveal+ Great companions with in-depth backgrounds, personalities and alignments+ Deep character and class building system, with loads of skills to suit any playstyle+ Programmable party members behaivior in combat to suit your own commands+ Real-time pause combat system with fully controllable companions and even summons, you can take control of any ally at any time+ Tons upon tons of different enemies, weapon types, armors and general loot to find+ Maximum level difficulty is hard as hell but gives great satisfaction+ Still good graphics for a game this old+ Balanced combat which always gives the right amount of challenge but is never frustrating+ Your choices in the story will impact heavily on what happens - Cons - Game doesn't work well on Win 8/8.1/10 systems. Use XP SP3 compatibility mode and run as admin to fix.- Above average amount of crashes. This is due to a memory leak issue that BioWare never addressed, but can be fixed by setting graphics to medium/low (doesn't matter if you have a high-end pc or not, it's just bugged)- Some spells are a bit overpowered if used right- Melee rogue class is underpowered and can't really compete with other builds even in late game, making it pretty useless=== Final thoughts even if it has some problems mostly related to it being old and bugged in the core programming (see memory leak), this game is still an absolute jewel and in my opinion one of the greatest RPGs ever created in the history of gaming. I have played all the major titles you can possibly imagine, and even edgy ones, but compared to this they all are blown away, only other true masterpieces can hold against a game of this greatness.Just get it.

												Oh my god, how have I not yet written a review for this amazing Game?!Dragon Age manages to combine an Epic Story, a great tactical combat system and superb presentation almost perfectly in a single Game.I'll try to keep this somewhat short:Why is it good?  Player Freedom: You get to choose Gender, Race and Class for your Hero, each with a Unique Starting chapter and during the game, your choices MATTER. It will affect how people react to you, how a Quest ends etc. etc. The Combat System: It is a Party based Combat system that can be paused at any point, to give Commands to your party members. While that doesn't sound special - the way it is set up makes it Special. Not only are the different abilities interesting and add a lot of tactical depth, but these abilites can also interact with each other in 2 ways.1. Indirectly - for example your Mage freezes several opponents in Place, so another Party member can easily hit an AoE ability2. Directly in the form of Combos - For example combining different elemental spells to form the Thunder-Blizzard of the Century Engaging Story and Presentation: If there is one thing Bioware really knows how to do, it's how to create an interesting World/Lore and present it. The World really feels alive and coherent. There is so much material for the player to read into the Lore if he is interested and the presentation is just amazing. The cutscenes are well animated (as is pretty much anything considering when it came out), the voice acting is stellar across the board and the sound assets as well as the music itself is nothing to  sneeze at. Characters & Romances: A huge part of Bioware games such as Mass Effect, Dragon Age etc. is the ability for a Player to start a romantic relationship with a party member. To me personally, this is even better in Dragon Age: Origins, than it was in Mass Effect. The Characters in both games are of course very unique and likeable, but when it comes down to it, i'd choose Morrigan or Leliana over Tali or Liara any day of the week.Also characters that you cannot woo are amazingly well done overall. There will be some that you love, there will be some that you just wont ever really understand, and there are some that you will HATE. As it should be - and yet, if you put in the time you might figure out that a villain that you hated, actually had really good intentions.So overall they feel really well fleshed out, they feel like actual Persons with real emotions. Replayability: Due to the many different choices, origins and endings that you will experience throughout the game, it is very likely that you will have a second and third playthrough. (Hell I probably have like 20 different chararcters at this point). In addition to that, the game can be really challenging on higher difficulties - so maybe you want to try and beat it on the Legendary difficulty later on. Mods: While the modding community isn't very active anymore, it has been in the past and all their work is still available. Additional armors, better textures, new quests, Locations, characters, the ability to skip parts of the game (♥♥♥♥ the fade!),  nude- and ahem ""love""-mods. You name it!They add to the already huge amount of time that this game will take out of your life. But it was worth every minute if you ask me :) What's bad about it: Slow Combat: This is pretty much the only thing i can think of. The Animations in Combat might feel slow to some people. They kinda did to me at first and were made faster in Dragon Age II and Inquisition. It's probably best to quickly check it in a Youtube Video - see if it bothers you. It's by no means unplayably slow, but everything kinda feels like it should just be a tick faster. Achievements: Now i dont really know if this can be counted as a negative thing for most people, but i feel bad only mentioning the combat System. So the game does have achievements - however they are not supported by steam. If you decide to play it on Origin, they will show up and you can brag to your friends there, as i am sure we all have a huge amount of friends on Origin....This seems like i am really biased, but that is the games fault because it is just THAT good. There really aren't many bad aspects that stood out to me.Overall this is a game that I believe everybody should have experienced at least once. It is certainly better than it's sequels, and to me, it even blows the Mass Effect series out of the water.Sale or not - this game is definitely worth it's price			"

												Take a fantasy novel, double it's length, throw in BioWare, and add a little EA meddling to make yet another Bioware classic.There isn't a secret recipe for a good solid game. It's just a shame the pure ingredient called Bioware can't be found anymore. You always find it now tainted with EA.While you will find this title to be well crafted, it's not for everyone. I had to get over my hate for the  fantasy genre, which wasn't easy. I'm glad that I did, as I would have missed out on yet another  Bioware classic. If you prefer running n' gunning, don't dream of playing this unless you can change your attitude. Sadly, many of the newer generation of PC gamers fall into the “action packed” trap, where they miss out on what makes a game – it's story. Characters take revenge, scheme behind your back, among other things.Speaking of story, one of my teachers once told me that a good plot mixes together the right amounts of gore, sex, and humor. While you will find all three in Dragon Age: Origins, there isn't enough humor to lighten the load so to speak. You will find that the story simply drags on. I recommend playing in 1-3 hour sessions, otherwise you might just end up leaving such a great title in the dust. The “behind your back” conversations are a nice break as the maps can take a long time to explore.It took me about 65 hours to play though once, not even completing every single minor side quest. Mass Effect 3 took 24, and the others in the series about 12-24. The store page lists 80 hours of gameplay, which seems about right. Many won't be able to withstand that long on one game since it feels like it just drags on. At the end of the day, if you can bear with it, you won't be disappointed.The “Ultimate Edition” includes quite a few DLCs that I didn't end up using/playing. The original seems plenty long enough, but I don't think I will end up going back soon for “The Awakening” DLC. The game ends with a cliff hanger, which was obviously setup for the 2nd.The joke with Mass Effect is that you should get an achievement for not getting laid. While some of you understand that joke and it being true for Mass Effect, it's not the same here. Dragon Age uses a scale from -100 to 100 (or what seems to be -100). If a party member's gauge is to low, they will leave you! Mass Effect uses a simple 1-5 scale, where “loyalty” is at 4, romance is declared at a 5, and save porting uses a special 6. All of that is of course hidden, but in Dragon Age it isn't. This newer and what some would call better “romance mechanic” makes it hard to understand. This isn't a real life simulator, but does a much better job then the “getting laid simulator” in the Mass Effect series. You can follow and please one individual, but then end up displeasing others severely – even if they aren't in your current party. Throw in the invisible “hardening” mechanic as well.. You will have to read the wiki to understand how complex the whole game is.It's judgment time now. I think 91/100 is fair for the metascore, as long as you can overcome your hate for the fantasy genre (nudge nudge me), not enough “pew pew” (many young gamers) and understand or appreciate the mature subjects within the title.So all in all, even with bugs in character's movement, old 2009 graphics, and a story that just seems to drag on, I can't stamp a great or terrible score. Playing quite a few other titles, and understanding who you need to be to enjoy this, I give this super long review a number for the game.8.5/10			"

												This game is a masterpiece. It is one of my favorite games of all time, and likely always will be. Bioware has created a beautiful world which is so unique and full of rich lore and fantastic characters. Everything in this game is what all RPGs should strive to be. A story that is by no means complicated, but at the same time very compelling. The oppurtunity to choose your own origin story from one of six choices may not sound like a huge deal, but in this game it adds a great deal to your sense of individualism and further adds to the games replay-abilty. And I wish the other dragon age games still had them, since for me it was a large incentive to buy this game back when it came out. As I said before the world and setting are superb in this game, however for me the characters are the best part. The companions you journey with in this game are all a pleasure to converse with as you learn more of their stories and opinions. All of them bringing something unique to the table, no two companions feel similar nor do they feel emotionless. If you haven't played this game yet,it is an absolute must, and I insist you converse with your companions as you playthrough the game for they add a great deal of character to the game.			"

												Dragon Age: Origins is a fantastic and nicely well done dark fantasy RPG. It's is very fun to play with endless replayability. You can create all sorts of characters with differnt oirgins such as an Elf archer or an Human warrior. It also has fantastic artwork, storyline, character design, and music. Also with the steam version of Dragon Age Origins you can also activate the game on your Origin account and you will be able to have both the Steam version and the Origin version of Dragon Age Origins. This is also one of the most best best role-playing video games that i've ever played along with other RPG games that I played like Diablo (all of the series), Neverwinter Nights Diamond, The Witcher ( well actually I have the GOG.com versions of The Witcher 1 and 2), and many other RPG games. This a very awesome and highly enjoyable dark fantasy role-playing game with endless enjoyment.10/10 A fantastic and extremly fan dark fantasy role-playing game with endless replayability.			"

												The following review will be my first impression of the game.I bought the Ultimate Edition while it was on sale, and I definitely think I got more than my money's worth. In retrospect, I'd probably buy it for the normal price. Let me tell you why:PROS-In RPG's like Skyrim, ESO, and even Dragon Age Inquisition, I have a bad habit of skipping through dialouge. With this game, however, I found myself listening closely to every single cutscene. I started as a human rogue, so I'm not sure what the other origin stories are like.-The combat is certainly interesting. It's not like the games ahead of this one. In fact, it reminded me very much of Runescape combat. You click on an enemy, and your player auto-attacks it. Of course, you can use your abilities. I have yet to explore the tactical combat system. I just don't like pausing the game to give orders, and it's working out fine for me.-The character customization is decent. One benefit of playing on PC is the availability of mods. While I found the base hairstyles and facial features more than enough, there are some mods to add more choices if you're really invested in your character's appearance.-The followers are full of personality, and you can romance some of them too. -The dialouge options are great for roleplaying. Instead of the standard 2 choices of evil and good responses, there's four or so responses you can choose from to create a more in-depth personality for your character.CONS:-Don't be expecting amazing graphics. It's pretty standard, even on the highest setting. -The movement system is clunky and weird to get used to at first. A and D keys turn the camera instead of the traditional strafing movements offered by newer games. If you hold down the right mouse button you can swivel the camera, which I found to be easier.As someone who played Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition before visiting this game, I can say it's a completely different experience- in a good way. You cannot go wrong buying this game while it's on sale.			"

												Bioware really excelled themselves around this time. You have to be pretty hardcore to finish the whole game (about 150hrs) but it is basically as good as Baulders Gate except new graphics. So many mods to.9.9/10. So nearly perfect.			"

												Dragon Age: Origins is a fantastic and nicely well done dark fantasy RPG. It's is very fun to play with endless replayability. You can create all sorts of characters with differnt oirgins such as an Elf archer or an Human warrior. It also has fantastic artwork, storyline, character design, and music. Also with the steam version of Dragon Age Origins you can also activate the game on your Origin account and you will be able to have both the Steam version and the Origin version of Dragon Age Origins. This is also one of the most best best role-playing video games that i've ever played along with other RPG games that I played like Diablo (all of the series), Neverwinter Nights Diamond, The Witcher ( well actually I have the GOG.com versions of The Witcher 1 and 2), and many other RPG games. This a very awesome and highly enjoyable dark fantasy role-playing game with endless enjoyment.10/10 A fantastic and extremly fan dark fantasy role-playing game with endless replayability.			"

												This is my favorite western RPG ever.If you like bioware RPGs I think this is the best one they've made, good story, good gameplay. It has the traditional RPG classes but with very interesting sub-classes (Who doesn't want to be a blood mage at least once?) The higher difficulties are quite rewarding, requiring a lot of strategy and use of the tactical options, you can set custom rules for individual characters like ""if health is below x% use x ability or x potion"" of course you can read much more on the tactics menu at the game's unofficial wiki page on tactics.[dragonage.wikia.com]If you're still  unsure please give it a chance on sale, but I think this is one of the best RPGs ever made.

												Short verdict: an epic story-driven RPG with all the usual BioWare stuff: moral choices, romance options, a s-h-1tl0ad of dialogues, alternative endings, unlockable character specialisations and mediocre tactical combat system.If you’ve played and liked games like Mass Effect and Jade Empire, you might also like this game. Although combat in Mass Effect was much more better.(If it’s too long to read, just skip to the summary.)The strongest aspect of DAO is the story. It’s very long, very detailed, interesting, but also overwhelming. After 100+ hours into the game, you get tired of it, and just wish for it to end, but it doesn’t. Don’t get me wrong, the game is interesting till the very end, but, at times, it seems that there’s just too much lore thrown at you. When I play games, I play them like this: 1. exploration -> 2. side quests -> 3. main quests, because I don’t want to miss anything. In DAO, after entering a new region, you can easily spend 2 hours just talking with NPCs, before you accomplish anything.The chaotic pacing, in which the game throws quests, puzzles or unlockable secrets at you doesn’t help either. At times, there could be more than 20 or even 30 active quests in different regions of the game’s world.Also, some of the main quest lines are incredibly long, particularly the Fade mission and Deep Roads mission. The Fade mission is so annoyingly long, because of all the mazes and backtracking, that there’s even mod[www.nexusmods.com] to skip it.  And it took me 3 evenings to finish everything in Orzammar and Deep Roads.On the bright side, all side quests are interesting, enjoyable, unique and well thought through. Even the few fetch quests that there are in this game, are nice and cool.However, it should be noted, that although the story is fantastic and engaging, there’s not much new DAO brings to the table. What you have is basically your typical Tolkien universe: elves with bows and arrows that have lost the glory of the civilization they once had and now are living in forests or city ghettos, Viking-like dwarfs who live underground with their runes and golems and crafting, greedy and power-hungry humans and menacing and brainless orcs, which are named “darkspawn” in this game. The class choices are also very typical: warrior, rogue and mage.And, it should be noted, that the game is favouring the warrior class over the other two classes, because majority of your companions are warriors and, also, most of the cool armour sets and weapons are intended for warriors. Mages, on the other hand, have more variable skill sets. I played as a rogue. It was still fun, but I wish I had more unique armour sets and weapons. This flaw is corrected in DAO: Awakening, though.As to the combat system, I think it’s the biggest DAO drawback. The combat is tactical and, although not static, it very much feels like the old RPGs of the 80’s (which I absolutely hate), where you need to take into account the stats, damage type and use either correct form of attack or skill. Another feature that reminds me of those old RPGs, are sudden ambushes, when enemies appear out of nowhere. I’d rather have had just a simple hack ’n’ slash experience, where the outcome is based on my reaction instead of strategy. I wouldn’t mind the planning part; at first, I even liked that I am able to pause the game, switch between the weapon sets, plan which item or skill to use, where to place my squad mates; but later on it turned out that, in narrow dungeon areas, this actually doesn’t play out well, and, even if it did, it still is tiresome to micromanage the s-h-1tl0ad of skills and items you have, after you have levelled up above level 20. Theoretically, you don’t need to micromanage everything, because there are automatic action slots available, but in reality, the automatic actions don’t cover every possible situation, and you still need to switch between the characters and adjust their actions. Fortunately, when you’re maxed out, you can just go and kill everyone, but the strongest enemies, without using any skills or strategy. Believe me, after 100+ hours into the game, that pausing and clicking gets annoying. For me it was so annoying, that I just started using console command runscript killallhostiles towards the end of DAO: Awakening. I was tired of the combat, I just wanted to find out, how the story ends.As to other gameplay aspects, insufficient inventory space (and even insufficient storage space) and lack of money are typical RPG problems that are present in DAO, as well. Also, very often, certain outcomes are dependent on just a few tiny dialogue choices. So save often!The level design is nice and the different areas are detailed and quite beautiful (as far as the dated graphics go). The characters are designed well and thoroughly, each having their unique background (and companion quests for the squad mates). You can engage in dialogues with your squad mates. Your dialogue choices determine their rate of approval of you. And it’s fun to listen to their funny cat fights, while you’re on a mission.As to the graphics, well, the game is quite old, so don’t expect Witcher 3 quality in it, especially when it comes to the textures. But there are a few mods that can improve your experience. I particularly recommend the Redesigned mod[www.nexusmods.com] for better character look. There are also some SweetFX mods available, but, imo, they just make things worse. Vibrant colours mod[www.nexusmods.com] is ok, too.A few words about the DLCs:Stone Prisoner: a fun additional quest that adds an extra warrior to your squad.Warden Keep: a fun additional quest that provides you with a base, where you can buy good items and equipment and also store your inventory. You also get a unique armour set and two new skills.Return to Ostagar: a chance to avenge Duncan, your mentor who dies in the second main quest.Feastday gifts and pranks: special items that can increase or decrease your companion rate of approval.The Witch Hunt: this DLC reveal the events around Morrigan and her child, who is crucial in the next DA games. This story line is especially rewarding, if you romanced and was faithful to Morrigan in the main game.Leliana’s Song: a nice little campaign, in which you play as Lelian - one of your companions in the main game. It tells the events before Lelian became a sister of the Chantry.The Darkspawn Chronicles: a what-if scenario, where you play as a darkspawn warrior and try to destroy the grey wardens of Ferelden. It’s short, boring and feels like a fan made content.The Golems of Amgarrak: just as boring as the Darkspawn Chronicles, with annoying backtracking and particularly difficult combat.Awakening: the best expansion of all. Just as interesting as the main game. The events take place after the main game. This DLC raises your level cap from 25 to 35, it expands your skill set, specialisation options and has better equipment and unique items. Unfortunately, there are quite a few bugs in Awakening, which prevent you from completing certain quests. I had to use third party patches on more than one occasion.So, to sum up, DAO + Awakening is an epic RPG with great and engaging story. If you are a fan of RPGs, this game is definitely for you. Unfortunately, DAO has all the typical RPG flaws, as well. Because of the overwhelming amount of the content, it is better to take breaks from this game, before you finish it. The Ultimate Edition is highly recommended.My overall rating: 8/10. P.S. I played the game on Origin (130 hours), therefore, the short gameplay time on Steam. You can use your Steam key to activate DAO on Origin.			"

												I'm a grandmother and often simply cannot keep up with many of the fast paced action games out there. However, with the pause capability and the ability to move every character to where I want them is perfect for me. Also the fact it let's me make my own danged decisions counts as well (well most of them...there are some it steers me into without mercy). I admit that I usually play at normal with a few drops into casual which enables me to enjoy the game even more. The fact that I can do that is  a plus, instead of doing a battle over and over until I win  (not that I haven't done that) or worse, be forced to give up. This game is like immersing oneself into a rich story that one mostly controls. Not that fate won't have it's say now and again. A thing that is all to the good. Like the building games I adore, you place one brick after another, each time hoping it's the right brick, and watch your creation expand and grow. Don't get complacent though, as any of your bricks/comments can cause a totally unexpected reaction. I say go for it and enjoy!			"

												Electronic Arts Dragon Age: Origins RPG is for its time a breakthrough for a RPG game.  The Good1)  Play one of three different races, each having a different story line. This is presented at the start of your story.2)  Play one of three classes, Warrior, Rouge, or Mage.  At a higher level the class you choose can be improved to have skills like for example (Holy Smite) for the Warrior class.3)  What you choose to say for your Gray Warden will effect your RPC group and the story outcome.4)  Many quests during the Main story and side quests. To gain coin, favor from RPC's and loot.5)  Have a relationship either male, female, or both! Naughty Naughty!6)  Mixing your group. You can mix and match as much as you want between RPC in your party.The not so Good1) Plot never changes so if you complete the Story at Normal level and play again at Hard level (Ho Hum) you already know what to do.  Of course it may take a long period of time to defeat the Archdeamon's army.2)  What? my (Gray Warden) is a mute? Kinda,  It would have been better to have him/her speak the sentence you have choosen.  When you choose a action for the (Gray Warden) it is acted out during the game.3) Weapons and Armor stay fresh and new, it would have been interesting to have items get worn or become damaged.The game is addictive if you a first time player or return to it after a while.  What is nice with the Ultimate edition is that after you play the main story you can transfer your (Gray Warden) to one of the other stories to start another adventure. "

												One of the most fun games I've ever played. It came out in 2009 or so and I played it in 2017. The best way I can explain it is this: it hasn't the greatest story ever, nor the greatest RPG system ever, nor the prettiest graphics by today's standards, not the best design or a sprawling open world (which all the cool RPGs must have these days).But it succeds by combining good elements from other great RPG's into a fantastic streamlined experience. I had a great time without ever feeling like I was ""grinding"", there was never a dull moment even though the settings were somewhat familiar from other great and original RPG's or movies. Also, Awakening is a brilliant expansion. I can see why people have hundreds of hours played on this game. Highly recommend it.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played.  I usually can't play through a story based RPG game more than once, but I played this one 4 times all the way through and a bunch more just for origin stories.Origins means there are many different introductory storylines depending on the race/class you pick (6 in total I believe) that all have different starting stories which integrate into the main story.  It's so engrossing that characters you meet later on while playing an Elf are characters that belong to other race/class' origin stories and vice versa.  There are so many fine details to the story this way, and you have a chance to manipulate everything based on your actions and outcomes of choices.On top of the grand story comes gameplay.  It's a classic RPG style (like Baldur's Gate), but with modern enhancements and features so that it doesn't feel ancient or clunky.  The combat is pausable and strategic, not arcade-like.			"

												This game has immense replay value with all the character origins and Player choices.  The Companions are interesting, in-depth and well-written, and voice acting is top notch.  I found the level design a bit bland, however, and it's quite a lengthy first portion before you get to the ""open world"" part.  Very rich lore, and I'd recommend to any fantasy fan.			"

												I love this game! It runs fine on my laptop with an Intel graphics card. It has great replayability because of how your choices can change the outcome of sidequests (even a few of the major events) and your character is so customizable, I felt so immersed in the story. I would reccomend this game to anyone. I bought it for the full price, and it went on sale about a week later. I wasn't even dissapointed because I enjoyed it so much I was glad to play it right away, and had I known a sale was in the near future, I still probably wouldn't have waited!			"

												This game is defintly one of the best games i've ever played and one of my favourites (if not my favourite). The gameplay is great, second to none, the storyline coundn't be anybetter BioWare really knows how to pull it off as shown in also in their Mass Effect Series. The storyline does well to get you attached to the game by making the descions that you make effect how the story pans out for you for the rest of the game and its expansions (classic BioWare tho i must note). The chat dialouges and cutscenes are always dramatic and never cease to bore you and always seem to add to the drama and hype of the already superb Storyline, the quests are never boring and their are endless side quests to do besides the storyline, this game will last you weeks on end.The characters in this game are represented very well, with so many different personallities in the game you are never left short from any chat dialogue. As for things to do other than questes you can't fall short, Poison Making, Trap Making, Tactics, Enchanting, Gathering and much more, I'm sure you wouldn't run out of things to do. As far as i am concerned i have not come across any glitchs or problems though bearing in mind it is a game and i am sure i will encounter one soon enough. I would recomend this game to anyone that really likes RPG games that have a great storyline and good feel overall to the gameplay, this game is like all the good things from The Elder Scrolls Series and The Diablo Series put together it is just great and i cannot stop playing it, best $7.50 i've ever spent and I would be willing to pay the actual price of around $20-$30 for this game because it is worth every cent you pay for. Had this game not gone on sale i would've never bought it, hats off to Valve for putting this game on sale and getting this gem out of the rough. Everyone NEEDS to get this game, you'll regret not getting it.			"

												The first videogame I ever played that made me cry. One of the absolute first PC games I ever owned too. It sat in my library for months upon months until I thought one day ""Why not?"" and I can honestly say without a doubt that after that first time playing it changed the way I saw videogames forever. They weren't hack and slash games for fun, something to pass the time and win achievements in. Oh, no. They were stories, worlds waiting to unfurl at your fingertips of heroes, lost histories, forbidden myths, and characters that stay in your heart forever. Little did I know that by giving this game a chance despite the older graphics that I would come to fall in love with the characters and come to follow the series for years to come. If you ever ger into the series, I 100% reccomend the books which are prequels and sequels to the games and really help bring this amazing world to life. Also if you want insight on Duncan and Loghain, the first two books make you see those characters in an entirely new light.Overall, this will forever be one of my favorite game series, something I can keep coming back to--to meet the characters and explore the world once more... and fall in love with them all over again.

												Great fun! Dragon Age has you taking on the role of the newest Grey Warden, travelling the lands of Ferelden recruiting allies to fight against a new blight of Darkspawn - a blight not taken seriously by others in the kingdom. This game is definitely the spiritual successor of the Baldur's Gate series, with a deep, complex storyline that twists and shapes according to your choices as the Warden. The excellent writing and voice acting keep the game feeling fresh; I thought the humourous exchanges between different party members were particularly fantastic. I've enjoyed Dragon Age immensely so far and would strongly recommend it to fans of roleplaying games, fantasy settings and those who love a compelling story.			"

												When i bought dragon age: origins, i did not expect to fall so much for it. I mean there's not exactly anything that somehow hasn't been done before, right? And yet, this game is captivating. My first run i completed playing all the time, sitting there til late (or early, looking at it other way) hours, unable to leave Ferelden and telling myself ""wow, just one more quest, and then talk with that character, and..."". And now i have completed the main story around 6 times, plus a couple of runs of awakening and other extensions. Had just as much fun every time. Having both a captivating plot and good gameplay, DAO is a good choice for both people who are story oriented and gameplay oriented. If you arent very good at games (like me), easy setting is there for you and you can complete the game fairly easy. If you are up for a challenge, you have harder settings too. What is important for me in Origins are characters. They feel so alive and make you feel you are a part of the game. Even side characters or villains are interesting and captivating. At first i didnt expect to love so many characters, but there i am, hoping more of them would be romanceable... Customization of your character is rather well too, although it could be better. Nothing you cant fix with mods - theres plenty of them, whatever you may need. Graphics are obviously slighly outdated, though personally i prefer them more than the wow-so-hd graphics in newest games, but thats just my preference. Locations are nice to look at, though. The best part is probably how much your choices change the game - maybe not exactly all of them turn it around, but i think that many small remarks showing how much changes depending who you play or what you have done are nicer. Not to say that there arent many important decisions - you can decide fate of your companions, more or less, decide who is going to be crowned and many other things that are probably spoilers. tl;dr: give DAO a shot. There is a reason why DA games got popular.			"

												From the makers of ""Mass Effect"" and ""Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: franchises, comes another RPG set in a fantasy world. First off, this game is massive, even the base game with no DLC, you will spend about 30 hours completing it, more if you do all the sidequests, explore everywhere, and do DLC missions. This isn't counting the other 4 campaigns you can get (get to that in a minute).You start off as...well, that's the thing - when you start your game you will be asked to choose gender, race...and then backstory. That's right, backstory - each race gets different backstories, but also multiple backstories within each race. You only get access to 2 the first playthrough, I imagine the others unluck after. Each backstory is unique, making replay value on at least the origin stories pretty high.The game is very old school sort of RPG, and it plays like an MMO in terms of the attack (you press a button, they do the work, you sort of micromanage), and the different abilities on a taskbar at the bottom. The story is quite good, lots of backstory for the world, codex's to unlock if you want to know more (a bit like Mass Effect did), and many people to talk to. Your companions are varied as well, each with their own unique character and personality to bring, along with races/classes etc, so you are encouraged to bring them along and see how you like them, and talk to them to get to know them, even romance them if you wish. Another thing is random dialouge that appears as you are just walking around as the characters interact with each other, and given the variables of who is mixed with whom, there's bound to be hours of it.The DLC is mostly very good, and if you get this game, get it on sale and get the Ultimate Edition for sure - Awakening is a full length add-on that brings back some old characters, introduces new ones, and will take anywhere from 10-13 hours depending on how you play, so it is a full game, and every place you go is new as well. The others are fairly short, about 1-2 hours in length. The ""Golems"" one wasn't that entertaining, but was worth one playthrough, the others were enjoyable for what they were, including a ""What If?"" campaign where you play as the bad guys. In the end, if you enjoyed Mass Effect or KOTOR, or just enjoy good RPGS with a good story, fun characters and lots of variety, check this out - as you can see by my playtime it took almost 50 hours, and I had played the game before on the Xbox, so I sort of knew what I was doing, newcomers may take even longer, but don't rush, just enjoy!

												Depressing as it is to know that this (and Mass Effect 2) were the last good Bioware games, Dragon Age Origins stands as one of my favorite games, considering that it is one of the few games that I can enjoy from start to finish. Pros:-The game contains a great amount of content. You can easily sink 60 hours into the base game-The cast of characters following the protagonist are memorable and well written. In fact, they are about on par with the cast in Knights of the Old Republic-The gameplay is well balanced and may often require you to use your brain, especially in higher difficulty settings-The dialogue is well written, and your character's attributes may determine what you want him or her to say-Each of the 6 different origin stories are very entertaining, and even offer a degree of replay value-Your choices in the game actually have an affect on the outcome of the story and are far from black/white, as a cunning player may find a compromise if all the availible options are assessed-The soundtrack fits the mood quite well, though (aside from a few tracks) there's none that really stand out to the point where I'd go out of my way to listen to itCons:-There are difficulty spikes in certain areas of the game-The tedious fade section-The extremely akward romance scenes-Magic can be quite over powered to the point where it takes only one mage to influence the outcome of the fight-Although the Player Character can do some very horrible things, there isn't exactly an ""evil"" endingVerdict:Dragon Age Origins is an extremely entertaining role playing game that offers a vast amount of content. If you are a fan of Bioware games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not playing this. If I had to rate the game, I'd give it a 9/10.			"

												Boy, what a ride.I've probably got about 100 hours total in the game, played it across 6 playthroughs and used another launcher when I had a bug with the original. The game is one of the best examples of RPGs I can give. It's party-based, tactical gameplay while not skimping a bit on the story. It's engaging, thrilling and truthfully one of the best games I've had the pleasure of playing. It creates some memorable characters and gives you a somewhat typical fantasy setting but weaves this interesting world out of old cliches. Companions, like most BioWare games, can really steal the show. You'll laugh, you'll shed a few tears, you'll love every second of the random banter, private conversations, and more with the companions you recruit and play through the game with. They've all got various ideas of morality and feelings towards any of the given major situations as the game plays out. You feel like you're with another person, not another sword/pack mule that swings at people. It has it's shortcomings in the technical department, and it's age is certainly prevelant, but I think it remains timeless in how fun it is to play.Do yourself a favor and buy it, and if you enjoy this one, there's two others to play.

												Dragon Age: Origins is one of those rare games which profess to offer a deep, meaningful degree of choice and then truly deliver on that claim. Here you will create your protagonist and forge a clearer picture of just who they are with every decision they/you make.But they won't be going it alone. A handful of diverse companions will become available as you progress, each with their own agendas and intricacies. The campfire conversations had with this bunch are among the most memorable in the game.The gameplay is also worth noting. The selection of abilities available as characters level up means that two of the same class can be made to suit very different roles, allowing multiple playthroughs to feel genuinely unique. Combat against large numbers of powerful enemies can result in some very satisfying use of the tactical options to achieve victory, particularly in the higher difficulty settings.The story's central conceit -- a shattered kingdom under siege by a great and powerful darkness -- is incredibly well written, and sets up countless opportunities for the protagonist to make defining moral choices. It may not sound particularly imaginative, but BioWare have done a stellar job at making this trite fantasy framework their own.To summarise: Dragon Age: Origins is absolutely not one to miss.			"

												I just started playing this game again after I got a little bored with Skyrim and Eve Online.Dragon Age: Origins is an amazing game.  It's graphics have withstood the test of time, and the story has a way of still feeling fresh: even though I am playing as an elf rogue, again, the number of choices that affect the outcome make it feel like a completely new experience.  The only real complaint I have is that the camera controls are a little dodgy at times, but this is a minor gripe and it has not deterred me.Bottom line: if you're are currently on a budget and want to experience an amazing RPG with deep lore, strategic combat, and an amazing story, then you should buy this now.  If you are really on a budget, put it on your wishlist and buy it when it is on sale.			"

												Recommend? Yes indeed. If you like old school rpg games. For those that dont like to read, plz stop now lol.Will say that other users who commented on the single version DAO are right when they say there is less content in comparison to other old school rpg's. Weapons, clothing, armors are limited but can be compensated through a mod that allows you to craft ur own items. Storyline is great, I have played the game before it came on steam and will say like so many others have played at least over 15 times. The race origins gives a lot of replay value, since certain storyline characters and items can only unlocked through that specific origin. Every origin also contributes a different game ending and influence on the post game world. Many mods available to influence this. Lot of lore to read for those that realy want to get everything out of the story, not as much as in TES4 Oblivion (good god) but still more than enough.One may argue the classes available for choice are limited to only 3 classic classes being: warrior, rogue and mage. Then again this is compensated with specialisations or if you want to translate into d&d language: multiclassing and yes with no pentalty. These classes are sometimes unlocked through relations with companions (regular no romance) and sometimes by purchasing manuals of that class or making certain decissions during the storyline that allow you to obtain said class. U can also choose what type of class u will get through levelling, meaning to say for example: a warrior u can choose to invest in two handed skills,  sword and shield skills and supportive skills, allowing u to build the type of character u want. Also the same with companions so u can shape ur party just the way u like it.Once again, lot of replay value.Storyline is pretty much rpg classic, first starting out not knowing what is happening, struggling through the story halfway, getting better, and in the end be the hero and save everything. Great storyline with almost every classic element you could wish for. This being a game that unlike many others, combines graphics and a good story line. Battlesystem in the early going can be a lil confusing but if you have played these type of games before, no sweat. For everyone something, storyquest about mages, elves, dwarves, the holy grail (has other name in game), and the corruptive nature of men, could have been LOTR if that hadnt come out sooner.Character companions are also very varied, going from those with noble origins to common crooks and murders, drunk warriors and a stoic giant who just likes to be sarcastic and put everyone down. Good thing is that they have written these characters in a way that any player can certainly recognise one self with fragments of those characters' story. Every companion also has a personal quest that allows the player to greatly enhance their relation with said companion. Other ways are to give them presents. With higher relations comes that companions get a specific bonus to their stats. (for example, +strentgh for warrior, +willpower for mage, and so on.)Few bugs that remain unsolved with certain side quests but those can easily be undone, plenty of reading material on the net on those right now.Awakening: good storyline once again allthough I will say that it is somewhat short in comparison to the original campaign. To say when it launched: they stated that origins would give the player over 70 - 80 hours in game to complete, in comparison Awakening was announced as having a even larger amount of space to explore then the original but with only between 20 - 30 hours of game time to complete, they may have run a lil short on that one, but in the end is it worth it? Oh yes. Is launched in game as a separate campaingn so doesnt go along with the main campaign, but like the main campaign also has an epilogue showing the result of the player choices made during his/her progress. New things, few new materials, few new companions, and guess what you become senechal (local lord) of your own keep and can judge people (comes back in DA Inquistion, spoiler).The rest of the dlc in short:Return to ostagar: adds background story and closure for the Alistair companion of the main campaign.Leliana's song: gives u a backgroundstory on the Leliana companion of the main campaign.Witchhunt: give prequel story to what Morrigan has possibly planned for the events in DA Inquisition(spoiler)Stone Prisoner: Gives u an additional companion through a short storyline (comparable to Zaeed in ME2 or Jarvik in ME3)Golems of Amgarrak: Dwarven history (lotr compare, in the end balrog like battle) and for me the hardest to play, lot of puzzles and difficult battles.Warden's Keep: Discover the sinister origins of a merchant family and in the process claim a castle for urself to enjoy. Darkspawn Chronicles: Play as the enemy, invade, pillage, burn...leave none alive.In short (ironic I know): Is it worth getting, no question, eventhough it has a few flaws here and there ramaining, everything else you get more then compensates for it. And for me one of the best rpg's I have ever played. Will certainly not dissapoint.			"

												Still my favorite Dragon Age game of all time, even over Inquisition. (And favorite game of all time probably). -My Warden flirted with absolutely everyone, even some random village girl who kissed his cheek-Was a sarcastic snot toward the king without consequence-Insulted an old lady whenever he had the chance-Fought Gaxkang and got stuck in the wall, the ceiling AND the floor. -Couldn't even bomb self to get killed, forced to return to a different save or live in a wall/ceiling/floor forever.-Alistair somehow lost his face and had it morph back into his empty templar armored shell of a body during a cutscene-Warden somehow fell through the floor in Orzammar, died and then came back.-Warden also died during Shale's quest by falling into a water pool that should have been impossible to reach, and somehow resurrected himself to start fighting the last boss of the quest alone. -Made Alistair extremely uncomfortable with lamppost licking conversations -Warden consistently outlived Alistair as the tankiest rogue that has probably ever existed -Consistently made forward comments toward every camp member possible with zero regrets-Made terrible life choices that effected the entire country -Gave zero ♥♥♥♥s doing so-Repeatedly trolled Justice with the silvertongue perk -Enabled Anders' cat addiction -Sadly glitches were fixed after the character completed the game but honestly the glitches made my score a solid 10/10 for amusement factor alone. Have never had another character I enjoyed half as much. ** (this character was made when the game first came out) Highly recommended. Great characters, diverse maps, and interesting storylines. Only cons: The Brecilian forest exists.Edit: Also recommended this game for an award too!			"

												Don't let the few hours played fool you - I have a full playthrough and then some on a non-steam version.This is truly a great game - it offers several different stories and events, and what you do can really effect the later ongoings.A good and long story makes this one of the best RPGs the last 10 years. The story clocks in between 40 and 70 hours, depending on how many of the branching stories you wish to explore (and how long you take doing that). Add in epic monsters, multiple followers (all with their own personality), and mountains of loot, and you have a winning combination.			"

												Hello DA, My old friend..... It's been a while since our paths last crossed, but despite that I have decided to play as a elf mage. A class and race I have never done together.So far it has been fab! It's like a new game, even if the graphics are dated, the story is there and (to be honest) it's like I just had a bit of a holiday.Duncan (bless him) is still out for new blood. I'm ignoring him for now, exploring the mage tower as it was before the blight. A few familiar faces and some new ones, no doubt will be regretted later, as most friendships are in DA.I am determined to see this playthrough to the end, as I want to take my char into DA 2, before eventually playing Inquisition, hopefully before I get to 60 lol.

The story line is excellent, moving and exciting and the potential for character interaction and development is impressive. 3+ unique beginnings and freedom in how you play your role in the world; different classes, moralities, approaches. This is no 'open world' but the freedom of choices and strategies is better than this; A great title to rival its contemporary 'The Witcher'			"

												This is the perfect game for anyone who likes tactical games as well as in-depth RPGs and especially for those who like romances and of course, especially for someone who like all three. The battles allow you to pause and give all of your party members orders, such as telling them to move to a certain position on the field or to use a certain skill in battle. Among other things, you can also place traps and use poisons or other items to exploit certain weaknesses. At first, combat may be a little difficult with getting used to the controls and such but it then gets a little easier, to the point you can play without pausing but be warned - the difficulty does go up again soon afterwards, there are many battles you won't win without pausing and thinking about how your party should be reacting to the situation. * You can also set automated tactics for each party member, including your own character, for when you're not controlling them.This is the type of game that actually gets you interested in the lore around it - I know I personally have issues getting into the lore in a lot of games, but it just kind of sucked me in. The world feels so complete that you'll want to learn everything you can. As far as RPG goes, you play a silent protagonist of your choice (several different options, such as a run away bride or a nobleman) and make decisions that will impact your entire game, as well as Dragon Age 2 if you choose to play that as well. There are three or four main endings but keep in mind they are all of a similar premise so do not expect something like one of the alternate Silent Hill endings with aliens.The characters are extremely engaging and varied in personality. They even react uniquely to each other - some hating or liking others. You get to see these reactions either in the form of banter while traveling, as an aside when you're having a conversation with another character in public(wandering) or even with certain character combinations in scenes. It is also possible to somewhat shape their personalities to the extent of continuing to be who they are or becoming ""stronger"" socially.As far as romance goes, you'll have three choices per character. Two opposite gender characters and one same sex, with only one of the opposite gender characters changing per your gender, so that's two male and one female for a female character and two female and one male for a male character. Each of these romances are quite deep and you see significant character development, possible more-so of three of the four though. The main two gender-locked romances will affect the story the most if you continue them to the end of the game. One thing to note, is that the romances suffer from sex as a sort of finale, and only the two main gender-locked relationships will continue story-wise afterwards. The other two do not end, but do not have anymore significant scenes.Overall, a fantastic game that'll keep you entertained for days. I've done two complete playthroughs so far and am going to get all the achievements and then play a few more playthroughs - totally not tired of this game! Each playthrough is interesting and generally unique.			"

												I played this game on Xbox a while back and just recently purchased it for Steam. I absolutely love this game and many of the other BioWare titles. The only complaint I have (if you would call it one) is that it took me a little bit to get used to the control and UI for the computer version. But, it did not cause too much of a hinderance and I was still able to enjoy the game in all of its glory.I feel that it is definitely worth trying, especially if you are looking for a good RPG to play.

   My Playthrough   Youtube Playlist    The Review Dragon Age: Origins as it stands is one of my all time favorite RPGs. This game succeeds at so many points. The game has a great story, setting, gameplay, characters, and mod support. I love the setting of thedas as it has so much potential for stories that can span multiple games. The great characters are what really help this game stands out from other similar RPGs. Every character is memorable, from the companions to the NPCs. Every companion is a 3 dimensional characters. And if you personally dislike a companion you will never find yourself outright hating them. The gameplay is very much like that of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic which is also a very good game. But the by far best aspect of this game is the story. You can choose from multiple origins, races, and classes. And these choices and the choices made during the main quest makes each playthrough different. This is one of the few games that I played through more then 20 times. The downloadable content add much more hours of gameplay plus with the mod support this game gets even more hours of replay value. This is by far one of the best RPGs I played and I can't recommend it enough.  "

Witches Don't Wear Bras - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Swords and junk are pretty cool. When I was little I liked to pretend that sticks were swords and swing them at the kids on the bus stop that I didn't like. They always said to watch out or I'd poke their eyes out. But I showed them. Oh, I showed them. Little did I know, that was little baby Waffle King's first little foray into the world of roleplaying games. I could be whatever I wanted, and I could wield powerful weapons beyond your imagination. Like those perfect sticks that make whistling noises when you swing them.As I grew older, of course RPG games would be a genre I got pulled back to time and time again. But in this day and age, true roleplaying games have become harder to come by. The big guys upstairs, the game publishers that control what we play, they don't want those. Because you know what, those games are hard. They're really hard. Making choices is hard. Consequences are hard. It's so much easier if you can just mash buttons and make things happen. And if you want to learn every skill? You can do that. It's okay.Hardcore RPG's aren't a genre that's explored often by big publishers. They're a niche type of game. One of the biggest developers of RPG's of that nature, Bioware, is still around. But sadly, there's a lot of corporate fingers in their ♥♥♥.They've made some of the greatest RPG classics. And some other games. Those were alright. Even after being acquired by EA, they still put out a number of quality games. Before, you know. It happened. RIP.Dragon Tales Origins was one of the first games to come out under the new EA and Bioware partnership, launching on Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and PC; it's a spiritual successor to Neverwinter Nights and the acclaimed Baldur's Gate games.Ever watch that one movie Lord of the Rings? Kinda like that, only you get to bang a witch.She doesn't really wear clothes or anything. She has some shower curtains or something over her shoulder.Dragon Tales is a pretty good game. A hardcore tactical strategy RPG, with an emphasis on the roleplaying aspect. You become the guy with the sword that does the things. You are him or her. You get to bang that witch and save the world. It's all you, buddy.A grand tale of zombies and witch ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, Dragon Tales Origins is extremely heavy with lore. They really went all out trying to build this fantasy world. They got the elves, the dwarves, and all that good stuff. Completely original lore, totally not just Lord of the Rings with some things switched around. In fact, they were so proud of their work they even went and named it Origins. They were planning ahead. They already knew it was gonna be big. They were gonna make a series out of it from the very beginning. And ♥♥♥♥, they really wrote a ♥♥♥♥ing book. It's a book, a book with some RPG elements mixed in. I didn't pay attention in History class, the ♥♥♥♥ you think I'm gonna memorize the lore of Dragon Tales for?It's written well at least, and the characters are a joy to be around. They're colorful and multi-dimensional, and you can sex them all up. Not all at once, they get mad at you for trying to do that. Which is definitely holding me back from giving the game a perfect score. You can even do gay things in Origins, one of the defining features that made it so popular with the Tumblr crowd. You can gay things up, and that is clearly what gay people look for most in their games. They're mostly awkward teenage girls actually, they love gay sex more than actual gay people. But you know, this is exactly what they look for in a game and they're free to like what they like.Writing would be what I'd say is Dragon Tales' best trait. It's visually a little dated, with a pretty good soundtrack. But the writing, ooh wee, that's some good swords and magic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. An RPG like Origins thrives on writing, though. It's all about pulling you in, letting you live the role of a dude with a sword in a medieval setting.The only problem with this setup is that the game mechanics aren't quite welcoming to the whole swords thing. In fact, I really wouldn't recommend using swords at all. Just don't, for your own good.You get to build your own character and assign them one of several backstories, races, and classes. It encourages you to make many different characters, to see the story from different angles and to make different choices to see the outcome should you have made one choice instead of the other. But what the game fails to encourage is using any class other than mage. Really, the mage is the best thing to play and is the only thing I'd recommend.A knight or warrior's job is to walk into monsters and take up space while mages attack and heal. Rogues are fun also, allowing you free rein over the battlefield to just kinda walk around, stab guys in the back, and all that good stuff. But mages get the most cool things to use. Exploding lightning, blizzards, and summoning giant spiders and ♥♥♥♥. It's the definitive way to play this game by a long shot. Not to mention how poorly balanced they are. If you're fighting enemies and there's an enemy mage, you gun for that guy first because he can crush your entire party in no time. And it's the exact same vice versa. So you're gonna want to take good care of your mage.You get to order your party members around as well, so if you do choose to make your main character something other than the best class in the game you can always just play as ♥♥♥♥♥ witch. Who is the best character in the game.Ordering around your allies isn't exactly optional however. They don't really have much in terms of AI. Their default tactics are to headbutt monsters while singing the U.S. National Anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner. Classic song, great song. But it helps out much more if you can command them to fight strategically. You have to pretty much program them through a bunch of clunky menus, which is my favorite thing in a game. You know me, I like my menus how I like that ♥♥♥. Hard to handle and all over the place. If it takes me less than ten minutes to get from Point A to Point B, it just isn't clunky enough. I want to spend hours trying to work that ♥♥♥. Menus and asses like that are a true work of perfection and are the clear indicator of brilliant game design. Swapping between characters on the fly works well if you're gonna fight that way also, but also can be very intensive during major fights.I'd still consider it one of my favorite RPG's, even if it has numerous little flaws and hasn't aged well in some regards. I've enjoyed multiple playthroughs, and it is still fun the second and third time. There's definitely a clear right way to play it, which is as a mage and on PC. Keyboard shortcuts, hotkeys, and the superior camera controls and options really make it the definitive way to play. But it's still decently enjoyable however you should tackle it. PC users have mods though also, so you can see uncensored ♥♥♥♥♥♥s and stuff. That's why people mod stuff in the first place.It's a wordy game, full of reading and numbers and nerd things. But it's immersive and fun, and a testament to Bioware's secret formula to making some of the best RPG's. Well it's not exactly a secret, you just need to be able to sex people, commit genocide, and unite the many tribes to vanquish a great evil that you told everyone was coming and no one listened.Dragon Tales always reminds me of raisins though. When I first played it, I was just kind of marathon-playing it and needed a snack. But there was nothing at all to eat in my house. Nothing but raisins. And it was a giant industrial-size can of raisins too. It had like 100 servings or something. So I just ate raisins while I played. That's all I had. I've learned from my mistakes, and I keep other things stocked up now. You just gotta live and learn, man. Just live and learn.			"

As the first in the Dragon Age series, it somewhat lacks in engaging combat and dazzling graphics, but I must give it credit for what it was in its time.

Sometimes doing the right thing is not the best option, which is why this game can be absolutely visceral. The graphics are a bit dated, but with some artful modding (and there are some fantastic mods out there) and a little imagination, this game is a true adventure.The sheer size of this game is startling. Not in maps (of which there are plenty), but in depth. The characters all have fascinating backstories, but the world itself is what truly shines. The codexes in this are nearly an art form. This is a living, breathing world, where religion, politics, and simple humanity are the most beautiful and poignant characters, rather than the companions that walk with you.			"

												PLAY IT! Well, there is nothing to say about this Game. Everyone should already have played it. Its the best RPG since KotOR - just great! Awesome Origin-Stories that get you straight into the Story, great Combat, great Story, great Characters, great Depth and a lot of choices in a awesome Setting. With Mods it gets even better.If you not already own this Game you have done something very wrong!			"

												I honestly couldn't give this game a better review. The characters are brilliantly dynamic and interesting (ZEVVIEZEVVIEZEVVIE)-- they have personalities and lives; romance subplots actually feel like falling in love, and although gifts can make romance easier, it doesn't feel forced or rushed. The combat, although linear, is engaging.  That story tho. Seriously, the story is amazing. It's exciting and fascinating.Ugh. This game tho. Beautiful 11/10			"

Especially with Inquisition coming out in a couple of months I greatly recommend it.Plus you can mod the begeebers out of it.Extremely story rich with amazing characters, ridiculously uncomfortable looking uderwear and a protag that occasionally emotes!

												Definetly one of Bioware's best games. The plot is good, but not the best part. It's the cast of characters that you meet that makes this journey so worth it. Gameplay wise is some of the best I have seen in a RPG and the combat is quite deep with tactical planning. To conclude, if you want a long RPG or just a good story look no further.			"

												If I were ruler of the world I would make a playthrough of this game mandatory every five years. This is the greatest game ever crafted by humans(in my opinion). The characters have nuances and personality and you get attached and are saddened and one of the endings made me sob. Actually sob. Tears and everything. The lady I always end up macking on is my favorite character in any form of media. The next is the protagonist of this game, in spite of and actually due in part to the fact that the character has no voice, even though you are clearly talking. It's better for immersion. This game has that in spades. It's beautiful and atmospheric and deep and by god it's depressing. It's gritty, serious, dark, gory, sad, and depressing. This game almost constantly beats you over the head with horrid events that make you curl into the fetal position with the brutality. But this backing makes the touching and comical moments stick out more and makes it great. In summary, play it or suffer the consequences.			"

												My favorite rpg of all time. Excluding a few instances of mind boggling tedium (cough cough CIRCLE TOWER/FADE) this game is fun from start to finish. Probably the only time Bioware got the ending to a video game right. Different Origins and a plethora of dialogue options let you create a truly unique character (compared to most other games that is). If you like playing mages then you're in for a treat because I've never felt more powerful and godlike as a magic wielding badass. I won't say not to follow up and get Dragon age 2 and Inquisition but be warned that they are nothing compared to this game so temper your expectations.9/10			"

I love the combat, and the many options available make replaying also quite alot of fun. The best thing about Dragon Age is the voiceacting.OMFG.Such wonderful banter between teamates, and so well done. Do yourself a favor and add different teamates, switch it up when you can, because they all have so many lines and interactions it is well worth itAs a lifelong gamer, I have played hundreds of rpgs dating back to the original ultima series in the early 80's. this is one of my top 3.

												Dragon Age: Origins was the game that set the bar for me when it comes to fantasty RPGs. It is, without a doubt, one of my favorite games ever. The story is compelling, extremely dark and well-thought through. There wasn't a moment when I felt the game was bad, even if it has a few frustrating parts. It takes you on an incredible journey and let's you make very hard decisions along the way. Even though the combat can feel a little clunky at times, it doesn't hurt the rest of the game. You have intriguing companions and interesting ways to expand your friendships with them. It has great replay value if you are interested to see how the game's world will treat you as a different race, class and with different choices. I recommend this game 110%.			"

												I overall enjoyed this game and consider it Bioware's swan song. The origin story chosen by the player impacts not only your dialogue options, but also the level of classism and fantastical racism encountered. The female Dalish elf has few rights, lives in poverty(walled off segregated part of the city), and gets taken to be a mistress for the local noble. She has little social mobility and only gets out of her scenario from being enlisted by the Gray Wardens. There is no social justice, only results matter from her actions afterward. This provided for me a sense of agency in my actions versus being dropped into say roleplaying as Geralt of Rivia in the Witcher series. The Noble female noble’s story is also one of revenge. Yet she can still do more. She can by my count simultaneously be: Queen consort of Fereldan, Teyrna of Gwaren, the second in line heir to Highever, Commander of the Grey in Fereldan, and Arlessa of Amaranthine. That is like... Michelle Obama if she was also Governor of Florida, heir of California, and Mayor of New York City and Marshal General of all the armed forces. There are many origins but only one Duncan to help that origin character. The others origin characters are dead if they do not get enlisted. The player can encounter the Dwarf commoner’s corpse in a part of the plot. With no Duncan to enlist him, he refuses to eat and thus dies in prison. The format of the vanilla campaign follows the usual Bioware formula. The main character must travel to four locations, solve the local issues and convince that faction to help in the final battle. You are hunted by the darkspawn and will encounter a vision/dream sequence with the big bad. As you travel you will encounter the ruins of an ancient civilization (lost dwarven thaigs/Prothiens/Underdark) lost over time yet full of artifact tier items and lore. The gameplay is similar to Baldur’s gate but does not rely on the daily spell count limit of D&D gameplay. Mages are far stronger than many other classes for regular enemies. With some exceptions such as the Gaxkang lich battle. This game reminded me of Baldur’s Gate a lot. If the Warden badly handles decisions, party members will leave the party and even challenge you for leadership. The backgrounds of the characters should be considered in your political dealings. During the Landsmeet, if you arranged for Anora and Alistair to marry it can backfire if you let Loghain live and join the order to redeem himself. To conscript Loghain into the Wardens will make Alistair furious. To Alistair, joining the Grey Wardens is a sacred duty and honor, it is not a death sentence. By contrast, if you let Alistair execute Logain, Anora will break down the political alliance as she cannot marry the killer of her father. What I found charming in this game was the fact that character interactions and growth seems to happen naturally. Alistair’s reception to mages was something I felt was handled very well. His early training was that of a Templar, a role sworn to strike down mages if they are taken over by demons of the Fade. Yet Alistair is scared of Morrigan and neutral to Wynne. At first glance you may think he hates all mages. But the reason he distrusts Morrigan so much is not just because she is a mage. Rather the issue is that Morrigan is a maleficar, someone outside of the rules of the Chantry. She practices unknown magic (shapeshifting, is neutral to blood magic rituals, etc) that he has been taught all of his life is evil and wrong. He is actually terrified of her.			"

												This is one of the last BIoWare games that *felt* like a BioWare game after their acquisition by Electronic Arts. It is a RTwP RPG with a pretty average main plot, but what makes it shine is the excellent writing and personalities of the companions you pick up on your adventure to stop the big-bad. If you play this game the right way, you will grow attached to the characters after spending 20-40 hours killing monsters with them, learning about their past, goals and desires along the way. Each character is distinct from one another, and fleshed out to make you really care about their ultimate fate. That doesn't stop you from being a complete scum bag to them, which yeilds its own rewards in the form of comedy (At least for me)The combat system is accessible, but not simplistic enough that you can go into each battle and not use tactics, (Not on higher difficulty settings at least).  Some battles require a great deal of thinking in order to devise the perfect strategy to take down a large group of enemies, or a tough boss. There are a large number of skills and talents to learn as you level up, as well as 3 different classes to choose from (Rogue, Mage, Warrior) which each have a few of their own sub-classes called specializations which also hold different abilities to learn, which makes the game extremely replayable right off the bat, even if there weren't multiple ending (Which there are). But there are also different Origin stories, as the title suggests. Dwarven Noble, Dwarven Commoner, Dalish Elf, City Elf, Human Noble and Circle Mage, which adds even more replayability since each origin story and race choice changes certain dialogues, the opening act and even certain missions down the road.Those who can't get enough swag will be delighted to know that there are plenty of epic armor, weapons and other loots to be found here to slaughter things with, which makes it a pleasure to play if you can't get enough of the cosmetic side of RPGs. The only thing I have a problem with is that the mage class has a very limited selection of rather boring robes to sport, and that is disappointing. There are also plenty of sidequests to complete over the course of your adventure, which range from dull fetch quests to epic dragon slaying.So in conclusion, the game is quite good. The characters are memorable, the combat is fun and challenging, plenty of armor and weapons to choose from, multiple endings and hours of content to play. It is well worth the money, in my opinion.That is all. "

												Brilliant game. Excellent choice&consequence, extensive lore, solid RPG mechanics and combat, though held back a lot by over-reliance on the MMO healer-tank-DPS archetype, instead of sticking with the D&D mechanics that made Baldur's Gate great. But still, the combat is engaging and never too easy. A lot of content also - 54 hours in and I have only completed the main game; I still have to do all the DLCs as well as the expansion pack Awakening. Dragon Age: Origins was probably one of the best RPGs in the few years before and after its release. It's a shame about the sequels because Bioware could have turned this franchise into something truly great. Origins looks, feels, and plays like a cRPG, and was developed primarily for PC, but its sequels had a console audience in mind and it shows. The squandered potential of Dragon Age is just one more thing EA has run into the ground. "

												One of my favourite RPGs ever - I strongly recommend this! (Not so much Dragon Age 2, although it was worth a playthrough.) There are plenty of ways to play Dragon Age: Origins which makes every new character just as interesting as your previous one. By in-depth conversations, you can choose to dive as deep into lore as you want - or ignore it and just go for gameplay. Romancing is another option that creates a deeper, believable bond between you and your significant other and/or party members. Just definitely a great game, and the Ultimate Edition gives you access to all of the DLCs which are highly entertaining as well. :)			"

												Graphically this game is starting to show it's age (this can be somewhat compensated for however with mods), but despite some awkward animation here and there it still looks beautiful and is a joy to play. Of all the Dragon Age games I'd say that Dragon Age: Origins and Awakening are still the best. DA:O offers the most diversity in character creation, roll playing, and character building than in any other Dragon Age game.Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition comes with the main game which will take approximately 60hours to complete if you do everything. It also comes with every piece of purchaseable DLC.-Warden's Keep; travel to Soldiers Peak to discover what happened to cause the Grey Warden's to be exiled from Fereldan 200 years prior to the events of the game (also adds 2 new abilites per class and a storage chest for items)-Stone Prisoner; aquire a Golem companion character named Shale-Lelianna's Song; you play the events that lead to one of your companion character's ending up in the Lothering Chantry (completion unlocks items for Origins/Awakening)-Darkspawn Chronicles; this DLC is a ""what if"" scenario for Fereldan if your character had died just after the prologue (completion unlocks items for Origins/Awakening)-Dragon Age: Awakening; this expansion sees you, or a new character, rebuild the Grey Warden order in Fereldan after the events of Dragon Age: Origins. This expansion alone adds an aditional 30hours playtime at least.-Witch Hunt; find out what happened to Morrigan, one of your key companion characters, after the events of DA:O (completion unlocks items for Origins/Awakening)You can also go to the Bioware website using your EA account to unlock all the promotional items (preorder bonuses and sh*t like that) for free.This game boasts an epic story, memorable characters, and creates the foundation that the other games have used to stand on. The other games have their own epic tales, but they all lack the same kind of urgency you get from playing DA:O and trying to thwart the 5th blight. This game is great value at it's RRP, but if you see it on sale I'd say it's a must buy.			"

I almost thought i flushed a few bucks down the drain when i first entered combat, which is pretty much World of Warcraft´ish autohit (must stand still) and skills only with a pause function and 4+ characters- but i stuck with it a few minutes more and- like i said, couldnt stop. Really well done in my opinion.			"

												Buy it, especially if it is five bucks! DAO is heralded as the best Dragon Age game ever made, having been the only one I've ever played so far I can't compare it to the other Dragon Ages. But I can say from the moment I started this game I am thoroughly impressed with everything it has to offer. I keep thinking wow Skyrim came out two years after this?? The facial animations are amazing as are the million dialogue options to choose from. The dialogue has more depth than Mass Effect even! I used to own DAO on hardcopy back in the day and paid over 10x more than I did here LOL. So yup if you like strategy and rpg this would be a GREAT thing to add to your library! 10/10 for DAO			"

												Graphically this game is starting to show it's age (this can be somewhat compensated for however with mods), but despite some awkward animation here and there it still looks beautiful and is a joy to play. Of all the Dragon Age games I'd say that Dragon Age: Origins and Awakening are still the best. DA:O offers the most diversity in character creation, roll playing, and character building than in any other Dragon Age game.Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition comes with the main game which will take approximately 60hours to complete if you do everything. It also comes with every piece of purchaseable DLC.-Warden's Keep; travel to Soldiers Peak to discover what happened to cause the Grey Warden's to be exiled from Fereldan 200 years prior to the events of the game (also adds 2 new abilites per class and a storage chest for items)-Stone Prisoner; aquire a Golem companion character named Shale-Lelianna's Song; you play the events that lead to one of your companion character's ending up in the Lothering Chantry (completion unlocks items for Origins/Awakening)-Darkspawn Chronicles; this DLC is a ""what if"" scenario for Fereldan if your character had died just after the prologue (completion unlocks items for Origins/Awakening)-Dragon Age: Awakening; this expansion sees you, or a new character, rebuild the Grey Warden order in Fereldan after the events of Dragon Age: Origins. This expansion alone adds an aditional 30hours playtime at least.-Witch Hunt; find out what happened to Morrigan, one of your key companion characters, after the events of DA:O (completion unlocks items for Origins/Awakening)You can also go to the Bioware website using your EA account to unlock all the promotional items (preorder bonuses and sh*t like that) for free.This game boasts an epic story, memorable characters, and creates the foundation that the other games have used to stand on. The other games have their own epic tales, but they all lack the same kind of urgency you get from playing DA:O and trying to thwart the 5th blight. This game is great value at it's RRP, but if you see it on sale I'd say it's a must buy.			"

												I LOVE BioWare RPGs, and I ♥♥♥♥ing -LOVE- Dragon Age: Origins!I first played it on Xbox 360, and then replayed it, and replayed it, seriously about fifteen times (plus every 'origin' story), not to mention all the time spent to unlock certain achievements.The game has a myriad of complex, flawed and ultimately loveable (or loathable) characters, with a consequence (or reward) for your every action. The world is vast, steeped in history and lore, and though the game is set only in the one country, Fereldan, you still get a sense of the larger scheme.The gameplay... It took me a little while to learn the controls on the 360, but I'm finding this time around playing on PC the controls are a little more intuitive. Everything else seems to be the same. Fully customisable tactics for your party members, interchangeable weapons, armour and skills, class specialisations, crafting, healing, set and skill bonuses, auto attack and quick slot skills, and the ability to pause the game in order to issue commands.When I saw the Ultimate Edition on Steam, all bundled together and so damn cheap I knew there was no question, I had to get it!Still the same epic game I fell in love with all those years ago <3			"

												Dragon Age: Origins is one of the BEST games I've ever played.It has it's ""bugs"" and certain times the game would crash before I would save but it didn't matter because I HAD to finish the story. The best part about the game is that you can make choices so you don't just have to do exactly what the game thinks you should do. You unlock different achievements for taking certain paths, you end up having people turn against you, or you completely change the direction of the game; it's absolutely marvelous. You can make characters fall in love, you can make the decision to kill someone or save them. The battle scenes are amazing, the story was so heartfelt, dark, and powerful; I actually remember the game bringing me to tears at one point.I recommend this game for ANYONE who loves a great RPG with a fantasy storyline. It’s like a zombie apocalypse has come to destroy the land and you have to build a team to defeat the them before it’s too late!Brilliant game.			"

												Dragon Age: Origins offers one of the best single-player rpg experiences on th PC. It has a rich and detailed lore surrounding the game world that sets up the stage for your adventures in the game. The main story is also very intriguing and is full of twists and turns that will keep you entertained for the whole ride. It also offers many side-quests that flesh out the world with many unique stories, and every conversation you have reveals more information about the world of Dragon Age. If you love a good fantasy world, than Dragon Age doesn’t fail to disappoint.The story is the traditional Bioware set-up, with a bit of a twist. When you create your character, you get to pick a race, an origin and a gender. Depending on your choices, the characters in the world will treat you differently. More importantly, you play a short 30-60 minute intro story that is unique to your origin. Then there is a 30-60 minute general intro sequence that you play, before the world opens up. You have to travel to multiple different locations, in any order you choose, in order to get different factions to pledge their loyalty to you for a battle against the game’s main enemy, the Darkspawn. Each area you go to have its own problems that you must sort out before they will pledge allegiance to you. Like everything you do in Dragon Age, solving these problems tells you more about the society and world of Dragon Age. The story continues on and ends in a grand finale. The main is very interesting.			"

PROS:+ 6 different origin stories (tied to 3 races & 3 classes)+ epic main campaign+ party banter+ companions & their stories+ TONS of decisions that affect the story+ complex skill tree+ fantastic mod support+ special finishing moves+ superior combat tactics to other DA games+ UE has additional missions inside the main campaign - Warden's Keep, Stone Prisoner, Return to Ostagar+ UE has additional DLC campaigns to main story - Awakening, Golems of Amgarrak, Witch Hunt+ UE has alternate DLC campaigns - Leliana's Song, A Tale of Orzammar, Darkspawn ChroniclesCONS:- some skills can be buggy under certain circumstances- decisions can glitch out when exporting between main campaign and the additional DLC campaigns- couple of promotional DLC items are missing in Ultimate Edition on Steam- majority of the DLC items become useless very early in the campaignComment:I bought this game, again, here on Steam because it is such a good game. I would say one of my favourite games ever.  At first you choose between 3 races - humans, elfs, dwarves and then between 3 classes. Afterwards you get to pick an origin. The six various origins make you start the game at various places and this adds to the roleplay element. Eventually all origin stories continue into the main story at Ostagar, but even after that your origin affects how NPCs react to your character. The main campaign has that epic quest feeling to it and I cannot say much without spoiling. The main premise is a darkspawn invasion led by the archdemon and you are the last hope to stop it. On your way you will pick up companions and solve various side quests ... or you won't, it's your choice. Either way there is a huge amount of content here that will get you playing for many many many hours. That is even expanded upon by the expansion Awakening, DLC Golems of Amgarrak and DLC Witch Hunt ... all of these can share 1 character that you import from the main campaign. The mod support is really really good in this game. It is easy to get into and even I made a mod and helped on some others. This support is a bit worse in DA2 and basically non-existant in DA:Inquisition. And that is a shame because mod support is one of the things that keeps games alive very long and bolsters the fandom around the game itself. The graphics are not as pretty as newer DA games but it still has a certain old RPG charm. And mods can fix a lot of the character models in the game or adjust the look to your liking. EA involvement was already visible here with 2 DLC missions and a DLC companion on game release. Despite that, the DLC feel fun for the most part. I could go on about every campaign and mission available here but it is too much and all you REALLY need to know is that the majority of it is fun and worth playing if you are into RPG games. Enjoy!			"

												If you prefer your RPGs to be story- and character-heavy (at the cost of, say, wide-ranging open-endedness) and party-focused then this is a beautiful game.Some strengths and weaknesses:+ Story.  There's quite a bit of writing in here.  It's mostly serious but there's quite a bit of intentional comedy.  Don't forget the DLCs.   ""Golems of Amgarrak"" wasn't anything special, but ""Leilana's Song"" is a nice short prequel.+ Lots of side quests+ Characters; a number have a good bit of story and personality to them.  Voice acting helps a good deal.+ Decent game flow and control; pause+give orders, cooldowns, limited scripting ability+ Modest system requirements compared to today's hardware, but still pretty+ Mostly quite usable UI; plenty of room for skills on the quick-selection bar, for instance+ Old enough that it's a likely on-sale target, and will be an excellent bargain when that happens+ Range in difficulty settings; if you're playing for the story rather than as a hard-core gam3r l33t, set it to the lowest difficulty and you'll be fine, for instance~ Some flexibility; the story arc is mostly set out, but there's still a fair bit heavily influenced by your choices~ No main-mission timer; you can complete many, many side quests if you wish.  This gives flexibility and allows you to experience more, but some may find it bad for immersion when you're undertaking these and seemingly not treating the Big Bad with as much urgency as it might demand.- Instability; crash bugs, at least if making heavy use of magic- Occasional but sometimes very nasty scripting bugs- Sometimes awkward camera positioning.  There were definitely times I'd wished for having either a true first-person view (rather than over-the-shoulder third), a true straight-down view, and/or transparency controls for walls, arches, etc.- A few notable UI omissions like no estimates of value unless you're at a merchant- Yet another RPG where you can't scribble notes on the map, *sigh*			"

												The game shows its time in development; a lucrative sum of content (roughly 85 hours total invested into one character completing all the DLC), rich and expansive lore, a great character-driven story with great and hilarious characters/interactions as well as a ton of choices that actually feel like they have an impact, and probably the most options I've seen in character builds in any game I've played yet. That said, the game also has some pretty great replay value to it as well if you want to explore everything some more.In a nutshell: Probably some of the most (perhaps among the best) out-of-the-box content you'll find in an RPG for just $30.

It has all the standard Bioware flaws (occasionally flat acting, goofy romance hooks, a story centered around an ancient evil and a prophecy) but also all the charm and memorable characters you get with Bioware, too. It also has some unintended hilarity in the form of a huge, mutant dog (name ""Dog"") who will actually lick the copious blood effects off of your armor after every fight if you ask him. But you never should, because walking around town talking to nobles and merchants soaked in blood after killing a single rat is one of the funniest parts of the game. Well, that and Alistair, becasue he's such a pushover.If you like RPGs or just Bioware romance simulators, grab the Ultimate Edition, especially if it's on sale.			"

												Tired of all those boring, unoriginal RPGs that all look and play the same?  Then this is the game for you!  At first glance it might look like your typical Warrior/Mage/Rogue trio, but it's the specs that really make it different.  Well, maybe not for Warriros and Rogues, but the Mages is where it's at for this game and that, for one reason.Arcane Warriors.  Now this is the ♥♥♥♥.  Hard to play but when played right, will turn your squishy mage into an invincible tank with enough auras and flashy effects to melt your graphics card... along with every enemy unlucky enough to cross your path.Add to that a huge game universe filled to the brim with juicy lore and you've got a game that will easily take you over 100 hours to clear a single playthrough... if you hurry up.

												Dragon Age is a fantastic RPG that lasted longer than I thought it would. I finished it in 40 hours, but it could easily take you 20 hours longer to complete everything.The characters have depth, the story is pretty good, the graphics also still look very good and the gameplay is tight for a 3D RPG. It can be a bit unbalanced at times though, so I had to change the difficulty from time to time in order to advance. It's disappointing but, it never really frustrates. The isometric view is actually very helpful and, in my opinion, works better than the default camera view. I do admit that the default view is the more cinematic one, but for the later battles isometric view is recommended, required even.Dragon Age is a title that I immensely enjoyed. It's one of the better RPGs of the last decade so if RPG is your thing you should definitely play this.(Play the second one as well. Despite the repetitiveness of the environments it's also well worth a playthrough and it's not as bad as people say it is).[Rating: 92/100]			"

												Recommended, but only with reservations.It doesn't run completely stable. I've had it crash several times when opening the party's inventory screen directly after a larger fight in the city of Denerim. Other players have had similar crashes years ago already. The Wiki mentions various bugs in quests and other parts of the game.The game's playtime is long enough, if it's your first playthrough without following any guides/walkthroughs. If you want to rush through the game a single time, note that some guides are controversial.The game's is easy enough at ""Normal"" difficulty, and even more so, if you don't mind reloading an older save from time to time. Such as when you've found out something that's not explained in the manual.The included manual only gives a very sketchy picture of how everything works. Don't expect to find any maths in there. Searching the Wiki and discussion forums will be needed, if you're interested in details, such as how exactly an attribute influences a skill's efficiency.Combat is very repetitive, especially since the party's size is limited to your player character and only three NPC companions, which you control. Companions, which you remove from the party, remain available at the party's camp site till the end of the game. I think the skill/talent tree has been dumbed down pretty much. The variety of enemies could be much greater.It is not an open world. Quest locations on the overview map get added/removed as you progress through the game. The quest areas themselves often are very restricted, and even in the wilderness you can only move through an area on predefined paths and not move freely.In some parts of the game you enter meta-gaming hell. Such as an ambiguous answer during conversation leading to an immediate and unexpected ambush of a potential companion, because that's how some of the conversation trees have been designed. Reload and avoid the WTF-moment. Or one of your long-time companions, who has been with you almost since the beginning and  calls you a friend, leaves permanently before the last few endgame fights just because the game only offers two story-driven choices for taking either the evil or good path. Or merchants at various stages of the game, who offer unlimited supplies of some very important crafting materials or a recipe you need. Once you've gained such meta-gaming knowledge, the real planning can start. Or else the potential for multiple playthroughs would be low.If you only want to do a single playthrough, the game is entertaining enough for sure. Its beginning varies in quality. Don't quit in rage early. The middle and end are better. The voice acting is fine, but sometimes a bit silly (they couldn't resist adding crap when you select a companion). And there are lots of cutscenes that add to the atmosphere.			"

												This game. Is. Amazing. There's nothing more to be said about it. There's 0 reason to not own this game if you like RPGs of any kind. Especially since it's $7 right now for the main game and ALL of the DLC? GET IT! I still have this game on ps3. I bought it back in the day when it came out. I re bought it for DLC. I wont talk about or ruin the story for anyone, but it is by far one of the best stories in gaming. The fight at the end made me cry. I cant recall a single other game that was powerfull enough to bring a tear to my eyes. The bonds you make with the members of your party is absolutely amazing. They feel like genuine real life flesh and blood people as you listen to their stories about their life. There's no other word for it. ""Amazing "". On top of all that, there's remarkable replayability as you can choose several different origins that change the story up immensely. And each of the story lines has one of two factons you can side with, which will immediately make you want to replay through it and see what happens on the other side. As soon as you finish this game if you agreed to morigans deal ( which I wont spoil ) you will IMMEDIATELY want to play the witch hunt dlc. And all of this, this is just the MAIN game. Theres so much content here it almost makes up a second whole new game. I can not praise this game high enough, it's in my top 5 games of all time, i've clocked countless hours on this on PS3, pick this up. 10/10.			"

												One of the best RPG out there, with hours upon hours of content, especially if you get the Ultimate Edition which brings all the game's DLC in the bundle, adding even more hours of gameplay and some interesting campaigns that differ from the main one, showing us more about certain characters, even allowing us to taste being part of the evil faction.I will add here some points that go for the game and some that go against it.Pros:+It is a long game with a lot of content, a rare thing to find these days.+It's side quests are where the game really shines, with a lot of ways to entertain the player in many different ways.+Your choices change things in the world around you.+It's background story is astoundingly well developed (As we have come to expect from bioware since games like KOTOR)+The PC version has a more in depth tactical mechanic than its console counterpart, you can pause the game at any time to    give orders to your followers or to plan how to tackle certain enemies.+Various origins to choose from that affect dialogues troughout the game. (Hence the game's title)+Many build options and various specs branching from three base classes: Warrior, Mage and Rogue.Cons:-If you are someone that values graphics over other things keep in mind that this game came out in 2009, so it is bound to be graphicaly outdated (The graphics aren't bad tough).-The main storyline is kind of typical and straightforward, and depending on your choices it might end in a way that leaves you with a bitter taste.-The relationship system with your followers is not that well done, you might find that the character you are trying to romance in their highes approval level and still don't show any interest in taking your friendship further.-It has mods, but the game's modding mechanics are kind of tough to get acustomed with, especially if you are new to modding games.All in all it is a very good game and while it isn't perfect, since it is a mess to activate the dlc for some people, for example, it is a game that I do sincerely recommend.10/10 -would play again-			"

												In the veins of Baldur's Gate, with relatively modern yet deep control scheme - the game that can be played in many different ways.A big plus is the option to choose a difficulty setting (and change it during the game as you wish), and the game's ability to tune the monsters to your own level, thus always providing a reasonable challenge.The story of DAO is captivating and very well thought-through, there are no big head-scratchers or points where the game would take your freedom of choice away. Each major plotline has at least 2 very different ways to resolve it, and you can on several occasions try to ""play it for both sides"", which results in some cool plot twists.I'd also like to highlight the fantastic Fade - this game's ""Mental world"", which you will visit on several occasions and where you face demons and emotions in place of ordinary monsters. This is one of the best portrayals of spiritual world I have seen.It is easy to forgive this game the few issues it has (such as the inability to plan ambushes for those enemies who have a conversation prior to the fight), because the game, as a whole, is a masterpiece.

SummaryA captivating RPG experience that easily stands shoulder to shoulder with classics like Fallout and Planescape: Torment.ReviewDragon Age: Origins is, in a word, awesome. Think of everything you love (and some things you might hate) about role-playing games, and that's DA:O.I'll get the bad things out of the way first simply because there are so few of them. First of all, there is tons of combat in this game. That's both a good and a bad thing, though. The combat system is, in fact, extremely well designed, interesting, and most importantly loads of fun. The problem is that there's sometimes too much of it which can feel like a bit of a meaningless slog on occasion, especially during some of the lengthier travel segments. My second criticism is that sometimes dialog choices don't actually make any difference during conversations and lead to the same generic response from an NPC. Thankfully, this is largely the exception.And that's it, really. Everything else about the game is absolutely stellar. The hallmark of the RPG genre is meaningful choices and consequences, and DA:O excels in this area. Quests have multiple solutions, conversations often play out radically differently depending on player choice, and your decisions during quests and conversations have an impact on your companions' relationships with your character. Consequences can be minor, such as lowering a companion's disposition towards you, while others are more substantial, affecting and sometimes limiting your available options later in the game. It all feels very natural and dynamic, and you'll often find yourself wondering what would happen if you had made different choices which contributes to DA:O's excellent replay value. Quite often these choices are not black and white with obvious ""right"" and ""wrong"" paths laid out before you, and you'll often find yourself trying to untangle a moral quandary. For instance, when a young boy is possessed by a demon, do you defeat the demon by killing the boy, or by allowing his mother to sacrifice herself in a blood magic ritual? There's no easy answer to that sort of dilemma, and many of DA:O's quests hinge on such decisions.The lack of moral certainty is refreshing for this genre, because it allows you to play a nuanced evil character, offering role playing choices that are deeper and more interesting than the usual ""evil guy = jerk"" one-dimensional characterization that many RPG's tend towards. It also happens that the morally good choices do not always bring the best rewards, so the player isn't at an automatic disadvantage for not walking the straight and narrow.DA:O features an epic story that could possibly be criticized for riffing on Tolkien, but then, what fantasy story doesn't? However, BioWare added enough of their own unique twists to the setting and narrative that they can legitimately call it their own. One area where DA:O shines in particular is how well realized the game world is. It's clear that BioWare put a lot of time and thought into this aspect of the game and developed a detailed and plausible society. Everything from history, local politics, national politics, religion, cultural divisions, and the plight of the common man is fleshed out in considerable detail making Ferelden feel more like a real place than a fictional world. I personally found the dwarven culture with its rigid caste system to be particularly fascinating. To give you an idea of the kind of attention to detail we're talking about, BioWare doesn't just declare that it's based on a caste system and that's it but actually delves into ancient dwarven history to explain exactly how the system developed in the first place. Much of this information is conveyed through codex entries which unlock as you progress through the game, and there is, in fact, quite a lot of reading to be done in DA:O, but it's well worth your time and perhaps even necessary to get the most out of your experience.And what an experience it is. The main game will take you around 60-hours to complete, and if you get the Ultimate Edition (and you should) you can add another 20-hours for the Awakening expansion plus several more besides for some of the smaller campaigns like Witch Hunt and The Dark Spawn Chronicles, so there's around a hundred hours of gameplay for your first play-through, and with its branching storyline, interesting moral choices, and 6 unique origins stories based on your choice of character, there's plenty of incentive to play again and again.Trust me, this is one you do not want to miss.

												DA:O has got to be one of the best RPG's I've played to date. It has an engrossing story, a fleshed out world with interesting and likeable characters. In terms of gameplay it relies on strategic thinking. You can pause in the middle of battle and zoom out into an almost isometric view to get a better look at the battlefield. This allows you to think of where to place your party members and what abilities will work best against a certain enemy. You can even do a cross-class combo, such as having a mage freeze an enemy and then have a warrior bash them with their shield, shattering them thus killing them instantly. But because of this style of play it may not be to everyone's taste. And its does have its fair share of flaws but overall, it is a good game. I really recommand getting it.  "

												8/10I recommend this only if you have not played it by now and want some background for Inquisition.Origins was predictable and slow paced. I am not a big RPG guy but the difficulty seemed unbalanced, much pausing was involved. I was fighting mobs above my level because I skipped some sideQs in the big city. I mean an enemy is at the gates and yet you have plenty of time doing all the inconsequential stuff. Some stories just are not fit for an RPG. The finale was kinda easy. I had a harder time dealing with the game when I got swarmed by 20 zombies. Awakening expansion was more tense, locations and story were better than the base game. Difficulty was balanced.Further DLC that I enjoyed was Witch Hunt. Amgarrak was sometimes boring but second best, it was a bit challenging since I did not have a healer.			"

												This review is for ""Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition"", that is, including all DLCs and the Awakening expansionDragon Age Origins, despite its...age (dates back to 2009) is still the best classic RPG and the only true spiritual successor of Baldur's Gate.PROS+ The game is huge. A completist walkthrough (there are hundreds of missions and side quests and endless dialogues) can easily take 130 hours.+ The tactical combat is very good.+ As of 2014 the best storyline ever.+ Fantastic characterization of companions, allies and foes.+ Truly epic+ Strong replayability (different  routes, different endings)+ Good, detailed graphics + Excellent voice acting+ Easy to use GUICons- While the main story (Origins) is polished, the follow up (Awakening) is still (and will always be, considering it's 5 years old) buggy, with a weaker story line and loses a bit of the high impact involvement with companions.- No voice acting for the main character (for some reason, they did not go the Mass Effect way).The sequel, Dragon Age 2, is a completely different game (more like an action rpg, buggy, with a weak storyline and silly game mechanics)), so don't bother.Overall 9,5/10 Dragon Age: Origins stands as the Golden Standard for all RPGs			"

												A brilliant tactical RPG with a refreshing story(for once the main characters actually feel vulnerable) and a compellingly challenging gameplay, that will often force you to either rethink your approach on combat and tactically distribute your damage, or die at the hands of high level random encounters.The game really is what you make of it. Dedicate little time and just rush through, your story will be fairly mediocre too. Do sidequests and shape the world to your liking, the story will respond to it. This game has every thing.

												If you enjoy rpgs driven by story and the choices you make having an impact I recommend  this game for you! This game has a multiple companions that can either love or hate you based on your decisions. Also many of your decisions impact the world in some way or another. The overarching story is seen as generic by some and in someways it is, but it is still a very good story. On the combat side of things this game has party based combat in the style of Baldur's gate where you compose a party consisting of you and 3 companions of your choice.  I would recommend getting the ultimate edition over the regular edition because the awakening expansion is very enjoyable. The other dlcs also add to the game and are fun aswell.  You will get many hours of enjoyment out of this game, not only is one playthrough long but there is a lot of replayability due to how many class combinations and decisions you can make. So overall I think this game is well worth the 30 dollar price tag but it is a good decision to wait for a sale as it usually drops to around 7 dollars which is an amazing price for how great this game is. I would give it a 9/10.			"

												Easily the best RPG I've ever played. In fact, as of the writing of this review, I'd go as far as to call this the single greatest game I've played on any platform - and that's coming from someone who's been gaming since Atari.Dragon age is a powerful, engrossing experience. The world is massive, the back-story immense. If lore is your thing, you'll find scattered throughout Ferelden enough lore to fill 9 novels. The characters are EASILY the best developed I've ever encountered. Spend enough time playing and you really feel like you connect with them. They have so much personality; and their voice acting is flawless. It really makes you care about them. The combat is polished and perfect for PC (if you played on console and were frustrated, it's not even REMOTELY equivalent. Being able to lay out all your attacks and click the ones you want is much more natural) - lots of strategy and customization options. Perhaps best of all is the story. I've never played a game that's done a better job of presenting the player with choices that will truly alter the story on the fly. This gives it IMMENSE replay value. I've played through this game a dozen times, and it was wildly different every time.If you've grown disenchanted with the increasingly j-pop influenced Final Fantasy series, try Dragon Age			"

												Ah yes, the good and uncomplicated dragon age.  Frankly this one is the best in the series.  Not because of controls or mechanics, but because the richness of the story and uncomplicated essence of the characters.  You hold an attachment to them and want to complete every aspect of the game to drive on their adventures.Essentially if you want to play a dragon age before the series became a politicly correct statement on minority rights and long narratives on how Casey Hudson thinks that anyone that disagrees with his agendas is clearly a moron and dosn't deserve the time of day, play this one.If you do however want to play more ""socially diverse"" games, please see Dragon Age II.  Less gameplay, more statements.  Or Dragon Age Inq, a little more gameplay this time, but we still wanna give you a liberal arts lesson as well.9/10 - Masterpiece			"

												As in most of the games I play I am very LTTP, but I enjoyed the story lines and world created in this game. While I normally don't play DLC (unless I really enjoyed the main game), I felt like the DLCs in this case built nicely upon what was created in the main game. Dragon Age Awakening was practically a sequel (a short one, but a lot of stand alone games are around the same length).I hate to compare it to Mass Effect, but I am going to anyway. One thing I noticed on my DA play through was I didn't love the characters the same way I loved the ME characters. I didn't make sure I did all the companion quests, etc and didn't even really feel compelled to romance any of the companions. So in a way for me, the story wasn't as character driven as Mass Effect, if that makes sense, but I still found myself enjoying the overall story arc, combat and world.The combat took some getting used to. At first I didn't like the pausing mechanic, but I found later as some of the fights got more complicated in terms of positioning ranged players or having a companion change tactics it made it way more fun. The tactics menu was also an awesome idea. Most of the time I went with the default tactics, but found myself slightly modifying them as I went further into the game. Basically the pausing mechanic and being able to change tactics really added to the game in a big way, setting it apart from other action RPGs.I plan on playing DA2 soon, but I don't own it on Steam unfortunately.

												One of my favorite games of all time along side Mass Effect and Kotor, this game detailed, rich, and full of adventure. With multiple starting races and starting locations that effect your character's experience throughout the game, it's easy to find yourself playing over multiple playthroughs - even if you normally don't. The combat is a blast, just don't try to get through without pausing! I've arguably never had so much fun. EA buying Bioware is one of the sadder events in gaming history, and the differences show.

												DA:O has got to be one of the best RPG's I've played to date. It has an engrossing story, a fleshed out world with interesting and likeable characters. In terms of gameplay it relies on strategic thinking. You can pause in the middle of battle and zoom out into an almost isometric view to get a better look at the battlefield. This allows you to think of where to place your party members and what abilities will work best against a certain enemy. You can even do a cross-class combo, such as having a mage freeze an enemy and then have a warrior bash them with their shield, shattering them thus killing them instantly. But because of this style of play it may not be to everyone's taste. And its does have its fair share of flaws but overall, it is a good game. I really recommand getting it.  "

												In the veins of Baldur's Gate, with relatively modern yet deep control scheme - the game that can be played in many different ways.A big plus is the option to choose a difficulty setting (and change it during the game as you wish), and the game's ability to tune the monsters to your own level, thus always providing a reasonable challenge.The story of DAO is captivating and very well thought-through, there are no big head-scratchers or points where the game would take your freedom of choice away. Each major plotline has at least 2 very different ways to resolve it, and you can on several occasions try to ""play it for both sides"", which results in some cool plot twists.I'd also like to highlight the fantastic Fade - this game's ""Mental world"", which you will visit on several occasions and where you face demons and emotions in place of ordinary monsters. This is one of the best portrayals of spiritual world I have seen.It is easy to forgive this game the few issues it has (such as the inability to plan ambushes for those enemies who have a conversation prior to the fight), because the game, as a whole, is a masterpiece.

												One of the best RPG out there, with hours upon hours of content, especially if you get the Ultimate Edition which brings all the game's DLC in the bundle, adding even more hours of gameplay and some interesting campaigns that differ from the main one, showing us more about certain characters, even allowing us to taste being part of the evil faction.I will add here some points that go for the game and some that go against it.Pros:+It is a long game with a lot of content, a rare thing to find these days.+It's side quests are where the game really shines, with a lot of ways to entertain the player in many different ways.+Your choices change things in the world around you.+It's background story is astoundingly well developed (As we have come to expect from bioware since games like KOTOR)+The PC version has a more in depth tactical mechanic than its console counterpart, you can pause the game at any time to    give orders to your followers or to plan how to tackle certain enemies.+Various origins to choose from that affect dialogues troughout the game. (Hence the game's title)+Many build options and various specs branching from three base classes: Warrior, Mage and Rogue.Cons:-If you are someone that values graphics over other things keep in mind that this game came out in 2009, so it is bound to be graphicaly outdated (The graphics aren't bad tough).-The main storyline is kind of typical and straightforward, and depending on your choices it might end in a way that leaves you with a bitter taste.-The relationship system with your followers is not that well done, you might find that the character you are trying to romance in their highes approval level and still don't show any interest in taking your friendship further.-It has mods, but the game's modding mechanics are kind of tough to get acustomed with, especially if you are new to modding games.All in all it is a very good game and while it isn't perfect, since it is a mess to activate the dlc for some people, for example, it is a game that I do sincerely recommend.10/10 -would play again-			"

												If you enjoy rpgs driven by story and the choices you make having an impact I recommend  this game for you! This game has a multiple companions that can either love or hate you based on your decisions. Also many of your decisions impact the world in some way or another. The overarching story is seen as generic by some and in someways it is, but it is still a very good story. On the combat side of things this game has party based combat in the style of Baldur's gate where you compose a party consisting of you and 3 companions of your choice.  I would recommend getting the ultimate edition over the regular edition because the awakening expansion is very enjoyable. The other dlcs also add to the game and are fun aswell.  You will get many hours of enjoyment out of this game, not only is one playthrough long but there is a lot of replayability due to how many class combinations and decisions you can make. So overall I think this game is well worth the 30 dollar price tag but it is a good decision to wait for a sale as it usually drops to around 7 dollars which is an amazing price for how great this game is. I would give it a 9/10.			"

												Dragon Age, when it arrived, was a game that I had been waiting on for a very long time. Having been criminally denied more KotOR (which is what I truly wanted), this was as close as I was going to get to that same feeling; Squad-based tactical RPG with a heavy emphasis on character interaction, development and choice... Just describing it makes me want to fire it up again.The setting and tone is similar to Game of Thrones, but before the show even existed; A dark fantasy that delves into intrigue, mystery, deception and tragedy. Not to mention a heavy dose of epic adventure. Of course the game doesn't always take itself so seriously, taking cues from its predecessor by implementing some charming, quirky characters and an overall sense of hope in the darkness. The consistenly excellent writing, VO and art design all come together in a way that helps you get lost in the universe they created.The story, and how it unfolds, is really quite good. As the name suggests, your origin is important, and what you choose to be at the beginning will have a noticeable impact on your path. However, everyone ultimately finds their way into the arms of the Grey Wardens, a jedi-esque order of warriors devoted to stopping a horde of darkspawn from spreading throughout the land. They recruit you, train you, and before you know it, throw you into the fire. What happens in the next 40-60 hours is for you to discover. That number will of course grow considerably if you get all of the DLC. Origins is unique for a modern Western game, in the sense that it is actually fairly challenging. The enemies, especially a few hours into the game, are tough and it only gets harder. Even on normal difficulty you will likely get your ♥♥♥ kicked a few times, soon to realize that a strategic approach is the best way to succeed. The combat is complex but it makes sense, taking the fundementals of KotOR and making it even deeper.Of course now having said all of that, it looks like I'm going to be playing it soon... You should do the same.			"

												One of the most excellent WRPGs in recent memory. While things slow down around the Deep Roads, it never fails to add new, imaginative characters and encounters that spice up the game. Combat is a strategic dance, with traditional roles (tank, healer, etc.) and new specializations that fit the unique enemies you fight. Best of all is the interaction system. Each and every character in this game is like a living being, and interacting with them feels natural and realistic. The game always finds ways to test you, whether it be your combat process or your strength of character. 9/10.			"

												I was never really a fan of RPGs, so I was obviously having doubts about this one, but the story seemed interesting and a friend of mine really inspired me to play. I've made simultaneously the best and the worst decision in my life. Best because this game is excellent. It's magical (haha), the story drags you in if you have even a bit of compassion and the characters can really easily charm you and in no time you'll find yourself in love with one or all of them. The reason I'm saying this was the worst decision in my life because the game ended.I never want to let go of my first warden and the fights and the characters and the places... Even with the DLCs I just want to keep playing this. And the replay value on this game is absolutely amazing, I've played as a female human warrior on the first try and I knew it immediately that I want to try the other classes/races.Just get this game if you want hours of exploring, humor and probably the most complex and interesting story ever.

												This is THE MOST amazing game. I don't much like strategy, but I can't imagine this game without the strategy side of it. The characters have depth and personality that makes them feel real; I am crazy attached to quite a few. The humor in it had me smirking and occasionally laughing out loud, and yes there are dramatic moments... but they're not overplayed or drawn out. They're what you would expect, but better. I was frustrated when I finished the game because I thought ""My God, they've done it so well that I CAN'T write fan fiction of this. The quality would be nowhere near.""Often the ultimate edition is on sale for like $8. HUGE steal. BUY IT!			"

												Bioware's Dragon Age: Origins, vanilla or with all the released content for it, has been one of my all-time favorite games, of any genre, of any platform, that I've played since I started gaming back in the early 1980s.  If that isn't enough of a statement to help you decide if this game is good or not, or 'worth it' as so many ask, then I don't know what else I could say to make it so.I just love the storyline and characters so much, to the point that I actually got emotionally tied to some of them.  As the storyline develops, based on your decisions throughout your questing, you'll come to love certain characters, and come to actually hate and loath others.I can bet you, that once you've played through the game a certain way, you'll want to play through again, just to see the storyline from a different perspective, and then yet again.Like for myself, I've played through the vanilla game on Xbox360, then with the DLC packs, then got Awakening to play through it yet again.  But I also wanted to experience the game on my PC so I bought it for my PC as well.  And I'm not done yet...  I just saw the Ultimate Edition on Steam for a crazy low price of $7.49 so I said, ""Why not!  I want to have it on Steam as well!  It has EVERYTHING that came out for the game, in one edition.  Well duh, I guess that's why it's called Ultimate Edition I guess, right?""It's just that GOOD!Bottom line is, if you like RPGs and/or Action RPGs, then you have to get this.  You won't be taken seriously when you say you know action RPGs if you've never played it, and that's the truth.Huge thanks Bioware, as if Baldur's Gate wasn't enough of a classic, you give us another.Want to see one of the best game trailers ever made?http://store.steampowered.com/video/17450/5452Feel free to share your favorite characters and why below in the comments.

												I'll be brief. The origins story was thoroughly enjoyable, I highly recommend it. I often complain about lack of depth in game stories, but this time I cannot. The only criticism I can come up with is that the depth of the Dragon Age universe, as it appears to me after one playthrough, is so overwhelming that I don't even want to keep exploring it anymore. You forget one thing a character has said and because of that you subsequently make a bad moral decision hours later. I'll leave it at that. "

												A fun game with the best dialogue Bioware has ever done. I'm a HUGE Bioware fanboy and in series like KoToR or Mass Effect you choose either all Good or Bad choices because of an alignment tree, which doesn't allow you to make the character that reflects you. In Dragon age all the choices reflect how you are as a person, no alignment tree no incentives to do everyone good or bad it's how you want to play. It makes you really get lost in this wonderful world. With all that said the combat system is very  unique...and that's not such a good thing. Let's just say I struggled through the combat system and was rewarded with a great story. Although hey you might like it, so it's 100% worth picking up if you want an 80+ hour RPG adventure with lots of very fun DLC.			"

												An amazingly immersive RPG with a great story and greater characters. As with most Bioware RPGs the main focus of the game is the story and the moral choices you make; what really impressed me were the choices aren't always clear cut good and bad; those choices not only affect the game but also influence how the characters you travel with feel about you. The combat system is strategic and challenging and playing the PC version means you can easily control the flow of battle with the zoomed out view, allowing you to better plan out your attacks and makes for a more satisfying experience than it's console counterpart. The character customisation is extensive and choosing the origin story really feels as though your character is fleshed out but don't expect too much from the origin story later in game as it only affects minor aspects of the dialogue and unique encounter for each origin. Dragon Age is a very good all round RPG which you will easily sink hours into, plus it has an impressive catalogue of mods which can really add to the game so be sure to check those out too!			"

												This game has everything you could possibly wish for in an RPG : tactical challenging and fun combat, classes and skills well designed, beautiful world and deep lore, great story, excellent companions, deep and meaningful choices and dialogue, funny stuff and in the same time things that will make you sad, good loot and crafting systems. I refuse to think there is someone who really loves good games and wouldnt want to play it. I might need to warn you though that you WILL need dozens of hours to finish a playthrough, so it is not really suited for casual gamers. But you WILL love almost every minute of it.			"

												What can I say, this game is one of my favorite games of all time. Story top notch, amazingly developed charecters, with tones of witty banter. Lore very fleshed out, if you bother to read the codex it does a really good job of explaining why things are the way they are. Also the enviroments are wonderfully degsigned, even if they arnt on top notch graphics they still invoke your imgination and look very interesting and pretty.            However the combat is alright not the best, think of it as playing WoW, click a hot key watch them do the move. However this does allow for some interesting tactical fights, as you pause chose where each of your four man team go and what moves they use then. The only other negative I can levy at this game, as I stated before, is its graphics. They are very ugly even for when it was realesed, low res textures everywhere. But in my book graphics dont make a game, its the story. This is a RPG after all where story comes first.			"

												Dragon Age: Origins sets itself apart from other games of it's genre.  The story is phenomenal to say the least, the characters are some of the deepest, well-thought figures in any game I've ever played, and the RPG element allows the player direct decisions on nearly every aspect of the game.  When 'epic, fantasy RPG' comes to mind, DA:O is truly the elite in it's class.  The Ultimate Edition is no exception, great price for value.I'm a long time console player with probably several hundred hours and atleast 5 playthroughs, but I have yet to complete my first playthrough of the game and all the DLC on the PC yet and already have 80+ hours logged.  You heard correctly; 80+ hours on one character and I've only completed the base game, Warden's Peak, Stone Prisoner, and Golem's of Amgarrak.  I have yet to complete Awakening, Witch Hunt, Leliana's Song, and Darkspawn Invasion.  I expect the total hours to be 120+ on one character by the time I have done everything the Ultimate Edition has to offer.  Easily one of the best values for dollar per hour spent.The combat may be the only draw-back to the game.  Strategy-wise, it's extremely in-depth and requires much preparation on higher difficulties.  Veteran MMO players will feel right at home.  However the visuals are lacking (keeping in mind the date of release) and the whole system isn't very 'exhilarating', though you'll feel the occasional rush during a boss fight.  The combat serves its purpose and doesn't really throw any curves; it doesn't add much noteworthy additions to the game, but it certainly does not detract from the piece.The vanilla game is stellar in itself, but the incorporation of the DA Updater allows easy organization of mods.  Mods I've found especially good include textures, re-skins, graphics, combat AI, and combat tactics.Overall, one of the best modern RPG's in existence.  Give it a shot if you haven't, you won't regret it.10/10			"

												You don't have this? GO BUY IT! I loved playing this game, Bioware managed to do a pretty good job with Dragon Age, even more than Mass Effect in my honest opinion. The story explains very well what is happening in the game world without anything sounding ""awkward"". The story is one of the best I've experienced lately but it kinda feels they are doing the same they did with Mass Effect, a special organization (Specters/Grey Wardens) fighting to save the day from evil (Reapers/DarkSpawn). But in the end, I enjoyed it very much. The combat handles pretty well and it feels solid, at first I didn't really liked it but after a while I got used to it and now, I adore it. The skill tree and the ammount of options you have that will affect how the game unfolds are surprisingly very good. I wouldn't say the looting system is the best, it's certainly mediocre. With tons of crafting along with runecrafting that there's in the game and the small but good amount of content that Awakening brings into the base game I'd say that this were around 99 hours very well spent and I recommend this RPG to anyone that loves a good story, a good fantasy world and a good experience.

												This game is a masterpiece when it comes to videogames. It pairs challenging tactical battles with excellent plot and an interesting setting. The graphics are good for such a large open game during the time it was made and even if they aren't as amazing as current days, it does not subtract from it. What I found to be the best part about this game was that each battle I had to fight differently. Each one had the possibility of defeat, and their were rarely any easy battles that I didn't have to think while fighting. Also, story wise, the greatest part in my opinion were the characters. I did not dislike a single one of them, and they each one of them I related and cared about. Overall this game is one of the greatest RPG games I have ever played, and if you enjoy RPGs and haven't picked this up, do so now.			"

												One of the greates RPG ever. I totally love this game. I played it like 4 times and its not enough. Awesome storyline where you interrupt by making your decision. Battling equal and sometimes hard. Like sometimes I had to low my difficulty to easy. However, that was beacuse I wasnt quite strategic person. So yea, if you like to make your strategies and trying something new, this is the game for you. And also.. I totally loved romance stories altought I always played woman so I tried only romance with Alistair, Zevran and Leilana. They were just sweet. Very well.. You have to give it a try! Also with all DLC.. I havent finished all of them yet but they are pretty cool. ;)			"

												So I know that Steam says I've played only 91.3hrs, but I've played offline as well, and it's a total of about 125+ hours. I ADORE this game. It is absolutely worth it to buy the Ultimate Edition-however, I bought it on sale for $7.40 (midweek madness is GODSEND). The extra content is very useful (there's items, gifts and and even 2 map locations, as well as an additional party member) and the additional campaigns are very fun.The story is very well developed, as are the characters. They're very vivid. The graphics are also fabulous. What I love the most about the story is how OPTIONAL it is; you can skip cutscenes by pressing escape, as well as dialogue. Much of the story comes from talking to NPC's as well as your party members, so if you are not a fan of story and are just there for the gameplay, you can easily skip it and go about your business.The gameplay itself can be tricky for those not familiar with the tactics system. I played Final Fantasy 12 and there they called it ""gambit"" system, where basically you can set up a list of tasks for each character to go through during a battle, which makes more strategy possible. However, unlike Final Fantasy 12's gambit system, selecting a character will prevent them from going through their tactics; they will only perform those tasks automatically if you're NOT using them. But if you don't want to set up each individual task, or aren't sure what you'll need, you can select from the premade tactics.Also, an important note: leveling up can be difficult because monsters don't respawn. For this reason, I recommend exploring as much as you can and completing a few side quests. There's tons of side quests available in almost every town you visit.The exploration CAN be a little linear, though. For example, you are unable to jump over objects or vault from cliffs (that was fun in Fable 2). Plus, when traveling from town to town, you go to a loading screen, and observe the map as you travel. There are random encounters that can occur, but it's definitely not as free exploration like Skyrim or Oblivion.All in all, this game is a lot of fun, and it just draws you in. I am very glad I purchased it. I tell all of my friends to buy this game because it's so incredible :)			"

(Which can later bite you in the ♥♥♥)-The items you can get are awesome.-You will take a HUGE role late-game.-The DLC's that came out for DA:O are so much fun! Especially 'Dragon Age: Awakening'.I really recommend you buying this game.Unfortunately the game feels very ""unstable"".Lots of memory leak, game will take longer to load, the longer you play and you will probable get 4/5 crashes throughout your game (My computer is very much able to handle the game, it's just very unstable, I wouldn't recommend this game for low-end computers).Already a 9/10 !!!

												Dragon Age: Origins is a great game, and the Ultimate Edition is the way to go as it includes every single piece of DLC released for the game. Everybody raves about this game, but rarely are the shortcomings addressed:- Animations are dull and stiff (during both combat and dialogue)- Character models have only a few different variations, (so you'll see the same haircuts etc. over and over again) - The overall story arc is rather generic, (hey, you're the hero, go collect everyone and prepare for a final battle)- Depending on what classes you play as, combat can be mind numbingly slow and weak (in particular for any ranged spec rogue, or sword/shield spec warrior)- The world is kind of presented in a rather dull manner- Several bugs (lots of crashing in Origins, and many other technical ones in Awakening)Most of these issues can be ignored because of the other great content in the game. There are some intriguing side quests, interesting companion characters, tough decisions, there's loads replayability and the lore is really deep and well written. For me personally, most of the issues are fixed in Dragon Age II (though that game also brings forward some new issues...)Overall, it's still a great game, I'd give it a flat 8.0/10. But again, for all the praise it gets, it's flaws are never talked about.			"

												This is less a review of Origins by itself, and more a review of the Dragon age Series as a whole.  Heavily opinionated and spoilers ahead, so be warned.If you like D&D style fights with an element of chance, and overcoming pitted battles with a tactical mindset, then Dragon Age: Origins is for you.  There are a few exploits here and there, but this game glitters like a ruby among RPGs released within the last few years.  I Just wish Inquisition was available through steam.  (And that it was more like DA:O.  It's got the hallmark sins of modern RPGs being too damn flashy.  This is supposed to be a Western RPG series, not a JRPG series.)And don't waste your energy on DA2.  It's a mess.  Watch a playthrough instead, you will get to experience a decent story without having to sit through gameplay that's trash comppared to DA:O.All top-down tactical RPGs should emulate Origins, I hope the next Dragon Age game takes cues from the Witcher and backs off from the cartoony flashy power activation nonsense that belongs in WoW and JRPGs. The series needs to get back in touch with its dark fantasy roots. I don't care if people think its gross or offensive.  Don't let trying to be politically correct limit you creatively  Perfectionism is the enemy of creativity, and trying to make a perfect game that pleases everyone will just land you with something dull and fangless.The Darkspawn in Inquisition were like boring zombies...While the Darkspawn in THIS game are like horrible scabby mutants with mouths full of corroded pointy snake teeth.  Their faces permanently twisted into manic grins of madness, gibbering in their gutteral and violent tongue.You're doing something wrong when your race of subterranean ♥♥♥♥-orcs comes off as boring and inoffensive.  They NEED to be disgusting, they NEED to be cruel in order for a player to feel invested in going in and seeking every little pocket of darkspawn lurking in the shadows.  Each kill is a small victory, each Hurlocke beheaded is a dwarven woman that doesn't need to suffer mutation and mutilation at the hands of darkspawn captors, each Ogre slaughtered is a caravan of soldiers that gets to go home to their families alive and not in boxes of bloodied paste.Recapture 30% of that, and Dragon age 4 will be a hit.

												Dragon Age: Origins is a great game, and the Ultimate Edition is the way to go as it includes every single piece of DLC released for the game. Everybody raves about this game, but rarely are the shortcomings addressed:- Animations are dull and stiff (during both combat and dialogue)- Character models have only a few different variations, (so you'll see the same haircuts etc. over and over again) - The overall story arc is rather generic, (hey, you're the hero, go collect everyone and prepare for a final battle)- Depending on what classes you play as, combat can be mind numbingly slow and weak (in particular for any ranged spec rogue, or sword/shield spec warrior)- The world is kind of presented in a rather dull manner- Several bugs (lots of crashing in Origins, and many other technical ones in Awakening)Most of these issues can be ignored because of the other great content in the game. There are some intriguing side quests, interesting companion characters, tough decisions, there's loads replayability and the lore is really deep and well written. For me personally, most of the issues are fixed in Dragon Age II (though that game also brings forward some new issues...)Overall, it's still a great game, I'd give it a flat 8.0/10. But again, for all the praise it gets, it's flaws are never talked about.			"

Very quick review:Well worth the money for a memorable RPG that can be played in so many ways. Fulfilling, funny, and completely engaging from start to finish. Minor flaws are forgivable and ignorable for the most part. Absolutely brilliant.Slightly less quick review:Pros:+ Overall gameplay is fantastic – flaws are not overly bothersome.+ Main storyline is excellent – very satisfying and great value for money in terms of length, involvement, and balance of fetch-type quests vs more intricate jobs.+ Side quests are interesting and don’t feel like chores.+ Character development is perfect – you’ll want to do those side quests!+ Customisation: great choice of unique starting points and character builds makes for unrivalled replay value.+ Incredible writing. Draws you in from the very start with whichever character build and story you’ve chosen and is genuinely hilarious at times.+ Voice acting is fantastic.+ Well-developed and immersive world build and lore, but not boring.+ Decisions actually matter.+ Great soundtrack.+ Good mod support.Cons: - Graphics are a bit outdated – high settings or a couple of mods can help, but it’s not horrendous.- Combat mechanics aren’t perfect – a bit slow at times and it takes some getting used to.- You might cry a bit.- You might also laugh till you pee a little. Down to business:Just as a starter, I adore this game. It’s one of my all-time favourites. The DA franchise is amazing, and although Origins is no spring chicken, it has aged well. On higher settings the game still has spectacular moments, graphically speaking, and the mid-low range settings are playable and artistically enjoyable, although not the best by any means. But you won’t care. At all.If you’re looking for an entertaining, fulfilling, thoroughly immersive RPG with brilliant writing and touching character development, grab this. As someone who has also read the Dragon Age novels because she was desperate for more, I can tell you the world build is incredible – the lore is well structured, believable, and gripping. But for those of you who don’t want to read codex or journal entries, with this, you really don’t need to – you’ll be drawn in by the game itself, which expertly takes you through a robust storyline and gives you just the right amount of info to keep you interested without being boring or overwhelming.Your companions will give you feels. Some you’ll hate, some will make you laugh, and some you’ll go full Hulk mode to protect.As far as mechanics go, it’s not perfect – combat is a little slow and clunky at times, and it can take a little while to get used to. The multitude of tactical options and talent customisations available may be a little overwhelming to start with, especially if you’re not used to RPG builds. However, this is more than compensated for. Put simply, you can play whichever way you want. If you enjoy micromanaging and tactical play, the game deals very well with this. If you’d rather be more hands-on, or a mixture of both, go ahead – the AI is pretty good at letting your party get on with it while you smash some darkspawn skulls in with a sword as long as your own body, or go full mage-rage and burn someone to a crisp. As for your actual character – the game does the (mostly) silent protagonist thing very well. It takes nothing away from the enjoyment of this game. The voice acting as a whole is excellent – very believable, very natural, and the right amount of comic relief vs. dramatic, feel-inducing bits. It’s all very epic but not over-acted.The story customisation is second to none. At the start of the game, you can build your male or female character from scratch (or just use the presets) – human, elf, or dwarf; warrior, rogue or mage; noble or bottom of the pile - these options DO make a huge difference to the story. Replay value is amazing. You basically have multiple different games, and the choices you make as you progress shape the world around you as you deal with the Blight. As far as DLC goes, Awakening is brilliant. You can take your story and character forward from the ending of Origins itself, or you can create another new one! It’s another good chunk of gameplay, with fantastic characters and plenty more to do. The other extras are great value too – not to spoil anything, they’re perfect for those wanting a little more from certain characters, and are well worth the play time. Moving forward to DA:2, you can take your Origins story along with you – yay for transferrable save files! Or you can custom-build a story if you weren’t exactly happy with your Origins playthrough and can’t be arsed to do another one. What more could you want?Overall, DA:O is one of the best RPGs I’ve played to date. The characters, the world, and the general gameplay are too much fun to be dented by the flaws in mechanics. It’s something I will happily replay over and over again.			"

												Grab your sword and shield because we're going on an adventure, First stop, Being born. Then we're off to fight rats in the kitchen, find your trusty mutt who turns out to be smarter than everyone else in the kingdom, seduce a visiting princess and head to bed where you're awoken by a siege to your castle. The rest of the game is a trudge across a wonderfully bland landscape dotted here and there by complete nonsense quests like Explore the dangerous swamp until you meet a sexy teenage witch who doesn't turn you into a frog. Kill ten gnolls along the way.Racist stereotypes abound, as the only intentionally attractive male character has blonde hair and blue eyes and casts snarky comments the entire adventure, and you're introduced to the party's only black character by finding him naked, shackled in a cage and saying he belongs there. You have the option to free him and bring him as a servant if you go through a complicated back'n'forth with the village leader, who hates dark skin. But in all seriousness this game is pretty chill, it's a 100+ hour modern day Baldur's Gate with decent characters, so if you're looking for another Baldur's Gate fix and don't have ADD you should consider this.Mods that are must haves:Advanced TacticsCharacter Respec ModDetailed TooltipsMadd Gift Guide + AwakeningMorrigan 3.3 and Leliana 2.8 (their default faces are fugly)No Helmet Hack + Awakening (not a single good looking helm in this game)Pretty Faces (NPC faces are fugly)Skip the Fade Manual (don't even question this, this lets you skip the ♥♥♥♥♥iest part of the game)Storage Chest (an official mod by a dev, that wasn't but into the game...)Unlock 25 Tactic Slots Extendedv2 No more Snarling (shuts that damn dog up at the camp)			"

												Hi, do you like the Baldur's Gate series? What about Planescape: Torment? Icewind Dale? Mass effect with swords and deeper character interaction? Dragon Age: Origins was made by BioWare, the makers of Baldur's Gate, to be the spiritual successor to that very same Baldur's Gate. Imagine that! Spoiler Alert: They succeeded with that.  While not without it's minor flaws, Dragon Age: Origins has the deepest dialogue and interaction with NPC party members since... well, Baldur's Gate. It's not *as* deep as Baldur's Gate or Torment, but it is certainly deeper than Mass Effect. Anyone who enjoyed any of those games should play this. Oh, and don't play Dragon Age 2. It's crap, and was really dumbed down to be a straight console game rather than a PC RPG ported to console. It's really dull, so unless that's your thing just pass on the sequel.			"

												Crashes and Freezes abound in this game. I remember having problems when originally trying to play the game in 2009 and for some reason it's worse with modern day (2014) hardware.That aside, DA is a classic. A quick history: BioWare originally gained fame by creating isometric tactical RPGs in the Dungeons and Dragons (Forgotten Realms) setting. I never looked this up, but my guess is that some suit at Hasbro wasn't able to continue that relationship with BioWare (and ultimately Electronic Arts) and so they created their own setting to create a franchise around at or around which became the Dragon Age universe.In contrast to the High Fantasy themes of Forgotten Realms, the campaign setting of Dragon Age is more Low Fantasy or Dark Fantasy. Magic is to be feared, the mood is dark and gritty, you are surrounded by despair and (to some degree) magic items are a little rare. Also in contrast to any D&D setting, characters do not seem to have direct relationships with gods (or Gods) and do not attain magical powers (i.e. healing) from them. In other words, there are healing schools in magic and no clerics.Differences in the campaign aside, DA is EXACTLY what you would expect from a BioWare game. You have exactly the same viewpoint and controls as seen in Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Neverwinter. Interactions with NPCs and companions is exactly as you would see in Mass Effect (which is the natural extension of the previously mentioned games).Lots of replay value is inherent with the different starting areas, different ways in which to approach quests and companions and multiple side quests. However, not NEARLY as much open endness within the world if you are to compare to a Bethesda, Elder Scrolls game. Multiple mods exist to enhance the game as well (check Nexus Mods)DA is a classic RPG. Whether you like it or not, however, depends on your style of RPG. Obviously it's a single player game. It's not a JRPG. It's not as open as Elder Scrolls. Tactics are of moderate importance within encounters. Lots of scripted (voice acted) dialogue with NPCs with 'some' variation, but in the end moderately rail-roaded.			"

												Dragon Age Origins: Ultimate EditionPositives:+ This game is a tactical based RPG, requiring frequent pauses in combat to issue party orders. Each class has unique strengths and weaknesses, mages, rogues and warriors alike all contribute something special to the battles. The game itself is very challenging but satisfying and fun at the same time.+ Rogues can learn the art of dual wielding and typically fit in as party DPSER, while Mages have access to a plethora of spells, from aoe and single target disables, to healing, revivals, nuke damage and more. Warriors can inflict savage damage with two handed weapons or tank enemies with a shield and armour.+ The dialogue and story in Dragons Age Origins: Ultimate Edition is amazing. Bioware are well known for their fantastic storytelling and this game is no exception. There are memorable characters who you can build friendships with and complete quests for. Romance is also an option. The main plot is well thought-out and maintains your interest. +There's a large number of side quests to complete, around 120 hours of content in total with the expansions. Plenty of moral decision making which impacts on the story progression too.+ Lots of random event encounters, with forests, temples and ancient ruins to explore, along with several cities.Mixed:~ For 2009 the graphics are not the best, but by no means are they terrible. This is definitely no reason to avoid the game.Negatives:- Some redundant skills, like trap making or survival, that don't seem to serve any useful purpose.Overall Score 9/10Dragons Age Origins: Ultimate Edition is a really solid game in pretty much every respect. Well worth purchasing on sale for $10 or less. In fact, many digital distributors are offering this price daily, so don't miss out.			"

												A Masterpiece game, that is made by a great company in Bioware. Story is always interesting, allowing you to pick your own character race and each one has their own back story. Like playing as a Human Noble, City Elf, Circle Mage, etc. Gameplay is great, with great use of a tactical system and dialogue in-game provides great fun. Graphics are great, with blood and gore. Presentation is like a story book style, and everything is easy to use. Sound in the game is great with amazing atmospheric music, and voice overs are well done. Although, it can be a bit on the low volume, so you might have to crank your volume up more than usual to hear. Also, some DLCs have come out for it to enhance the story even more. Overall, a masterpiece game. I don't remember another RPG like it, maybe except Neverwinter Nights 1			"

												I didn't start to play this game until about a year ago (2015), moving to a new place without internet and my trusty 360 (I didn't think to use my laptop as a gaming maching at that point)... I than proceeded to spend the next 4-6 months playing through all possible endings and getting all the achievements (base game).However I stopped shy of getting every achievement cause at that point I was exhausted and needed to do something else... but even after getting the sequels and trying out a plethora of other console RPG's nothing would quite get close to Dragon Age Origins.So here I am... just recently bought this game again for the PC (while it was on sale mind you, but I had my finger on purchase for a while now)- and seeing and experiencing this game as it was meant to has given me a second wind.The Landsmeet awaits.

												This game was like a great book you just can't put down until you finish. And when it did finish I was left satisfied yet wanting more. A truly immersive experience, I found myself talking to my companions, and laughing at their bickering. It features a great storyline with a different outcome depending on your choices. There is a bit of a morale system in that certain companions will like or dislike your actions and you will gain or lose reputation with them. Some companions have different morals than others so you can choose to take those who will agree with your choices and thus gain rep with them. However for the most part you'll want to choose your companions based on what classes/spells you need for battles. This game can be brutally hard with battles, but it does have a difficulty option which can be changed at any time.If you're a fan of RPG's this is a must-play. It features immersive towns and people, all of which have something to do or say. The world is full and rich, with no ""empty"" spots. However, the story is somewhat linear, so if you skip something you may not be able to go back later if you go forward in the main quest. Side quests are aplenty as are companions. You may struggle with bag space as you never know what you might need. I got around this by avoiding the crafting specialisations and selling the materials. This left room for all the loot.All in all, I'd give this a 9.5/10. Very few RPG's come close to this immersive experience.			"

												The characters of Dragon Age are memorable and the story is brutal and interesting. Gameplay of turn based combat is a lot of fun and strategic once you start understanding it. All of the main characters have fair amount of depth to them and they truly feel part of your team.The loot system and gears are varied and pretty cool. You can customize all of your characters in any way you can but a lot of the armors look way too similar and it gets boring to see legendary level armors and weapons that look the same as much cheaper ones.The setting of Dragon Age is both a strength and weakness. The places you go to are memorable and are visually amazing, but there just aren't that many places and they aren't big enough. You basically fast travel from one place to another, and the world doesn't feel big at all.Overall the fantastic story, well done characters and fun combat system definitely makes for a really fun game. The climax of the game also feels epic and hectic. Rating 85 "

Even after several playthroughs over the years, (used to have PS3 version and non-steam pc version) I have yet to see everything in this game. Your save from your DA:O playthrough can be carried over to Dragon Age 2 and your world state after finishing DA 2 can be uploaded to Dragon Age Inquisition via the Dragon Age Keep. Find out for yourself why both fans and critics say that Dragon Age: Origins is one of the best RPG's ever made. This is one of Bioware's best games. A company already known for quality RPGs. "

												When I first saw this game I expected it to be similar to Dragon Age Inquisition which I had played and thought was okay but didn't like it that much. I saw it on sale though and thought maybe I'll try it because bioware at least used to make good games like kotor. Man this game amazed me. This has easily become one of my top 3 games of all time. while the gameplay is a little outdated it's not unplayable by any means and features the best story I've ever experienced in a game. I would easily pay $60 for this game as it offers at least double what most games have now a days and also features the best dlc I've played too. The dlc is almost as good as the main game and could easily be it's own game based on how much is in it and how good it is. If you even slightly enjoy RPGs I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												I cannot say enough good things about Dragon Age: Origins. The storyline, soundtrack, characters.... all of it. It is a masterpiece. I became extremely attached to my characters, the relationships with the other members in the party, and became very invested in the story. Complemented with one of the best game soundtracks of all time, it is a truly immersive experience.This game, in every way, shape, and form is superior to its sequel: Dragon Age 2. I suspect the purchase of Bioware by EA severely diminished their creative license or gave them an unreasonable deadline. Dragon Age 2 plays like an empty shell of Origins.			"

												An amazing tactical RPG. Still holds up to scrutiny after all this time.I've just bought it a second time, just to have on my steamlist - it's that good.If you're new to the series, give the second game a miss unless it's going cheap...As with the Mass Effect games, EA pushed for a more action, less RPG and less tactics based game... to it's detriment.I've read that the devs are making the next DA game to be allot closer to the original. Which can only be a good thing.The Ultimate edition is great value, it packs some great DLC - Awakening - with some content packs that were not great value when they were released stand-alone. As a whole pack though, I'd definately recommend teh ultimate edition over the main game on it's own.			"

												As a warning, I'm not done with this game yet.This is a story-rich Roleplaying Game where you play as one of the last of an order of protectors fighting to save the world. The setting is a fantasy one with not too many departures from tropes. Characters are generally written well enough. You have a party with which you can develop a variety of relationships including romances. Combat plays like an MMO, but has some extra things that allow you to play more strategically.There's plenty of content and quests to do as well as things to explore in your character's journey.If you like Western RPGs this is well-made one with a story that has depth and a world filled with enemies to rid it of in your travels.

												Customizable characters, difficult decisions (no red or blue or right or wrong like other games), funny dialouge between characters, epic boss fights, weapons, romance, and over 100hrs of gameplay.....What more could you ask for from an RPG game. The main story is amazing. You will laugh, cry, and ponder about you're past decisions as you progress through the many hours of the game. Always was a fan of the original dragon age orgins edition, so buying the Ultimate was a no brainer for me. The DLCs whether following the main story or occuring after the main story may not be the longest, but they are definitely interesting and will leave you wanting to knwo what happens next. The Awakening DLC is fantastic though; being able to lead the Graywardens and make decisions not just for yourself but for a city of people is stressful , but rewarding. Also being able to be reunited with former friends and make many new ones is also a nice change in pace. The darkspawn in this dlc are also more interesting since there are those who talk and do things with a purpose not just because they can. Overall, get this game!!! Whether its the regular edition or the Ultimate Edition, either one wil be worth every last buck.			"

												I only have like 20 hours on steam with this game, but on console I have well over 200, and I have beaten origins along with awakening with 6 different characters and my favorite to play with is the mage. Having said all of that, this is easily in my top 5 games of all time. I love the story line and how in depth it can get with desicions, and the desicions actually matter in dragon age, they affect quests, what people (mainly your party) think of you, and change the ending. The combat can be a little slow and clunky at times, but this doesnt really deter me. I prefer the big hot bar of spells and talents to the button mash system that is implemented in many newer RPGs (dragon age 2). If you want hours upon hours of in depth gameplay, in depth and deep if not sometimes tear jerking story, character romance, great boss fights with killer rewards then this is the game for you. I highly reccomend it, and at the price it's at now, it's more than worth it.			"

If you like this style of game, it's a great example of the genre - each race and background comes with its own unique starting plotline, and both the main story of the game and the many side quests are well-written. There are lots of party members to interact with, each with their own backstory and set of quests to look into, and you can form relationships with nearly all of them. Well worth the price.			"

												Great game with replay value. Depending on what race, class, and origin you pick, the world will react differently to you and you react differently to the world. Also, your party influences some options as well, but only minimally so.			"

												Dragon Age: Origins is an incredible game.  This game is much more user-friendly on PC than console. The story is very interesting and engrossing.  The ingame lore adds an insane amount of depth and texture to the game.  DA:O is a very solid RPG.			"

												This game is seriously so much fun. I've had it less than a month and I've already put in like 100 hours. It's insanely addictive and there's just so much story to it. And it's a GOOD story, too. Highly recommended. And this from someone who really doesn't consider himself a gamer in the traditional sense of the word.			"

												An amazing tactical RPG. Still holds up to scrutiny after all this time.I've just bought it a second time, just to have on my steamlist - it's that good.If you're new to the series, give the second game a miss unless it's going cheap...As with the Mass Effect games, EA pushed for a more action, less RPG and less tactics based game... to it's detriment.I've read that the devs are making the next DA game to be allot closer to the original. Which can only be a good thing.The Ultimate edition is great value, it packs some great DLC - Awakening - with some content packs that were not great value when they were released stand-alone. As a whole pack though, I'd definately recommend teh ultimate edition over the main game on it's own.			"

												Great RPG if you're a fan of NWN, Elder Scrolls, Witcher etc. Character and story-line carry-over in DLC/expansion are amazing features too.			"

												the plot of Dragon Age is extremely rich with details that unfold over dozens of hours of play. All of this is documented in your in-game codex, which tracks conversations, plot points and other elements of your journey. The general backstory revolves around the Darkspawn threat to the land of Ferelden. Darkspawn are a race of creatures born from magic users who attempted to become gods, but were cursed for their efforts. Led by the powerful Arch-demon, the beasts emerge from underground lairs every few hundred years in a swarming plague known as the Blight.  "
