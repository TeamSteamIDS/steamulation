												My god, This game. I cant belive that i missed it when it was released, this game is just pure greatness. I think this is the best ""mount and blade"" game in the series. Its kinda similar to the last game , ""Mount and blade : warband"", but new additions are improved graphics and guns. Gunplay really makes this game unique as the combat in this game is best i have seen in a while. You fire your inaccurate musket or bow from range, and on close combat you try to kill your enemies with a sword, and block enemys attacks, if you master the timing, you can easily take down large group of enemies. It adds bit of reality and cool skill ceiling to the game.In singleplayer, you start as a little poor villager, you can Travel around the map, Take quests , trade ,rob caravans, besiege castles , recruit men and much more. When you start to Get some money and experience , you will start to Get better gear and armor, and you start expanding your army. You can ally with factions and conquer the other factions. Its awesome when at start you rob small bandit groups with your Little army of mens recruited from villages, and after some time, you have army of 100 of mens, and you Attack an enemy faction castle along with your Friendly Armies. Singleplayer is like big sandbox, you can just be trader and make loads of profits, you can be bandit and rob caravans, you can create your own faction and conquer lands, or ally with other factions and eliminate others. You can get hours and hours and hours of fun.    This game also has really entertaining multiplayer, first you create the way your multiplayer character looks like, then you hop in the battle. Usually there are about 50 players in same match, other team is defending castle and other is attacking it. You can buy equiment like better armor with gold (you get more gold when you get kills). There are also classic deathmatch , battle and other game modes. I just love the multiplayer, it feels amazing when musketeers fire their muskets and throw their grenades and trough the smoke charges cavalry trying to stab poor foot soldiers and as the armies meet begins hectic sword play.     Also, this game has really active mod community which helps this game survive on the long runI Cant recommend this game enough , it really is worth the price			"

												What can I say about this game?UPDATE!!!!: While the gameplay itself is absolutely phenominal, there is a MAJOR drawback that I discovered once I was finally given a castle to oversee. Beyond the challenge of getting your best friend, the King, to give you a little slice to call your own, when the budget screen shows up for each town/castle/village you own, instead of putting every tariff and expense on a single sheet with a breakdown of each category as was done in basic Warband, here they point out to you EACH AND EVERY thing you have had built, and every person you have had hired for EACH AND EVERY town, castle, and village. As I mentioned in my first review, there are a lot of options for each location you own. Now imagine every week in game, you are bombarded by a 30 page dissertation of every individual expansion you have ordered. It makes the game *almost* unplayable. This is the only major drawback of the game that I have found. If you can cope with this first paragraph, read on and see why I would still reccommend keeping a dictionary handy to check your sperling and that you should purchase Mount and Blade with Fire and Sword!It's fan-freaking-tastic!!I loved the original, but lets face it, there comes a point when there is no more challenge or suprise to obliterating your opponents on the field of battle. That game was drying up for me, it was finished.Then this little gem appeared, and the love was reborn!The game is the same concept; pick a faction, crush the opposition.What makes this game so great? They give you freaking muskets, pistols, and grenades!The reload spead is faster than reality, but who wants to stand around reloading all the time?But the powder weapons, even at their worst stats are devastating. The grenades are a lot of fun, but leave a bit to be desired. You can choose from three different sizes: Small medium and large. (Sounds like a freaking fast food menu, right?) The problem with each of them is they do not replenish after each battle as bullets and arrows do. But hey, they're already OP, so theres gotta be a drawback somewhere, right? Now here's where I have an issue with the game: Some unknown set of circumstances casues them to explode but do no damage. (Believe me, Im not missing. When you are taking the walls and you are the first one up, get to the top of the ladder and look down at the horde waiting for you [units set at 150]. You cant miss a target like that if you tried. So after the first two grenades, the rest seem to stop working.) But with any of the three types of grenades, you can expect 3-4 kills with one throw. Oh! There is nothing more satisfying than watching a surge of blood-thirsty warriors coming at you with every ounce of confidence that you are going to be splattered across the walls. Then with a single throw, 7 of them just drop dead. And the rest? Well, there seems to be a large impact on morale with these explosions. Sometimes you dont even have to hit anyone. They hear these beasts go off nearby, and that's all for them! FT! Im done!!Another drawback to this game: They took out a lot of the weapons you could get in the original. My favorite was the heavy axe (Or something it was a one-hamded axe, dealing 40c) and they also took out the lucern (Fudge spealling, the pole-hammer) both gone. Replaced now by generic fencing swords and eastern equivalents. The game is still entirely playable, but you just yearn for your tried and true steel buddies of old. Other features of note: You can upgrade and armor recruits at mercenary camps. Each camp has their own nationality and their upgrades only affect that nationality. (Rascist, I know) In cities and Castles/fortresses: You can visit Weapon, Armor, and Horse masters to order ""custom"" associated gear. There is also a WONDERFUL new adition of the Merchant Guild!! Leave a couple thousand Thaler (money) at the ""bank"" and let it accrue interest. Theres even more to mention, but if you even managed to get this far in my review, I salute you! If you liked Warband, just stop reading and get Fire and Sword already! You wont regret it!			"

												Mount and Blade is the secret handshake between PC gamers in the know. It's the last revelation of a secret society. Everything that makes PC gaming great is here. Unique gameplay that would never sell on a console, History nerd heaven, MODS out the Kaiser, and fun mulitplayer.With Fire and Sword is also an amazing entry in the series. The new weapon types shake up gameplay in wonderful ways. The setting is unique for players too. If you are not playing any of the Mount and Blade series, you aren't living properly.I would say that With Fire and Sword may not be the perfect introduction to the series for a new player. Warband, then Napoleonic Wars will acclimate you to this game.			"

												I honestly love this game, despite the many things that are much worse than Warband. For one, the graphics are a tad worse (not that i care anyway), it is slightly buggier, and personally i find some of the armour in this game to be absolutely hideous, understanding that this is a different culture of course. but lets get to a list, shall we?Pros:-Guns!-Explosives!-crouching!-seems to run smoother than Warband-You can hire and customize mercenaries of your choice-more indepth caravan system-fighting feels more challenging, in a good way-for sieges, there are more options to choose from before commencing the assualt. also you can blow holes in the wall-this is more of a personal thing, but, different cultures and factions, like Sweden and Poland (although i do love Warband's factions)-you can have a not-so-fancy-gentlemen's-duel with random drunk tavern guests, (this is where the thrust only swords can come in handy)Cons:-Enemy firearms can be OP at low levels-some weapons are specifically thrust only-rather boring early game-the map is rather bland compared to Warband-the explosives have a limit(this is more of a nitpick for me, cuz it IS realistic), if you have 5 bombs and use 5 bombs in one battle, you have to buy another 5 bombs because the other 5 bombs get removed from your inventory. Did i mention 5 bombs?-Modding is more limited, unlike Warband's Module system That is about all i can think of right now. If you do get this game, I recommend looking up the WFAS Enhanced mod to make your experience a little better			"

												When Mount & Blade came out, it was an ambitious project that did not reach its full potential. The first standalone expansion  (Warband) added some key improvements to the formula, but ultimately it felt like a re-release of the first game with just short of enough new content to justify paying full price for it if you already owned Mount & Blade. With Fire & Sword is the breath of... semi-fresh air that the series needed. The essentials of the gameplay remain almost identical (except for the great addition of powerful firearms and some other additions, which force the player to come up with new tactics). However, it is the setting of this game that really sets it apart from the two previous M&B titles.Based on Henryk Sienkiewicz's historical novel ""Ogniem i mieczem"", the game pushes us back to a period in real world history instead of fiction. We are taken to mid-17th century Eastern Europe, where the once great Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is facing war with multiple of its neighbouring nations. This is where the facts end, as the player can choose to ally himself/herself with any of the real factions included in the game (the 'Polish Commonwealth', the 'Kingdom of Sweden', the 'Cossack Hetmanate', the 'Muscovite Tsardom' or the 'Crimean Khanate') and alter the course of history. Alternatively, like in Warband, you may choose to form your own kingdom or simply remain neutral throughout the duration of the game.Ultimately, the gameplay of With Fire & Sword is refined to such an extent that it feels like the most well-designed of the first three M&B titles. However, it is still very similar to the previous games and suffers from the same main flaws at the core: lack of significant unique content in terms of story. The cold and calculated nature of the tasks and actions the player is permitted to do in the game may get tedious after a while of playing. If you didn't enjoy M&B, then perhaps you should skip this one unless you really like history. On the other hand, if you enjoyed Mount & Blade then I see no reason why you shouldn't like this game (its unique and unusual setting, which explores a period in history rarely ever mentioned in video games, makes this experience more interesting).

												Mount&Blade: With Fire and Sword takes place in the middle of the 17th century, its about evolving your character into either a bandit, lord or even a king. The game has 5 main factions: The Cossack Hetmanate, Polish Commonwealth, Crimean Khanate, the Kingdom of Sweden, and the Muscovite TsardomMount&Blade: With Fire and Sword is just like every other Mount&Blade game, addicting, fun, amazing, any good word that comes up in your head. There ARE bugs, but not much. It doesn't cost much, worth every single cent.My rating: 9.5/10			"

												Singleplayer Grade 7/10 (mainly due to bugs)Multiplayer Grade 8/10 (If you buy this game for multiplayer, remember to check if there are still active players online playing this game)IMPORTANT:1) TRY FREE DEMO BEFORE PURCHASING!2) Mount & Blade Warband is much better and it has mods that bring firearms to the game.Short review: Like mount & blade Warband, but in different setting. If you hate idea of firearms in this kind of game you shouldn't buy this game. The grade is lower than in Warband, due to some problems in gameplay and large amount of gamebraking bugs.Full review:The singleplayer of this game gives you the possibility to lead mercenary warband in the setting of 17th century eastern europe. Like in mount and Blade warband, the experience is generally exciting and unique. Unlike Mount & blade Warband, which is like huge sandbox, this game tries to create what many consider the the Holy Grail of gaming , which is combining story and sandbox gameplay. Unfortunately the developers failed in this in many ways.First problem is that many players didn't care at all about the story and wanted to play sandbox game, but this was difficult due to the fact that unlike in Warband, you can't create your own kingdom. You can't get married either and there are no tournaments. Because of these and some other reasosn he RPG and sandbox elements are lacking compared to Warband.Second problem is that if you follow the story (I played the Black Mace campaign which on my opinion unfortunately wasn't interesting) you will face problems. The first one of those are huge amount of bugs, that force you to load your saved game many times during the campaing. Many of these bugs are related to the fact that the world of the game changes usually independently comapred to the story. Even when these changes don't cause actual bugs, they can seriously hamper the players attempst to progress in the story. I was for example given task to capture certain city from hostile country Poland, but by the time I had army to capture it, neutral country Crimean Kahanate had already taken it. In order to capture the town, my country would have to start war also against them. This would have been almost certain defeat due to getting into war in two fronts.Third problem is the setting. Some people might be scared about the strange setting, but that is not what is the main problem. The problem that the setting causes is that it affects the gameplay negatively. In mount & Blade Warband, the player can both be commander of his/her troops and also be the superhero in shining armour that kills dozens of enemies on his/her own. This is even somewhat historical because armour made medieval knights very difficult to kill. In Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword, half of those filthy peasants :-) that you used to kill without trouble are now armed with firearms, that kill you with one or two shots on hardest difficulty. Even on lower difficulty levels it is difficult to be superhero anymore. The one shot kill firearms also make melee weapons relatively weak, which is a shame, because one of the best things in Mount & Blade series is the melee combat.Despite the severe problems in singleplayer I gave this game grade of 7, because the basic mechanics of Mount & Blade series are still there and they are great.Multiplayer part is good, mainly due to the uniqueness of Mount & blade combat. The reason to not to give 9/10 for multiplayer is that there are no modifications for multiplayer unlike in Warband, and because the gameplay is slightly worse due to what firearms cause to the gameplay.

												Tis a good but nuanced game. I could only recommend it to people who really like Mount & Blade and are interested in Polish history. Game has promised patches that never came, the ""Black Mace"" story quest (Ukraine/Zhaparozhie) is still broken IIRC haven't done it recently. The game is also incredibly imbalanced and the firearms are the worst of it. The sad part is that it's not the inclusion of the firearms, but rather their mechanics. You can reload a a full-length rifle while galloping on horseback, I'm not even exaggerating sadly. Like I said good but nuanced game. Only buy if you really like M&B and Polish history.			"

												Aye, over thousand hours have been sunk in Mount & Blade With Fire and Sword.And why I've sunk so many hours in this game, you may ask,The answer is: because I really love the time period of this game and I find it most interesting part of history.But let me tell you what the game is:The game is basically reskin of Warband with muskets with the singleplayer which is a sniper simulator in a nutshell. Nothin' to add that.Multiplayer is: Full of pike-spammers (is that even a real term?) Badmins who ban you without hesitation Musket snipers (other strange term)Horse archers who can snipe you from miles away Stupidly fast infantry (like Crimea and Cossacks) who can almost outrun a horse.I have very negative thoughts of this game and only good thing is the time period of game.If you want a masochist experience then this is the game for you!Edit: review updated with more explanatory content and (hopefully) better grammar.Edit 2: got banned from a siege server because I was better than the admin in combat.

												You know, i dont know how many reviews says get Warband instead. I wanted to begin with With Fire and Sword, and do Warband later.But if you are looking for modding directly. Then go Warband directly.Just make sure first to play With Fire and Sword if you like the time period, atmosphere and nations, if you like those, this can be the best of MB serie for you,with true to life Euro-asian nations and etnicities.    Whole game is very ethno...Interesting and funny wars. Also challenging achievements.. All broken.This game is little buggy. But most bugs can be overcome with enough persistance and patience. Persistance and patience, are key to its gameplay too, as 90% of the game, you will travel as a courier, riding around with foods.If you have patience for all that, you will never give up on this game, you will enjoy it even more. It is a personal preference.11/10			"

Also, as soon as you enter towns,villages,cities or whatever, it says all of the rumors. There are some other cool things, like you can have a bank acount, you can send your hero chaters to universties.			"

												This game is fantastic. I've put hundreds of hours into it, and I'll likely put hundreds of house more into it. Takes place in the real world in mid-17th century Eastern Europe. There's 5 factions; Muscovite Tsardom (Russia), Sweden, Poland, Crimean Khanate (Crimea, which is a location in the game), and the Cossacks. You'll meet people from these areas as well as Spaniards, Frenchmen, Germans, and even Scotsmen. There are muskets, and because of the time period, they come in a variety of flavours. Home made, matchlock, wheel lock, and Miquelet (flintlock) are the main ones, in order of quality. Accuracy is in short supply of course, but I do believe there are some rifled muskets in the game, however they are VERY expensive, and not something you can give normal soldiers. Only your own character, and heroes.You amass your own Army, there are many different endings, and there are many different ways to fight. Personally I like to position my cavalry to the side, while my infantry takes 10 paces in front of my marksmen to defend them from enemy cavalry, while my own cavalry does the same. If the enemy bowmen/musketmen get too close for my liking, I'll send in my infantry to charge them, make them switch from ranged attack to melee, so that my own musketman can help quell them while they're busy with my infantry and cavalry. Works very well for me so far, as you can tell it's all basically revolving around my musketmen, but the infantry and cavalry certainly have their place. Without one or the other, I would feel vulnerable. You can cavalry if you like, or perhaps just stick with infantry and musketmen, or even exchange the musketmen for bowmen but you best have some DAMN strong bowmen with some DAMN strong bows because as troops come with heavier armour, those arrows quickly start doing less and less damage, however muskets will always do a lot of damage... when the shots hit. Thick shields and thick armour combined can really lessen a musket's effectiveness however.There's lots of quests, lots of cities and towns, lots of different methods to take in order to secure victory, the replay value is VERY MUCH present, and as many battles as I take part in, it never seems to get old. The tutorial is entertaining enough, complete with voice acting, but it's not something that drags out annoyingly long. It puts you in the action quite quickly, and then you're free to go, Eastern Europe is yours to explore! Though there are some muskets that are so accurate you'd think them rifled, there's always bullet drop, so you'll have to learn to compensate for that. It just adds to the gameplay however, which though simple, is difficult to master, and I'd have it no other way. Like Call of Pripyat with Misery mod (and The Armed Zone if you REALLY want to be overloaded with firearm selection), and like Red Orchestra II/Rising Storm, I expect to ultimately end up with 1000+ hours in this game as the years go by. Sure it doesn't look particularly pretty, but there's a unique appeal to it that I've yet to find in any other game or mod. An experience in and of itself.The process of leveling up, improving my various aspects, getting better gear, customizing ther Mercenaries available for hire at Mercenary Camps, training them up from Recruit, to Experienced, to Veteran, to Elite... it's so much fun that I've lost count of how many time I've restarted the game. A clean slate starting at day 1, my current playthrough is over 450 days in-game, over a year's worth, my Army is at a max of about 87-88 troops, however when I put the coin down for Mercenaries with ALL the best equipment I can give them, then train them together with a few of my heroes to work them up to Veterans and Elites, my less than 90 soldiers feels more like 150-200 or more, usually depending on how many muskets the enemy is bringing to the battlefield. If none, it feels like I've got 300 troops, might even be gutsy enough to take on 350 if all they have is bowmen, but that might be reaching a bit too far. All the same, there's such a wide range of armour, melee weapons, bows, muskets, horses, troops, and so on... the variety is amazing. Ultimately though, we all know that muskets would come to rule the battlefields in the 18th and early-mid 19th centuries, so although most of the muskets in the game are primitive matchlocks, it can only be expected that they'd ultimately be superior. That said however... armoured, well trained, and well equipped bowmen vs unarmoured, untrained, and ill-equipped musketmen? I'd put my money on the bowmen any day of the week. You don't pick up a musket and you're suddenly invincible. If you see a hussar barreling at you on horseback with lance couched, as of yet untouched on the battlefield, a single musket ball will likely do little more than ♥♥♥♥ him off, you'll want a second one to finish the job, but if he gets you with that lance, musket or no, you're equally dead both ways. Some say that cavalry with muskets is all you need, but cavalry can only use carbines of pistols, and not only that, firing on horseback isn't as accurate as firing on the ground, so not only does fool soldiers with muskets have more accurate firearms that cause more damage, they also have the advantage of firing on the ground. However once they have to be forced to use melee, the shooting stops, and if the enemy is still shooting or firing arrows, then you're at a heavy disadvantage, which is where the infantry comes into play. Troops trained in melee combat, often given better melee weaponry, have them positioned to protect your musketmen, just as pikemen had done before the advent of the bayonet. If the fighting becomes stagnant though, with the musketmen a mere 50m away, sending in volley after volley, order the infantry to charge, get up in their faces so they can't keep their muskets spitting, but keep your men firing lead balls into them. Yes, just like chess, there are many ways to attain victory. Find your own way, your own troops, your own tactics, and take 17th century Eastern Europe for your own! HUZZAH!			"

												BUTThe reason I don't recommend this game is because it's predecessor (M&B: Warband) is an absolute gem with essentially the exact same graphics and gameplay but for me it just feels.. better. If you haven't tried it then you should go pickup Warband and if you have played Warband then I'm here to warn you that F&S is just a little bit off.I can't quite put my finger on it; perhaps it's the strategical considerations that come into play with the introduction of firearms, or perhaps it simply wasn't balanced quite as well, but either way F&S on the whole is just not as enjoyable to me as Warband. Both are exceptionally unique and fantastic games but I would either buy Warband if you're new to Mount and Blade or stick with Warband if you're a fan of the series.			"

												I spent 5 years trying to come up with a funny review for this game. I failed. Now, I'm gonna stick with the good ol' boring, wannabe helpful review.I don't have an idea why I didn't reviewed this game for so long but seeing those fresh recruitments (thx to bannerlord I guess), I decided to be helpful to those who consider buying this game as a committed player of the series, started playing Mount and Blade in November 2009 and spent many days&nights playing it since then.Comparison to the previous games; Even tho scenarios to take the throne of some nations (like Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Russia) were added as a unique feature to it's predecessors, Single player was a little... dull. Despite using firearms, siege artillery still wasn't added to the game. There are some features like; ordering a weapon for yourself, changing equipment of the mercenaries from their camps for a price (yeah, they have camps now) etc. but also It didn't have marriage or creating your own kingdom/empire so they took some things out, put some in.Multiplayer on the other hand was quite entertaining, especially clan battles. So just go for it If you want to pvp. Even tho, the era of clans is over, you won't have trouble finding a server if it's not late night or morning. Multiplayer is still not dead! The game isn't demanding and most likely to run smoothly on ancient rigs. (Hello 128 MB Video Card)  Graphics are ok, not great but ok. (Graphics wasn't the MB's strong suit anyways). As for the price, It's cheaper than what it deserves right now.* I give it a 7/10, feels incomplete in so many levels but also doesn't fail to keep you entertained. At the current price, It's worth it.			"

												This is a very nice and a heck of an addictive game! It is very much like Warband, but with a few major differences: firearms - drastically changes the combat; grenades - probably the most fun part of the game; realistic world map and city names - makes it a lot easier for the player to connect to the in-game world. But the most important thing for me is that I can hire an army of my ancestors - the Kalmyks.

												YEs! this game has everything that made Warband great plus early era guns and cannons! i put off playing it for a while, because i was worried the guns would be too overpowered and sometimes they can be. you can be mid to late game and be a super high level with tons of health and armor and get murdered by a couple stray bullets, but it's not something that's going to happen a lot. especially if you play smart. i think this game requires much more strategy than Warband. in warband, by the time i've level 40 or so, i can wade into a battle and kill 20-50 people on my own and it's much harder to do that in this one because of how much damage guns can do. you also tend to have more casualties during battle and numbers tend to matter more. it's like they took all the good parts about warband and added to it. more quests, a new world, new factions, more and different weapons (including primitive grenades). beyond all that, the various factions have their own storylines which i did not need, but kind of love. playing as the polish will have some different quests from the swedish which are different from the russians which is different from the crimeans. the addition of the story elements add some believability to the various relations between the factions because you learn why they like the factions they like and hate the factions they hate.if you played warband and like it, you'll most likely enjoy this game too. if you haven't played warband, i recommend getting the mount and blade full collection and playing warband first, then coming to this, because there are some major differences in gameplay. i assure you the addition of guns and bombs adds much more depth and strategy to this game than warband had to it. that's not to say warband was bad or too easy, just that guns make it easier to kill than swords. which we all already knew anyway.

												TL;DR It's a fun game but Mount and blade warband is better.Let me explain. I bought this game on a sale because guns sound a lot more fun and warband was more expensive. So I bought this and the original mount and blade. The problem with this game is that the single player is hard. Like really hard. It's hard earning money, there is no real tutorial to learn you how to start your own empire or join an existing empire etc.My first time playing my men were starving, I had ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons and I was fighting bandits in hope that I could pay for my soldiers and food. Eventually my luck ran out and I lost everything. This has been a theme for my experience with the singleplayer. It's fun if you know how to play and earn money without going to tournaments and cheating the system like in warband. So why do I have so many hours on it? Well the multiplayer is awesome. Shooting people with muskets and ♥♥♥♥ is a ton of fun. It's a bit like the napoleonic dlc for warband, which is a ton of fun, but more derpy. I guess this is where I conclude my review. This game is fun if you know how to play, the multiplayer is the best part and I've played a lot of it however the singleplayer is somewhat lacking and where the previous games were fun this one is too difficult and time consuming. I've put 20 hours or so into the singleplayer but I just don't get into it.			"

UPDATE: As much as I would like to get into this game more its pretty boring compared to Warband. Plus I hate the looks of the clothing and weapons.While Mount and Blade: With Fire & Sword isn't as fun as Warband, it's still pretty awesome. I've read both positive and negative reviews for this game and I can see how it can go either way. I personally enjoy this game, it gives you an entirely new perspective on the world forcing the player to adapt to a new environment very quickly. I find making enemies much easier in With Fire & Sword than it was in Warband, so you need to watch what you do or you could find yourself alone against an army.Mount and Blade: With Fire & Sword is very similar to Warband only in a different era (The 17th Century to be exact). Here's my breakdown of WFaS:PROS+ Includes 21 Steam Achievements (Some more challenging to get than others)+ Requirements are low allowing this game to be played on almost every computer+ All Castles & Fortresses have Taverns (Unlike in Warband it was just the towns)+ Ability to chat with the Mayor/Elders directly from the town menu (Unlike in Warband you had to find them yourself)+ Ability to make a wagon fort (Allows for a better defense perimeter in Battles, but does not necessarily give you an avantage)CONS- No Steam Trading Cards- Larger quantity of Bandits/Looters/Enemies than in WarbandWHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? WITH FIRE AND SWORD! (BUY THIS GAME)My Rating: 9/10 (Recommended) "

												Fantastic and fun game. Not as good as Warband but once you get out of the beginning phase it's a very enjoyable game.... at least until major quest givers disapear from the ♥♥♥♥ing mapI wasted 20 hours on a character. I was nearing the end of the Muscovite questline, at the point where you rebel with the claimant to the Tsar's throne and declare yourself the grandson of Dimitry.So in that quest you have to get support of a certain warlord. Nikita Odeovseky or something. Naturally, the first thing I do is go find the nearest Muscovite warlord to ask where Mr. Nikita is. ""I don't know where Warlord Nikita Ovaryscars is"". Hmm maybe this is something for the quest and i'm supposed to go to the only fortress he lives in. Nope that doesn't seem like it. Maybe I have to wait. So I set up camp for a week. Nothing. Talk to another lord and ask where this jackass is. ""I don't know where he is.""Okay something's ♥♥♥♥y.Save and quit. Enable cheats. Control + T in order to view everything on the map. Can't find this guy's party. He isn't in any Muscovite castle chilling like a ♥♥♥♥♥. Maybe he's prisoner somewhere and I need to break him out! :OI spend 15 minutes scanning this damned map looking at every prisoner garrison of every castle, town, and noble for this warlord. Nope. He's gone.Okay ♥♥♥♥ this save is broken. Maybe I'll restart, export the character, inflate his skills and give him cash, then breeze through back to where I was. K cool.2 hours into going back through the beginning dumb-♥♥♥♥ hardass phase of blah blah ♥♥♥ kissing nobles and take this letter across the map to this guy who is definitely at this town but by the time you get there he's somewhere else. Great now to initiate the quest I had started. No time wasting now.Gotta find the Tsar.Go ask nearest warlord where Tsar Mikhaelovich is.""I do not know where Tsar Mikhaelovich is""where's a gun			"

It contains dynamic squads you can command that adjust to player count and a whole but load of new content, maps, and server side mods with battles of 300-400+ units cooperatively and up to 30 other players.

Pros:+Firearms+Grenades+Additional siege options (sneak through town, blow up wall, poison water supply)+Campaigns+More town/empire management+Real map locations+Can trade in castles (was not able to in Warband)+Bank/debt system (however simple it might be)+Can place orders on the best equipment from various venders (new feature)Neutral:~New siege system. Multiple ladders instead of one. Good if you are an attacker, bad if you are defender. ~Gameplay. Overpowered bullet damage forces you to keep your distance and player smarter. Cons:-HORRIBLE SIEGE AI. ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS. Half the time your troops or the enemy is just standing there, doing absolutely NOTHING or they keep switching their weapons back and forth, whilst doing nothing. -Bugs. CTD bugs after tabbing out, finishing a battle, or just traversing the map sometimes. 'Line error' messages and more bugs sometimes after battles and quest completions. And then you can also shoot someone and the bullet will go behind and not do any damage. Extremely annoying.-Campaign intructions are vague and hard to figure out. You will end up using google to complete missions. I guarantee it. -Tax revenue from towns is no longer automatic. You have to visit your town to collect.Overall, it is a step down from Warband. Sure, you can say ""but guns, so cool, much wow. pew pew gg"" but these new additions do NOT make up for the sloppy AI and the bugs. The ""RAAHH CHARGE!!!! I'LL KILL 50 OF YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S!!"" feeling at the beginning of every battle is not the same as it is in Warband, there's more of a risk to go in balls deep forcing you to stay back in every battle.TL;DR - Do not buy this game if you are looking to get into the Mount & Blade series, buy Warband instead.. Vanilla (unmodded) Warband offers a similar experience but with less of the hassle. Modded Warbands offers a superior experience, and it has a wide array of mods in comparison.			"

												Its actually challenging! Instead of just spamming rhodoks or nords you actually have to think here. Musketeers are vital to a healthy strong army, but are terrible in combat, infantry is high damage but not very hardy and calvary is EXTREMELY EXSPENSIVE but hold a raw power unseen by any force on earth besides the German Blitzkrieg, but be warned, these arent the Swadian tanks weve come to love, charging a musketeer wall head on is a mistake and you WILL lose men! constantly refresh your reserves. As always make sure to keep your factions kept within your army to one or two as desertion is common. Be warned, you are no longer the god wielding death and mayhem with your heavy armor and two handed weapons as seen in warband, shaking off all but the most powerful blows, in this game you are very, very vulnerable early game and even late game you are still able of being beaten. Armor and weapons are exspensive and money can be hard to come by, COMPLETE FAVORS TO GET MEN. PERIOD. GET DAT TOWN RELATION STAT AS HIGH AS A KITE BECAUSE WITOUT IT YOUR ARMY WILL DWINDLE! AND IF YOU RUN INTO DESERTERS EARLY GAME PAY THEM OFF! THESE ARE NOT THE IDIOTIC NORD AXEMEN THAT YOU CAN RIDE AROUND AND SABRE ONE BY ONE, THESE ARE MEN WITH MUSKETS AND CALVARY OF THEIR OWN THAT CAN AND WILL 1 HIT KILL YOU, YOUR FOLLOWERS, AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR MEN. MY FIRST PLAYTHROUGH I HAD 20 SCYTHE WIELDERS AND RAN INTO 6 WINGED HUSSARS. NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS CAPTURED AND MY ARMY DECIMATED. GREAT GAME			"

												Here's the thing - if you're looking for the best mount & blade to buy and can only afford one of them, this is, sadly, not the choice to make. I love this game but Warband is the superior one, although this one has guns for the campaign, the gameplay is better and warband and there's just not anything new here. I enjoy both of the games, but this game does lack in comparison. Now is it a bad game? Hell no. I love using a two-handed claymore one minute and switching to a pistol for the next wave of enemies, and having a group of 100 men with nearly all of them using muskets is so satisfying when you can watch them shoot down the entire enemy group. If you can afford both mount and blades grab both of them, and while you'll throw more hours into the other, you'll get a great amount of game time and fun from this one as well to make your purchase worth it. Just wait for a sell first.			"

I honestly wouldnt buy this game, if you have the money for Warband. If you have the 20$ (or only like 3ish dollars on sale) Buy Warband, It's an excellent game. But this one is still ok, its basically the same concept as Warband except it is set in Eastern Europe and there are guns...It has OP guns in the beginning and the map isnt huge. The armor is weak and the weapons are too...I'm just reccomending this to not hurt the series. It is much more difficult than Warband and honestly not as fun. Just get Warband.			"

												Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword is on of the greatest strategy games (in my humble opinion) of all time. Not only can you command your army, but you can do so while playing as your own character. The multiplayer part of this game is not very famous, by that i mean not many people play it, yet it still gives you a sense of trying to get better and and improve at it to better yourself to someday beat someone who slayed you before. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games and doesnt mind to learn from mistakes.			"

												okay my review:Maps 5.5/10.0Well you might ask me: why so low score? just because they didnt make castles historically accurate, and just a few unique buildings, while the eastern europe was filled of them. Example: my country's capital Vilna (Lithuanian spelling: Vilnius) had a river getting into two pieces, a very steep hill with a great tower on top and walls surrounding. the tower on hill is even today staying there. you could google it too. Trakai, that village nearby, was no worse, it had huge great fort in a island which was in a huge lake, altho what i've seen was a random village with a few houses ingame. The map could've been more accurate.Combat + Units 8.0/10.0The game, has great combat, altho sometimes AI gets easily stuck or it forgets to fight and other funny buggy things. sometimes they even bug out so hard, but still its good.But the units, you could've make a bigger variety of them, because i am pretty sure there was not a lack of unit kinds there. I like the ones that you made, but some are little inaccurate.Storylines + Quests 7.5/10.0The Quests from cities are a little boring: if you do much of them, they repeat quickly...Storylines are good, but sometimes buggy.Factions 9.5/10Well they're great, but it would've been more amazing if we wouldve had prussia, ottomans, austrians too!Overall calculated rating of these things from me is 7.625/10.000			"

												This is a mod of the original version of Mount & Blade. The primary focus of this mod is the singleplayer campaign revolving around the formation of the Moscovite Tsardom of Russia, the Swedish Deluge into Poland, and the Crimean Khanate Incursion into Kiev; this is the modern day area of Eastern Sweden, Poland, Ukraine, and Western Russia. The big gameplay change is the inclusion of firearms; however since this is based on the original Mount & Blade, the Player will automatically lose the battle if his character is knocked out. With the inclusion of volley fire firearms, the player character can be knocked out with a single bullet, causing the gameplay to suffer greatly. The second large addition to this mod is 3 unique questlines revolving around the kingdoms of Poland, Cossack Ukraine, and Moscovite Russia. However, the questlines are near impossible to complete without a guide, are buggy, and poorly translated.With the singleplayer losing most of its charm with combat being against the player's favor, and the quests being difficult, requiring guides, buggy, AND uninteresting, I cannot recommend this game.The multiplayer is an interesting take, but the Napoleonic Wars mod for Warband handles firearms much better. I recommend M&B: Warband over this game. Free Warband mods are vastly better than this one.			"

												Buy Warband instead. The difficulty between this game and Warband has been increased greatly, which isn't a bad thing. Once you got a hang of Warband the AI got fairly easy. Unfortunately success in this game is not only greatly more difficult, especially at the lower levels, but often your success in matters are not only random, but often the odds of missions you are given are literally impossible.If the only issue was difficulty it'd not be a problem. But mission scaling is horrendously broken. If you take a mission, especially at the lower levels, you have typically less than a fifty percent chance of finishing it. I would say the game is just too difficult, but I've nearly mastered Warband and I can't play this one for more than a few minutes without either losing and getting captured, or save scumming.			"

												Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword is an RPG based game with the freedom to do whatever you want. In Fire and Sword their are five factions: The Polish Commonwealth, The Crimean Khanate, The Muscovite Tsardom, The Cossack Hetmenate, and The Kingdom Of Sweden. All four factions are based off of real kingdoms in the past and all have the same government type. When playing Fire and Sword for the first time I was not sure what to do so, naturally, I did't do what I was told to and decided to travel to Moscow. Long story short that campaign was short and I gave up. So instead I started attacking looters and doing favors for villages and slowly drifted to joining the Cossack Hetmenate who I ended up being a Mercanary for.In terms of gameplay this game is incredibly fun and addictive, however I was constantly running into graphical glitches and sometimes bugs that would just stop the game from working this sometimes made the game frustrating but a simple reboot solved the problems.

												Props to my good friend RedAlpha for giving me this games as a Christmas gift. Thanks alot, buddy. Fire & Sword, as a standalone expansion to Warband, is almost mechanically identical to it's relative game and has everything from it that makes it good, but there are tweaks and alterations that set it apart from the game enough to justify it as it's own separate title. Not only changing the weapons that the skills constitute and the armor and apparel to go with the new, much more advanced and recent setting than Warband, but to go with that, they added guns and grenades (Hence 'Fire and Sword'.) which is my favorite selling point in this game, because of this, they changed the ranged infantry from Archers to Marksmen, whom you can command to form rows thanks to the new additions to the order-giving system this game has. However, Fire & Sword also shares the two infamous gripes I have with Warband: Frustration with regards to difficulty, and as mentioned in the Warband review, letting a snail win a race to you while you're -riding a horse.- Oh well, just like Warband, this gets a 9/10, an impressive.

												This game is probaly the best sword fighting game I have ever played :D It's amazingly addictive and keeps you entertained for hours...But the thing is, it was originally a DLC so it's not that big a game. But that doesen't mean it's only has 1 level. It has 2 modes: castle seige and battle mode. (+ Campaign mode).In both battle mode and castle siege you only have one life, which immediatly rises the tension.The campaign mode is good and fun, but i prefer the other game modes. The online exprience has some different maps and it is modable (Is that a word)?but the other players.. My god they are annoying.So say you want some good old swordfighting action, yeah? You want them to fully block, and attacklike a proper duel, yes? But the thing is, the other players think that doing that is bullsh*t and spin around in circles while mashing left click is a good way to win a fight. Just saying.Overall Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword is a great game but however has some issuses. (I forgot to mention that the graphics aren't that good, but that doesn't ruin the experience at all).The game has a simple to learn but hard to master combat system. It's very simallar to Chivalry Medival Warfare.In other words, BUY THE GAME!			"

												The game's story was so good that it inspired me to read the novel that this game was based on. It also got me interested in 17th century Eastern Europe history, just like how Napoleonic Wars DLC got me interested in 19th century Western Europe history.There are three main storylines (Polish, Cossack and Muscovite) depending on the faction you join. So you could play the game 3 times to get through all the endings.I recommend playing with a mod to enhance the experience.			"

												I'm up in the air with yes and no. It is not as good as Warband, but it's fun. It's got optional story, which is nice, and guns and horses and swords, which are all nice, (oh, and GRENADES!) but it has its fair share of problems. You can't set up your custom kingdom, you can only usurp existing ones. Bad. You can die (yes, that matters a lot!), which is not supposed to happen in M&B, and some of the storylines are just plain silly. Looking at The Deluge and Black Mace! False Dmitri is probably the best one. Speaking of which, this game is considerably more linear than the others, which is why it is out of the loop. Mount&Blade is supposed to be sandbox open-world blah blah. Also, you can't go home and become a family man here. You don't have that option anymore. So, go back to Warband for the moment, and wait until Bannerlord to -see if it is any good-. EDIT: Bannerlord will be the best game of all time. Be a family man.Anyway, returning to this, guns! Why not? The other best part is that if you hire a mercenary army, you can customise their uniforms. 11/10, would make morion-toting Crusader army again.			"

												-Started campaign-Became a trader and made some money-Hired mercanaries and began adventuring in the north-Did a couple quests for the muscovite tsardom-Found an old man in a village who gave me a golden cross and pistol-Decided to not pay attention to what the man said and went to do more quests for the tsardom-Delievered a horse to the tsar-About to be vassalized for bringing a horse to him when he sees the cross-Got thrown in jail-Escaped jail and fled to poland-Found a claiment to the tsardom who decided to help me overthrow the tsardom-Used the cross and claimed i was the real heir to the tsardom to turn the entire army against the tsar-Overthrew the tsar and betrayed the claiment who helped me-Became the new tsar and led the muscovite tsardom to glory.10/10 would overthrow the muscovite tsardom again.Seriously though this game is pretty good, not as good IMO as warband but its up there, wouldnt suggest getting this if you want to just join a kingdom and take over the world as the vassalize system feels slightly broken (Tried to get vassalized once by sweden got the king to 80 opinion of me and had fought so many battles against his enemies yet he wouldnt vassalize me at all) however sieges are pretty fun and there are more options than in warband for sieges such as blowing a hole in a wall. Outside of sieges combat is really fun and requires you to use a strategy instead of just charging all the time like most would in warband, however it does have alot of glitchs from what i can see and IMO is not as well done as warband is however one thing this game has over warband is story quests, three of them infact one for the muscovites, one for the polish, and one for the cossacks, they are pretty fun and enjoyable decent length to. 7/10 great game if you like 1600's combat and want to play a mount and blade game that has a ""main story"" element and don't mind the fact the game feels a little unfinished in some areas			"

												A good game. Though it isn't as good as Mount and Blade: Warband, it is still awesome in its own way.Pros: Guns - guns are OP. Sure, they take a long time to reload, but they have power and can wipe out whole armies.Actual trading - assessing local prices actually means something and you can make lots of money by doing it. Also, you get to form your own caravans, which is awsome and makes you very rich if you do it right.Banks and Guilds -you get to deposit money in banks and gain interest on that. You can also take loans as well. There are special guilds which can sell you special armor and weapons. Though expensive, they are very cool and can provide you with some cool stuff.Useful Castles - sounds weird, I know, but now every fortress or castle has a tavern and a marketplace. Unlike the Warband castles, which were basically just strongholds, the WF&S castles allow you to sell stuff, access the tavern, and talk to a mayor for quests. Interesting story-based quests  - there are special series of story-based quests for the Poles, the Russians, and the Cossacks. These stories are well-done and are quite interesting, giving you some history lessons while at the same time letting you campaign and battle Mount and Blade style.Grenades  - sure, they're almost always inefficient and usually not worth the steep price, but they are freaking GRENADES. IN MOUNT AND BLADE!!!!Cons - Bugs and Glitches - the developers moved on before the game was fully fixed, which is a huge shame. Though the game is mostly smooth and most problems have been dealt with, you may experience some graphical glitches here and there. At the worst, you will have a bug that wiill ruin your game. For example, a faction leader will be defeated in battle and never reappear, or the story-based quests will break and you'll be forever stuck on one part. Hopefully, you won't have these, but you've been warned.Lack of variety - in Warband, all the factions were truly unique, with obvious strengths and weaknesses. In WF&S, all the factions seem the same. Aside from appearances and some strengths (Poles= cavalry. Swedes = infantry), the factions don't have enough variety to make they feel truly unique in battle. At the end of the day, they are all essentially the same.No Story for Crimeans and Swedes - while the Russians, Poles, and Cossacks have story-based quests, the Crimeans and Swedes have none, which is a shameMap is Bland - in Warband, you have a desert, a steppe, a tundra, a mountain range, and a plains region. These added variety to the game and made the different areas unique. In WF&S, the entire map is flat, with just rivers and a few patches of forest. Woop-ee. Overall, don't let the cons prevent you from buying the game. It is a very fun and exciting experience which all Mount and Blade fans should have.			"

												Amazing game, it captures the steppe/eastern style of warfare perfectly in the 17th century. I love this game and have enjoy it immensely a thousands times more than Warband. The line battles in Napoleonic Wars don't even match up to this game. TaleWorlds Entertainment is ripping themselves off by offering this standalone for 10$. I do not lie when I say if I could do it all over again, I would have purchased this at full price, not on sale and never picked up Warband. Its obvious more people like Warband because it's medieval theme, but for people like me, Fire and Sword is a little trip to gamer's heaven. While the loyal fanbase is moving on to Bannerlord, I'll still be on my little island, riding my war horse, bow in hand, leading Khan styled hoards, charging straight for an army of Polish Winged Hussars, while arquebus and wheelock muskets can be heard in the distance.

												Very Good....Rating: 8/10- Gameplay: 8- Multiplayer: 8- Campaign: 10- Learning Curve/Depth: 10- Community: 8Great addition to Warband, this DLC allows you to really see the gamplay come out in spades! New factions and weapons are definitly fun!Fight battles in first person using your horse and sword when you feel lucky and conquer the world as well in the strategy view. This game never seems to stop giving new twists and turns with its great sandbox environment. This game is a lot like sisters, one is always prettier and this one is not that sister (that is NW) but this one has a ton of personality!- FPS Battles- Overhead open world conquering- Strong Character Development- Strong Team Characters Developed*Note graphics are dated because the game was released a long while ago but there are modifications available that bring it up to date!**Quick update 12/27 about the story line, it is a bit flat to start with but then again it is a sandbox game so you are making the story up as you go!

												Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword, with regards to how much I like it, and how much I don't, is quite a hard game to review. Overall it feals a lot like Mount and Blade, which is hardly suprising, but then it feels more advanced with the guns, almost like Napoleonic Wars DLC for Warband. Graphically i don't think Fire and Sword is really an inmprovement. Personally i don't think it looks very good, but let's be honest, that is never what Mount and Blade was about. If it was, they failed every time. The playstyle of the game is very much the same as all other games, with the same idea behind blocking and attacking n melee, and shooting. This is set in the early era of the invention of guns, i don't know for certain but maybe early 1700's? Either way, the uniforms for the soldiers look very old, and the guns are NOT very accurate. They also feel very 'light' and a bit too easy to aim, in comparison to that of Napoleonic Wars.The campaign is 'good'. That is about all i can say for it. It is much like the other games of it's type. Overpriced equipment, limits on army size and plenty of fetch and carry missions, and still no luck with marrying into a wealthy family. I think once you have played any Mount and Blade campaign, you have played them all. I can't think of much more to review in this game, maybe because there is nothing else. Overall, i don't like the time era very much which has turned me away from the game. I prefer the Napoleonic Wars by far. Other than that, death and melee still looks stupidly unrealistic, gunshots sound like...anything but gunshots, and the music is quite bad. Despite all this, i cannot say i don't like the game. Mount and Blade are good at making addictive games that are quite bad in comparison to other games, yet still very good. I know all that made sense, but i feel better for getting that out. 8/10. Graphics and the era ruined it for me more than anything, but i do like it.			"

												First of all I would recommend this game for anyone who likes sandbox games ( for the single player mode ). One reason this game is so unique is because it has a different style of musket fighting than in the other mount and blade mods. The game gives you a sense of individuality in multiplayer, in which there is no sandbox you just battle with other people. In the other mount and blade mods and other games like those, you fight in groups so you are more of a body of men than a single soldier. In the multiplayer almost everyone moves at their own free will, like an irregular. So being a musketeer means more of you by yourself than you in a battalion of infantry. But it also allows other things, imagine a knight with a gun. This game is very fun but the multiplayer takes a while to master especially since there are a lot of hackers on some of the servers so PRACTICE!!! But other than that this game is very wide spread so it covers a lot of fields so this game is definitely one of my favorites.			"

												AS A GUY NEW TO MOUNT & BLADE: I think this game was really well made, as a strategy game it was fun playing it , although it was alot challenging when I had no armies at all. This Game will take you to a different level of strategic gaming. An RPG styled you can level up, your troops can level up, and your empire can be ""leveld up"" by building upgrades and hiring people. You can be an emperor/King Or you can help a KING to take over other nation. Well whatever you choose it depends on you. GOOD LUCK :) This game was alot of fun, and I'm looking foward to play this game again. (P.S this game is really really hard, so you will need patience. Or, you can use the easy way. Use cheats xD.

The range of clothing and weapons is dissapointing unless you want to wear the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ top in various sizes and colours all game. The game is not worth buying just for singleplayer. The only thing that comes close to saving this game is the commander game variant in Multiplayer out of my 120 odd hours about 100 of it was spent in that gamemode, it had a better feel to it than even the commander mode in NW. The smaller squad sizes and abiltiy to choose your troops specifically, gives the gamemode a much more tactical feel and when you loose a man, it hurts, it would actually sadden me when one of my 6 childeren took a bullet to the head.I will still reccomend the game because of this one gamemode, without it the game wouldnt be worth it. Even with the gamemode I would wait for a sale of the game as paying full price for it is as stupid as the game itself.			"

												Good about warband: Your pc doesn`t have to be from nasa to use it on the best settings.You can spend much time on it before it gets boring, then you have the mods.Cheap.Bad about warband: OldLack of realism sometimesBugs ( not gamebreaking, but there are some)Everything is small /holdings armies) compared to reality.Mount and blade warband compared to fire and sword:Mount and blade: Much more worked onMore active serversMore and frequent updatesFire and sword:HUSSARS!!! CheaperIf you prefer to play in a fairytale world , there you go.But I think that it is much funnier playing in a historical world, with real troops and factions. The idea of fire and sword is really cool, but they haven`t worked on it enough, and the developers have left it to it`s own fate. If fire and sword had been worked on for as much as warband was, it would be epic. It lack the features warband has, and the graphic.Fire and sword has guns, this is a +. But can be frustrating gettin randomly one shot, and killed. If you are: Polish, Lithuanian, Russian, Crimean, mongol, ukrainian, swedish. Or you syphatize with any of them, You will love fire and sword (for a time) "

												WF&S is basicly a mod for M&B: Warband, sacrificing some of Warband features for actual historical background.If you played Warband, you know what to expect. If you haven't - M&B is a sandbox game. You are being thrown into a pretty big map, full of villages and cities belonging to one of five factions. And then... well, you tell me. You want to become a bandit, rob caravans and burn villages? Why not? Want to be a vigilante, taking down bandits and doing small jobs for the lords? Why wait? How about joining the faction, gaining fiefs, and taking over hostile factions? Go on. Or maybe... create your own faction, and become a king? Your call. Or you can always be a merchant. Still a good idea if you enjoy it. This applies both for warband and With fire and Sword.Factions in WF&S are Polish Commonweatlh (with their extraordinary cavalery), Kingdoms of Sweden and Russia, Cossacs and Tatars. Each faction has it's strong and weak sides, as well as it's unique units. Speaking of units, i have to say that I'm  disappointed. not by the numbers - there are plenty of them, but upgrades.... most of the units can only be upgraded to veteran/elite status. Even village recruits can be upgraded maximally to Mercenary status. Which means - obtaining unique faction units is really hard.A word about equipment. Crossbows were removed, instead, you get muskets and pistols. Pretty good and deadly weapons, if you know how to use them. Of course, they need bullets. Luckily, they refill after each battle. Weird enough, granades (yep, there are explosives. Quite powerfull, yet, quite pricy) don't refill. So if you buy pack of 3, use one - next battle you'll have 2. Quite annoying, isn't it? To sum up, if you enjoyed Warband, but got a bit bored with Swandians and other Nords, and want to try something new, but not THAT new, try WF&S.P.S: Just realised that it's just like Napoleonic wars, if it were abit more to the east, and contained single-player			"

You can make custom battles, campaign, multiplayer and have much fun killing men with different types of weapons (sabers, bows, muskets, something like the fist grenade ever, spears, broadswords, swords...). In campaign you can hire men and conquer the map killing your enemies (almost eveyone) earn money and honor and become the mightiest faction in the game! I highly recommend this game!			"

												Ever sense I had the pleasure of getting M&B warband ive been a huge huge huge fan of the series. Clocking in nearly 100 hours in almost no time it was easy to get lost into this medival world. Generally text bases rpg's would steer me away but not the m&b series. The combat is just sooo perfect easy to learn and soooo difficult to master. Multiplayer is tense and rewarding as you see yourself climb the leaderboards the more you play. The story mode is amazing allowing you to make a character and a story completely your own. It is difficult for new players but if you press on you will not be dissapointed. You can literally be and do anything you want. Wanna be a trader of goods make profit by selling various goods from food to silk. Maybe join a faction and pledge your allegiance to it. Do you wanna say ♥♥♥♥ that and start your own empire from the ground up to take over the entire continent. YOU CAN! its an amazing game and the new guns add another layer of difficulty and tension this is a must own so if you dont own a M&B game GET ONE DAMNIT. 10/10 who needs a life anyway when you can start your medival empire.

During your adventure you can hire mercenaries in bars capture prisoners and create an army. Your army can also be upgraded so then you can get the best troops possibile on the battlefield.

												Very good game but only if you're into this type of games. It's cheap ♥♥♥ hell both on sale and off sale, right now it's like $1,24 which is a focking joke, even soda pop costs more than this gem. And I'd tell you that it is defintely worth even $20. But enough about it's value. Game has a lot of content as for such game, entertainment is almost endless, for example I've never finished any of main quests but still enjoyed it tremendously. I spend few hundred hours (off Steam) with this and never got bored. I would recommend it especially for people that aren't familiar with XVth, XVIth and XVIIth century Poland, Ukraine, Russia and Crimea - it's a great way to learn more about our culture and history. It might somehow clarify, for not acknowledged, why Crimean Crisis occured, what's going on in the Ukraine and why are these countries so important in present day world.Graphics - even though I've taken under consideration the fact that is outdated, it still sucked for its times: 4/10 (doesn't matter much if you enjoy the game itself)Music - stays in the climate of those times and those places: 9/10Content - enough for such game: 7/10Gameplay - many times I've had batter things to do (like study to not be a ♥♥♥♥ing failure) but I rather played F&S: 9/10 [disclaimer: difficult to stop playing once you get into it] Dude just focking play it, it's 1.24 for focks sake			"

												It feels like they shoved the Original Mount & Blade forward into time into the gunpowder age. While the guns can almost always kill someone on the first try, the trick is trying to not miss, as the gun takes a good deal of time to reload. Also, most armors with a defense of +10 or higher are expensive and harder to obtain, making it vital to avoid being shot at. The implementation of bar fights, caravan hiring system and diseases really adds into the game that I feel like the original should have had. Addicting and highly enjoyable.			"

												A good Mount and Blade game, this one is set in the mid 1600s and there are a lot of firearms and different weapons than warband. In this game you will be finding party casualties a lot higher than in Waband, because a lot of firearms are a one hit kill.Slightly suffering from repetitive gameplay and not very many people playing it, but is still a solid game.8/10			"

												Warband with Muskets.Set during a tumultous time in European history. Centered in modern day Poland and surrounds, Fire & Sword does an excellent job in recreating many of the armours and troops of the time.The faction quest lines are a nice addition that set it apart from Warbands purely sandbox mode.It is pretty much just more Mount & Blade, but that is always a good thing.

I SAID CHARGE!!!We have fought and bled for this chance and you would sit it out? What of your brothers and sisters who lie dying and screaming for aid or even a swift death, crying for their mothers as they lose control of their bodies. Is this how you would honour them, with cowardice?You make me sick. What is that you ask? Why don't I charge with you? How dare you? Is it not I who has the more courageous task. Do not let the wine, food and this tent fool you. It is to dull my rage for I fear without it I would be first into the breach, and that would be the end of us all, for if I were to meet my end in such a glorious charge many, many innocents would suffer for it. I am but one man but I must carry this huge burden alone. Now order your men to CHARGE!!!

												Its fun. Ridiculously fun. But either I am not doing something right or its an insane grind. I cannot get a fief. I got one once and quickly lost it.There are little to no instructions, little margin for error, and its extremely inconvenient to use the battle system on a laptop (FN THEN F1 buttons again and again)Its better than Warband though. At least I dont have to go wander a town to find an elder or some other waste of time like in that game.I give it a meh. Its fun for goal driven people like me but even i find it infuriating when you play for days and still have no land or steady stream of income.			"

												Beware, this game is shockingly addictive! What starts as a simple, open world RPG with no clear goals or aims turns into a personalized intricate story. My character started as a simple merchant of the Cossacks and soon became a powerful political figure with an impressive army, though with the main goal of ensuring the nation's survival through peace. This game is more historical than the others, though only loosely,  and more visually detailed. The combat system is also better than the others as are much of the other aspects of the game: trading, questing, commanding, etc. The setting of this game is also more advanced, 1700's ish as there are wheellock and matchlock firearms. This game and the other Mount and Blade games are very noteworthy and worth buying on a good sale.			"

If you liked Warband but want a more Rennaisance/Medevial feel and technology then this game is perfect for you.  There are many big improvements and countless minor ones that increase the enjoyability of the game immensely.I reccomend everyone try this game out.			"

												I have the original M&B (not Warband), so I have only that to compare it to, but this is probably NOT the first M&B game you should get.   That said, it's a fantastic game, with a few quirks.Best point:  Guns.  They make every battle more tense and unpredictable, because it only takes a stray bullet or two to put you out of comission fast.  While in the old M&B I would just charge in and kick ♥♥♥ (once I got to a certain level) even against ridiculous odds, in this one I've actually found myself strategizing, having the marksmen follow me, coming in slowly.  Aside from guns, money and supplies seem a little more plentiful and goods more fairly priced, which means I'm not always worrying whether or not I'm going to have the funds/food to pay/feed the troops.Worst point:  Glitchy main story quests.  I had to restart after several hours of play, just because of a buggy quest that would not allow me to join a faction.  Not saying it will happen to you, but it certainly dampened my enthusiasm, at least initially.  Also, the tutorial is still too basic, and doesn't explain how or why to join your faction.Bottom line:  If you only get one M&B game, it should probably be Warband (or the original, if it's on sale).  But I play this more than the original now.Note:  Have not ventured into multiplayer yet, but that's not really why I play M&B...			"

												It's been a little while since I last played WFAS but here's what I remember:It's okay. Sometimes, it feels like guns are little too good, like you'll be charging into battle on your horse and *plonk* someone shot you from across the map while you had no good way of defending yourself.If you've played mount and blade original or warband, the recruitment of troops in the game is different. Instead of getting most of your men from villages, you'll only be able to recruit a handfull from villages (you can't recruit any more once you reach around 30 units in your party I believe, though I think you can recruit more from villages that are part of a faction you have joined). The units recruited from villages only upgrade to a certain point, in order to get better units you have to either recruit units from from a mercenary camp (you have a choice from melee, ranged and cavalry units) and change their equipment (There is one merc camp in the middle of each faction, each has equipment based off the faction the camp is in.) The other way is to join a faction and order some sort of soldier-recruiter-type-guy in one of your faction's settlements to train one of the better units of the faction you joined, e.g a Polish Hussar or a Swedish swordsman. If you choose this option be aware that there is a translation error which means the recruitment-trainer-type-dude will say something like ""coppers"" instead of ""days"" in reference to how long you have to wait for your units to be trained.No marriage as far as I can tell, you may join a faction as a lord after serving as a mercenary commander but that seems to be about it.Combat works pretty much the same as in warband. There are shields, there are swords, there are two handed swords, there are pole-arms, are are bows and arrows (though aren't as commonly used), there aren't any crossbows as far as I've see, there are maces, there are lances, there is chambering, there is blocking, there is swinging in a certain direction.The main difference now is with guns and bombs. Guns are pretty powerful, they're usually a one or two shot kill so having at least some units out of melee range firing at the enemy is generally not a bad idea. I haven't had much experience with bombs other than having some shirtless man in multiplayer throwing them at me over and over again. They appear to be a one hit kill so... I don't know, use them if you have the money I guess.Having vassals works pretty much the same in WFAS as it did in warband, not much to say there.The factions declare war on each other and make peace with each other... there's honestly nothing else to say about that, if you're part of a faction you'll probably be called on a campaign just like in warband.You are able to take over a city and create your own faction, just like in warband. You can't, however, give your companions any vassals without any mods (I've used WFAS enhancement mod for this).There are companions in this game as there were in warband, they work pretty much the same.No tournaments, no arenas, no smacking a bunch of naked men and women with wooden weapons to get a little bit of money like in warband.Some of the quests available are the same as the ones in Warband, e.g the ""This man killed a guy, go find him in this village and kill him for 300 gold"" quest. There are also some new ones.I believe there are three storylines to this game based on a book called With fire and sword but I haven't experienced any of them.Verdict: It's okay. It's not as good as Warband in my opinion but it's still kinda fun. If you have some money to spend and want something a little different to warband (but not as good) then this game might be for you.			"

												Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword is a game many fans don't view in a positive light, and while I cant say exactly why, I can make a few guesses. The biggest to me is probably the introduction of firearms into Mount and Blade, its pretty powerful. early on, and I myself never had any problems just riding into huge battles alone on horseback just to shot dead most enemies before finishing off any stragglers. That being said I feel like it is also missing some of the broader features of Warband, thus losing some of the variation in gameplay. I have not spent as much time with the game, on or off Steam as I have with the other two Mount and Blade games so I don't have as much experience with Mount and Blade with Fire and Sword. That being said, I myself Still really like the game and recommend Mount and Blade fans try it.			"

												Honestly, this is my favorite game and in WFAS it just gets better. Not Only are you getting a hands on experience about a certain period in time, but you also get to make your own character, build you own army however you please, and become a lord of your own nation. If that doesn't suit you, you can become in kind to a bandit and raid ""innocent"" villages and reap to rewards. Or you may wish to be a merchant, learn the arts of trade, what sells for good where and how to make money quick. Feeling lonely playing by yourself? You can play online with friends and pplay through different scenarios. Ever wanted to besiege a castle, or fight alongside up to 200 men? you ccan do all that here in a quick battle, too. The point is, this game is great in most fields and live up to more than its expectations. Mount & Blade in general is a great series and WFAS keeps the trend goiing. 10/10. Besides graphics, I believe this is one of the best games and you will not be dissapointed by getting it. GG no re. Hope to see you online soon!			"

												The game is so good, I literaly bought it again on Steam, only so I can give it a positive review. With Fire and Sword is a standalone thrid party created Expansion to the Mount & Blade. It put's the game into the real 17th century Europe, and does provide player with an optional story mode, and tons and tons of new features and usage eases. After you get used to playing with Fire and Sword, the Warband itself will just feel empty, and limited. The game however requires a bit of mindset changing if you are a Warband fan already, since 17th century armies were marginally different from the villager raised armies of Calradia. The multiplayer game also provides players with slightly altered combat system (Difference can be felt only by the very dedicated players), that is the matter of taste. I persoanlly like the way combat works in Wfas more than WB, but I do understand that some people my like the feel of WB more than Wfas. Generally the game is worth your money, especially now that it is on sale. I have spent more than  1000 hours in the game over the last 4 years I have it. (Some of the features that were added to this game : - Optional Story lines- More siege possibilites- Better siege AI navigation- Training soldiers in castles and towns- A LOT of new buildings to build in your towns- Buildings now also require hiring people to operate them- Being able to choose equipment for some of your troops- Ability to talk with Guild master / Village chief without finding them in city- Building provisoric defenses to help you on field batte (wagon fort)and many, many other minor changes like loaning money, sending NPC's to academies, tavern brawls, sending merchant caravans etc.)The game however does not feature : - Marriages- Tournaments- Training camps (They serve different purpose now)			"

												This is one of the best games I've ever played. The very first time I played was around 4 years after it was released, at the time I played the demo just to check if it's worth it. The demo was almost nothing and you didn't have too much time to play but I did buy it because I wanted to see what I could do next.I've played this game for a long while, about 4 years now, when I started really enjoying it. It is an old game, yes, but it's worth every dollar I spent on it. This game might not be the most epic game in the world but it's still fun to just go around, completing missions, getting an army and getting to rule land. The game has multiplayer as well, which makes it even more fun. Sadly not a lot of people play Fire&Sword.I don't have too much to say about this game. It's just really fun and I'm sure some will really get into it. I've never seen any bugs and glitches in this game. This game runs smoothly with nothing bad happening, though it might crash rarely, but it's no problem if you save your game from time to time.			"

												Tl&dr: my recommendations for M&B variants are as follows:1. Viking Conquest Reforged2. Floris mod3. Warband4. Any mod you can find, but you can expect some crashes and bugs in some5. With fire and sword6. Blood and Gold: Carribean! (only for a 5 minutes laugh)I assume this M&B version wanted to put the player in a position closer to an army general than the original Warband, but fails to do even that through its own fault. This is why (comparing to Warband):- no more character attributes design at start of the game. You start with the same point in all attributes and can distribute only a few. You will be a poor fighter, poor trader with a slightly above average IQ; no other choice.- since the discovery of fire (a.k.a. muskets) any fight can end abruptly if some mediocre rifleman gets lucky and lands a head shot from across the map, no matter how many hit points you have or what head gear you use; but to be honest, this can be avoided 99.99% of the times if you get a horse and run around in circles like a crazy chicken. In short, if you run around buck naked you survive, if you stand still in the best armor in the game, you die.- although the game almost forces you into a command position, the battle map size doesn't really give you this feeling. Half the times, after you give a few commands and your men start to move into position, the enemy cavalry is already close and charging, turning what should be a clean line-infantry battle into a total mess of men and horses.- adding to the above point is the battle size limiter to 150, which makes you feel like you are the leader of an oversized gang, rather than some wannabe Napoleon. There are tools to increase this size to 1000, but, considering the small maps, having 1000 men fighting is more of a lottery than some tactical or strategic combat.- Warband had a questionable AI at best in siege battles, but this one made the step forward. The best result I had against this terrible AI was at a siege 60 attackers vs. 180 defenders. Attackers won with 1 wounded and 1 dead.- speaking of AI, do not expect any challenges on the global map either. No matter what you do, you can't be outsmarted, the only way to lose anything is through brute force, when you are seriously outnumbered.- story-line quests are bugged; almost all of them. The only one that works without constantly saving because of the fear of the bugs is the Polish one. However, it has some interesting ways to make the game challenging. One moment you have half of the map, the next half of your cities belong to the enemy without any battles fought or any warnings. Why? Because you talked to some guy and asked him what's wrong. Thank you.- no more tournaments, lots of quests from Warband removed- troop upgrade trees are lacking imagination to say the least- money from fiefs are not sent to you automatically forcing you to make a tour every now and then to collect your taxesOverall, a M&B with less interesting combat, but in which you can trade and become a tax collector.

The multiplayer is sort of like Native Mount & Blade and Napoleonic Wars mashed together but not perfect. It seems to be one of those games that you might have to give it time for it to warm on you, otherwise it won't at all.I don't mind it, it has some decent multiplayer modes which make it unique and the other game modes aren't that bad.

												While it probably doesn't stand up to Warband for raw balanced MP combat, and it definitely doesnt have the bevy of mods vanilla warband mount and blade does, Fire and Sword brings a grip of new single player content, and a fun multiplayer for mount and blade that has guns but is still very horse-oriented (didn't get that from Napoeleon really). If you have a gaming boner for Mount and Blade single player campaigns and want to try one with a little more structure and story, or you have a history boner for north-eastern europe around the 1600s, or you just want to play mount and blade with guns but also horses and are aware of the fact that unfortunately the MP community for mods is universally tiny - this is definitely worth grabbing.If you haven't played Mount and Blade and aren't sure you like the series, try Warband instead.

												I'm still adamant this game will be awesome, so don't pass judgement just yet. They do a lot of bugfixing in this game, they just have a bit of a slow development cycle. They still need to fix achievements, as they don't appear.The game strikes me more as a 'P2P Mod' than a typical expansion. It also appears to compound the problems of the last game, namly starting out, since 7 bandits with guns are much more likely to take out the lone wanderer than 7 bandits in previous games. However, all the open-endedness is still there, now in some kind of maybe Russian land but now with added featuers like banks and most importantly: guns. For all you people who read the last review and needed guns, but were too stupid to figure out how to install a mod: get this. If you like Mount&Blade and can deal with the above problems: get this. If you havn't really tried the series and want to play: go get Warband. Bugs, guns, fun.			"

Yes the grapics are old but the game play is fantastic. Only problem is, if you have no ranged or cav and you are vs cav, prepare to be kited and destroyed i did 1v20 at level 1. They enemy had no ranged weapons so I just rode my horse around in a circle poping off pistol rounds until people would route. I would go after then slice them and repeat.

												Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword is just not as good as Warband but will still have you playing for hours when you get into it.WFaS made by a polish company (as far as i can remember) set in the 15th to 17th century adds guns to madness that is 'MaB' but personally i still prefer the Swords and combat rather than ranged weapons.The map personally is not great but it is only a map, everything else is just the same as it was in Warband. Just a storyline to go with the action, new factions based on true history and plenty of men to boot.This Warband focuses less on allowing you to create your own faction and more or less forces you to become a Vassal. Again nothing wrong with that, it's just very unrewarding claiming your own kingdom so i tend to avoid it.Overall, everything is the same you just may not like it as much but it is still woth the money easily and the online also remains with guns helping increase the diversity of troops.I grant this a solid 8.8/10			"

												Want a somewhat realistic story on medieval times? Well... this game won't exactly provide that. Ultimately, it is fun to play but they took out the concept that if you're a woman, you have a harder time. This takes out a part of the series and it is a let down since people enjoyed this concept. I feel like people got mad and they let these people have their way and took it out. Mostly, the game is fun. I enjoy using the guns in the game and they seem overpowered but the reloading is a downfall to it. Like the crossbow. Better than the bow, but you sacrafice some reload time. If you enjoyed the concept of women having a harsher time in Warband and it's something that you saw as something to benefit to your replay value and having mods in the Steam Workshop, well, I don't recommend the game. If you are a huge fan of Mount & Blade either way, then I do see this as a game for you.			"

												A very different game from the previous Mount & Blade games.  Some changes not so good.  But the biggest good, or interesting change at least, is the addition of firearms.  It really changes how combat works, especially early on it can be quite difficult.  It definitely provides a new experience and I think it is worth trying.  Really changes the combat.  I think in terms of whether that change is good or not, will differ greatly from person to person.  If I had to choose my top Mount & Blade game it would be Warband.  This one has removed the arenas and tournaments from the game, which I think they should have kept.  However this is still a fun game, and the other changes make it worth trying out.			"

												I recommend this as it is very fun to play and you can do a lot of stuff on it. Mount & Blade games are good because they are different to other games. Although some people might find it boring, I think you can spend a long time on it because there is singleplayer and multiplayer. Obviously people will mostly go on multiplayer, multiplayer is more challenging than singleplayer.Fire & Sword is also quite realistic because in some games you can shoot people in the head and they don't die, but with this game they will die if shot with a gun or bow in the head. I would rate 9.5/10 because of the sheer lack of graphics, but that dosen't really interfere with gameplay.			"

												Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword is just not as good as Warband but will still have you playing for hours when you get into it.WFaS made by a polish company (as far as i can remember) set in the 15th to 17th century adds guns to madness that is 'MaB' but personally i still prefer the Swords and combat rather than ranged weapons.The map personally is not great but it is only a map, everything else is just the same as it was in Warband. Just a storyline to go with the action, new factions based on true history and plenty of men to boot.This Warband focuses less on allowing you to create your own faction and more or less forces you to become a Vassal. Again nothing wrong with that, it's just very unrewarding claiming your own kingdom so i tend to avoid it.Overall, everything is the same you just may not like it as much but it is still woth the money easily and the online also remains with guns helping increase the diversity of troops.I grant this a solid 8.8/10			"

												Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword It is a good game and i recommend this for all. My computer is complete ♥♥♥♥ and i can run this amazing game really smoothly and my computer isnt even a gaming computer anyways.heres the good about this game: the fighting in this game is really good and it is really fun to play with friends to have a good laugh with and team up agains other players you can customize your character Male/Female and make them look how ever you would like. There are a couple of game modes you can play like survival, Teamdeath match, Deathmatch and so on. Theres even a campaign so if you dont feel like playing with other players you can go on there or in private match to play by your self.The bad: The shooting in this game is kind of hard you have to aim in a certain area to shoot someone in the head, leg, chest etc. if you are on a horse and your weapon is a  spear or sword you have to aim in a certain way as well to kill them easy. If you are on foot and about to fight someone and they have a sword and you have a spear it is hard to attack back because the sword is quicker than the spear AND YES there is weight heavy armor with a broad sword or a heavy pike you will run slow and if your getting attacked and trying to run put away your weapon and run.BUT all in all ithis is a great game i highly recommend it hope this helped :)			"

												Want a somewhat realistic story on medieval times? Well... this game won't exactly provide that. Ultimately, it is fun to play but they took out the concept that if you're a woman, you have a harder time. This takes out a part of the series and it is a let down since people enjoyed this concept. I feel like people got mad and they let these people have their way and took it out. Mostly, the game is fun. I enjoy using the guns in the game and they seem overpowered but the reloading is a downfall to it. Like the crossbow. Better than the bow, but you sacrafice some reload time. If you enjoyed the concept of women having a harsher time in Warband and it's something that you saw as something to benefit to your replay value and having mods in the Steam Workshop, well, I don't recommend the game. If you are a huge fan of Mount & Blade either way, then I do see this as a game for you.			"

												If you're like me, you asked a friend if there's any good games with musketeers in it, and came here. Then I watched the video, and became somewhat uninterested in the game because I have no interest in the Northern Middle East and the Northeastern-most part of Europe. But the game was on sale for cheap, so I went ""What the heck"" and jumped in anyway. I instantly fell in love with the game and all the features I saw off the bat. Even though I kept getting murdered by bandits and ended up restarting my playthrough about 7 times in my first hour, then figured out there was such thing as difficulty settings, I still loved it because the fighting mechanics of the Mount & Blade engine are SO much better with guns. If you ask me, Warband has NOTHING on this game. It's odd to me how the majority of Mount & Blade players will tell you Warband is the best, but it feels so plain after playing this game. You can choose one of 5 factions -- Muscovite Tsardom (Russian), Cossack Hetmanate (Ukrainian), Crimean Khanate (Ottoman), Polish Commonwealth (Polish, obviously) or my personal favorite, the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish, also obviously). You can also start your own faction and get obliterated in two days. The game has a variety of items ranging from basket-hilted swords to rapiers to complex-hilted broadswords to double-barrelled Dutch pistols. There's also tons of armors, weird hats, and my favorite, Comb Morions. Specialty items that are of top quality and are always exotic or technologically advanced can be ordered from masters of the craft in a town center. These items are often imported from the Dutch or the Turks who don't exist as factions in the game, but it just takes 2 in-game weeks to get your order. Overall I had a lot of fun playing this game, and I think it has tons of replayibility. My suggestions:- Get a hussar lance- Get a breastplate and a morion, which you can get from Karllsson and Victor de Buscudor relatively early in the game, and hiring them is still cheaper than buying the items without them (just ask to see their equipment when you hire them)- Just use whatever firearm you can get in an easy bandit battle or somethin'. Save your money.- Buy troops. Aim for 60-80 in the start and work your way up to a 200-strong army. In the beginning, get some cheap mercenaries who you can upgrade over time, and later order specialized faction-based forces from a town's commander in the town center (note: you need to wait 3-5 days for the men to be trained and ready before you can pick them up)- Do quests and serve a faction leader as a lord so you can start collecting taxes as well as getting weekly payment for military campaigning. You're gonna have to do a ton of quests for a ton of DIFFERENT people from that faction first, though.- Save up for the double-barrelled Dutch pistol, maybe a half-decent sword, and you're set for life. From there you can pillage and defeat your foes as you please, and there'll still be PLENTY to do...That's all the stuff I wish I would've known when I started. But feel free to discover that on your own.			"

												It's a very enjoyable game. However I found it very copy and paste from Mount and Blade Warband... except this has guns. So does Warband with modifications and lets be honest Warband is a lot more fun and most mods and a lot more stuff such as weapons, armor, and factions. So I would say pick warband... This game is great fun but just cannot compare to warband...  So in all Warband is better in my opinion but this game does add some nice features and I still have to recommend it.			"

												This game is based on the 1998 Polish movie ""Fire and Sword"".  It provides a historical backdrop for 1650's warfare in central Europe, including Cossack, Tatar, Muscovite, Polish and Swedish units and cities.  Some mods extend the map and available units too.Game is ungoddly awesome.  Something about riding a horse while shooting - it's a similar feeling to flying.  You can command units with great precision and it takes a while to master.  But what a rush to play - even though I completely suck at fighting, buidling up an army and working out the tactics is great.  The AI is is pretty good too (I'm guessing completely based on Behavior Trees).  Sometimes I play the sniper while the rest of the army is skirmishing - really hard to get in a good shot - and very satisfying when it connects.  These are ancient guns and not rifled, so they aren't very accurate from long-range.Also playing solo (no army yet) and taking out the horse of some jerk who's tearing me up - it's a big rush of adrenhaline!Economy is quite clever, where you can drive down market prices and then send caravans at a discount.  Can also take out loans in a pinch.If you quit the tutorial immediately, then it's a little more challenging to start with no money, no gun and no horse - I think this is the best way to play it.

												Main questline is somewhat lazy and kind of disappears. Game has less content than some free community made mods yet costs 10 dollars for some reason. The Eagle and the Radiant Cross or it's submod have probably the same amount or more of content and is completely free. There's also a wide variety of mods that go above and beyond like Gekokujo, Floris, Pendor, Brytenwalda, Anno Domini, and much more yet this expansion doesn't really seem to bring anything to the table like the other two expansions. Very uninteresting map, lacks detail and makes the eastern european theme very drab. All in all not really worth buying imo. Napoleonic Wars and Viking Conquest are far superior expansions while this just feels like a community mod. If it was made by a fan I'd give it a 8/10, but since its made by taleworlds and charges money, more like a 5/10 in my opinion.			"

												Notably better than vanilla Warband, but this game suffers from one great big insurmountable flaw: It is made entirely redundant by Warband Workshop mods. If you own warband, download a total conversion mod from the Steam Workshop (Perisino is my personal favourite). BOOM! Instant Mount and Blade game, and its free. If this had Steam Workshop support, it would no doubt have an excelent modding community of its own, but without it, there is really no reason to buy this game. Let this be a lesson TaleWorlds! The new game had better have workshop support if you want it to replace warband.			"

												For an old it still makes up for its amazing immersion to the battlefield.The concepts of bringing new weaponry to seiging and invading enemy is very fun.To build a wagon fort to use when there is so much calvary to give you an advantage,to blow a hole in the castle wall so your infantry can run in quickly without being shot down,and to run in and point blank double shot an enemy to the head.It adds quite alot from the regular Mount and Blade Warband but to not to much to let you play for hours on end.The quest are repetitive after a while and it reminds me of a mod for Warband than a new game. It adds nice armor and new weapons but it seems too small. I kinda wished for more variety.Overall its a nice expansion to the world of Calradia. 8/10			"

												If you dont know mount and blade already, it is a realistic medieval simulation role playing sandbox game. At least I just called it that. For those who want to go god of war style, look elsewhere, because you will die in the 3rd second of combat:D It has a steep learning curve and realism can be irritating at times (like getting killed by a blow, or two) if you value realism over mindless hack and slash, I recommend this game. Although the main storyline is quite weak in the game that you barely recognised its existence, there are tons of things to do for those who like to explore. Graphics are not the best, but coming from a small studio, this game is a valuable underdog. "

												If you dont know mount and blade already, it is a realistic medieval simulation role playing sandbox game. At least I just called it that. For those who want to go god of war style, look elsewhere, because you will die in the 3rd second of combat:D It has a steep learning curve and realism can be irritating at times (like getting killed by a blow, or two) if you value realism over mindless hack and slash, I recommend this game. Although the main storyline is quite weak in the game that you barely recognised its existence, there are tons of things to do for those who like to explore. Graphics are not the best, but coming from a small studio, this game is a valuable underdog. "

Weapons of that era were captured partially.

I bought this game to play in a clan and I really was disappointed when there wasn't any multiplayer :(There is that *lag* fire ( Firing when you do not release your mouse button to fire your ranged +++*Good things*Alot of players tend to play Captain Co-op. I love it! This is when you team up with other players to defeat the oncoming raids of AI soldiers.Funny stuff happens when you kill a guy off a castle wall into a pond xDAlso got a very cool story line- Deluge, Black mace :P Good achievements to be had also.to be continued ( Need to play more so I need ideas!!! =D )			"

												Where could I start?  There is nothing wrong with this game.  Living up to the standards I've come to expect from Paradox Interactive, this game is perfection, fine-tuned.Some say that introducing firearms ruined the game, but that isn't true.  It made it different, and people hate change.  Playing through the campaign of this game blasts you with the ideal that indeed, graphics don't need to be perfect to have a completly immersive game. Huge battles that are decently historically accurate (as far as weapons / armors go), and an excellent team-building system make this one of the epics.  A game I ALWAYS come back to.  Living the life of the gun-runner in the medieval era, or any other sort of life for that matter, makes this game great for me.  But you could approach victory however you please.So what are you waiting for?  Buy it. 10/10.			"

												For an old it still makes up for its amazing immersion to the battlefield.The concepts of bringing new weaponry to seiging and invading enemy is very fun.To build a wagon fort to use when there is so much calvary to give you an advantage,to blow a hole in the castle wall so your infantry can run in quickly without being shot down,and to run in and point blank double shot an enemy to the head.It adds quite alot from the regular Mount and Blade Warband but to not to much to let you play for hours on end.The quest are repetitive after a while and it reminds me of a mod for Warband than a new game. It adds nice armor and new weapons but it seems too small. I kinda wished for more variety.Overall its a nice expansion to the world of Calradia. 8/10			"

And guess what else since im at the beginning, my army is small and is murdered with little effort on there part and leaves me defenseless getting spooned by 8 bandits at once. On the bright side as you progress through the story and little by little you become more supierior then these problems dont have much meaning. Also it is a good idea to remember the map as soon as possible it will help you with your quests. This game now features guns now which is a nice upgrade from the previous games in the series. This game gets a 7/10.			"

												Not a bad game, but definitely the weakest game in the series, alhough that is subjective. My personal gripes are:Guns detract from the strategy, it sort of devolves into nothing but shooting ranges.Getting randomly oneshot from across the map by said guns feels really bad.The game in general feels very simplified and dumbed down, less weapons, less troops, less content overall.The factions completely lack the personality and interesting lore of Warband, they all feel very bland and samey.Just get warband, there are endless amazing mods for warband that are worth checking out as well.

												As a fresh face to the Mount & Blade series, and also a fairly seasoned veteran at the Elders Scrolls series, I had *some* difficulty learning this game. Whether is be from the fairly complex battle system, to the robust and dynamic economic system, all the way to just not having my hand held. The reason for me being, initially, overwhelmed, was that there isn't really any direction given to you (so, for all of you players who hate linearity, take a look at this). Essentially, you're thrown into a huge world after you complete the short tutorial, and with only two towns to note, you have no main quest line (at first), no grandiose story (also, at first), nothing. ""Why?"" you may ask. The answer is one that, albeit cliché, is simply because it's up to you.  With literally no bars to take note of, you can: make a living learning all of the best trading items and locations, be sure to spend a ton of money on mercs though; plunder every poor village you see, using the money and supplies to further expand your small band of unruly thieves; play the noble boot-licker, and live a virtuous and honest life as you win further glory for your lord. As the parenthetical phrases have said, the lack of a story is only in the beginning, when you're not a particularly notable character. Though, you could completely ignore that story, and still fully enjoy every aspect of the game.Aside from the story, the combat system is something to take note of. There are speed multipliers that aide or detract from damage done on horseback, range and reach modifiers that take note of how much damage point X on a longsword does compared to point Y or Z, guns that can literally change the tide of any fight (I've been one shot so much while prancing around on my pony...), and fun archery, crossbows, and throwing weapons, all affected by range of the shot, location of impact, and all that nitty gritty stuff. As a side note, it's a fun little challenge (and I use that term loosely) to find a band of 10+ looters, or similarly weak enemies, and fight them by yourself, I've taken grenades into those fights, and run circles around the enemy to herd them, in a sense, and then just toss a grenade ;)The characters are rather lackluster unless you're dealing with specific, named characters, who all have their own sets of morals and values. For an example, a more noble character may leave your party if you're constantly bullying small villages, whereas the more violent-loving characters may shun you from running from a fight - yes, even if it's your 20 man squad of peasants, versus a noble's 100 man squad of elite soldiers. Named characters also have their own skill sets, so finding the proper balance of brain and brawn, or just pure brawn, is all a matter of personal taste and is affected by your long-term goals for a character. The political aspect of each faction and character is something that I find incredibly amusing as well, blindly taking quests from the nobles of Sweden may land you as the enemy against whomever they're currently at war with, thus losing a key trading outpost (I say this from experience, be careful). This game hasn't won any awards for its graphics, they can be buggy, low res, low poly-count, and all of the above at one time. And, speaking of bugs, there can be a lot. Tearing in a lot of terrain, a complete lack of rendering in the overworld, and just flat out moronic AI, the pros outweigh the cons, immensely. Multiplayer is something that I didn't bother with much, but I have dabbled. From what I've played, the classes seem fairly balanced, and the 'kill to coin' system if very reminiscent of CS.In the case of Warband vs With Fire and Sword, I'd have to take WFaS. Overall, the game feels slightly more immersive with the landmass being real geographical locations, cheaper costs for mercenaries (which actually did take away a lot of frustration from a lot of my merchant characters), and guns. Guns are incredibly amusing to play with since the game takes place in the period of time when gunpowder just began to be utilized for firearms and explosives. There's also some quality of life improvements with the guildmaster from warband being replaced by the mayor, who's accessible from a town menu, there are also more towns you can actually visit, rather than large amounts of fortresses that only house nobles. Sadly, though, I have yet to see tournaments in any of the towns, and that was a major point of fun for a lot of my playthroughs. All in all, a fantastic game, with a lot more than you could hope for. Don't judge a game by its graphics: 9/10			"

I mean its still a Mount and Blade game so I still enjoy it but just theres always that damper on it. BUT this game has features I wish were in other Mount and Blade games base, like the Caravan Feature that is probably the most beautiful way to earn money in this game, also the factions are a really good touch.            All in all its a 6/10 its playable and still able to sink 100+ ours into it if you enjoy the gunplay and etc.			"

 How I played this game: (difficulty)	 1. 	 Setting the difficulty to easy. (WTF too easy?) 2.	 Setting the difficulty to normal. (Yep it's like I'm playing the normal mount & blade version it's  still easy) 3.	 Setting the difficulty to hard. (OMFG! THIS IS SO UNFAAAIIRRRR THIS GAME SUCKS! LOOK AT THAT STARTING GAME ALREADY LOSING F*CK! I'M GONNA UNINSTALL THIS SH*T!! F*CK!!!!!!!!) How the gameplay works: (easy, normal, hard)    1. 	 Always comes with the tutorial when you started a new game. (even tho there's a tutorial in the main menu) 2.	 Starting quest [bandit problem, tax problem, AND F*CKING SALT! (SALT IS VERY HARD TO FIND)] the elder will give you a quest which you will spend 13 days in the game!!! THAT ONE IS TO FIND 3 BAGS/SACKS OF SALT!!! 3.	 The most exciting part is, when your enemies have a gun DON'T CHARGE ALONE! Because when they start to shoot you at the same time you'll die! Uhm I mean knocked unconcious. (TRUE STORY!

Get your pocporn cus we gonna be here for a while ^.^````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````-Basic Introduction-This game is set in the years of ol' 1600's. Weapons of that era were captured partially. Armour is set good,Nice set of melee weapons and also ranged- muskets and bows, pistols and grenades.````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````-Multiplayer-*Drawbacks*There are no clans/regiments or not that any time I come on it I see them. I bought this game to play in a clan and I really was disappointed when there wasn't any multiplayer :(There is that *lag* fire ( Firing when you do not release your mouse button to fire your ranged +++*Good things*Alot of players tend to play Captain Co-op. I love it! This is when you team up with other players to defeat the oncoming raids of AI soldiers.Funny stuff happens when you kill a guy off a castle wall into a pond xDAlso got a very cool story line- Deluge, Black mace :P Good achievements to be had also.to be continued ( Need to play more so I need ideas!!! =D )			"

												I can say I loved Mount and Blade : Warband with every peice of my heart..but this game is.... mehI try to love it but the guns and bombs..  they put a big damper on it. I mean its still a Mount and Blade game so I still enjoy it but just theres always that damper on it. BUT this game has features I wish were in other Mount and Blade games base, like the Caravan Feature that is probably the most beautiful way to earn money in this game, also the factions are a really good touch.            All in all its a 6/10 its playable and still able to sink 100+ ours into it if you enjoy the gunplay and etc.			"

												Well this game is alright, it seems confused in parts of it, first of all with the single player campaign being much harder then the other 2 Mount & Blades, I have no clue where to recruit new soldiers besides taverns and mercenary camps so yeah thats 1 thing you need in the game and its troops... In a week or two ill probably go back to playing Warband anyway if im still not happy with this game.Pros:Its got guns, grenades, swords, bows, etcthere are a lot of people playing around 3000 right now so its good for multiplayerthere are more various jobs to do and a lot of trainingConsIts hard to understand the difference between a Fortress and a CityNot enough places/troops to recruitMultiplayer is too laggyGuns are too overpowered and have terrible reload time7.2/10----Thanks for reading my review!

												This is a game that doesn't need to exist. It's essentially a Warband mod, and honestly, even for that it isn't even the best warband mod I've seen. Hell, its not even the best warband mod that the developer sells (that would be Napoleonic Wars by the way). Just buy Warband, and if you've already played it to death, go download Brytenwalda for it. You'll enjoy yourself a hundred times more than playing this.			"

												Personal rating: 4/10replayability: N/ABudget: Don't bother. Get warband instead. Lenght: InfinateNote: Below is my review from warband. Imagine that it's basically like Warband, but not as good. Which isn't saying much to begin with! This title simply takes away the few features that made warband addictive and entertaining. While definately entertaining, this game feels like it was never fully developed and was released in it's beta, or even alpha state. It presents a weird mix of game types, from RPG like conversations via dialogue options to Heroes of Might and Magic style overland map travelling to open combat in third person, like in Oblivion. While this may sound great, and is infact entertaning (for a while), the game is lacking in so many departments that it's almost embarrasing. It could have been so much, but unfortunately, this is what we get. The worst about this game, is, that it's unwinnable. There is no purpose in the game, so it's just a sandbox freeroam game with randomly generated missions and encounters. That get's old quickly.While not a true paradox game, I can see why paradox published it. There are some similar elements. This game is extremely addicting and can feel overwhelming at times, which is what hooks the player. The potential of going from lowly peasant to ruler of an empire and the danger of losing it all even at that point. There is so much unused potential in this game. A new title is coming out soon, a ""sequel"" of sorts, I recommend waiting for that.			"

												If you wanna play Mount & Blade, stick to the original or Warband as this game is just a Warband mod with a number of the features that could have been added not in the game, don't get me wrong I enjoy the setting of the game and the addition of guns and other more modern weapons but it doesn't make this standalone game worth it.

												I loved M&B: Warband and really liked With fire and sword when I started it, as someone that likes to create my own adventure and has a lot of Warband I didn't read guides, just started playing. I started to make my fortune by trading, got up to almost 500,000 thalers, good gear, all the needed companions and a good core army when I wanted to start joining factions for the combat experience and found out I can't, somewhere along the way I randomly started a ""main quest"" of a faction I don't even like which cannot be canceled and forbids me from joining any faction or taking up any merc work, more than 10 hours of trading and building wasted... With fire and sword has a interesting concept however due to bad optimization, bugged quests and randomly denying parts  of the game I can't recommend it, if you want the M&B create your own adventure experience just stick with Warband...

												This Mount & Blade was poorly done.  It just doesn't compare to its predecessors.To start off, I'd like to say that Fire & Sword has an incredible problem with experience points and leveling, and on top of that, if you want to level up, you've got to kill countless people with firearms- It doesn't matter what armor you wear, damage taken can be as low as 16 points in heavy armor to a full 60 with none.  You get shot in this game, your fun is over.  The big problem there is that firearms are actually quite common to everyone except you...  Want a good one?  Be prepared to spend $2000 or more.  In addition to that, when you're actually trying to ""aim"", be prepared for ridiculous misses, while the enemy seems to have no trouble hitting you from halfway across the map.Aside from the experience points problem and the stacked cards against you in the gun-crazed Eastern European atmosphere, the balance for the game feels a bit off, and nothing is as ""pretty"" here as Warband.  The map is overall darker, the bandits seem less regional as they are in Warband, and the game feels less alive than Warband.  My biggest problem with it?  It just isn't worth it when an infuriating mistake occurs.  Ride by a reloading musketman, put the reticle over him, miss about 2 paces from him, and get shot in the back as you're riding away...  When you finally *DO* kill him, you get 30 experience points.  Yay you.  23 more to go before you'll level up!Mistakes like these show how little thought and reception was given to community concerns.  It's a dumbed down model, and I've been pushed away by the ridiculous level-up problems.In addition to these slated issues, another problem is in regard to armor.  Armor is completely unbalanced, and much of the decent equipment is ridiculously overpriced.  There seems to have been no thought put into balancing the economy in that regard, which makes it nigh-impossible to outfit yourself to survive a few bullets.  So how do you deal with these gun crazy fools when your armor- and that which you manage to buy- barely protects you?  Spend about 20 minutes circling 13 Brigands until they run out of ammo, and you'll see my point.This M&B is a definite Thumbs Down.  It just wasn't well-thought-out, and I don't think development was very receptive to the community on its issues, and there are many.			"

												TL DR version:Buy if you like:70 musketeers firing their guns all at onceAvoid if you dislike:Buggy questsNo right to rule systemLack in variety of weaponsLong Version:I've played Mount and Blade Warband with Floris Mod and before.The only epic thing in Fire and Sword is the ALL FIRE NOW command you give to all your musket-holding soldiers and watching the enemies fall as your volleys pierces through every armor in the game.Other than that, the game and current mods don't allow you to be a ruler (no right to rule system like in warband), the soldiers can only be upgraded into a better version of themselves, unlike in warband where a simple militia can be upgraded into a pikeman, a crossbowman, a horse archer, a lancer or throwing axeman. The weapons choice in this game is very poor as well and lack in variety. There's only four ranged weapons - Pistol, Carbine, Musket and Bow, where Musket is the only ranged powder weapon that can't be used on horseback. The melee weapons lack the cosmetic appeal they need.Oh, and many of the quests are bugged as well to the point that you will have to consult a walkthrough in order to avoid the bugs. There is also a lack of ways to increase your renown in the game where there are only small groups of bandits and you'll be forced to fight the lords of one nation if you want to increase your renown faster than escorting caravans to towns and picking off small bands of bandits.

												a quick quote from a friend that loves Mount and Blade: Warband. "" Mount and Blade with Fire and Sword is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ as ♥♥♥♥"". He's not right but he's not wrong either.  Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword tries to take a risky step of adding guns to a mostly medieval franchise, it succeeds in some ways, but it is a terrible attempt in another way. Napoleonic Wars did a much better job doing this and it costs the same.  Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword is a downgrade of Warband in the aspect that Mount and Blade's best part was it's fantastic medieval environments and amazing gameplay which is what sparked and rose Warband to fame. With Fire and Sword throws it all to the garbage and takes away the Medieval tag by adding GUNS! I say spend your money on Napoleonic Wars, because that game is money well spent with its endless gameplay and possibilities. They spent more time into a DLC then a Standalone Expansion because  Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword has next to nothing new to add to the series other then a game with guns but the sad truth is, Napoleonic Wars does it better. Recommended on Sale and if you are hungry for Mount and Blade, but with MnB:Warband mods, i doubt that will happen.			"

												i have an amazing recipe for APPLE PIE 1 3/4 cups (260g) plain flour1/2 cup (75g) self-raising flour185g unsalted butter, chilled, cut into small pieces1/3 cup (75g) caster sugar2 eggs1 tablespoon milkDemerara or caster sugar, to sprinkleFILLING 8 large Granny Smith applesJuice of 1 lemon45g unsalted butter1/2 cup (110g) caster sugar1 teaspoon ground cinnamon1/4 teaspoon ground clovesstep 1Sift flours and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl. Add butter and rub lightly into flour with your fingertips. Lift mixture high above the bowl as you rub, to incorporate air into the pastry and make it lighter. Continue until mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, then stir through sugar. Lightly beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon chilled water, then drizzle over flour mixture. Start to bring the dough together by cutting the liquid into the dough with a blunt knife, then form into a smooth ball with your hands, adding a little more water if necessary. Divide dough into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other. Wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for 30 minutes.Step 2To make the filling, peel and core the apples, and cut each into 8 pieces. Toss immediately with lemon juice in a large bowl, to prevent apples from discolouring. Place the butter and sugar in a large frypan over medium-low heat. When butter has melted, add apples and spices, then stir to coat. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until apples have softened. Set aside to cool.Step 3Roll out the larger pastry ball on a floured workbench to a 30cm circle (about 2mm thick). Roll pastry around rolling pin, then unroll over a 22cm metal pie dish. Gently press into corners and allow excess to overhang. Place filling in base with a slotted spoon. Roll the small pastry piece to a 25cm circle. Beat remaining egg with milk, brushing some on rim of the base. Top with small pastry.Step 4Lift the pie dish and cut excess pastry from edges with a sharp knife. Crimp edges of pastry together with your fingers. Chill for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 180°C, place pie dish on a baking tray. Brush top of pie with more beaten egg, sprinkle with demerara or caster sugar. Cut four small air vents in the centre of the pie and bake for 45 minutes or until golden brown.			"

												A good game with a bit more of a challenge early on when you are coming over from Mount & Blade: Warband.The firearms are nice in the story mod of the game and not just for online multyplayer like with Napoleon.  Also Grenades, they shouldn't be as much fun as they are.Another nice change with this one are the added options for castle sieges though the option to poision the cities water really is underwhelming.  When it works it only ever seems to kill less then 20 of the garrisoned troops.On the downside, it would seem some of the achievements seem broken.			"

												The game brings you to the renessaince europe's northern territores. The war has begun between Poland and the Khanats.What i think about the game:Even if the graphics aren't the best, and the old BF:BC 2 has better graphics, it looks good enough. The battles you can have, more than 500 troops at the same time on one map. The multiplayer is hard, but if you play enough with the game you can get much better. The single player let's you conquer whole northern europe: Sweden, Poland, Russia, Ukrain...You can follow quests to get strong, but if you want you can also ride to the next camp, buy some troops and run down a village, even a castle. The multiplayer has a lot of maps, and the community makes more and more. And if you're not good in PVP you can also play Co-Op with friends. You can buy 6 men to your side, buy some equipment, and fight the enemy, and survive the waves. The game has so much to offer. I recommend this game, because it's a Mount & Blade game, because it's FUN!			"

												Fun but immensely frustrating version of M&B since it crashes randomly more than TES: Morrowind back in the day, which aught to tell you something. The devs ♥♥♥♥ the bed in that regard on this release, as it really ruins the game with the constant random crashing. Apparently this is a widespread problem and google searches offered no solutions that actually worked, so for that reason I do not recommend purchasing this game.The guns are a fun addition, and they did some nice improvements in this version (being able to upgrade villages/towns with buildings and leaders), and the quests are fun from what I've been able to do of them between all the crashing. The black mace is a neat item.It still however suffers from a lot of the same issues the original failed with, including the far too intense micro-management babysitting required late-game, where when you conquer most of the map you end up just running around constantly re-taking castles that your own faction cannot defend, or chasing off enemies that just instantly respawn with 100-300 size armies full of top level troops. That part of it really ruins a lot of the fun of the end-game as far as I'm concerned. I should be able to expect my own lords to match up reasonably against enemy lords, but most of them just constant camp in their castles and do nothing of use. Even turning the battles on easy-mode and going hero castle conquering it takes forever, because it just ends up being a ""run around babysitting castles from being taken while my own lords do nothing"" game.Also disappointed in Fire and Sword troop upgrades, most units can be upgraded only once or twice, and a farmer cannot eventually become a knight or anything cool, so that is rather a big part of the game they turned quite boring.Overall I don't recommend this game, it's not worth the money. Way too much crashing and not enough of the previous versions problems fixed to make it worthwhile for the few neat innovations.			"

												The expansions comes with added guns and a bit more content/characters/missions. It's still worth the money because the gunplay is lots of fun. If you like Warband a lot, definitely get this during a sale. If the whole pack is on sale, I recommend you play Warband first before trying this expansion.This is not DLC. This is an expansion. It does not add anything to the Warband game world so to speak, you launch this expansions as a separate game.			"

												This is byfar the worst Mount And Blade game, i'd say topping the original by quite a way. Yet it's still one of the best PC games that you can play. Personally, I hated using the muskets, i didn't like the real world relevance, Mount And Blade is all about Calradia, and the people inside. The weaponry felt quite unbalanced, but besides that being (in my opinion) the absolute worst thing, it expanded in every way and made it so much more interesting to play, making the out of battle experience even richer and more enjoyable. It let me experience this type of game in a way i didn't think possible. So if Fire And Sword's out of gameplay experiences were placed with Warband's setting and gameplay, then it would be the actual perfect game.			"

												As a lover of the other Mount & Blade games, I came in with fairly high expectations and a want to love this game. And I really tried to, but after just 3 hours I realised something.This game is just nowhere near as fun as Warband, or even the original M&B.Perhaps this is unfair, due to my love of a medival environment, and I can't quite put my finger on what I dislike so much; perhaps it's the less interesting units or the changes to certain gameplay aspects such as mercenaries which overall just made the game far less fun for me. All in all, for other lovers of the M&B franchise, I'm afraid I cannot recommend buying this. It's far from being a bad game, but I simply didn't enjoy it. Perhaps worth a buy if on a decent sale.

												This game's mechanics are terrible, stick with mount and blade if you donj't want to rage at the game screwing you over (as it does many times).Some examples of this:Sided with Poland, we were doing well until two polish cities (one was Warsaw) mysteriously became Swedish (no siege, no reports of being conquered).King constantly sieges city that is alternately taken by 3 other powers constantly, we lose all of our forces doing so.Forces really want to siege a city in the heart of the enemy's territory on the other side of the map. So they do this, and it causes 1000 problems.Have to do a part of the main quest where nobody from the country knows the location of the guy I have to visit (literally no one, talked to at least 10 people) and I have never seen him once.  So I can't progress in the main quest at all which I need to do.  Amazing.Somehow 150 troops are faster than my army with only food supplies and half cavalry units.  What the hell.Tons of other problems like these can be avoided by playing native/modded Mount and Blade Warband.  Seriously, don't buy this if you value your time at all.  If you want firearms just buy the Napoleonic Wars DLC for Mount and Blade Warband (multiplayer only).			"

												Mount And Blade: With Fire & SwordI remember i had just still only known the M&B series for such little time, yet after playing Warband. I had to keep going and surely With Fire & Sword kept me at the edge of my seat taking up hour by hour as i couldn't be contained from this outstanding expansion to this godlike franchise.A truely amazing experience i've had with this game for only three days.This expansion or stand-alone DLC for Mount And Blade: Warband (Another great piece to buy) is a definite must have for any PC gamer. Taking place in 17th Century Europe, firearms and explosives have now been introduced causing much more of a threat in casualties. As well as five nations ranging from the Polish, Swedes, Ukranian, Russian and Arabian decent are in constant war with each other. Whilst you, a wandering mercenary must find your calling to either work for these factions and conquer all of Eastern Europe. Or manage to raise an army of young recruits and mercenaries to be a lone wolf and conquer all of Europe yourself.There is also a story for the Poles, Ukranians and Russians in case you want to play in a more linear fashion.Other than that, combat still feels fantastic aside from the old 17th century firearms being able to one shot both you and the AI,  but thats just really my only downside to this game.Realistic, fun, and endlessly entertaining. I recommend Mount And Blade: With Fire & Sword to either veterans of the M&B series or maybe those who wish to start off their long and exciting journey into this series. But be advised, if you are a first timer to this series and buy this, just note the start in this game is far more complex than the start in Warband.Yet at the same time, both Warband and With Fire & Sword are honestly worth the cheap price it asks.

												I have quite a few hours on this off Steam. It's one of the few games I like enough to buy twice.Most people who've played both seem to like Warband better, and I'd have to agree that certain aspects of WB do make it a little easier to get into, one of the major ones being that you'll probably never get killed by some ♥♥♥♥ing peasant with a musket in the land of Calradia.That said, I think that the majority of the people who don't like this game much only feel that way because they don't realize that you need to play it very differently than Warband. It's about commanding your army more than glorious personal combat, all because of the guns. This is a good thing, really, because an unskilled dude being able to kill someone who'd trained all their life for melee combat and had invested a small fortune into their equipment by simply pointing a cheap, crude little stick at them is what ended the feudal era. Very, very few games set around this time (or even far, far later) really accurately represent how game changing a gun really is.The key to having alot of fun with F&S is to play it more like a first person strategy game. Don't charge in there with your mass of calvalry, maybe telling your handful of ranged guys to stand just a ways off of where the collision will occur. This will probably work if you personally don't get killed, but you will take some ridiculous losses. Instead, fight like you would if you were engaging a wall of enemies with deadly ranged weapons. Move up behind hills, set your own musket lines up, and let them slug it out  for a bit. Move around the side with your calvalry. When the moment is right, and the enemy is a little scattered, fix your bayonettes, sound the pipes, and ♥♥♥♥ing CHARGE! Your losses will still be noticable, depending on your army composition, but you can always get more conscripts, and the odds of you getting shot by just one or two ♥♥♥♥ing peasants with muskets is pretty slim.This is the uncaring, unglorious, bloody fighting that is musket warfare, and this is the whole reason to buy this game.In every other way, the game is actually quite a bit better than vanilla Warband. UI is better, menus are better, recruiting isn't really better per se, but much more realistic. Trade is better, etc. etc. It's sort of like fallout 3 and New Vegas - one seems pretty great untill you play the other, then it's hard to really go back and get the same sort of enjoyment out of it.Buy it if you want to support a good franchise, or if you think fighting with muskets sounds fun. If you want glorious personal combat, the ability to strike terror into your foes with Winged Helms, and battles that can always be won just by riding your horse in a circle, buy Warband instead.

												As a lover of the other Mount & Blade games, I came in with fairly high expectations and a want to love this game. And I really tried to, but after just 3 hours I realised something.This game is just nowhere near as fun as Warband, or even the original M&B.Perhaps this is unfair, due to my love of a medival environment, and I can't quite put my finger on what I dislike so much; perhaps it's the less interesting units or the changes to certain gameplay aspects such as mercenaries which overall just made the game far less fun for me. All in all, for other lovers of the M&B franchise, I'm afraid I cannot recommend buying this. It's far from being a bad game, but I simply didn't enjoy it. Perhaps worth a buy if on a decent sale.

												Mount And Blade: With Fire & SwordI remember i had just still only known the M&B series for such little time, yet after playing Warband. I had to keep going and surely With Fire & Sword kept me at the edge of my seat taking up hour by hour as i couldn't be contained from this outstanding expansion to this godlike franchise.A truely amazing experience i've had with this game for only three days.This expansion or stand-alone DLC for Mount And Blade: Warband (Another great piece to buy) is a definite must have for any PC gamer. Taking place in 17th Century Europe, firearms and explosives have now been introduced causing much more of a threat in casualties. As well as five nations ranging from the Polish, Swedes, Ukranian, Russian and Arabian decent are in constant war with each other. Whilst you, a wandering mercenary must find your calling to either work for these factions and conquer all of Eastern Europe. Or manage to raise an army of young recruits and mercenaries to be a lone wolf and conquer all of Europe yourself.There is also a story for the Poles, Ukranians and Russians in case you want to play in a more linear fashion.Other than that, combat still feels fantastic aside from the old 17th century firearms being able to one shot both you and the AI,  but thats just really my only downside to this game.Realistic, fun, and endlessly entertaining. I recommend Mount And Blade: With Fire & Sword to either veterans of the M&B series or maybe those who wish to start off their long and exciting journey into this series. But be advised, if you are a first timer to this series and buy this, just note the start in this game is far more complex than the start in Warband.Yet at the same time, both Warband and With Fire & Sword are honestly worth the cheap price it asks.

												I started playing this game after I beat M&B: Warband. I am still working my way through it, and I am enjoying myself. I will say that Warband is a better game. This game is not bad, however, it is hard to recommend to someone who has not enjoyed Warband first. Bottom line: play through Warband first, if you want more M&B without mods, snag this one when it is on sale.			"

												Good game. It's economical aspect is much better than Warband who had basically no economy.I wish the economy of the game would reflect the income and resources a lord has. That way, commerce would be even more interesting, and being a bandit even more fun as caravans would transport important supplies.Combat, as in all M&B, is excellent. Adding firearms only adds another dimension to the already excellent combat system.It would be nice if the designer could make a gameworld as good as their game system. Right now, few gameworlds were interesting enough to hook me more than a dozen hours each. I lose interest in M&B games due to the bland game worlds. I don't mind having no story if I have something to do in the game world like trading, building, patrolling, hunting, marrying, spying, conquering, diplomacy, politics, economics, road building, bridge building, cult-related stuff, etc. There are very few of these things you can do in all M&B games put together. I really thing they should improve the game worlds they use, they are too colourless.Still, it's a must buy for anyone who dreamed since the 1980s of having a game where you can fight on horseback in real time, not some dumb swings of weapons on horse back, real fighting with some physics involved.

												You wonder: What is this? With fire and sword? The name sounds off tasks of Warband but this... This is warband in the 17th CENTURY! What I nicknamed this was the 3 musketears of Mount and blade because... Its just so simliar to the 3 musketears and you meet a guy from France! I really did like the beggining where you steal a horse (Unlike warband) and ride off like your some sorta gangsters and run into some, Police. But overall there is a fun invasion type where you buy troops (In mp) and then deffend against a entire army of troops! Sadly but surely there is only 1 mod. But the good news is the mod is a Zombie mod? Unlike warband all the zombie mods died! Enjoy this and I hope you get the, Zombie mod for this. Enjoy this!!!			"

												While being a very anticipated game for me and many others, I was very underwhelmed by the work put into this game. While many others did enjoy this game, with right reasoning too, I personally enjoy the other two predeseres to the mount and blade franchise. Let me tell you why. I have seen plenty of mods for mount and blade warband and they have been pretty good. In fact I would go as far as to say some of them are up to par or even better than what with fire and sword has to offer, a ten dollar game mind you, as where the mods were completely free (Minus the game). This game really brought me down and thought the mount and blade series was slowing and going down, but news of a sequal to warband has got my hopes up for the franchise again. Now let me tell you why I prefer warband to this. In this game you dont recruit people from villages anymore, a perfectly fine mechanic they threw that out the window to make it where you have to get people from the merc. camp in the faction. Now this is kinda a load of bull because they cost way too much and also are not very good in combat, the unit upgrade system was funky and when the game was released you could not even upgrade your troops to begin with. The interface and combat seems clunky, the weapons are very unrealisic, and the quests I just dont like in my opinion. Overall rating for this game? 4/10 could be better.			"

												(review of a game previously purchased and played)Mount and Blade: With Fire and SwordYour probably thinking ""I Loved Mount and Blade:Warband .... but now with muskets Awesome!!""  well no, not so much.M&B:Warband was this series crown jewel... Fire and sword is this series ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stepchild.  It feels gimicky, and ruins gameplay that was/is uniquly Mount and Blade.If you want some Mount and blade style gameplay but with muskets buy the DLC for warband called ""Napoleanic Wars"" its amazing and does correctly what Fire and Sword does not.Fans of the series should avoid this title and it pains me to say that as ive supported this developer since i first heard of the Orgional Mount and Blade and bought it to support a new indie dev.  (single guy makes a game... compelling story)  But hes not indie anymore and this title prooves that.Overall id give this title a5/10 (because it doesnt do anything good, and is worse then previous titles)			"

												I have to ask if this was an actual expansion made by those who made M&B Warband..or if this is another glorified Mod like Vikings that got pushed onto steam. If the latter, then it would explain so much.This game has lots of good improvements and additions, yet it just falls so very short. With a game more focused on caravans, less chances for actual combat (In Warband, you could hunt down brigands and such in the early parts. Here, you don't really get so many to hunt down), and a strange voice focus on always saying ""With Fire & Sword!"".This doesn't feel like Warband. It just feels so off and strangely..boring. You have less fighting, and more running around to find who sells salt or the frustrating quest of what Bishop wrote what on what cannons to use as some passcode. The nations/powers don't have the same 'personality' and feel as Swadia & Company.Honestly? Don't buy this. If you want guns THAT badly, find a mod. Any mod that puts them in. But this mod is not worth 10 bucks. Get it under 2-3 dollars if you really *MUST* have it, but Warband is much more fun than this.			"

												Guns = cool, everything else = not as good as warband.EDIT: Heres some more about why I dislike it.To me Fire and Sword just has much less character and charm to it. In Warband I often struggled to gain a large army and to maintain it I enjoyed interactions with the characters, e.t.c, but in FaS I didnt care about the quests the lords gave, the lords/kings, or really anything else. There are also odd choices such as you cant recruit from towns at a certain point, and more. I recomend buying Viking Reforged instead of Fire and Sword, and looking into reviews that competent people have written.			"

												I want to like this game, I really do. But the combat feels so... Unfair, and short. Having played Warband for many hours, this game just didn't feel the same, and mods reflect a general dislike of this game. Something about it makes it feel shorter, and clunkier. This is a game that in my eyes just didn't live up to my expectations. If you want a more balanced combat system, with each class having advantages and disadvantages, then go to Mount and Blade Warband. If you want quick, ranged battles with the battles being dominated primarily by musketmen, then this is the game. If you want a gunpowder multiplayer experience, Mount and Blade Napoleon.			"

												This game constantly feels like there is things missing it it, the Mount & Blade series and every game in its series is based more towards modding and modding is what makes the game; thus saying this, the modding section of this game is pretty low in the section of mods you can get compared to Mount & Blade Warband which is the game that takes home the golden trophy when it comes to this series. Mount & Blade Warband also has a pretty decent vanilla game compared to this game, as this game constantly feels like its missing features as stated before.There is one thing I do like about this game and that's the ability of fire arms in the vanilla game (which there are mods for fire arms in Warband) and the ability to mass recruit soldiers at low costs, other than that I don't really care for the game.If you love Warband you may want to try this game but just know this game is lacking more so in the content department than Warband is and mods are what make up Warband and this game doesn't nearly have the wide variety of mods as Warband has.It's a good game, don't get me wrong but it's just lacking with content and the world feels more empty than Warband and the lack of mods and vanilla features that were in Warband makes me give this game a thumbs down.

												     Caravan Simulator 2015 Is this game.This game adds and takes away a lot from the great M&B Warband.     What it gives?---------------------Caravans-New Map-Ordering Custom Gear (armor/weapons)-Firearms-Main Storylines-New Factions-Cool custom mercs-Banks-------------------     Now what it takes away--------------------Marriage-Tournaments-The usefulness of hiring village volunteers-Crossbows-The Sense of being a hero in a battle-The fun of being able to simply join a faction and get land then break off and be your own nation------------------     I personally find this game pretty fun, but i dislike what they removed mostly. I enjoyed courting my future wife and i enjoyed joining a tournament. I also miss being able to take on 10 guys by myself easy as pie. With the presence of firearms, you WILL die in 1-2 bullets, unless you leave your damage taken at 1/4 (Easiest) Getting fiefs is now a HUGE chore! Want to get your nice personal custom musket? it costs over 100k thaler.. How do you get 100k thaler? There are ways of getting cash, but it still takes quite a long time, I have done about 30 hours of JUST trying to make cash, and in that time i have the best gear OUTSIDE of custom gear. Now banks are useful, but there slow, want to raid a village? cool you get about 1-2k and that faction will hate you and hunt you down DEAD. I do enjoy this but if your a achievement hunter this game will literally take you over 100 hours to finish 1 storyline, unless you cheat but then you dont get that cheevo. The presence of being able to hire top tier soldiers is nice, but you have to wait a few in game days. There is ALOT that just makes this game slow..very very slow, if you are willing to put ALOT of hours into this go ahead. It is not as fun as Warband was, not even close, and I would recommend getting a mod called ""mount and gun"" before this game, i got it on sale for 2$ which is definitely worth it, but i would wait for a sale to get this, it is not worth full price.      Good luck and enjoy! "

												As a veteran of ""The Deluge"" M&B: Warband mod-, -I can safely say that this game, which shouldhave been released as DLC for Warband as it bringsNOTHING new to the table-, not only pales in comparison with [The Deluge] mod, but by doing so, the devs failed to achievewhat they had set out to.

												There is no reason to get this game when there are so many mods for Warband. Some have all the features of Fire and Sword, such as different grades of food and gun warfare. The game lakes quite a bit of polish, even compared to the original Moun and Blade. The gameplay is ruined for me by the fact that for whatever reason, I can't recruit troops from villages. I'm not sure if this is a glitch or a gameplay mechanic, but it ruins the flow of the game because it makes getting high tiered troops impossilbe. If your looking for a fun game in the Mount and Blade series, just stick with Warband or wait for the devs' sequel.			"

												I can't stand this game. With as great as the first Mount and Blade was, you'd think the sequels could only be better. You'd be wrong. The sword controls are completely broken, making it all but impossible to actually swing your weapon in the manner you wish instead of flailing around like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fish out of water. The enemy coding remains just as horrible, however, meaning that once you've flailed yourself into a defeat, if you manage to miraculously get away you can expect the exact same enemy party that just beat you to immediately chase you down again, just to watch you Kermit the Frog your arms around until they beat you again. And again. And again. Unplayable. They should've stuck to updating the original instead of wasting time on this piece of crap ""upgrade"".			"

The mechanics are kinda bad, the animations are stiff, not to mention the bad graphics, that is caused by the, at least,  century old game engine. But oddly enough, it's lack of quality is the charm of it. A lack of that realism, the developers sought to create, actually comes across the board as a positive ""quality"". You don't play it for an technical masterpiece, but to have fun and have a laugh with your friends at some of the ridiculous characters you can create.

												If you are considering getting this game, DON'T. I pre-ordered it with high hopes from  the creators of Mount & Blade/Warband but unless you did heavy research, you'll learn the hard way Fire and Sword is basically a older version of Mount & Blade that was geared towards the European audience just repackaged and released upon the masses at retail price. ($30)When compared to it's ""older"" predeccesors it falls flat on it's face in every single way possible. The addition of firearms isn't nearly enough to make up for the short-comings. You could easily just get a mod for Warband to just add firearms. The character models look like they took the original Mount & Blade's models and just wiped their ♥♥♥ with it. The dev team has not done nearly enough to breathe life into this because in my opinion nearly EVERY faction is the ♥♥♥♥ing same. The only way I can diffrenciate them is ""mongols, other guys with horses, Swedish, everyone else"" the 'unique' units are a joke. The AI is lacking. Marriage? Gone. Companions are generic as hell, certainly no Nizar. I had to FORCE myself to play this game in order to validate my mistake of paying for this game. While they were trying to make it historical, Eastern Europe was not the greatest place to do it so I give them credit for working with what they had. There are not many mods for this game either because what's the point? the Trade missions are a DRAG, villiager missions can go to hell, in fact I can say every mission with MAYBE the main questlines are BORING and REPITITVE and POINTLESS. There is nothing redeeming about this game.RATING:3/10 (a BAD game)The only mistake the devs made was releasing this AFTER Mount & Blade/Warband. This should've been the first game in the series. The M&B games after this would've been hailed as the greatest ♥♥♥♥ing improvement ever. If they were on such a money-grubbing mission they could've at least improved the graphics, AI, EVERYTHING before releasing it. Not even can be called a reskin of Warband because its INFERIOR to Warband. Looking at this game makes me ill.			"

												Mount & Blade: Fire and Sword is the third game from the game series of Mount & Blade. A sandbox game that takes players to control a character in an open world map with multiple  major and minor factions.Those who have played the previous/other games from the same series will know exactly what I am talking. If not, take a look at my Review related to M&B: Warband for a complete knowledge of what the series and its games are about: http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakedaYabu/recommended/So, I’ll begin my review by writing about the bad aspects of the game which are many...No character background story:That lack of such feature before your adventure can even begin, gives you the feeling that you will be playing with a completely random character. Unlike of what happens to all the other previous games in the series, Fire and Sword does not have a custom character background history.Same engine and mechanics as in the previous game, Warband:There is absolutely nothing new in Fire and sword that wasn’t been already seen and experienced in M&B: Warband. From the graphics and textures, what changes are that only muskets and matchlock pistols were added as a main weapon in the field of battle.In few words, this game feels like an average community made mod/expansion, and not an actual game produced from a company who managed just before, to release the best game from its series that defined the whole concept of what a true sandbox game should be.Even more bugs and errors:Despite Warband having some issues with some insignificant bugs and errors that could be easily fixed most of the times, in Fire and Sword, not just it has the same bugs and errors but also other more bugs when you wish to do an action, but also in the quests themselves that can ruin your entire gameplay if you are unlucky enough not to create a save file before you accept that quest.Boring and repetitive:Even when both games follow the same concept of sandbox with a very similar if not the same gameplay style, the way the campaign map is designed being only made of grassland and more grassland instead of the 4 elements seen in Warband, such as the Desert, Snow, Grassland and Montains.Unbalanced game:Despite being interesting at the beginning, once you have invested some time in the game and in your campaign progress, you will realize that the game ends up by making you looting villages, sell items, hire troops and fight.The players routine in the game to achieve success and power is a never ending repetitive loop.Now to the good aspectsMusic:The music in this game is wonderful I must admit, to hear the piano and the violin while you shoot and slain people is very pleasing and mixes perfectly with the time period where the game is based on.The age of gunpowder:The addition of firearms and armies based on it in a Mount & Blade game is unique and indeed a surprise to players who enjoy shooting and slashing down opponents!ConclusionI would rate this game a 20 out of 100 or a 1,0 out of 5,0 stars. The same exact graphics and game mechanics as in Warband in a game that could easily contain success, but failed miserably... a huge disappointment.			"

												Well, it's not that bad. Probably can be fun for some. But overall, I consider it to be awful. I played only 3 hours, because of the early game. And here's the main reason: It's hard. You can put difficulty on easy and lower all options until you get ""14% difficulty"", but you're still going to be killed by villagers. The issue? You aren't fighting farmers, you're fighting the same soldiers you'd recruit. So, yes: 50+ units of the same level of the early game units. You might reply saying that you won't pillage villages soon. Well, wrong. The questline forces you to raid not one but three villages, a task that apparently may only be done with 15 mercs (and I repeat, easy difficulty with 14% difficulty in the options). Of which atleast 10 will die because there are musket militia, and your ""riflemen"" mercs have bows. Have fun.			"

												I bought with fire and sword probably a year or more after it came out because I had  finally purged enough salt from Mount&blade and Mount&blade warband not feeling finished. I was able to buy this on sale for like 1.99 or something.I regret the time I spent installing it. It's a partially reskinned Mount&Blade Warband with guns, but somehow it manages to lack the appeal of its predecessor. I didn't play long enough to really pick up on the nuances of why, but I didn't care to. Uninstalled it as soon as I finished my first session. Probably will reinstall Mount&Blade warband though! If you haven't played that one you might want to check it out!			"

												At first... I was like ""Oh, sweet, a Mount & Blade set during the Deluge!  This sounds really interesting!""  It sounds interesting.  Sounds.I enjoyed Mount & Blade a lot, and I was expecting it to work as sort of an expansion pack similar to most mods or the Napoleonic Wars add on.  However, it turned out to be a stand alone game.Whatever, I can dig it.  I'll just start a new single player campaign.It promptly asks you what difficulty and gender, and immediately after... skips the background and goes directly to the stats screen.  It was unusual, but I figured maybe it was after this part.  I enjoyed having a background for each character, afterall.  Added to the immersion, afterall.What a backstory for your character?  You won't get one here.Alright, that's fine, I can still hang in.  Now, where do I spawn first?  I think Sweden would be fun.Nope, can't do that either.  You begin with a tutorial.  A tutorial.  It leads to your first quest which is fight a gang of bandits and hlp three guys you don't know out of a sticky situation.  Or something, not really sure.  I stopped caring when I realize they just drop you into the action with little motive or reasoning.Well, that was a rough start...  Still, its set during the deluge.  I wonder what weapons you can get.I turn cheatmenu on to see the item list... and it was removed.WELL, that sucked!  Whats the purpose of removing a cheat option?  To balance a game that's already been cheated?Whatever, I'm sick of campaign already.  Time to check out the custom battle!I set up a siege between Sweden and Poland, I'm fighting for the Swedes as a nameless Scottish Halberdier.  Whatever, I get to hit someone with a halberd and I like it.  ^^The battle starts off like most Mount and Blade battles, so no real difference there.  The moment I die, the battle ends...  Which is strange.  Yes, I know Mount and Blade tends to end battles when you die, but with all the mods that continue the battles... you'd think they'd take a cue from the community.  I mean, Napoleonic Wars began as a mod.  And now its like $10 on steam.Whatever, I'll just host a mulitplayer match and turn a password on so the battle continues.  Siege again... and I forget the AI is stupid in Multiplayer.  Something they won't ever fix...  Not like they can just take the NPCs from the Singleplayer game and use them instead of the bots, but whatever.  I'll just take a moment to check out the armor and weapons we can get for each faction and each unit.The stuff you get are just as bad, apparently.  ""Its realistic, though!""  Realism would mean they didn't call Russian Musketeers 'Riflemen'.Whatever...  If you want some deluge action in Mount and Blade Warband, save yourself the money and find a mod on the forums.  I'm sure there is something that is just as good, if not better.  Overall, I don't think this game would be a good buy for your library.			"

												While this game features firearms and grenades it adds nothing to the mount and blade experience, this DLC is worth skipping out on in my opinion. The map, factions and combat with these changes don't feel engrossing at all and are completely inappropriate for the engine.

												DO NOT BUY for SP!Every line of main quest is broken, i am sure you'll at least encounter one game breaking bug that will not let you to advance in main quest chain.For MP you can buy only if you like the idea of MB:WB style of multiplayer experience with very accurate muskets. Though some mods of MP are still bug ridden.Go buy napoleonic wars mod for mp warband with muskets and best community.			"

												Multiplayer is fun, but the single player is awful. Battle auto ends if you get knocked out, even if you still have a 100 troops alive, and only one enemy left to kill.I took over a polish town that was occupied by Crimean forces, and it made me a Crimean rebel. It won't let me start up my own nation, and i'm labeled a rebel. In being a rebel, it won't let me talk to the commanders that i paid money for in hopes that they could hire some troops, but no option for that, even though i hired them.			"

												The gameplay of F&S is nearly alien to warband. Only play this game if you are expecting completley different gameplay. Here are a few differences:-You cannot get professtional troops from villages. The most you can get out of them is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ millita.-In order to get better troops, you must do a lot of pointless ♥♥♥♥ or go to overpriced mercenairy camps-Features such as weddings are removes-Your guys will die very easily (trust me)-You cannot chose your own beggining.

As you are only just starting out, they have a whole team that could wipe you out with no effort. Not recommended to anyone till they lower down the difficulty for the starting part.

												Can somebody say ""frustrating?""  This game is relentless to newcomers and vets alike.  If not for the guns, Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword would be just Mount and Blade, but it would also be exponentially better.  From the begginning of the game to the pinnacle of your rule, guns remain the height of your fear.  Just a single bullet can put a player down in a battle, leaving the rest of the fighting to the exceptionally stupid AI who always seem to lose if they're on your side.  Simple occurrences like that can set a player back hours, and this happens over and over again.  This is a game Macklemore would turn down, even if it was just 99 cents.			"

												The addition of black powder weapons is interesting and executed well enough.  However, the campaign map is flat and empty, they abandon the mildly interesting low-fantasy setting of the previous game for pre-Napoleonic Eastern Europe, and somehow it actually manages to look uglier than the predecessor ""Warband"".

												I don't know why, but I could never into this mount and blade very much. I loved Warband but fire and Sword just wasn't cutting it for me. Perhaps, It was my hundreds of hours of Mount and Blade: Warband that wore me out but I just couldn't enjoy it.  I felt like it added almost nothing to the game except rifles which I disliked pretty intensely and would just use my bow to shoot everyone in the face who dared to aim one at me.			"

												To judge this game is to compare it with the others. It is a okay game some graphic errors (how you hold a gun sometimes), but the story is based on west europe not the fantasy realm. A fun game but without that aspect it doesn't feel as fun this game doesnt seem to be a game of alternate history more of fantasy so I suggest Warband then this. Over all I give it a 4.6/10			"

												Its far from as good as Mount & Blade warband.What i felt most disapointing was the singleplay. Sure it has some new mechanics but i didnt find them any good or fun.Also you don't get those epic and fun fights like you do in warband. Becuse you spend most of the fights hiding behind a rock, tree or your soldiers so you wont get one shot by some random rifleman 100m away.The rifle combat is so awful. The rifles are very strong so you can often get suprised killed by anyone. Useing a rifle yourself is even worse since the bullet can fly anywere. So shooting becomes more of luck then a skill. With the high relode time just makes it worse. If you want to fight with rifles in a mount and blade game i recomend the napolic dlc for warband. Becuse the rifles are more accurate so its more skill based, It feels more epic with music and cannons, I think relode is faster or atlest it feels faster. I only got the hours on the game becuse the melee combat in multiplayer was the one fun thing.			"

												I though this was going to be a good game, better than Warband. Guess what? It wasn't. It's exactly like M&B:W but with a smaller troop recruitment, Want to play as a Warlord that conquers land? Too bad. This game takes away the feel that you can conquer every single village,town,fortress,castle, and Capital. This is a good game overall(Graphics, Storyline ETC.) but the gameplay isn't that good, I though it would be like M&B:W but with cannons. It wasn't. (I also got it for 75% off, thank God I didn't get it at full price.)			"

												It's the black sheep of M&B. The addition of firearms to the base game essentially unbalances everything, and being shot anywhere ♥♥♥♥s you up something terrible. This and the period of history it depicts are the only real divisions between it and Warband.However, you probably only own this anyway because you bought the collection, in which case you have Napoleonic Wars which is far better, despite being multiplayer only. Out of all the numerous modules you can get for Warband, Fire & Sword will probably be played the least.			"

												With Fire & Sword is a version of the game Mount & Blade, the game that claims to be a mix of a role play game and a wargame. The most obvious changes are the replacement of crossbows with firearms, a new map and the 16th/17th century setting.  This is the time that warfare gradually changed from melee based to firearm based. (A side note: the setting actually mixes  aspects of the 16 century setting with that of the  17th century. The halbediers belong more to the former century and the musketeers/cavalry more to the latter.)There some  other changes. There seem to be more quests and the recruitment system has been overhauled. However, at the core the game is the same and as such has the same problems as the old game, such as a rudimentary battlefield mechanism, a nonexistent storyline,  a simplistic dialogue tree, superficial boring personalities and  tedious repetitive battles of which there are way too many. And these problems are  now compounded by the introduction of firearms.With muskets you can kill an adversary from the other side of the map and what is more.. he can do the same.  In fact the ai is actually better at shooting because it isn't bothered by the fact that from a distance avatars are so small that you can't make them out right. My first half hour was spend being shot to pieces. The only way to escape that fate is by  moving in an unpredictable pattern so the enemy can't take aim properly. In the meantime you either have to try and kill them with your own firearm(while moving about in a random way!) or with your  sidearm. Battles turn therefore into tedious hit and run activities in which standing still is an invite to be killed on the spot.The milita that you can recruit at the start is woefully inept to deal with anything better than looters and once you have enough of them to actually have a chance to win a fight, your army is so slow that you can't catch deserters, brigands and such because they are faster than you. So you either have to fight enemies who are superior to your inept troops.. or hope to corner a band of ruffians,which involves you in chasing them across the map hoping you won't loose sight of them when the night sets in or when they run into a wooded area.In fact the best thing to do is not to recruit any militia or infantry but to go from town to town to find and  hire mercenary cavalry or  heroes so you can overtake your enemies or have a chance to runaway from them when they are too strong.In any event the game seems to promise to become a protracted boring game, like the basic game was, but now you can use firearms and play on a map that represents eastern europe. The game is neither a good role play game nor a good wargame, because it doesn't implement either aspect well and  it amazes me  that people actually consider this game to be good.But I guess tastes differ..

												This 17th-century counterpart to the fun-filled Mount and Blade: Warband was ill-conceived and does not even nearly measure up to its predecessor. Firearm-based warfare simply does not fit into Mount and Blade's combat system, and the result is silly, disjointed battles rife with anachronistically-accurate gunshots. In the period during which this game takes place, one would be lucky to hit a barn at 100 meters with a musket. As such, massed volleys were the order of the day. Not so in this title. Want to hit an enemy from 50 meters with a pistol while riding at full speed on your horse? No problem. And don't be surprised if you get sniped from halfway aross the map under the same circumstance. And it's not just the battles that are bad: the campaign takes a giant step backwards from Warband also, lacking numerous gameplay aspects native to that superior title. Campaign gameplay in With Fire and Sword mainly boils down to running away from bandits and endlessly playing errand boy to local lords, and is both needlessly difficult and extremely tedious.Though this game is sold at a bargain-bin price, it is truly not worth any amount of your money or time. Avoid.			"
