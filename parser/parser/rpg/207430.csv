												For a brief moment I couldn't decide whether this game is just too hard or game design is severely flawed.Now I've come to a conclusion - this game is VERY flawed. It's pure RNG, even the knowledge you gain by trying to beat it will be countered by incredible randomness.It doesn't give you a sense of progression, you either get lucky or not.			"

												As of this writing, 49% of the reviews for this game are positive.  This is frankly, to me inexplicable as this is the worst game in my library of 90 so far.  What makes this game obnoxiously bad, egregiously terrible is that it has surface appeal.  It deceives the experienced player of roguelikes into thinking that strategic and thoughtful play will be rewarded if one can intuit the subtle rules of the game.  Don't waste your time.  There is no depth of gameplay here.  For example, you find a potion.  Will it hurt you or heal you?  It's random. It might give you a permanent defect.  Or it might heal you.  There is no way to tell unless you drink it.  Intelligent decision making in this game amounts to not wasting a precious minute of your life on this cynical trap created by a soulless programmer whose only goal was to part you from your hard earned money.  It is one of the most offensively designed games I ever played in my life.  I am passionate in my hatred of this game.  Good day sir or madam.			"

												Alright, I tried to like this game, I really did. Normally I can get some enjoyment out of rogue-like or rogue-lite games. Hard games are fine. Games like Demon's Souls or Dark Souls? Great fun. But Dark Souls has a design philosophy that makes sense. If you die, it's your own fault. You're punished for your own failures. But this game? It's basically just a coin flip that determines whether you win a fight or not. You're punished for things you have no control over.I think the biggest point of failure is the lack of a maximum health stat. Sure health is there, but the problem is it is finite, and can only be replenished by picking up a random enchantment from a scroll or potion or what have you. And keep in mind that it's random whether or not you find a scroll and random again whether or not this scroll will heal you. It could even be detrimental and hurt you instead. Basically if you get unlucky and take too much damage in combat? You're hooped. You have no chance. The point of health in most games is to give you a chance to survive even if you get unlucky.There's additional classes that you can unlock, but the game is so entranced with being obtuse that it doesn't tell you at all how to unlock them. I unlocked one somehow and the game didn't even inform me that I had. I only found out when I returned to the main menu and found another class just sitting there.			"

												The game in a nutshell:*Miss**Miss**Miss***Dead**Buy a couple of dice. It will be cheaper and WAY more fun than this game.And the chances of getting a desired number on said dice are accurate, as oppossed to this game's RNG.RNG (random number generator) is an important part in roguelikes. It's not, however, the ONLY meaningful part.This is the game's worst sin. it's completely random. In good roguelikes, there's a lot of strategy and thought. Randomness can screw you up, but usually, a good player can turn the tides.Not in hack, slash, loot. Frankly it's like someone saw the success of rogue-lites and jumped the wagon without actual knowledge of what makes a roguelike/lite a good game.Protip: it's NOT randomness what makes a roguelike good. Randomness is just one of the ingredients.			"

												A good roguelike is characterized by providing you limited resources and abilities, but presenting situations where your choices among those resources and abilities are generally meaningful and significant to your survival and progress. Hack, Slash, Loot does not understand this, limiting options to the point where the game may as well be a linear corridor occasionally blocked off by an enemy or a small numeric increase. I cannot stress how disappointed I am that I gave this developer my money.			"

												Meh...everything in this game is random. Everything. From the level generation to attacking and being attacked. You could literally die from the first rat you fight if your random luck is bad enough. I started one game where I spawned, opend the first door , and was greeted with about 7 enemies that swarmed me from the surrounding rooms. All of which got to take shots at me while I had to focus on one hoping I could get some quick kills. Of course I ""Missed"" about the first 4 turns I had so the game lasted 12 seconds before I died. It is basiclaly just a game of chance that you hope you will acquire some fantastic weapon, or gear randomly and you hopefully don't get hit every time you have to fight something before you can hit them. You can't really run away from anything unless you get a double move item. It's just not that good and I wouldn't recommend it to roguelike fans at all. There is little to no ""skill"" involved in this game, and you will see no progression in which you feel like you are getting better at the game. If you like playing games that can only be beaten by having a lucky day, thengo for it. If you want a challenge and feel like you beat something based on skill...don't bother. Idle this game for the cards if you happened to buy it in some crap bundle and don't even bother playing it while you do that.			"

												""Hack, Slash, Loot"" is an overpriced waste of time. What could of been a cute little roguelike is purely an only-RNG based mess of a game that has you rely only on luck. There is maybe only one mission you can play through the longest since it has easier enemies but even then the game is all luck based. There is no real progression here, and there is nothing in this game worth mentioning as a positive. You can get dozens of far superior and cheaper roguelikes (E.G Dungeons of Dredmore, Tales of Maj'Eyal) and you can just find a bunch of free rogue likes anywhere, with a thousand times the quality.This game is worthless.

												Hack, Slash, Loot is a simple dungeon crawling roguelike that keeps everything minimal: the graphics are low resolution, the characters are limited, the story is basic. However, this is not its weakness. The gameplay can be awkward with the mouse, and bearable with the keyboard. What ruins it the most though, is the awful game mechanics where constant misses send your character to the grave randomly, and most of the times prematurely. Sadly, it fails to entertain even those looking for some casual retro fun.			"

												I strongly recommend you avoid this rogue-like. Since I can't really think of any pros that this game contributes to the genre, I'm just going to talk about the flaws.This game is BRUTAL. I know rogue-likes are supposed to have you constantly die over and over but at least you make progress and learn a little more about the game each time you play through. However, I don't feel this way at all when playing this game. Well okay, I learned one thing.This game practically eliminates 1/3 of your class choices. By attacking with warrior-like classes, you're guaranteed to miss most of your attacks and die within 3 minutes. With ranged classes, you, for whatever reason, have a higher accuracy and don't run as high a risk of getting hit, even with your health being low.Speaking of which, it's almost impossible to get back any health you lose. In other games you find potions to restore your health and your armor is actually an important statistic. However, in this game, the potions are extremely rare, they don't always give you health (and the ones I've found give less than 10 HP), and with as much armor as I could find, I was still taking FIFTEEN damage from an enemy on the first floor of the game! Also, you start off with either 20, 30, or 40 HP, so...Speaking of the floors in this game, the chances of completing a floor, or even moving on to the next floor, are low, really low. These floors are massive, and while that may not be the worst thing, there's no inventory system, and consider the flaws I've mentioned before. I've gotten to the second floor ONCE out of all my playthroughs, and naturally I lasted no more than a  minute. My luck, huh?Speaking of luck, the biggest problem is the randomized generation this game has. I'm not thrilled with starting a game, having two enemies appear in front of me, me missing my attacks, and dieing without making A SINGLE MOVE. Also, like I said before with the damage, I don't find it really fair that an enemy on the first floor could whittle down a chunk of my health before even going through more than five rooms.			"

												Hack, Slash, Loot has almost no redeeming qualities.  Seriously.  The pixel art looks cool and retro for a couple of minutes but there is no variation on the blue tileset.  What you see in the screenshots, that's it.  Blue.There is no strategy to it, you cannot avoid monsters once you've seen them and combat is random.  That means you're playing a dice simulator and hoping to roll only winning numbers.  There is nothing more, you can't hide, you can't change from melee to ranged fighting you have no inventory and can't heal after fights.  You can't even run away because evey character moves at the exact same speed.Gameplay-wise there are just two tyes of enemy.  Those that do random damage from a distance and those that do random damage up close.  Again that's it.  There's no space for depth of play, roll a dice and hope.The strange view angle sometimes makes it difficult to tell if you're standing next to something or one square away from it and also sometimes hides cupboards behind walls.  A minor gripe but gvien Hack, Slash, Loot does nothing right it all adds up to a pretty terrible experience.Lastly - and for me the most frustrating - is the 'animation'.  One character moves at a time, if there are 8 serfs around you and a bunch of demons then you've got to wait for each one to do their little bobbing movement.  Similarly with ranged combat, if you're firing at an archer on the other side of the map it degenerates into a very slow game of ping-poing as the arrow crosses the screeon one way and then crosses the screen the other.Play 'Doom the Roguelike' instead.  It's free and it's awesome.  Hack, Slash, Loot is neither.			"

												Simple is not always good. A game needs to offer its players enough options to form strategies against whatever challenges are posed. Otherwise, you're just playing a glorified slot machine. I don't think the folks behind Hack, Slash, Loot understood this because they made a dungeon crawler that has classes with no skills and loot with no inventory.The game dumps you straight into a cluttered, pixellated menu where you pick your class and your quest, and then get dumped into a crowded, nondescript dungeon. The perspective is a weirdly squished 2D where tiles are twice as wide as they are long, which crams the otherwise pleasant character sprites too close together. As you navigate the random floors and rooms, you'll find items like weapons, armor, potions, and scrolls laying around. Gear can only be swapped with what you already have, with the stat change shown in the corner when you mouse over items. Similarly, consumables are used the moment you pick them up, and their purpose is obfuscated in an annoyingly Nethacky way so you don't know what they'll do for sure until you use them.These are all corner cases for those times that you're not beset by monsters. HSL is packed to the brim with things that want to kill you, while offering absolutely no tactical options for killing them back besides funnel them through a doorway. While this isn't terribly different from many old-school roguelikes, the distinct lack of healing items or reliable gear upgrades is. Everything appears to be randomized in the extreme, and with no inventory, there's no way to store potions or food until you actually need it. There's not even a guarantee any will appear, because I've definitely had runs end on the first floor because literally no healing options were offered.Imagine playing Diablo without skills, potions, or inventory, and you get a very basic idea of how flawed HSL is. Streamlined roguelikes are an excellent idea because many of the classics go way too far in their complexity, but this completely overshoots the mark in the opposite direction. Nothing you do in this game will effect whether or not you win, and there's not even any sort of overarching progression system to make losing worthwhile. With all the clever, interesting roguelikes on Steam now, Hack, Slash, Loot is better left forgotten.			"

												I looked forward to a challenging game, what I got was 2.x hours of pure frustration. If I wanted to fight this hard for something I would have started an argument with my mother-in-law over anything family related and would have still had an easier time.To quote some people on just one of the threads in the forums:-“I've played a lot of rogue-likes, and it's one of the most unfair, least skill based, unreasonable rogue-likes I've ever played, to the point that a lot of fans of the genre refuse to even count it.”“Almost threw my CPU out the window.”“This sums up my experience with this game.

												If you want to have an idea of how random this game is, then press ctrl + f  (cmd + f on a Mac) and type ""random"".I love many ""random"" games, but like it has been pinpointed in other reviews, in such games you're essentially learning from your mistakes and experience, one's own self ""out of character xp level"" experience that adds to your skills and perception by grasping the mechanics of the game. In such games, you're rewarded progressively by the experience you have gathered in earlier play-throughs and in every new game you're becoming better, not because you're upgrading a character from the game (Rogue Legacy I am looking at you!) but because you're comprehending better how the game is actually working. That leads to the conclusion that the deeper the mechanics of a game, the more rewarding the feeling of satisfaction you're getting from it.Unfortunately, 'Hack, Slash, Loot' is not such a game, in all of the above statements.

												HSL is a very old-school roguelike with the usual turn-based movement and permadeath, but does have decent pixel graphics and can be completely mouse-driven.  The difficulty is just as brutal and unforgiving as the ancient and free ascii/tileset roguelikes.  The only mercy is that stronger playable characters are unlocked through number of deaths as well as wins so, since you will be dying a lot, it won't all be in vain.You start with a warrior, archer and wizard and, from there, can unlock around 30 additional classes to play.  There are a handful of different quests you can undertake, which will decide the types of enemies you'll be up against, dungeon layout and general mood.  Besides having achievements, there is nothing special or fun about Hack, Slash, Loot in comparison to all the free roguelikes out there.  I would only recommend paying for it to a hardcore roguelike enthusiast; anyone else who wants a traditional roguelike on Steam should just play Dungeons of Dredmor, Sword of the Stars: The Pit or Tales of Maj'Eyal.

												This is a top down retro style dungeon crawler along the lines of an old DOS dungeon crawler with random dungeons, random enemies and everything will kill you. The art style is nice, but really too many games are doing retro. As a game, Hack, Slash, Loot is not fun, it doesn't just feel unfair, but it feels more difficult than fun. You can pick a class or have it random. You can pick a mission / quest or randomly do one. Either way everything is random.The controls don't feel that good. Everything is grid and turn based. You can use arrow keys to walk around and arrow keys to push into an enemy and attack. You can attack diagonally, but that would mean using the mouse, which is fine if you're using a mouse. You can mouse click square by square to move too. If there are no enemies, you can mouse click to move several tiles. But its all turn based. You go once, the 'active' enemies all need to go before you move. You all go one by one, you don't have 10 units of movement and enemies have 6 moves of unit. You all go 1 space at a time. I had to explain this, because there are other games that feature more movement spaces or real time movement.The levels generated don't feel balanced, its either you vs 100 or its you + 100 allies vs 1. But hey random is random. This is jut really unpolished. A lot of games would have an easy level first even if its random, but an easy level to get your feet wet so you can get some items. Not this game. Sometimes the only door to go from the start leads to a room laughably full of enemies.You end up having to bottleneck to survive half a dozen enemies. Luckily the enemy AI is smart enough to go around and flank you on the other side of the room. Not always of course. Most of the time the bottle-necking works well enough, but the attacks miss.... a lot. I could understand enemy attacks missing, for game balance or at least having enemy attacks do minor damage when you just start out. Not this game.The classes don't even feel that balanced. The melee classes seem to by far be the best. Especially the knight which, just doesn't seem to die at all. It slaughters everything. It may sound fun, but the catch is, there's such little depth to this game that it becomes a chore trying to find the next level to the quest. I'm bored long before I die. The range classes have a difficult task ahead of them, because of 'fog of war,' you don't see what's in a room until you open the door. When you open the door, there are enemies in there and rooms never seem to be large enough to kill enemies before they pile on you and murder you.Its just not fun, a lot of monotony, room full of enemies, fall back to bottleneck. As the knight you can just run from room to room and not even stop to face enemies, because its just a waste of time. The game is so shallow that you reach your peak pretty quick. Not just that, some different dungeon graphics would have been nice, its all blue. Every screen shot is blue. I feel like I saw everything the game has to offer within 10 minutes let alone the time I played it for. To top it off, there is no save, but maybe the game expects you to die before you'll ever save. I can't recommend Hack, Slas, Loot. Luckily I bought it for $1, but otherwise there are plenty of free dungeon crawlers out there.			"

												They should just rename this game to ""Miss, Miss, Die"", because that's the only thing that ever happens. This game is, in my opinion, a misunderstanding of the roguelike genre. The point and basic design behind classic roguelikes is that it's tough but fair - every decision matters and every situation is or should be winnable with good enough tactics. This game, however, is essentially just a slot machine with a cute fantasy theme and nice sprite graphics. Whether you win or die is entirely up to the randomization engine. Will you survive and beat the quest? Depends on what loot you randomly find! There's no other way to level up, so it's all down to the loot. Will you survive the next fight? Depends on if your character suddenly feels like missing ten bloody times in a row! Essentially, your character in this game is the most useless warrior in existance. They can't even hit a mountain with a homing missile! Fights are tense, indeed, but not because the game is cleverly designed; simply because your useless character will just spend the entire fight missing their attacks. Death in this game never, ever feels like it's your fault, because there is nothing you could've done. There is no room for strategy and enemies just come rushing at you, eating away at your health while your mentally disabled warrior keeps missing and missing. This game has very nice spritework, is nicely programmed and is generally well-crafted, but it is absolutely not fun or rewarding in any way. If you want to play some games of chance and see how lucky you are, hit up a casino instead.			"

												While this is a part of a trend, I really wanted to like the game as it seemed to have potental but it seems to have wasted it in various ways.I don't mind the graphics, but a glaring thing is the lack of variety in tilesets. The spites/animation are pretty basic.Music isn't too badNow for the big beef; Roguelikes are random but this takes it to absurd levels as fights often devole into flurries of ""MISS!"" and prying the enemy doesn't get lucky with his hit and/or damage.The items aren't so random as some claim as there's hints as to their effects, the Gyphs on some quests on the other hand.... yeah pretty random. But there's not much of a stockable healing item to be seen nor a passive healing ability that often appears in some games.These things combine to make a quest often an exercise in futility as unless you get lucky, you'd get worn down and dead on the first floor.

												Hack, slash, loot is more of a rogue....light then roguelike, why?! because you cannot really control the death of your character very much? Why again you ask? Because you cannot control the hitrate of enemies, meaning you can miss 10 times in a row(high chances of oing at least 5 misses in a row).The game can be fun but frustrating aswell. there are a few strategy guides out there that can help you but again you cannot control when your character dies.The game does have a decent number of characters, no skill tho, only items being gear(armor/wep/accesory which only boost/nerf your stats), a decent number of achievements, not a big number of maps tho, espite each of them beeing randomly generated each time.I say try it at least but i can't really recomend it as a GOOD game, ill give it an average at best!

												Hack, Slash, Loot, or ""HSL"", looks charming at first with it's retro-style pixel art... until you realize that the gameplay is even more primitive. It is not an understatement to say that everything in this game either comes down to little more than random chance and comparing numbers. Combat is completely limited to clicking on an enemy until they die. That's it. No special moves, no abilities, no changing gear, nothing. Sure, depending on your weapon you either use melee, ranged or magic attacks, but unless you're fighting near a weapon drop you can't change on the fly, plus your character will usually specialize in one type so there' very little reason to change unless you get VERY skewed consumable drops (more on that later). At best you can try to bottleneck enemies in doorways or tight coriidors to fight them one by one, or run away and hope you find something useful before you get surrounded, but that barely qualifies as ""strategy"". And even then, you still have to hope that RNGesus is smiling down upon you. The item system is almost as primitive. Most of the time, it feels less like you are trying to decide which weapon or piece of armor to equip, and more like you're just comparing numbers (although special damage types such as the stunning Lighting do make things a little more interesting) As for consumables, you never know if a potion or w/e will help and/or hinder you, meaning once again it's entirely up to luck rather than any sort of choice or strategy if it help you.Oh, and there's no save system. At all.All in all, this game had a lot of potential, but instead the gameplay is comparable to banging your head against a wall while comparing helmets and popping pills that ""might"" make it hurt less. What this game needed was something, ANYTHING that might have made the gameplay more complex than dice rolling: Abilities/items to use in a pinch, swapping around weapons, etc etc: anything that would make success less dependant on how lucky you are. If you're at all thinking of picking up this title anyway, I highly recommend buying another game called One-Way Heroics instead, which in a nutshell is practically like this game with the improvements I just suggested, and at only somewhat more than half the price.

												SUMMARY OF ALL BELOW: It is repetitive and random, never supplies you with anything useful, and all around sucks. Don't even buy it if it is on sale, even if it was free, you should stay away.SO, STILL THINKING OF BUYING IT? :   No. This game is absolutely terrible.

Really need some better armor? Too bad! Maybe on your next run.   Really need some health? Tough luck, buddy, there is no regen, and you don't know what potions do!   Really need... Anything?

It seems more like a crappy flash game that you would find on Kongregate, rather than a $1.00 game that is on Steam...    Wait, wait a sec, what? WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT IS $7.00!?! Bull, to the shizzle, 'cause this game is seven whole dollars. Hell, let's face it, I would be dissapointed in the purchase even if it was only $1.00. Thank Christ I only got it from the Humble Bundle, which I really only bought for Dungeons of Dredmor anyway.   If you want a much better game than this, get Dungeons of Dredmor (which I hope to play later) or The Sword of the Stars: The Pit. Even though The Pit isn't exactly my favorite in terms of being fair, it still is much better than this steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ that dares call itself a $7.00 game.Hack, Slash, Loot? More like Miss, Miss, Die. But in the end, I guess that's just my 2 cents.			"

Very few runs are winnable in this game and it takes a helluva lot of luck to win. There are so many better Rouge-likes out there nowadays that this game shouldn't even be on your radar.

Unlike other roguelikes, I didn't feel like I learned anything with each death.It's also not pretty to look at - it's hard to tell the difference between enemies (which one of those is the one shooting ranged attacks?), and sometimes it's even hard to tell the difference between enemies and furniture.

												Do not buy this game.  If you're looking for a good roguelike, pick up Dungeons of Dredmor instead (a much cheaper, and better game).  This game is basically a RNG, where it takes absolutely 0 skill to win since it's based on 100% luck.  You don't unlock character by winning, you unlock them by dying in the same dungeons with the same 3 characters until you unlock the Amazon character (which starts with one of the only ""good"" items).  I have no idea why a game developer would reward people who suck at the game, rather than people who can actually complete it.  I love roguelikes, but this is not a roguelike.  This game is garbage, and the developer is an embrassment to indie game developers.			"

												Welcome to Dungeon HellThese sort of Rogue-like games are appearing a lot nowadays. What is a rogue-like? Essentially its a dungeon crawler with random elements abound from random rooms, random enemies and even random item effects. They are tough as hell and often only for real fanatics.This makes a little bit of an attempt to make things more acessable, different character classes try and make different ways to play work, a limited inventory throws out a lot of 'garbage' items and movement/attacking is done via simple clicks. However it throws itself back into the pit by cranking up the difficulty level to make things brutally hard, the random generator more often than not throwing you into rooms right from the get-go that kill you almost instantly.And its this that kills the game dead, theres no fun in repeatedly dying and resetting into a whole new dungeon so any progress or memory is taken away. There is also no fun in having controls that make it far too easy to accidentally hit 'friendly' characters, nor is it fun to have to unlock characters by the amount of times you have failed.Its a tiny filesize game but theres zero fun to be had here. Avoid.			"

												True to its title, Hack Slash Loot is about as straightforward a rogue-like as you can find. After choosing a hero and a themed dungeon (Goblin fortress! Pharaoh's tomb! Dragon's lair!), you are given a paragraph of exposition and sent straight into mouse-clicky battle. Your goal? To reach the fifth floor of the dungeon and slay the boss monster. There's no leveling to speak of, no skills, no puzzles. Your choice of character only determines your starting gear and your proficiency with melee, ranged, or magic attacks, all of which function identically except that melee can only attack adjacent opponents. That isn't to say there's no strategy involved in the game; HP restoration is very limited, positioning in combat is crucial, and knowing what sorts of monsters and hazards each dungeon contains can make or break your survival. However, the primary method for improving your character is to loot the place, which means endlessly comparing your current items to every item drop you come across in the hopes that one of them might outperform your current outfit. If you're lucky, you'll find something early on which offers tons of resistances or one of the handful of special abilities that can easily carry you through to the end. If you're not lucky, well, keep dying, and eventually you'll turn up something nice.In the end, HSL suffers from a crummy GUI, tedious mechanics, and a lack of variety in almost every field. It's perfectly playable, and winning is admittedly somewhat satisfying, but you can get better bang for your buck in plenty of other places.			"

												The game is too random.Player skill means nothing, method means nothing, loot means nothing.The only thing that means anything is a lucky roll of the dice.If you head to the forums to try and find out why you die immediately and can never progess, you will find that many of the missions are only possible with certain unlocked character classes. And such classes are often far better than the starting set. Rediculous and awful idea for progression.Dev abandoned this the minute it hit the shelves. Expect no updates other than trading card artwork.The only perks I am able to squeeze out of this unforgiving rock are that I enjoyed the simplistic artwork, and that there were no visible game breaking bugs.I can honestly say this is one of my few steam purchases I am really upset about, because it was a complete and utter waste of money for all the aforementioned reasons, and I have no way to get my money back.Avoid at all costs.

												Difficult, unfair, and completely based on luck. Fun!An attempt to get back to the roots of roguelikes that sadly needs complete rebalancing before it gets anywhere close. Still, as a turn-based roguelike it can offer a few hours of fun, assuming you manage to survive for more than a few turns. Can be IMMENSELY frustrating to go through a hundred tries without even getting to the second floor of a dungeon. Past the first few hundred deaths the first glipses of strategic gameplay can be seen, but they're nevertheless completely overwhelmed by reliance on luck. Still, getting lucky and making it to the end of a quest delivers a strange sense of accomplishment.			"

												The problem is you're completely at the mercy of the RNG. Miss five times in a row? You're dead. Get poisoned? You're dead. Get an enchanted necklace that heals you over time? You're overpowered. All the melee characters are the same, all the ranger and wizard characters are the same. You don't have any control over the outcome of the game. It feels like the only strategy beyond basic positioning is ""Get lucky."" Maybe I'm just bad at the game, but I don't see much reason to spend time on it at all when there are so many other, better roguelikes you could be playing instead, like Dungeons of Dredmor or Binding of Isaac or FTL.

												Hey, you!Want to get something for someone that you hate that expresses how much contempt you have for them but Bad Rats is even too good for them? Well, concider this pile of vomit! A Roguelike so terrible that watching a newborn kitten getting ripped apart by a Gorilla would be preferred to playing this!I got this from a bundle awhile back (the only way I would get it, because this game isn’t worth buying on its own and needs to shave 6.99 off its price tag at the least and even THEN its still asking too much for this thing) and since it was just lumped in their I decided to give it a try.Before I go any further let me just say that I LOVE Roguelikes. I love the genre to pieces. I just got into them about a two year ago as of writing this, so while i’m no expect and have yet to beat even one Roguelike (i’ve come close...VERY CLOSE on a few of them) even the ones that normally hand me my butt back to me on a silver platter I still enjoy. This is a bad Roguelike. To expand on that, this is what makes a Roguelike good in my eyes. Its fairly difficult, offers customization, practically an out for almost any situation if you’re smart enough to keep something on you to deal with it when the time comes (assuming you were lucky enough to find it) and, while it relishes in kicking your butt its still, for the most part fair and the majority of your deaths are your fault. You could had done something to prevent it from happening, or hold out longer or even WON.This game is the polar opposite. The antithesis of Roguelikes that should only be kept alive in our hearts, minds and souls as a case study on how NOT to make a Roguelike. Its hard, but hard as in cheap. My little brother tried it once and never again because he was spawned in a room surrounded by three monsters and died after trying to move away and didn’t last even one click. The customization is their, but its all in the gear for the most part, and you can only bring with you what you’re wearing.That’s right. No inventory to speak of and is incredibly unfair. Now I know Roguelikes are some parts luck based, but the luck factor in this one is so high it doesn’t even feel like you’re in control of anything. You get as far as the game allows, so you must deal with it. You can’t fight fate.Don’t buy this game, don’t even pirate it, its not even worth the time to STEAL IT. And despite what I said, don’t even give this to your worst enemy! Only Hitler would do that, and you’re not Hitler...ARE YOU!?			"

												I'm seeing a lot of reviews that the game is bad, due to it's previous glitches and the difficulty, I think it deserves a chance from first impressions.I must say the game gets annoying due to the fact that the difficulty is off the charts on the last levels of the main quest, I can't say of the other quests but they probably play in a similar matter.Well, since the last fix it seems everything's pretty well off, it seems the game won't be updated any longer.I noticed the game was lacking good instructions, I don't see any guides around, and well, to be honest, the forum had a few tips and so on, about the controls, the game isn't really difficult to play but there are a few keyboard keys that are pretty crucial to know, , a bit later, I'm going to make a game instruction guide for the keyboard buttons, and whatever is necessary to know before playing the game, as I found some information archived, since the author took out the instructions from the how to page and replaced the video with a youtube one and entirely removed the instructions, pretty much throwing the player into a deathpit.My reccomendation to get the best experience possible for this small game: adjust the visual aspect of the game and remove the tooltips from the main menu.Get the characrer mods for the game (I think they were made by the author...although some users do have custom ones I found like pokemon.) in the game's forum (named chat area for some reason.)(They're in a zip, get the file, extract them into the save data folder, I kept the mod files in case he links expire...)Last but not least, play as the mantis from the mod, that character will make you want to play the game more.My score for this game: 6.5/10			"

												The core of a roguelike is to slowly understand a world and its rules so that you may perform better and achieve greater successes, getting further and learning even more. Hack, Slash, Loot teaches you nothing about the little there is to learn and throws you into scenarios where nothing can be done or improved upon almost every single time.The solutions are so simple - yet every single moment you'll suffer the pain of knowing anything that could solve it, make this game actually enjoyable, was simply not implemented.

												This has aspects of a rougelike, but there is no balance due to the fact that ranged weapons have pretty much the same damage as melee, you can get the same armor that has buffs any type of attack, and too many melee enemies, all paired with the fact that no enemy moves any faster or slower *except a few fringe cases* then the player makes kiting impossible and having no max life makes it so it's impossible to have a good system of healing. The game pretty much boils down to how much you can buff the one damage stat you care about *magic ranged or melee* and then kill the thing before it hits you, just no way to skill your way around a stronger oponent, if one sees you, you have to fight or let it chase you untill you either dead-end or leave the floor.

I love how I start the game and every room has tons of mobs and I lose almost all of my health as I leave the first few rooms, then I always die after I encounter the next monster. Even if I do somehow get past all the monsters on a level I'm confused on what the objective is and what I'm supposed to do. There's no sort of in game tutorial or hints, when you start the game you are completely lost. The melee character is completely broken, can't survive more than a few turns. Once you start playing a ranged character you can make it a little further, but it's the same thing over and over - wondering around random rooms just trying to find a way out. By the way it took me 30 minutes to figure out I can move to the next floor after I found a rope the size of 3 pixels! The game design is purely flawed, avoid this game at all costs. "

Hack, Slash, Loot reduces roguelikes to their bare bones, making success in this game literally and 100% dependent on luck and luck alone. There is no place for skill in this game, and any attempt at strategy will ultimately be thwarted by a random and unforeseeable turn of events. For a game that looks and plays like it was thrown together in an afternoon, the asking price of $6.99 is ludicrous.			"

												I agree with all of the negetive posts. I got this game thinking it was a real rogue like. It is a random mess. Some tweaking would fix, I thought the devs might even do that, but no updates. Please buy Pixel Dungeon or Dungeons of Dredmore. I have gotten quite a bit of entertainment out of them.			"

												Not actually fun. It's basically fake-difficulty. It's not truely roguelike, where you have a chance of surviving for a long while if you play well. Instead it just throws everything at you, everything seems to do much more damage than your character, nothing (especially the stats) is particularly explained well, and you get near-constantly swarmed by enemies (and will often miss just about everything in combat) for very little reward- the loot seems...pretty depressing, for a game that actually includes ""loot"" in the title.

												Hack, Slash, Loot is a top down roguelike, this game will kill you over and over again to begin with. But be paintent, the game will reward you immensley with a lot of fun and characters. The more you die, the more characters and items drops you unlock. The classic pixel art works really well in the top down view. The game play is very simple. You play with a mouse, and that's it. Turn based movement/actions makes this perfect for playing with a trackpad on a laptop too. There is a nice ""compare"" feature here which makes picking and choosing what equipment to use easier than most games I've played previously. Plenty of different classes, I specifically enjoyed playing the Mage class, as it is super powerful towards endgame.  I also found that the levels do not get progressivly harder, for instance, the first map you play is by far not the easiest, the difficulty will change on each playthrough.  By completing certain other maps, you might also unlock ""artifacts"" which carry over to your other playthroughs as well.Whilst the game is very RNG, I still ploughed plenty of hours into HSL and enjoyed every minute of it. Worth the £4,99 for sure.			"

												Hack, Slash, Loot lacks the depth of even the most basic Roguelikes, and brings nothing interesting to the table other than immediatley dropping you into a new game when you inevitably die. Unfortunately the game also makes other things immediate that probably shouldn't be, such as exiting your game. On multiple occasions I've hit the Escape key, forgetting that HSL doesn't have a seperate settings window, only to have it immediately and without warning, quit my current game.As much as I like to see commercial roguelikes succeed, HSL is not an example of a roguelike that I'd like to see prosper. If you want to spend some money, go support Dungeons of Dredmore instead.			"

												Most of the negative reviews posted here are true. While luck and chance play a great part of being successful in this game, the amount of actual strategy is minimal. This does not make the game unplayable or not fun, but it does make it short lived and boring after some time. First of all, the player must realize that Hack, Slash, Loot is totally item based. The hero does not level up or improve statistics by earning experience points. All alterations, positive and negative are dependent on items that you equip or interact with. Because of this deliberate design limitation, there is very little to be done in terms of experimenting with strategy. The player stumbles upon items, hovers over them, and compares the numerical statistics with the already equipped items, and then makes a decision on what to keep and what to leave behind. The potions, altars, and other items that the player is allowed to interact with are complete surprises, changing your attributes at random without giving the player a choice. The sound effects get annoying and distracting after a while and I feel are not a good match for the art style and setting, sounding out of place. I beat a few of the quests and picked up some of the rare relics, but after the third quest win, I had had enough. Winning the quests simply does not feel rewarding and fulfilling. It seems more like a chore or a painful test rather than anything else, but in the beginning, when you realize how to approach the game, it's fun for some hours. Learning the enemies' vulnerabilities and resistances can be fun at first, but the game quickly outstays its welcome and becomes boring and shallow.Hack, Slash, Loot is okay.			"

												This game is not worth the time or money spent to play it. There is absolutely no progression in the game save for what you find. There is no leveling, there is only loot. Of course, to get such loot you need to find it, off enemies, or out of barrels and chests. But, good luck surviving long enough to actually get it! In this game you have absolutely no passive regeneration. HP has to be restored through use of items and only through that.In terms of mechanics, there's moving, attacking, and looting. Moving is really the one part I can't complain about, since well, you move just fine. Attacking is either ranged or melee, but regardless of range you will spend most of combat missing. You will miss much more than you ever hit. Now, with looting, there's one large thing that stands out: you don't have an inventory. You only have what you currently have equiped, and that's all. Want to save that potion for later? Nope, you have to use it now! This also means that looting devolves solely into: ""is this better or worse than what I have right now?"" And potions are only for chugging on sight.Generally speaking, a game such as this has some sort of scaling difficulty. Either the lower/higher the floor, the more difficult things get. Or you find something like Risk of Rain, where the longer you spend in game, the more difficult it gets. This game? There is no difficulty. There is only the RNG. Add to the fact that the floors are absolutely tiny, and I hope you like get swarmed if you're unlucky.This game is overly random and gives you no tools with which to determine your fate. This game is simply an overpriced RNG that looks like a rogue-like. Look elsewhere for a good rogue-like.(Boy, am I glad I got this off the Humble Bundle and didn't actually purchase it.)			"

												This feels like the most watered-down rogue-like experience ever. There's definitely a very good randomly-generated element to it, with randomly generated maps, enemy placements, loot, etc. What kills it for me, however, is the fact that there is barely anything to do in terms of combat -- there are three damage types (magic, melee, ranged), but the magic and ranged attacks play out identically in that they both have ranged attacks compared to melee's 1-tile range. In essence, it feels like the only reason there are ranged and magic damage types is so that the randomly generated loot isn't a coin flip to see if it's relevant to you or not. I haven't seen anything resembling skills or abilities (though there are evidently artifacts that you can unlock once you beat a small campaign, allowing for better starting stats), so combat is literally just rolling the dice to see who hits and who doesn't with no room for any other options. As a result, playing with line of sight to minimize the amount of ranged attacks that can hit you during combat is the closest thing to tactics you'd have to employ. Inevitably, at many points in the game, you'll just spend many turns clicking on the same tile down a bottleneck, which is about as degenerate of an experience as I can imagine. Given how wild the RNG can be with the combat, sometimes even this much planning is not enough to do well, as enemies can hit devastatingly hard and your character's ~60% to hit does not perform as consistently as it would have you believe. If you want a fantasy dice-rolling simulator, look no further. If you wanted something interactive or exciting, there are many better options out there.			"

												I can't say this game is bad, but I can't say it's very fun.The biggest problem this game has is its simplicity, in that there is no strategy to the game. Combat is just ""click the enemy until it dies"", and it becomes aggravating when enemies are swarming you and you can only deal with one at a time because all you have is just one attack and nothing else, no special abilities or anything, and it's also aggravating how often you miss even with high accuracy. There's a lot of characters to unlock, but there really isn't much of a point to picking anyone because there's virtually nothing to make each character special, save for cosmetics. The only real exception to this is the Amazon, since she starts with a weapon that can boost stats or health when you score kills, and I guarantee anyone who played this game never really used anyone other than the Amazon once they unlocked her.As for the gameplay itself, once again the game's simplicity is what ruins the experience. There's no inventory or skill/magic/whatever system, which contributes to the lack of strategy (no having to strategize what items you want to keep, what skills you want to learn, etc.), and you end up praying the game is kind enough to give you some way to heal because you will constantly die. I understand that as a roguelike, this game is meant to be challenging, but when you literally begin the game surrounded by enemies and die just like that...well, that's not a challenge, is it? And unlike other roguelikes, where you would be motivated to keep trying, to see if you can get further, this game gives you no such motivation. There's nothing to make you keep playing this game, nothing to make you want to see how it ends. It just feels tedious and boring and not fun, and if a game fails to be fun, it has failed at what it has set out to do.In conclusion, Hack Slash Loot isn't a fun game. It's boring, tedious, and in my opinion doesn't understand what makes roguelikes work. If you want a fun modern roguelike, I suggest Dungeons of Dredmor, The Binding of Isaac, Teleglitch, and Sword of the Stars: The Pit, as each are entertaining and fun in their own way. Don't bother playing this game.			"

												Despite its charmingly minimalist presentation, Hack, Slash, Loot takes simplicity a bit too far, resulting in a game where player choice carries exceedingly little weight against the overwhelming tides of chance.Presented as a simplification of the Roguelike genre, Hack, Slash, Loot endeavors to be a casual, bite-sized dose of turn-based dungeon crawling goodness. Toning things down from more classical entries to the series like NetHack or the more recent Dungeons of Dredmor, players are relieved of such responsibilities as developing character skills, managing an inventory, or generally deciding what action to take at any given time, provided those actions might have been anything other than moving in a particular cardinal direction or performing a generic attack on an enemy.The final product is a game where painstakingly small decisions such as what equipment you've chosen to pick up and wear will be most input the player has on each adventure's outcome, and even then, it won't quite measure up to the significance of what items and enemies the game decided to spawn in the first place.Ultimately, the prognosis for each freshly-rolled adventurer is about the same as in any other hardcore roguelike- anything but the most carefully chosen actions will invariably end in your character's death, and odds are the right choices will still probably see you winding up dead sooner or later anyway. The difference between the two is that in a deeper Roguelike experience, you will likely have had more than a few memorable close calls where gambling on an unconventional action pays off in a few minutes of continued survival, or enjoyed the unique experience of mixing and matching talents to come up with a wholly one-of-a-kind adventurer whose inevitable death was a mere period a the end of an entirely unexpected story. In contrast, Hack, Slash, Loot will take every bit as much persistence and consideration to advance in, while completely failing to pay off in any sort of fun factor beyond trading genericized blows with enemies and crossing your fingers that the sword you found in the previous room will give you enough of a numerical advantage to be the last man standing.To put it simply, Hack, Slash, Loot mistakes simplified graphics and gameplay for a pleasingly simplified gaming experience, while instead only succeeding in creating a dreadfully boring one that actively resists being played in a remotely engaging way compared to the sorts of games it seeks to emulate.The final nail in the coffin is the pricetag, which at the time of this review exceeds vastly more playable and equally casual-friendly Steam roguelikes such as Dungeons of Dredmor and Tales of Maj'eyal, either of which is perfectly content to kill you every bit as quickly, while affording a comparatively staggering array of options with which to actually enjoy your brief life.The bottom line is that fans of the genre and newcomers alike will do well to look elsewhere. Hack, Slash, Loot may be charming to look at, but there's barely a game here to play, and it just isn't worth the time.			"

												It's below average for an attempt at a rogue-like game, that it's basically showing you the ropes of a dungeon crawler and it's just the basics. There are no skills, leveling, inventory management or anything that makes these types of games interesting in anyway. It's basically ""That's a monster, fight it and it may drop items that could be better than what you're wearing"" sort of gameplay, and that's the only thing that's going for it. And while I'm not the type of guy that judges games on its graphics, for retro 8-bit graphics, it's the blandest graphics I've seen. I know it wants to be a simplistic style, but there's seriously nothing I can say about the game's art style that's great and it almost feels like the graphics are forced just to look retro.There's not a whole lot this game offers. I don't really hate it, but I can't really recommend this to anybody that's looking for a great dungeon crawling rogue-like experience. The gameplay is as comparable to a punching in as many number problems in a calculator until it shows an error and you have to reset it all over again. The only interesting concept this game has is you can have a random quest and a random character setup as if you want, but a lot of the quests aren't really different since all maps look the same and save for a couple of maps, the enemies are basically the same.

There are 3 playable characters in which two of them are absolutely USELESS. Nothing is based on player skill, it is all based on stats.Most of the time I have been dying is because I would click on an enemy, but instead of attacking, my char uses its turn to move on that square and being hit for every square subsequent to getting to that goal. It was  a ""decent"" time killer with a bit of breath for nostalgia but I do not recommend this to anyone that has any expectations to blow them away.

												I see most people talking about how this game is too simple and too luck based. Well, for most of us who played Rogue-likes back in the 16-bit era, we took simple games and we learned how to roll with the punches. Guide large groups of enemies through doorways, keep two types of weapons, drink and use all potions/scrolls (except for dispel, trust me.), and take what's given to you and use it to the best of your ability.And if the game is still too hard, do the Boy with the Mask first. Easiest of all the quests and you can get two artifacts that can really help you. One of my complaints, however, is that even after being out for two years, there has been no released content for the game. So once you unlock everything, all you have to look forward too is repeating the same quests. I am content with that, but I know a lot of people who wouldn't.So it's a hit and miss kind of game. If you like challenging, barebone games, then pick it up. If you like games with expansive spells and weapons, this is not the game for you.			"

												Extremely hard. No way of healing during combat, death is permanant, no inventory (which sounds dumb I know) so the only way of carrying your loot is in your equip slots. You will die heaps but deaths unlock new classes. Randomly generated dungeons make it almost impossible to progress sometimes but rarely, be warned though, if you choose a hard quest to start off with, it could be generated to be even harder than it was initially.If you like 'Roguelike' genre games, think Dungeons of Dredmor, Pokémon MD, The Tower of Druaga etc., give this game a go. Highly recommended.Protips: - Start off with the Wizard class. He's ranged and magic damage negates armor.- 'Mask of the boy king' is by far the easiest quest to attempt.- Try to resist opening tombs or crypts unless you're farmed up with gear as 90% of the time they spawn skeletons and demons. The loot from chests will sustain you with pots and gear. Monsters from tombs/crypts do however, always drop gear.			"

												An extremely minimalist Rogue-like which initially may seem like it involves little more than dice rolling and therefore unavoidable death.  However, once you unlock a few characters and start to learn how to manipulate the odds in your favour, the game really begins to open up.  The other nice touch is that all the achievements are possible to get just by playing the game normally and you can easily set up the odd one or two that you missed along the way.  My only complaint is that you start the game with three relatively dull vanilla characters which might put off new players that  may otherwise be unaware of fun unlockables such as the Ninja, Pirate or Scout.To sum up, it's certainly not a game for everyone but it can be a very rewarding experience especially when you finally beat that first map!

												This game is a complete gamble in terms of progression. And more often than not, you'll be struck by enemies with abysmal hit chances to suffer a fourth of your health in damage. Combat is mostly fruitless since your character doesn't level up and at best your enemy MIGHT drop their weapon or gear, which might be an improvement over what you currently have. Not only that, but enemies won't approach you ever to get into melee range unless you're out of sight. There is only one skill to master in this game: not getting surrounded. Except that enemies can and will go around to multiple doors and open them to surround you, or even spawn in areas you already cleared. I've played a fair few roguelikes in my time and this is one of the most luck based ones I've ever played.Pros: Aesthetics have a nice pixel, retro look, simple interface, enemies actually use simple tacticsCons: Completely luck based gameplay, enemies spawn in areas you've already cleared to backstab you, combat is nearly pointless because of infrequent item drops and no leveling system.Closing word: Only get if you're a glutton for punishment and don't mind dying hundreds of times before you complete even one quest.

												This game legit is a big fat steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥.Holy ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. There is no controls just click where to walk and where to attack. No stratedgy. 100% luck. This should be on mobile. Actually let me reprase that. This should not exist. Not joking it's that ♥♥♥♥ing bad. It's a complete waste of money and I don't even care that I got it from humble bundle and donated to charity it still wasn't worth it. This game makes you contemplate suicide and makes you wish you didn't ever use steam again. It's actually that bad. It gave me and my whole family and any of my friends who even saw the logo cancer. It is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. And if you get it, good luck getting rid of that cancerous thought that attaches to the back of your head like ♥♥♥♥ing justin beiber.Onto the game itself, it's 100% about luck. There is no stratedgy other then ""Attack the guy who does more damage and has less health"" I know it's meant to be minimalistic but this is shitimalistic. (lol get it?) No jokes though, that's the whole game. Theres no inventory system. Very boring loot system. And once i finally beat this dungeon i searched around for the exit for litterally 10 minutes. Like for ♥♥♥♥s sake. Where's the ♥♥♥♥ing exit when you need it?Anyway that's my review on this game. Horrible litterally would rather play flappy birds.			"

Had I watched the video all the way through, instead of being sold on the presentation and interface and the ""more roguelike, woo!"" factor, I might have known what I was getting into.There are two major features that differ from typical rogeulikes in HSL.First, the usual character progression and management is absent.

												Horribly balanced roguelike. You have to die a ♥♥♥♥ load (which will happen regardless, don't worry) in order to unlock stronger characters who still can't make it through the quests. The only reason why I'm still playing it is to somehow prove myself wrong that the game is impossible to beat.If you some how manage to find gear which regens your health, you may make it through a couple of levels, but you probably still won't finish the whole quest.There's little to no background music, which makes the game completely devoid of atmosphere unless you play your own.I could only recommend this game to a masochist.

												A classic rogue-like game, with 8-bit graphics and character classes. That's really all there is to say about it other than ""it's good."" In my experience, rogue-like games are either good or bad, with not much in-between. This one's good, and it's mouse-driven so it plays faster than (for example) rogue.If you ever loved Rogue, NetHack or Ragnarok, you will love Hack, Slash, Loot.A[UPDATE]This game is frustrating. It's hard, but not so hard you feel like your beating your head against a wall. More like you're digging furiously through bedrock with your bare fingernails and actually making headway. It's super paniful, but you feel like you're getting somewhere.			"

												Hack, Slash, Loot is a Roguelike RPG, meaning that you start with a new character every time and play until you die or win, gaining little except for skill between playthroughs.HSL has a high learning curve, which is a problem since the game tells you nothing about how to play. The interface does nothing to help. It took me about ten deaths to figure out how to do well enough to live for more than a few minutes. It takes a lot of time and research to play HSL effectively, but once you know some of the basics, the game becomes more fun.What HSL does right is removing the player's inventory. You only carry what you have equipped. Everything else is dropped or used. This simplifies the mechanics a lot and streamlines play. The downside is that I found the mechanics to be a little shallow for a Roguelike, and much of your success depends on luck. The game is very poorly balanced.HSL isn't the best Roguelike, but there's fun to be found. It's worth getting if you find it on sale.			"

Otherwise it's a race against time until some lucky goblin comes and kills you in one hit because you had 4 HP left.

												This game looks to be a traditional rogue like, but only offer three-ish classes that don't even cover the basic trinity (knight, rogue, mage). People complain about RNG, but honestly thats just part of the game. My main issues with the game were the complete lack of a list of controls or menu system. You have to learn the controls from an external website, there is no way of learning them in game. The diaglogue systemis clunky and only displays the past 3 actions. If you want a more indepth much more varied rogue like try Stone soup. Google it. Its completely free, much more complex and in depth, and personally much more fun. Avoid this.			"

												Hack, Slash, Loot is a game that I got as part of a bundle, that I dearly wish had never been redeemed. Its presence, forever a taint on my library.Avoid this game, for this game is precision crafted to avoid literally everything good about roguelikes ever. Hack, Slash, Loot is such a bad roguelike that it can be considered the anti-roguelike, the embodiment of all the bad parts of roguelikes with none of the good whatsoever.The game lacks any sort of mechanical depth whatsoever. Everything boils down to boring, static numbers. Where a better roguelike would have classes that play differently, different skills perhaps, equipment preferences and the like, the ability to use magic perhaps, this game has none of those things. And I'm not saying that a roguelike has to have those things, you understand. I'm saying that most fantasy roguelikes would have those things, for instance Dungeons of Dredmor and Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. Even within the ""Roguelite"" games, you'd have characters with a vastly different playstyle resulting from different skillsets, stats and starting equipment, like in The Binding of Isaac, Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne, Ziggurat, the list goes on.Hack, Slash, Loot instead has classes that boil down to melee and ranged, no resting to regain your health, no skills, no mana. Your character is simply a walking sheet of stats, bolstered by your equipment that are nothing but stats. This creates no interesting gameplay choices, either you find something that has better stats than your current equipment, or you don't. There is no strategy, there is no way to build your character, there is no game to be enjoyed here.This creates a game that is nothing but dice rolls upon dice rolls, with little to no player input involved. There is no feeling of accomplishment if you get further than you previously did, there is no anguish when you die. You cannot self reflect on a defeat that was entirely out of your control, you cannot ask yourself what you could've done better. The beauty of a roguelike is its nigh infinite replayability, the ways you can experiment with builds, the magic of discovery as you find something that works, figure out the tricks of the game, and get further everytime. The excitement when you turn a bad run around after an item that perfectly synergizes with your current character appears, or the opposite, where you make it far, even perhaps to the final level, before dying. Lamenting that you would've won if you had the right items. And what about the times when you pull through a bad run? That is the core of the roguelike experience that Hack, Slash, Loot ultimately fails to capture.In conclusion, Hack, Slash, Loot is a thoroughly incompetent roguelike that tries to distill the experience, but what you instead get is a shallow game with no identity, no soul. It is a bad game, it is a bad roguelike, and you should avoid it like the plague.			"

												While certainly not a ground-breaking game, Hack, Slash, Loot is fun for what it is: an old school dungeon crawler that is unforgiving in difficulty.  Over time, a few updates have been added to spice it up with new characters, though it hasn't changed the gameplay or style (a plus for me as I appreciate what it has to offer).  If you're looking for something flashy or complex; look elsewhere.  If you're content with old-school dungeon crawling, 8-bit graphics, occassional insane spikes in difficulty when attacked by a multitude of monsters simultaneously, and an oddly comforting interface and simplicity, then Hack, Slash, Loot is for you.

												In all fairness, Hack, Slash, Loot (HSL) is a decent rogue-like. Realistically, how would any human fare trying to kill a dungeon full of ogres, undead skeletons or parasitic demons that burst out of his fallen comrades? The answer: he'd probably die long before reaching his goal.HSL's main feature is arguably the starting character choice and the initial artifact they can bring with them (in case they have unlocked it). You start out with 3 mostly crap characters and then you unlock more through either a) successfully clearing a session or b) dying a certain number of times until the next unlock threshold. For most people, their first few unlocks may be the death based ones.An ""interesting"" design choice was the strengths/weaknesses of elements in the game. To sum it up, every element has a chance of doing some effect. If you're strong against the effect, you take half the damage and never suffer from the effect of that element; if you're weak, however, you take double damage and the chance of being applied the element's effect is increased. This comes with some very nasty consequences, such as being poisoned for a bad evasion roll or having a random piece of your equipment destroyed by fire. It gets even worse when you figure out that holy and dark elements' effect is applied when you kill something and that both give you health, increased accuracy (aka hit enemies more often) or even increased damage: the game is practically forcing you to find and stick to a holy/dark weapon combo of melee, ranged or magic varieties, since randomly finding a potion and carelessly using it without knowing what its affix might do is bound to either screw all you've worked for or not heal you when you'd really want some health.HSL also starts handing you characters that are arguably better for specific dungeons or have gameplay variability to help you find your niche. One particular character has intrinsically magic resistance, for instance: you'd definitely want to bring him to at least two of the dungeons for that reason alone. But on the other hand, every character is more or less gimped in some way, and the arguable best stat to stock upon is armour (which, unfortunately, is more likely to come from your randomly dropped equipment than it is from being boosted from a potion) because it is applied BEFORE strengths and weaknesses come into play.As for the artifacts, the undeniably best all-around one is the Mask of SomeMummyGuy (name forgotten, not the actual name), the goal from the crypt dungeon and forever unlocked once obtained. There is no real reason not to bring it with you either, since it boasts an incredible amount of armour and reasonable stat boosts for your offensive ability. Compare to the Butcher's Knife, which makes you walk twice a turn but does such an insignificant amount of damage that you'll be seeing the numbers 1 or 2 popping out when you attack something, or the Necronomicon, which if you aren't a melee character or don't have holy or dark weapons means you will also be hitting a lot less for the ""benefit"" of being able to pass through walls (which may sound nice, but on most of the dungeons it simply means that if you don't clear a room FAST the monsters are going to start opening doors EVERYWHERE and the entire level is going to make a never-ending conga line to beat you up).Also keep in mind, my worst gripe with HSL isn't about the gameplay but the accuracy of targetting itself, a game mechanic. As you may see from the screenshots, tiles are rectangular: they are wider than taller by a ratio of aproximately 2. And when you want to click on something, you HAVE to click on their bottom half, because otherwise you'd be targetting the tile above it. It also doesn't help that targetting a tile to move that is far away AFTER having seen a threat doesn't cancel the order to move unless you click again or are hit by a monster, and if you are trying to attack from a range that will mean you will most certainly get hit before you realize that you are moving instead of attacking, and that in itself will usually get you killed since ranged characters tend not to have the best survival up close.But, as I said on the opening line, HSL is a decent rogue-like. Not too deep about it nor very long-lasting, but if you like rogue-likes you may enjoy it. Should you buy HSL? Maybe. Maybe on a 75% discount. I still hate the inefficient targetting system and how hard it is to move long stretches of the dungeon when you're on the last rooms to find the stairs, pixel-clicking on the map or hitting the wrong tile. If you think you can handle it go for it; don't bother otherwise.			"

												I recommend this game with a bit of a warning. It can be fun, but only if you're extremely patient and don't mind having your ♥♥♥ handed to you every ten minutes or less.It's a simple enough premise. Choose your mission. Choose your character. Go through the dungeon floors to try and complete your mission. Die. Try again. It's your typical roguelike in that regard. However, there is one thing that really makes this game more difficult than other roguelike dungeon crawlers such as Legend of Dungeon or even The Binding of Isaac (I know it's a bit of an odd comparison). The hit rate system in this game is seriously flawed. Your hit rate automatically starts out at roughly 60% regardless of what character you start with. You can deal a fair amount of damage and kill enemies in one hit, which is nice. Yet, you only hit them a fraction of the time and you can find yourself exchanging blows with a single enemy for two or three minutes until one of you dies. If you're surrounded by multiple enemies, odds are, you're going to die because you have such a small chance of killing them all before they've managed to kill you.Luck based elements in roguelike games are not unheard of. Quite the opposite. They're a crucial part of the genre. However, when it becomes TOO luck based, it becomes a problem. Random level, enemy and item generation is a good idea. Random hit rates however are not. It makes completing a single floor almost impossible, let alone a whole mission. If you're patient enough to actually sit through countless runs of this game to beat a mission, then this is the game for you. However, if you do not like the idea of huge maps with a flawed probability driven combat system, then I would recommend other roguelike titles first.			"

No levels/No XP/No skills.  Only the most minor of differences between classes.  Loot adds to one stat (sometimes also reduces one).  RNG rules everything.

												If RNG rogue-likes are your thing, look no further than Hack, Slash, Loot. Level layout and enemy generation both perfectly balance the procedural generation of a rogue-like with the intentionality of a well-designed level. Unfortunately, other randomized elements are less-than-perfect. With a peculiarly inverted difficulty curve, players will find the greatest initial challenge is persevering through the 25+ deaths required to unlock the first character truly capable of rewarding a player's skill with success. Each successive character is more powerful than the last, and although some strategy is necessary in combining character classes with various artifact 'loadouts,' most of the later unlocked characters make previous ones obsolete. Similarly, choosing wisely from the loot at the player's disposal requires careful consideration, but the randomness of enchantments and loot mean that a session typically ends in either frustrating defeat or unsatisfying triumph. On the spectrum of skill vs chance, Hack, Slash, Loot is just a bit more random than most players will find rewarding. Nevertheless, there is a wealth of unlockables that may keep a determined gamer occupied for many hours. For its unique interface and enjoyable retro stylings, the game is commendable, but overall it comes off as a quirky experiment that doesn't quite make the cut.			"

												You could say I love this little game. I admit, the first minutes, even the first hours, playing this game can be pretty frustrating. It all looks pretty basic and simple, you have probably already played more than a few roguelike and dungeoncrawling games, it seems that you're doing everything right, only you keep on dying all the time.It's also the biggest part of the game. It's like Dark Souls, only unfair since dying in Dark Souls has to do with your skill, skills which you can improve by trying and trying again. In Hack Slash Loot there isn't much skill involved, since most things are based on luck and are random. Although, it takes some time to understand the techniques and strategy that's behind this cruel little game.And when I'm saying 'little', I don't think you can actually ever really finish this game and all it's quests. I've played around 10 hours, when writing this review, but I feel like I'm going to play it for quite some more.In the end it's also a bit like a poker game, work with the hand you draw, try to improve it and try to win. If not, try again. And again.			"

												Hack, Slash, Loot has been described as a roguelike, it looks like a roguelike, but it completely misses the mark in terms of gameplay. There is no resource management, there seems to be no risk in using potions and scrolls; they all buff. Every entity seems to move at the same speed, which is not inherently bad, but limits the tactical landscape. There is very little thought involved while playing this.In terms of playability, perspective can get the better of you if you are not careful around enemies. Sometimes an enemy is visible, but can not be targeted with a ranged attack, which seems strange at times. Otherwise, the simple gameplay leads to simple controls making it very accessible.What was done well: the starting classes feel very different from each other in play. Allies intelligently stay out of your way in travel, but in combat situations they may block your path to the enemies and get themselves killed. Enemies stay out of reach generally, unless they have companions, which is interesting.All in all, if you are looking for a casual turn-based dungeon crawler you may enjoy this. If you are looking for a thought-provoking roguelike then pass on this.For Linux usersThe game runs on Wine, so if it's something you're interested in, you have the option to play it.			"

												With ""classes"" that all play exactly the same (starting stats being the only distinguishing feature) and gameplay that's almost entirely based on luck, Hack, Slash, Loot doesn't have much to set it apart from the host of other, better roguelike dungeon crawlers currently available.

												Can't really recommend this. I like some roguelikes, but this one is too barebones for me. There's no skills or spells, no character building, no inventory (though you do get to use a weapon, helm, armor, etc). Basically all you do is click on enemies until they die or you die (usually you die). Sometimes you get an equipment upgrade, usually you don't. Then you restart and do it again. After playing 10-15 minutes I assumed I was missing something and there must be more to the game, so I visited the forums, but as near as I can tell that's really all there is to it. If you want a good roguelike, try Tales of Maj'Eyal or Dungeons of Dredmor instead, both have way more to offer than this.			"

												This game, as every single one, has its pros and cons. But its difference with other games is that what some people consider pros are considered as cons by others. The main point of the game is to go through random rooms, get random objects and killing random enemies to keep going, with very simple controls. This thing of not being able to plan anything can be seen as something bad, but it's part of the charming of the game, and makes it a little bit different from others. It's a good game if the only thing you want is to spend some time playing without thinking very much, but don't expect anything deeper than killing random enemies and picking objects that can make you stronger or weaker. Worth trying it, but maybe not at its full price.			"

												It is a great game. It can be played in snack sizes or in larger chunks. There is perma death and that gives you a greater feeling of achievement when you actually make it all the way through a scenario. There is some depth in the strategies you can use in battle. Great little turn based RPG Rogue-like. I have spent some enjoyable hours with this game.			"

												Pros:- It was just over a dollar on the Humble Bundle store- Nice art style- Some decent gameplay concepts, like friendly NPCs that will fight alongside you- Simple, responsive mouse controlsCons:- No inventory, WTF?- NO SAVE FEATURE?!?!?!?- Interface isn't well defined, could use some minor tweaks- Extremely limited character class selection- Nearly impossible to find healing items- No apparent experience/leveling systemOverall:I want to like this game, as I like the concept, and I find the controls to be extremely fluid and intuitive, but there are just so many basic things that this game is missing. I would play the living crap out of this if they introduced a proper inventory and leveling system, as well as the ability to save your game. It's sad to see such wasted potential.			"

												This game, as a rogue-like has many positive aspects but also some minor shortcomings. It isn't fast paced action but round-based action, still you can play it as a little morsel when you make a break or when watching TV and again there is this ""commercial-time"". The game can't deny it's roots and that is most of the time a good thing. But don't be mistaken, you don't level in HSL, you have to power up through your equipment only - here the game can get challenging, but not so challenging that it is on the level of unfairness. I am still in the phase to test the game, and I have already found many things that I do like. The shortcomings don't destroy the game, or the fun with it, they are mostly minor anoyances. Over Time the tune in the game can get ... well, enervating would fit. Either switch it off and put some hard rocking music into the Player or switch it off and play it silent. And the second isn't enervating only a little bit more like - weeeeelllll, in the 1980s we had those nice little breadboxes called C64 that was 8 bit technology and we tried to pull out the most out of this little - homecomputers. Dang, I even had a ZX-81 and a ZX-Spectrum back then, and we loved the games that were out then. I remember Warlock, a game for the ZX-81, in which you could do a little dungeon-romp *sigh*. What I wanted to say, the graphics might even for a 8bit homecomputer look a little too outdated, but that doesn't rob the game of the mostly positive impression.			"

If you want to play this game be ready for disappointment, you will find it difficult to succeed in any of the quests and I'm sorry to say that's nothing for you to change. The game is purely luck based, making fights that seem in you favour result in your death. The gameplay is simple and so are the visuals of the game.Personally if you are willing to pay the slightly overpriced price this is definately a game to consider, just try and take it as casually as possible and you'll enjoy it.

												Hack, Slash, Loot reminds me a lot of how the old ASCII Nethack plays. It is at its core exceptionally brutal, however surprisingly enjoyable. Much of the games drops are out of your control and left to the dice (random number generator) which can either be in your favor or not. You must use doors and hallways to your advantage to limit monsters' ability to get swings on you which will greatly increase the odds in your favor. It is as close to a classic in terms of atmosphere and feel as you can get. It will not hold your hand, It will not give you tips or hints, It will do its best to kill you.I've nearly clocked twenty hours and I have thus far died fifty five times with only four victories. Highly recommended if you don't mind a challenge			"

												Hack Slash Loot is great fun. A rougelike-like, dungeon crawling RPG game, with a cutie pixel-art graphics style, and challenging gameplay. It's a turn based game, where each time you move on a tile, you along with everything else in the dungeon takes a turn, and you go through the dungeon completing quests. At the main menu you'll pick a character/class, each which have their own stats and unique style of play (melee, magic, ranged, etc) and depending on the quest, some may be better than others. You also choose the quest you want to play from the main menu, and each has its own story. But everytime you play one of these quests, the dungeon is different, since they're procedurally generated. (Though depending on the quest, they'll follow a certain ""blueprint"". For instance, a quest that takes place in a large tower will always have a circular shaped map/dungeon). Fun, challenging, and bite sized, HSL is a great way to spend a half an hour or so.			"

												Okay, I hear a lot of how bad this game is, and how unfair it is. I am going to give my honest thoughts about the game, and help people understand the game.First off, the graphic they look like they're from ""Realm of the Mad God"" and ""Legends of Yore"". That's because it is. Sure people can say that's a downside, but it could also be a plus side. Seeing how it's simple and easy to know the enemy you're trying to fight. Another thing is how the fog is. At times, you can see something, but not be able to shoot it with your bow or staff.The soundtrack has seven tracks. No joke. I got the soundtrack from the Humble Bundle I got the game from, and it is good when you first hear it, it can be a pain hearing the same few tracks more than needed. But, the game does have one track that does help. When the track plays, that means there's five or more enemies in the room.Okay, now, let's talk the gameplay. If you want to know, yes. It is a rogue-like game. The levels are randomly made as you play through the game. However, the game doesn't have one solid story like ""The Binding of Isaac"" did. This game has quite a few different stories that you can pick from, each with how to go through and manage the game. One story has a ton of tombs that you can look at for items, with another one with being a tower that a giant wizard use to live. They all mostly look the game, but little touches make it seem different.Now, the buttom of the screen is everything, and I mean everything. Your settings, your stats, your map, your bloodtype, everything. You move around with the mouse, and you do everything with the mouse. You might be able to play this with a touchscreen, but I'm not to sure. Along with picking your story you want to play through, you can pick which character to play with. Each one is different and unique. You can unlock more if you do some tasks, like dying twenty times (I'm not kidding). Some characters work best with some stories because of the items you can get in the story.Combat is what might make a lot of people mad. Whenever you move a space, all rendered enemies will also move a space. So, think of it as a game of chess, planning out where to move and when to strike your opponents. To actually deal damage on your opponent is as simple as clicking on them. If you have a melee weapon, you have to be next to them, if your have a ranged or staff weapon, you can be as far away as you can (but, still visible on screen). If you hover your mouse over the enemy, you can see their stats on the right side of the menu on the buttom of the screen.To be honest, I wish I remembered how the stats work and how you can calculate your damage output. It is a pain when you start, but if you get this game, I recommend using Amazon (unlocked by dying twenty times), and using her on the story ""Mask of the Boy King"". This game isn't for everybody, but if you like rogue-like games, you might like this. However, I recommend getting it on sale or in a Humble Bundle, it isn't worth the full price. But, one last note, you can run this 8MB game on anything. I bet you can run it on a Raspberry Pi, I seriously think you can. But, with that said, I do like it. It is a game to play when you're waiting for updates to finish.			"

												If you like roguelikes Hack, Slash, Loot is a brilliantly simple one. No inventory management, if you can equip it you have to choose what your taking with you then and there, and if you can use it you have to use it where you find it or leave it. There is a bit of permanence in the form of unlockable characters (unlocked by getting a certain number of wins or deaths) and Relics you can find and then start new games with. While levels are randomized in typical roguelike fashion there are 6 quests that offer distinctly different flavors.If you're having a bit of trouble at first here's a hint: die until you unlock the Amazon, then play the Mask of the Boy King mission, keeping your starting weapon (until the boss, who's resistant to it). Don't open Tombs but open everything else you see and bottleneck monsters in doors. If you can kill the boy king the burial mask he drops is a relic you can use on all further runs. :)			"

												Pretty fun, pretty nice.Have you ever heard of a rogue-like? Well, they're wonderful little games chock full of complexity, instant-death, and general pandering to a small niche of gamers that just love them. I'm one of those of course, love NetHack. Most players find them unapproachable due to either ASCII only graphics, or very very high learning curves.""Hack, Slash, Loot"" is different. While one might say it's not go the depth of a game like ADOM or NetHack, it does capture the feeling of a good rogue-like while also keeping things simple enough that anyone can enjoy it without having to print out huge command lists and scroll through pages of guides to survive.So don't let it scare you off, because it's way simpler to play than it's old-school cousins.

												Simple and sweet' a brutal luck driven game which is as addictive as it is infuriating. I am enjoying it very much, right down to the pixelated characters. Lots of replayability; it is smiliar to Dungeons of Dremor, but without the sass. Great for when you only have a little bit of time to game, or for longer stretches as you unlock characters and become familiar with the mechanics.			"

												I have played a good deal more than 2 hours of this game, probably about 5 or 6. Steam hasn't tracked all of my time of it for some reason, though I did play a lot offline in the summer. I love this game, it's a good timewaster, I've had sessions that last 10 minutes and I die and that's totally satisfactory and I move on (or was just looking to waste 10 minutes).I've only ever beaten one of the scenarios but I keep finding myself coming back to it. From what I hear there are a ton of unlockable classes and I should play more. I don't play a lot of roguelikes though, I'm surprised I'm as into this as I am.The music is (kind of MIDI-y and) very reminiscent of some other games I love (title screen reminds me of Castle Crashers, dungeon themes remind me of Zelda) and serves the game well. The sound effects are minimalistic but follow the 8bit style. I love the UI, very functional.I bought this game at full price, I'm not even sure why as most of my library is Humble stuff and sale stuff. I still recommend it at full price, though I hope it appears on Humble someday so it can get the exposure it deserves.			"

												Not at any price.Hack, Slash, Loot is hard to even describe. It is a game that essentially boils down what it means to be a game to its simplest level. Step one: Left click. Step two: Left click. Are you dead? Restart. Go to step one.While the game boasts multiple classes and multiple quests, there are almost zero differences to be found regardless of your choice. There are no activatable abilities, of any nature. Combat is all dice rolling against your accuracy, which can begin at a pitiful 60% base chance to hit. Monster variety consists of melee or ranged, and what element they might hit you with or be weak to. Everything else boils down to dealing out and taking increasingly larger numbers of damage.Your only stats are accuracy, damage, health, and defense. In almost all cases, every item or consumable will simply futz with those numbers a bit. Or, give you weakness/resistance to an element, which is of limited utility. A very rare find will give you two actions per turn. This is about the only time actual tactics are involved, as otherwise everything moves just as fast as you do.Making matters worse, friendly NPCs can make certain quests nearly unplayably obnoxious for their ability to get in your way, die, and spawn a ghost who will turn on you.Essentially, Hack Slash Loot brought in the worst parts of classic Rogue games, but somewhere along the way forgot to add in the things that make them fun.Here's a video with a look at the gameplay:

												I do not recommend this game. This game does not feel like a completed product.AudioThis game lacks music. Most of your gameplay is filled with digital squeeks and sfx of the character's actions. The sounds get monotonous and boring. GameplayThis game is not repetitive for a dungeon crawler. This is good. The game was enjoyable for the first few hours. However, you'll realize that the randomly generated maps are at times impossible to complete. For example, you start a new game, and you spawn right next to a hobgoblin. You'll die. You won't be able to kill it, not with getting artifacts. The chances of getting artifacts are very low, considering that you'll have much more difficulty in trying to survive the first level, let alone trying to find artifacts. You might be complaining that these ""vanilla"" gamers don't know what difficult is. Well, if you take the example of spawning next to a hobgoblin, you don't have a chance in playing the game. You could either open doors and run away, not knowing whether the next room would be filled with enemies or weapons to aid in your quest, or you could face the enemy and try killing it, dying in the process. This ""fated death"" does not represent what difficult is. The good news is, such situations does not occur frequently. In my opinion, the gameplay does not leave much to be desired. The randomness did not seemed to be well thought of. GraphicsI had a huge problem with the minimap. At full screen, the mini map was, too mini. You might be thinking, this guy is nuts! It's a mini map, what more do you need? Well, the issue is you can't adjust the size of the minimap. The minimap is important in this game because it shows you the loot, the unopened doors, and the stairs. You can also click on the minimap to move your character to the far side of the room effortlessly. A small minimap was just straining to the eyes.Overall, information in the hub (or whatever you call it) is dense and it will take you some time to get used to it. This isn't a bad thing. Some players may find that the hub is ""busy"" because there are a lot of things going on. You can't really experience this by looking at the screenshots of the game. You have to play it to know what I'm trying to say. When you get into a room with tons of enemies, you may want to choose, say, the easiest to kill/most lethal to take down first. To do that, you gotta hover through each enemy to look at their descriptions, comparing their atk/def with your atk/def to determine the likelihood of you hitting it. This process isn't made easy based on the design of the hub. Again, it takes quite some getting used to.			"

												I have a thing for roguelikes.  This is a roguelike, so I purchased it.  I think I paid $2, and I would consider that a fair price.  It's a dumb game, it makes no pretenses about it is.  It's unfair and random.  But it's dead simple, and it's a better roguelike than a lot of garbage out there that involved a lot more developers and a lot more money.Do I recommend it?  Probably not, because it adds little of value to this world.  There are no ideas here.  It feels like a weekend project of some developer.  But if you, like me, frequently find yourself poring over every last page of Steam's RPG section looking for something, anything you haven't tried before - sure, go for it.			"

												Quite possible one of the most simplistic rougelikes I have ever seen. Also stupidly hard. As in, be prepared to fight rediculous amounts of enemies that will grind your face to dust before you can even get established. That said, the classes you unlock are better than the ones you start with, and with patience and a ♥♥♥♥ton of luck it is possible to progress pretty far in the missions. Hell there is probably somebody out there who has beaten a few of them. Also tons of achievements to grind if that's your thing.I would still recommend it despite its flaws.

												A very simple and honest rogue-like.  Not a 'rogue-like'-like, which have been growing ever more popular, but rather a game that is very much like the original ""Rogue"".The differences between the unlockable classes are ultimately pretty minimal, but they put you on a different footing from the start of each dungeon.  That really changes how you think about what items you pick up or drop to maintain that character's theme.  That little shift really helps to extend the replay value, and encourages you to try and take different approaches to each dungeon.			"

												Hack Slash Loot, though seeming to have some depth on the surface; is probably one of the simplest roguelikes around. The mechanics are virtually unexplained, death is quick, and your options really boil down to where to move, what to kill, and when to pick up the next bit of new equipment. No inventory, no dialogue, just lots of mazes and clicking.Despite the lack of controllable depth though; there's tons of varied enemies, locales, and items to find. It's a pretty zen experience to just click start, bear yourself for the worst, and send another adventurer off to what is probably their doom in the next few minutes. The random nature tends to go against you, but it's easy enough to start again with yet another adventurer on yet another quest.If this game sat in the corner of a bar, dusty and forgotten; giving you a random doomed hero for a quarter each time; it'd feel perfectly at home. As a Steam game, it's worth recommending as a great little timewaster.			"

												Hack, Slash, Loot is simple in a truly rewarding way. The entire game is played using only a single mouse button in a dungeon delving enviroment. While the game function is simple it is probably it's greatest charm. The actual level of difficulty and choices you make keep the game interesting and rewarding while all the while allowing you to simply relax and sit back.			"

												I almost didn't want to like this game before I tried it. The video of it didn't look terribly engaging, and seemed a bit over complicated. I really couldn't be more wrong about that. Hack, Slash, Loot is one of those rougelikes that you can sit and play for 2 minutes on a bad run, or spend hours looting every single corner of every floor in the randomized dungeons (some of which are quite large), and all by mouse control. It's one of those types of games that are really rewarding when you do well, but if you fail, it's no big deal; just start a new quest, maybe check out a different character, and find some more stat boosts.I keep coming back to this one when I've got some spare time and just want to click on stuff, since it's a lot less time-sensitive than other dungeon crawls like Diablo, Path of Exile, etc. Would recommend if you're interested in the genre, and enjoy/can deal with the ""retro"" art style- it's a really well executed entry in the ""low-pressure roguelike dungeon crawl"" genre.

												I realize many people give this game ALOT of flak, and I can understand why. The game is very much random in how things play out, and people often hate that.I find the complete randomness to be very enjoyable, and makes every turn a tense, though fun turn of events!The game can be unforgiving, but a real dungeon experience would be difficult if one was in such a situation, right?All the negative reviews on that pop up when you 1st look up this game will deter alot of people I think. That's not fair to me. Especially at the current $7.00 price tag, this game should not be passed up.- The game is difficult, it can be rough and unforgiving, but you get a CHALLENGE nonetheless! Doing well on a run when you know the odds can be against you? That's a truely gratifying experience. You're not really breaking your wallet on this one. Don't let all the negative comments push you away, consider this game! Cheers!			"

												I've spent quite a few hours playing this game off steam and only got it there for the cards. It's bad, really bad.It's not just hard, it's unfair. There are so many misses you'll often be bored to tears looking at a whiff-fest. There are very few choices to make and even less that matter. Skill plays little role (and is utterly negligible compared to random luck) and I have found no depth whatsoever in this.I haven't had a single minute or moment of fun in this game, ever. I don't know why someone would want to play it. I may have missed something, but if you have to search for more than 4 hours then there's a big problem with the game.			"

												This is pretty much the worst Roguelike I've ever played. It tries to cut a Roguelike down to its bare elements, but removes too much of what makes such a game worth playing. The best description I've read of this game was that ""It seems like someone told the developers Roguelikes are really hard and nothing else."" and they went with that. There is no sense of curiosity. Nothing interesting to learn. You just wander around rooms looting chests hoping for an item to increase your health until you die or you're lucky enough to accidentally clear a dungeon. Because that's ALL that matters in this game. Luck.1/10			"

												Hack, Slash, Loot is a nice little turn based dungeon crawler.  About gameplay The maps and the loot and monsters therein are always randomly generated, which at the beginning can be quite frustrating as you have a steep learning curve as to how this game exactly ""works."" Since you start out with rather weak characters (you unlock new ones by dying in/failing a quest) the game seems rather frustrating. But don't let that ruin your experience as you advance you'll unlock new characters and get to the fun/challenge of the game rather quickly and more easily.The game completely bypasses difficult and complex skill and stat systems for a rather basic approach. You have 2 stats per weapon class (Attack Chance/Attack Damage) a defense skill and health. In addition to the stats there's an ""elemental system."" You can either cause, resist or have a vulnerability to one of the 7 damage types; silvered, fire, lightening, poison, divine, necrotic and psychic. And that's it.If you start the game up you'll first decide with which kind of character you want to play (32 in total once all are unlocked. You unlock new ones every N^2 deaths) you'll then decide what quest you want to approach (there are currently 6) and what artifacts to take with you (once you found any).Depending on these choices you also set the difficulty for your game. Melee characters are hard to play with (since they need to get close first), ranged characters have a medium difficulty (since they can shoot from afar) and wizards are easier to play with (since their shots penetrate armor if the enemy hasn't got an enchantement against it). Depending on their starting elements or enchantements they also add or substract from the difficulty, based on which quest you are approaching. It'd, for example, be quite foolish to try and attempt the ""They Dwell beneath"" Quest, wherein you go out to hunt down 5 dragons in a mountain, with a starting character or artifact that makes you vulnerable towards fire damage.Artifacts are found in specific encounters throughout the game or by finishing certain quests. Artifacts stay with you and can be selected as starting gear making your life significantly easier.With all this in mind the games actual gameplay is rather simple but shines in one particular aspect: choice. In every quest there are 5 levels with certain enemies of certain quantities but they are nonetheless of the same kind. With this in mind the biggest challenge of the game is to take or not to take risks. As the ""Loot"" aspect in the title of the game suggests it makes you think rather hard on what to use and what not to use; ""Are you taking this shield with you that makes you less likely to hit enemies and makes you vulnerable to psychic damage but gives you a steady defense stat that'll continually help you out whenever you are hit and in addition makes you resistant to poison?"" or ""Do I drink this potion which name doesn't suggest neither positive nor negative effects that could heal my low health but also make me vulnerable towards the current enemies most common element and therefor kill me?"" are examples of the most common and frequent choices in the game.A lot of other people think this game is ""unfair"" to them but it really isn't. It is true that a lot of luck and chance is involved in the game, however this feeling of ""unfairness"" will usually go away once you've understood the game and beaten it once or twice. While it is based on chance and luck a lot you'll, as it is always the case with luck and chance, on >average< succeed quite steadily. That's what odds are all about. If you get into the game a bit statements will quickly go from:""Stupid game always spawns too many enemies and no good loot,"" to:""Maybe I should've taken that other helm with me instead and risk being poisened so that I'd have received less normal damage by upping my defence."" Sound and Graphics Some words about sound and graphics: The graphics usually don't exceed the 10x10 Pixel boundary per sprite or background element so don't expect too much even though it features fantastic and distinctive design within this limitation and the sound is really nice. This is actually the only thing that bugs me: The music doesn't consecutively play throughout the game but rather plays one soundloop on occasion. Starting a quest? Soundtrack 1 loops once. Found a big amount of enemies? Soundtrack for danger loops once. And so on. I'd have wished for a soundtrack that stayed with me for the entirety of a playthrough whenever there is no occasion for a loop. However the effects are nice and will kind of feel like a soundtrack after a while. Is this a game for me? So all in all: If you are NOT easily frustrated when confronted with chellange or a little bad luck, you like roguelikes and turn based dungeon crawlers or simply crave for a little bit of ""something else"" then please give this game a try. It'll surely not disappoint.If you are easily bored or frustrated when confronted with chellange or a little bad luck stay far away from this game.			"

												This game is both brutally difficult, incredibly unfair, really annoying, and very tedious.The game loves to set you up against masses of enemies that you are really not capable of dealing with (nor can you run away from).  Be prepared to miss with your attacks a lot, often in streaks of 10 or more in a row.  Also be ready to have very little health, and not many opportunities to refill it or increase it.  As you descend the enemies get harder and harder, and they get more cheap with their attack powers, such as poison that can take off half your health over time, fire attacks that can also destroy your equipment, and lighting attacks that can chain stun-lock you.There is also no leveling system, you gain (and loose) attributes from equipment, which is further modified scrolls, potions, and altars.  The loot in general is also very boring and uninteresting, and you will often see the same equipment you didn't want over and over again.  The best part is that to unlock extra characters, the game expects you to die over and over again.  You start with 3 out of 32 characters unlocked.I cannot recommend this game on any level.			"

												Firstly, this game is not as awful as people say. It's not unwinnable, I certainly managed to win it. I stopped playing the game because it became too easy for me, but that's because I have a lot of good gear (due to winning the game) and knowledge about the game after playing for 80 hours. I was very persistent and I learned more every time I died. I must be one of the few people who really enjoyed this game. I greatly enjoyed the challenge and tried to get just a little further each time, before finally making it. Roguelike perma-death games that reward you for trying and trying are quite hilarious.This game only lets you have a small amount of gear, but the gear is vital. The combination of gear lets you take less (or more) damage from certain types of damage, as well as improving your ability to hurt stuff.There's a ton of luck involved, but a lot of skill. As I played more and more, I realised which classes worked well on which levels. I worked out when to fully explore certain areas with certain classes and when to rush to the next area.Some people won't like this game because of the graphics, and that's certainly one downside. Others won't like this game because it's repetitive and because you only have the ability to only carry a small amount of loot.I loved the game because of the challenge of the game, the complex simplicity of the gear management, and the huge amount of enjoyment I got when I started winning games.

												Seeing the reviews that this small and fun game has, I've decided to add mine to counter the negativity. I have to admit, I too would avoid buying unless you:- like experimenting and trying odd indie games and their features- like Binding of Isaac or any other hardcore-ish rogue-likes- are able to multi-task (e.g. play the game and watch a film/listen to an audio-book/...)- genuinely enjoy unlocking new hard-earned stuff- have a lots of free time on your handsSo if you're a COD player, run for your life. However, If you meet at least 2 of any of the points, get the game or wait for the nearest sale, I guarantee you'll enjoy it. I myself enjoyed every second (well, tbh, except couple of the first ones...) of the 34 hours that it took me to achieve every single achievement in the game and explore nearly every possibility and mechanic in it. I totally recommend! You'll thank me (and the dev) yet, when you manage to make it to the end of your first dungeon after dying again and again - that sense of accomplishment is definitely the best thing that a game can give you.

												Poorly balanced, each run's difficulty is anywhere on a scale of ""normal"" to ""completely-broken-impossible,"" with most beyond the impossible mark.  I hear it gets easier after you unlock more stuff so your starting stats are better, but I don't want to waste hours waiting for the run where I am fortunate enough to progress.It's a shame, it could be fun. The combat movement and ranged mechanics are simple and offer a bit of skill, but does very little to offset the immense amount of luck involved. Even a simple change like increasing your starting health and changing nothing else would allow you to progress at least a bit further each run increasing the chance of finding some good treasure to get you started.3/10			"

												I have put an embarassing amount of time into this little rogue-like-lite gem. First the bad: The graphics are embarassingly bad, with teeny sprites that have no animations. For some reason, the console, which tells you crucial information about things happening around you, is obscured behind the map itself. One or two glitches occur when continuing an earlier game, including torches blinking between torch and blood spot sprites. The sound fits into the style of the game well, but it all sounds like someone cranked it out on sfxr in about 30 minutes or so.Now the good:The gameplay is both extremely simple and very deep.The game has a ton of classes and artifacts to unlock, which will keep you coming back for more.The gameplay is both fun and addicting.This game is pretty difficult when you start out, and requires practice to improve at it.You can pick this game up, play it for 30 minutes, and lay it back down without getting lost.

												Basically the worst game in my library, this game is god-awful. DO NOT BUYA roguelike where your only options are move and attack, but every hit only has like a 60% hit chance. And you die in 2 hits. And there's no health regen. Your only inventory is some equipment slots but 90% of the equipment is garbage, unless you luck into one with a rare and totally overpowered enchantment. Also you can start the game totally surrounded and die in two turns with no recourse. This game is the most lazily designed piece-of-♥♥♥♥ I've ever played.

EVEN A KNIGHT CAN MISS POINT BLANK.Nothing frustrates you more than missing more than 4 times when your enemy WHO IS STANDING INFRONT OF YOU is doing 5+ damage each hit.On Mask of the Boy King there is a Ghost Zombie that can move twice a turn. On my wizard with 80 hp, shouldnt be a problem. I missed every shot except for a few only doing 4 damage. After i killed him, i had 54. He was doing 4-7 a turn.But all I can say is, It's fun for an hour. This game is heavily RNG based and its very lucky to actually get a good hit.			"

												*shakes head sadly*  Such a pity.Look, I like roguelikes.  I really do.  I've played a good few, and I enjoy a desperate struggle with limited resources, where every choice matters and one bad move can ruin an entire run.  I like to have to make hard decisions and cheat death through careful planning, frantic improvisation and the rare lucky break.Hack Slash Loot is the antithesis of those things.Unless the game has undergone a  total makeover in terms of design since I last played it, it's a broken, pointless roguelike in which you stand absolutely no chance in hell of surviving (unless you get lucky and get a Holy/Virtue element weapon that boosts your stats with each hit, right at the start of your run).The most potent strategy you have is ""Stand in front of a doorway to fight the enemies one on one, and pray that the guys stuck behind the guy you're hitting don't loop around and flank you before you kill them all one at a time"".  You can't even RUN.  The enemies chase you forever like homing missiles and will not stop until you've bopped them on the head enough to kill them.  There's no class-specific skills to use and manage either.  It's all about the items you find and pick up.  And getting them?  Random.  There are virtually no hard choices in the game.  Just roll the dice and pray you make it.It's like playing russian roulette with a fully loaded gun.  There is no skill.  Only luck.  Winning (Or even PROGRESS) is impossible unless you get insanely lucky.If you want a roguelike, go play FTL (a much better game), or Dungeons of dredmor.  Hell, if you want an action-based roguelike, Eldritch is pretty good and actually takes skills and quick thinking to beat.  Go play those or the many other good roguelikes out there.  Avoid hack slash loot at all costs.			"

												If you enjoy playing as a character that can't hack, slash, or loot, this is the game for you. It's desperately punishing. The blindfolded sacks of meat holding your weapon of choice nearly always fumble when confronted by a mob-filled room, fall over their own feet and onto the spear of the nearest goblin.			"

												I'm very fond of HSL, so I wish I could recommend this game more highly. Its appealingly nostalgic looking, fairly accessible, and charmingly simple - cutting back on a lot of roguelike conventions without losing the main idea. Looting and getting stronger is predictably addictive. Unfortunately it still feels unpolished and balanced poorly, and the worst offender is the fact that there are just relatively few meaningful actions for the player to consider and take throughout a playthrough. Questions a player faces are two: whether or not to engage, or whether or not to equip - and the answers to those questions are often strikingly obvious. I also haven't found a single practical reason yet to focus on melee over ranged weaponry. That fact combined with a relatively common boost makes the experience very simple to game. In some was HSL feels like an iOS casual game, with a veneer of hardcore trappings, minus the in-app purchases. But I am fond of it, and will keep playing a bit.			"

												This game was fun at first....  Than it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me right off...  Than I understood how this game is supposed to function.  This is a luck based game.  I can't stress that enough.  There is some strategy to it, but far and away everything is based on risk versus reward.  You will die many many many times, but that is how you unlock new characters to play.  I didn't fully enjoy the game until I figured out how to win!  You need the right class for the right level.  No story though.  Just a ""rogue like"" dungeon crawler.			"

												This game is both brutally difficult, incredibly unfair, really annoying, and very tedious.The game loves to set you up against masses of enemies that you are really not capable of dealing with (nor can you run away from).  Be prepared to miss with your attacks a lot, often in streaks of 10 or more in a row.  Also be ready to have very little health, and not many opportunities to refill it or increase it.  As you descend the enemies get harder and harder, and they get more cheap with their attack powers, such as poison that can take off half your health over time, fire attacks that can also destroy your equipment, and lighting attacks that can chain stun-lock you.There is also no leveling system, you gain (and loose) attributes from equipment, which is further modified scrolls, potions, and altars.  The loot in general is also very boring and uninteresting, and you will often see the same equipment you didn't want over and over again.  The best part is that to unlock extra characters, the game expects you to die over and over again.  You start with 3 out of 32 characters unlocked.I cannot recommend this game on any level.			"

												This is pretty much the worst Roguelike I've ever played. It tries to cut a Roguelike down to its bare elements, but removes too much of what makes such a game worth playing. The best description I've read of this game was that ""It seems like someone told the developers Roguelikes are really hard and nothing else."" and they went with that. There is no sense of curiosity. Nothing interesting to learn. You just wander around rooms looting chests hoping for an item to increase your health until you die or you're lucky enough to accidentally clear a dungeon. Because that's ALL that matters in this game. Luck.1/10			"

												Yeah... There's no experience points or levels in this game. It's all based on the loot you find. There's no inventory other than what your character has equipped, so everything you carry is based on swapping items. You can't carry healing potions or scrolls, so healing is based on finding the items. The constant 'stand-off' of enemies is annoying. It gets boring very quick.To even call this game 'roguelike' is extremely insulting to the original. Do not recommend this game at all. Not worth $6.99. Wish I could get my money back.			"

												This Game is honestly a bit of a dissapointment (probably more so if you got it for full price, I got it from a humble bundle). It looks like it should be a nice game, and while it does have its charm, but just not enough to make up for its flaws. PROS:-A number of artifacts, once you find one, you can choose to start with that artifact in any future game.-A nice weapon/armor material system, silver weapons disarm foes, gold weapons give you stat bonuses occasionally, psychic weapons causes stat drain, among other things-A couple of nice references to other (better) games in the form of some artifacts and uncommon rooms (such as an Aperture test chamber and I'm pretty sure I saw the castle crashers knights once)-Despite not having an inventory (kind of a good thing, to be honest-it leads to less of the hoarding mentality many RPGs end up with) it does have a secondary weapon slot, and you can switch between the two easily, which I thought was a nice little feature.CONS:-Melee is awful-seriously, there's almost no reason to use it.-combat is dull and repetetive (there's literally nothing beyond 'attack' and 'move')-more than one or two friendly NPCs completely bog down the pace of the game-Unlocking more characters seems to be completely random-Death is frequent, not because the game is hard, but because healing is almost exclusively availible from random potions/scrolls/food (and the occasional vampiric weapon) and there's no garauntee you'll find anything that actually works well with your main combat stat. also poison is effectively incurable-if you can't survive until it passes on its own, you're dead.While the game is flawed, it's still somewhat enjoyable if you stay away from the melee characters and the Battle for Stormrise quest. Playing as a Pixie Mage wearing plate armor and using a gun to shoot weapons out of your enemies hands is hard not to enjoy.			"

												At first touch, the game doesn't seem very challenging and stimulating. It seems like it's all luck. However- the longer you play, the more you realize that every action is part of a long term strategy. Not as advanced as Dungeons of Dredmor, but faster and more 8-bit. 7.2/10			"

												Seeing the reviews that this small and fun game has, I've decided to add mine to counter the negativity. I have to admit, I too would avoid buying unless you:- like experimenting and trying odd indie games and their features- like Binding of Isaac or any other hardcore-ish rogue-likes- are able to multi-task (e.g. play the game and watch a film/listen to an audio-book/...)- genuinely enjoy unlocking new hard-earned stuff- have a lots of free time on your handsSo if you're a COD player, run for your life. However, If you meet at least 2 of any of the points, get the game or wait for the nearest sale, I guarantee you'll enjoy it. I myself enjoyed every second (well, tbh, except couple of the first ones...) of the 34 hours that it took me to achieve every single achievement in the game and explore nearly every possibility and mechanic in it. I totally recommend! You'll thank me (and the dev) yet, when you manage to make it to the end of your first dungeon after dying again and again - that sense of accomplishment is definitely the best thing that a game can give you.

												I put about 7 hours into this game hoping that it would get more fun or easier, but unfortunately it did not.  I like Roguelike games and this game has potential but it fails in the fun department.  I managed to beat a couple of quests but I didn't want to play every quest as the Amazon char.Anyways - this is a turn by turn combat with randomized everything from loot drops, monsters, and maps.  The difficulty is really high and without reason.  You can get ""good"" at it, but if you don't find good items on the first floor... just re-roll/Not a bad game, but not as fun as I thought it would be.

												Hack Slash Loot è un RPG puro, difficile ed estremamente longevo.Pensato per essere realmente guidato dal fato e in minima parte dall'abilità delle proprie doti di giocatori, si può fare ben poco quando si beve la pozione sbagliata che disincanta tutti i propri oggetti magici, tuttavia ci si può trasformare in una macchina da guerra se le cose girano dalla nostra parte. Nonostante l'apparente randomicità, il gameplay è del classico RPG per eccellenza, a turni e senza dare vantaggi a nessuno, ne a noi ne ai nemici.Il gioco parte con personaggi deboli che moriranno senza scampo su tutti i livelli disponibili, poi man mano che moriremo, si sbloccheranno personaggi decisamente più interessanti come l'amazzone, probabilmente il personaggio più facile e potente da usare di tutto il gioco.Se vi piace il genere puro RPG questo è un must, deve anche interessarvi poco la grafica, o almeno essere abbastanza vecchi da godervi un gioco a 8-bit in tutto il suo disarmante e scarno splendore.PROS- Puro RPG- Immediato e semplice- È come mangiare le patatine fritte, quando parti non riesci a fermarti- Nonostante la disarmante semplicità grafica riesce ad essere vario- Lo stile visuale è coerente e molto consistenteCONS- Morire contro il mostro di fine quest, dopo 2-3 ore di gioco capita, spesso- Morire contro un nemico a caso dopo molto impegno capita, spesso- Frustranti capovolgimenti durante la partita- Ci stava poter guidare più personaggi nella stessa partita- Si sente la mancanza di uno story mode più profondo			"

												*shakes head sadly*  Such a pity.Look, I like roguelikes.  I really do.  I've played a good few, and I enjoy a desperate struggle with limited resources, where every choice matters and one bad move can ruin an entire run.  I like to have to make hard decisions and cheat death through careful planning, frantic improvisation and the rare lucky break.Hack Slash Loot is the antithesis of those things.Unless the game has undergone a  total makeover in terms of design since I last played it, it's a broken, pointless roguelike in which you stand absolutely no chance in hell of surviving (unless you get lucky and get a Holy/Virtue element weapon that boosts your stats with each hit, right at the start of your run).The most potent strategy you have is ""Stand in front of a doorway to fight the enemies one on one, and pray that the guys stuck behind the guy you're hitting don't loop around and flank you before you kill them all one at a time"".  You can't even RUN.  The enemies chase you forever like homing missiles and will not stop until you've bopped them on the head enough to kill them.  There's no class-specific skills to use and manage either.  It's all about the items you find and pick up.  And getting them?  Random.  There are virtually no hard choices in the game.  Just roll the dice and pray you make it.It's like playing russian roulette with a fully loaded gun.  There is no skill.  Only luck.  Winning (Or even PROGRESS) is impossible unless you get insanely lucky.If you want a roguelike, go play FTL (a much better game), or Dungeons of dredmor.  Hell, if you want an action-based roguelike, Eldritch is pretty good and actually takes skills and quick thinking to beat.  Go play those or the many other good roguelikes out there.  Avoid hack slash loot at all costs.			"

												Since I puchased this game, I've occaisonally come back to it to satisfy my dungeon itch while talking to people in the room, or waiting for something else. It (Hack,Slash,Loot) serves my purpose for it. For me, it is the simple, casual, non-engaging go-to game that I can walk away from at a moment's notice.There's no saving the game. There's no rhyme or reason to the drops. The monster difficulty depends on the floor you're on. For cleared areas, the minimap navigation is a big time-saver. You could spend an hour building your character just to watch it get torn down in moments upon opening a door to a boss that is way stronger than expected.Pro's:- Casual. You can step right into it with zero load time and quick menus....and walk away from it just as fast- Pixel graphics are simplistic and nostalgic - Simple, fast learning curve. The gameplay reminds me of ""Temple of Apshai"" of Apple II fame. Item upgrades and potions are easy to choose (or to know the effects that result) Con's:- No story, beyond some paltry title page blurb. No sense of story progression either.- Character ability is a set of stats that calculate based on to-hit and parry roles.- No room for combat strategy. Just try to channelize groups of baddies and hope you outlast them.In conclusion, if you wanted a rogue-like dungeon game that's story-rich and full of stimulating and complex battle strategy, or multiplayer party based co-op, you're missing the point with this one.  If you want a simple, casual time passer that you can blow unimportant time with,  well this one may be exactly what you need.A game to play while waiting on thecable company hold music:                 10/10 "
