												Ah, KOTOR II. Where to start? First, download The Sith Lords: Restored Content Mod. I state this because the standard game is highly unpolished, is missing a lot of extra dialogue and has many bugs that will frustrate anybody, whether they are new to Star Wars or loved the first KOTOR.This game shows mechanics that would later be implemented into Mass Effect. A definite meter to determine morality, the breaking down of gear into components (or ""omni-gel"" for you Spectres), combat that can be paused while issuing commands to you and your squad along with a focus on dialogue options between NPCs and your companions. Your choices in these dialogues could allow you to avoid a combat situation, help progress a quest, or give more information on your companions or your surroundings.Those familiar with some Star Wars lore (such as the movies or KOTOR I) are probably aware of the black-and-white morality shown. For example, KOTOR I gives you a situation where a woman is attempting to sell a hunters trophy belonging to her late husband. You can either buy the trophy from her (the light option), or convince the woman using the Force to give you the item (the dark option). KOTOR II blurs morality into tones of grey, where the Jedi are not seen entirely as the paragon of all that is good and where the ultimate ""light"" option is not always perceived as the most prudent one.Part of this blurring of the lines is due to Kreia, one of the companions accompanying you, the Jedi Exile. A mysterious woman whose becomes more cryptic with every word, her musings and personality have convinced me she is one of the most fleshed-out and well written characters in video game history. The strange thing is, not many of the other characters seem as interesting as Kreia in comparison. Actually, I'm somewhat wrong; HK-47 is a great companion as well. His mannerisms about murder, his copies and his past are worth listening to if you want to chuckle. Atton is somewhat interesting wisecracking pilot and the remaining characters aren't worth writing home about. They're not bad characters, just not great ones.I'm going to stop this review now before I type spoilers and just tell you to play it. If you enjoyed Mass Effect, if you played KOTOR 1, if you enjoy learning about the lore of Star Wars, or if you need an RPG fix sorted out, KOTOR II is a great option. Just make sure to get the Restored Content Mod. It's really necessary to have a good experience.			"

												""Perhaps you were expecting some surprise, for me to reveal a secret that had eluded you, something that would change your perspective of events, shatter you to your core. There is no great revelation, no great secret. There is only you.""That is the culmination of Obsidian's Knights of the Old Republic II, a game which flips the entire Star Wars universe on its head via deep character interactions and a unique spin on established aspects of the franchise.Make no mistake - the original release of KOTOR II was a flawed, incomplete mess. Not only was it missing a large chunk of its ending (notably, what happened to the player's squadmates when they landed on the final planet), but it was buggy and prone to all sorts of glitches. Yet, despite all that, the game still remains a classic of the RPG genre for how often it defies standard conventions and plays with the series' established tropes.You play the Exile, a former commander who committed a terrible sin to stop the Mandalorian Wars, and was exiled from the Jedi Order because of it. The game begins with the Exile waking up onboard the Peragus mining facility, alongside T3-M4 (a returning character from the first game) and an enigmatic woman named Kreia, who knows more than she lets on. Together with sprung prisoner (and ace pilot) Atton Rand, the quartet escapes the facility and discover that the Jedi have been driven to near-extinction. With the help of a cast of supporting squadmates, including a former Sith protegee named Visas, the fun-loving (well, as fun as a homicidal robot can be) assassin droid HK-47, a bounty hunter, the leader of the Mandalores and more, the Exile sets out to stop the Sith and rebuild the Jedi Order.The biggest difference between this and KOTOR I is how linear this game is. Not that it diminishes the plot at all, but there's a definite rhythm to the way you approach areas and plot situations. Whereas the original game's only real goal was to activate the four pillars to find out the location of the Star Forge before assaulting it, II has you either aiding or working against a planet's internal war, taking part in a trial to exonerate a wrongfully-accused civilian, taking apart a crime syndicate and more. The plot is a lot tighter and focused than its predecessor.The cast of characters is where the game really shines, though. Aside from Kreia (an enigmatic woman who stresses being neutral in all decisions), every character has some backstory that requires trust and increasing the ""Force Bond"" with them to access. I truly liked that you could upgrade various aspects of your teammates' abilities by either talking to them a lot or helping them with certain decisions.It's pretty much a given that if you're going to play KOTOR II, you need the Restored Content Mod. Not only does it restore the bulk of the ending which was scrapped by Obsidian in their rush to finish the game for a Christmas deadline, but it also fixes a lot of the bugs and underlying coding issues found throughout the game. I used it the first time I played the game, and I can't imagine going without it. In the same vein, the M4-78 Enhancement Project fills in an unfinished questline and gives some great upgrades to your droid party members, along with some awesome consequences later in the game - I was so pumped to see the droid army helping me during a later encounter.It's not all perfect, though. While the crafting system is very good (and has shades of Mass Effect, which came out three years later), it's far too easy to be stuck with a large amount of components and weapons that are unusable, and there's never any real need to upgrade your gear beyond a handful of weapons.Likewise, the ending (even with the Restored Content Mod) is a huge slog. There's a mid-mission quest with a robotic remote, which you are forced into, which is impossible to complete if you didn't clear out all the enemies from the map just prior to starting it. Likewise, the final fortress is a huge slog and is only passable through spamming Force powers or avoiding the majority of enemies.That said, KOTOR II is well worth your time and money. The way it turns many of the elements of the Star Wars universe on its head and keeps up the energy and characterization through its runtime is still near-unmatched in this day and age, and I heartily recommend that every RPG fan check this game out at least once.

												KOTOR II is one of those classic RPGs I can replay over and over. This sequel was released in 2004 and is still a great game and remains extremely playable today. Even though Bioware developed the first KOTOR, they ended up handing the job over to Obsidian who, as always, did a fantastic job with their work.The use of KOTOR II's Light Side/Dark Side system is a lot like the modern day systems of good/evil characters. When you as the  character does or says evil things then you grow more in tune with the dark side of the force. The contrast to this is of course, doing good deeds and saying not-so-evil stuff. This leads to the Light side of the force. In either case you will grow more powerful and influence those you travel with. This will also effect your force powers amongst many other things...The StoryThe single defining feature of KOTOR or KOTOR II is the story. Anyone who loves Star Wars must love a good mythos from the Star Wars world, especially one this early in the timeline of the Star Wars Universe. This sequel begins when a stranger, oblivious to his past, wakes up in a Mining Station medical bay, only to notice no one is around. No one...except a mysterious elderly woman. Journey to several planets and cause havok or create order. Kill the weak or defend them. All the while, you search for the power to make you a Master of the Force.Pros:- Great main storyline with various other mini-quests, all which act in canon with the Star Wars universe.- Open world that you would expect from an RPG- Choose what you say to someone carefully; You could end up in a fight or effect the story.- Choose light or dark side; Your actions will decide what you become.- Tons of lore from the Star Wars universe you can't find anywhere else!!Cons:- Graphics are from the first Xbox generation, but it still holds today.- Some of the voice overs for alien species are simply repeated recordings on loop.- Occasionally, a glitch or two might happen- RARELY, but sometimes there are game breaking bugs. There are only two that I know of, and one of them ruined my first game. This requires the double save slow technique. Verdict? - 8.5/10 This is my favorite Star Wars game hands down. Many people also recognize this particular game to be LucasArts' crowing achievement. Obsidian does a great job with the sequel to Bioware's KOTOR and does Star Wars in general great justice.			"

												Well, I liked this game so much I spend years working on a mod to fix issues with it that happened due to LucasArts rushing Obsidian. And again several to work on adding a cut planet (M4-78) with a lot of self-made content to make it a fully fleshed out planet matching the ones ingame. That should tell you enough. If not just know this is a ""must play"" RPG you can't miss...EDIT:Since it was unclear for some people which mod I talk about, TSLRCM. You can now get it from the Workshop!			"

												A great idea for a main character, memorable teammates and a plot shrouded in mystery makes The Sith Lords one of my favourite games of all time. Some people may find the first section of the game quite linear, but the game only really begins once you leave Telos. Also, the wait for a lightsaber makes getting it all the better.Be sure to install the latest version of the Restored Content Mod, which adds in dialogue, scenes and missions that were cut from the official release. The mod also removes many of the games glitches.			"

												This is Star Wars free from George Lucas. He created the saga, and Obsidian show how to continue it, creating more stuff thats even better. I have played this game over 500 hours, I bought it on Steam just to have an easy way to install it. 4 cd to install it is a little annoying today.I can write long novels why I love this game, why I play it more than I play Kotor 1. But I will try to make this short.The Sith Lords has:- great characters with deep personalities- dark stories and setting- a deep lore thanks to Kotor 1 and Tales of the Jedi-comic- fantastic dialog with complex possibilities- an improved crafting-system (6 parts-lightsaber anyone?)- Influence-system with your compainons- make your own jedi or sith-team. Even good guys can be turned to the dark side.- Be a jedi, or turn to the dark side and be a Sith Lord. It really change alotPlaying through the game once? You have missed much, I promise you, I still learned new stuff on my fourth playthrough.Is the game perfect? No, its not. Its a slow start, it really is, and it was a rushed game, so bugs, it had alot of bugs on release, but nearly all is fixed today, and some things was left out, and not really a good ending, . But the way there, is so gooood. So much improved from Kotor 1, and so much content. Its a 30+ hour game.From me, a die hard Star Wars fan, and not too experienced with rpg, its a 10/10 points.			"

												If you like Star Wars, you love the lore behind the Force, and you love the Jedi, then you'll probably hate this game. Why? Because the idea behind KOTOR 2 is to take all of the black and white in Star Wars, then break it down so you see past the blinded Jedi council and ambitious Sith. It's not your standard Star Wars movie. The game turns Lucas' pure good/pure evil fantasy into moral playground that makes you question the very existence of the Force and the people who use it. That being said, though, this is an absolutely fantastic game for any cRPG/WRPG fan. It sticks by the standard D&D rules, just like the first game, but adds more feats, force powers, and items. However, after a certain point, the game gets extremely easy, especially if you have half an idea of what you're doing.Unlike the first game, it doesn't have a major twist (the biggest twist is a backstory for one of your companions), but instead slowly provides hints to the major plot. The game's setting is pretty dark, too. The universe is in disarray, and really feels like it. Settlements are run down, there's ruins on places that were bright in the previous game, and the Jedi order is nearly extinct. However, along the journey you run into several party members with interesting personalities and troublesome backstories. If you were expect any form of romance, it's not here. There's subtle hints, but no official romance options (which I really enjoy). That said, I suggest playing as a male simply due to the fact you get Handmaiden, who is a far more interesting character than the Disciple. Overall the story and setting make a very immersive game that will keep your attention, as long as you can force your way through the first two planets. The combat starts off fairly difficult, but becomes a breeze once you get going, then turns into EZ mode. Your companions are great, some of the best if all of video game history, in my opnion, and their voice actors deliver top notch lines that you will remember for years to come. Is it better than KOTOR 1? In my opinion? Yes. In your opinion? I don't know, play the game, dummy. (just kidding, i don't mean any offense at all, but you should form your own opnions instead of jumping a bandwagon)apathyisdeath/10P.S. Look into the Restored Content Mod to not only fix a lot of old bugs, but get access to a TON of content that was cut from the original game. Also, if you use a widescreen monitor, look online for a widescreen fix. It's pretty easy to do. "

												Star Wars: KOTOR IIThis game is truly epic, considering the fact that it was released 9 years ago. I tell you what, this game could probably be the best RPG game out there, in my opinion it's the best. It is much better than the first game. The voice acting is really  great and the wonderful thing in this very unique game is that it evoked players to feel strong emotions the same way the characters were portraying in the game. Light side or dark side it doesn't matter which side you choose because if you play this game you will feel peace and passion thoroughly. However, the downside is that when this game was released back then, it wasn't complete due to LucasArts pressuring the Developers for an early Christmas release date, many parts of the game was cut out. But thanks to hard-core Star Wars fans out there they made the KOTOR II TSLRCM which allows you to play the game with the cut-out parts. Now, do yourself a favor, go to the store and buy the game.May The Force Be With You!			"

												Quick story recap: a long time ago, in 2003, prior to KOTOR release, LuasArts already wanted a sequel, but Bioware was unavailable at the moment and offered Obsidian instead. Then two things happened: 1. LA were greedy and patientless enough to demand the game be done by Christmas 2004; and 2. Obsidian were optimistic/desperate enough to agree to these terms without even seeing the first game. The end result was a glitchy half-cut but potentially great game.I used to hate it and left after ~5-8 hours into the first playthrough. It seemed boring and I got stuck on the very first planet… but then it got a new life on Steam, with high-res support, achievements, and the Cut Content mod already on Workshops. And I loved it. KOTOR 2 is worthy of the first game, adding a little more ambiguity to the classic light/dark dichotomy, and offering more action and independence to playable characters than the first game. The Exile story is probably not so personally dramatic as the one of the first game, but it's just different and delivers no less.			"

												Let me tell you the story.Once upon a time, there was a Boy. That Boy had a dream. He dreamed about the galaxy far-far away. There were no limits for his imagination. So he created the world where rebels fight with Evil Empire. He decided to add some weeaboo stuff too, so there were Space Samurais called Jedi, and Evil Space Samurai called Sith. So they were fighting epic battles, ya-da, ya-da. And people liked it, and praised the Boy.But then this universe got popular, and the boy sold out. He didn't care about his creation anymore, because he lost his dream, and his imagination ran out. So he sold out everything and began to pander to child audience, selling merchandise for ♥♥♥♥ tons of money. He also blessed various of talentless hacks (like Bioware) on creating tasteless and pandering copycats to get some cash.You probably know that Boy by the name George Lucas.But there was Another Boy. He was a writer. But not just writer, he was a videogame writer. And pretty successful one. He liked videogames. He liked to write for them. He went through tough ♥♥♥♥, however. But in the end he gathered the greatest team of RPG developers of his time.But there was a thing that Another Boy hated. It was the universe George Lucas created and then butchered. Another Boy hated how childish this universe was. And the overpowered Jedi demigods, i mean WTF? Who the ♥♥♥♥ wouldn't kill himself instead of fighting them. Because Jedis and Siths secretly manipulated regular folk, oppressed them and did whatever they want with them. Another Boy didn't liked it. It was ♥♥♥♥.So what Another Boy did? He created The Game. The Game without childish stuff, but set in this very universe. He deconstructed the whole thing, and then made it smart and quite philosophical too. His name was Chris Avellone, and his brothers were Obsidian Entertainment.And together they made the best Star Wars game ever existed.Knights of the Old Republic 2.			"

Star Wars | Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords is an Adventure RPG based on the D20 System. As the Republic lies in shambles five years after the Dark Wars, a former Jedi who lost his connection to the force is pursued by a trio of dark jedi masters who roam the galaxy, seeking its destruction.Pros: Darker story than the first Star Wars | Knights of the Old Republic game with a lot of shades of grey. Alligning yourself with the light side of the force may cause death, while other times the dark side of the force may save innocent lives, and seeing the consequences of your actions makes much more of a moral struggle to determine what really is the right thing to do. You get to spend time and train some of your companions into jedi, and yourself get to upgrade your jedi class with a new selection of 3 jedi master classes. Crafting has also been enhanced, adding among other things the ability to disassemble existing items into parts and chemicals. There also are many winks to locations or characters from the previous game, without actually needing to have played it to understand everything.Cons: As with the previous game, the graphics didn’t age too well (although the full-resolution update helped), and unfamiliarity with tabletop RPGs and the D20 system might confuse many who try to understand and optimize their character’s equipment. The game has multiple bugs due to problems in the development, making the story somewhat hard to follow: A cut scene might pop in but the playthrough that lead to that scene was missing, or maybe you were in your ship flying to a destination and the game suddenly jump to your cockpit with your ship having landed on a unknown planet you’re unsure how you got there.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next of your list!This is a darker game using the same mechanics as the previous one. The bugs aren’t game breaking, and can be easily fixed with a Mod in the Steam Workshop. If you didn’t like the prequel, you won’t like this one either. But otherwise, I definitively recommend it!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												It's better than KotOR from Bioware (with the restored content modification)!There, I said it! And why exactly would I say something?BioWare make great games, but their stories and lores are divided into good and bad. It's simple, faithful and hence; unrealistic. A deluded fairy-tale, trying to simplify fiction, so people who delude themselves in real life know what they up for, so they're not overchallenged by nuances. Obsidian, on the other hand, did with The Sith Lords what they did with Fallout New Vegas; they put everything on a higher meta-level. They included realism in form of blurring the line of what is good and what is not, making it uneasy to decide between sides. Kreia is one of those prime examples, just by including her as an important character. I don't want to spoil anything, but you'll know what I mean when you play it. Those things are what makes this game far superior to the Bioware equivalent. Obsidian are the best RPG makers, then, and especially now.			"

												After the huge innovation of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, KOTOR2 had high expectations. It introduced advanced upgrading; a more fleshed out and expanded story; more force abilities and early game choices/customisations; and allies that you could get to know, gain influence with, and overal interact with, with much more depth.From the get go, you're flung into a mystery as you find your character recovering from being held within an abandoned mining facility. I won't spoil the story for you, but I will say that it it never gives in - also raising new questions, and spawning many branches which act not only as side missions, but also to add more detail to the main story.In KOTOR2, you start the game as a jedi, as opposed to becoming one later in the game. There are more force options, and more feats that make each of the 3 classes really distinct. This, combined with the game's element of choice, and a light/darkside meter, you will find it is a unique experience for each player.So, for those who enjoyed the original KOTOR, this game will serve as both an extension to the story, and the means to get back into this amazing experience.For new players, however, this game will still be blast to play. It features an easy to understand character creator, and a solid tutorial in the beginning. I would recommend playing the original KOTOR first though, to really understand both the gameplay; and more importantly, the story.Kotor 2 is a fantastic game, and one played through many times. Each experience is unique, and the characters and story are really engaging.*Also, on a side note. I recommend a mod called 'The Restored Content Mod', which will increase the amount of content in the game, as well as adding some 'lost' content that wasn't in the original game. It also fixes a bunch of bugs that really plague this game, due to it being released premature.			"

												This is the true Masterpiece Star Wars game.Yes, Bioware's first game is fantastic and fun, but if you look at it closely it's basically a retelling of the original trilogy and is a bit one-dimensional in terms of characterization and plot writing. You fight against the big bad empire and find a way to stop their super-weapon(factory) and discover a massive plot twist truth, and it's pretty much polar opposite paths of pure good and pure evil, with almost nothing in between. Plus, the dialogue can be really cornyFor the sequel, however, the gods of writing known as Obsidian were given the power to bring their epic writing ability into Star Wars and thus came one of the best RPGs known to man, and one of the best stories Star Wars has to offer, where the story really comes to life through character interaction and brilliant lines that chill you. A lot of what you learn comes through dialogue in this game, so be prepared to listen and respondNow, you may be saying: ""But it has bugs and is incomplete!"" That's because LucasArts got greedy and gave them a year to do this game instead of the three years that Bioware had for the first, it's amazing they managed to create this much material. I highly recommend getting the Restored Content Mod here which does its best to re-create what Obsidian had tried to do with this game --> http://deadlystream.com/forum/files/file/578-tsl-restored-content-mod/So why am I saying this game is so good? Well, here are my reasons:1. It has one of the deepest and most moving plots of any story, and changes your perceptions of the Star Wars universe. The Jedi are not painted as the god-like saviors and the Sith are not necessarily entirely evil. In fact, the game almost presents the point of view of an outsider (well, an exile of the Jedi) and you can experience the consequences of the constant conflict between the light and the dark. The entire plot is trying to find a way to stop the sith, but you have no help, and you just got back into the galaxy and just re-discovered your force connection. As you progress, you discover just what has happened to the galaxy, how bad the situation is, why you were exiled in the first place, and get to make some very tough calls. Unlike the first game, there are no real bomb-shell plot twists that come out of left field, rather a setting of interesting minor twists that make sense, but feel no less impactful (the jedi council scene on dantooine, for instance)2. It has some of the best written characters ever witnessed. Case and Point, Kreia, who's practically your twisted female Yoda who lies to you so you do her bidding, but mixes her lies with truths as she shapes your view of the world. She also has some very interesting viewpoints on the Jedi Civil War, and provides context to why the war happened in the first place and why Revan (the main character of the first game) did what he/she did. Other characters also have their own flaws and positive traits, each being actual living individuals, whereas in the first game it was clear that most party members were just a character embodying one viewpoint only (light, dark, comedy). And those brought back from the first game are given even more of a shining light and a deeper backstory so that they become real people. (HK-47, for example, is even more epic)3. Your choices matter - No, really, they do. Granted, the endings don't play out that differently, but you see the consequences of your actions throughout the game (especially with TSLRCM), and particularly with those you travel with. The way you act changes your followers, and the way they respond to you likewise does so. Again, particularly with the restored content mod, you can witness how your choices play out, and experience the difference in how others react to you (People also note that if you're evil your face looks awful, which nobody notices in KOTOR 1)4. It feels grounded to reality - It's not just cowboys and spaceships, you actually witness good political drama too in this game. Here, you deal with real people and their problems, not just a grandma needing to get across the street. You also have to struggle with what is good and what is evil, and often times the lines are blurred, particularly when it comes to choosing sides. On Nar Shaddaa, you might feel inclined to help the hapless refugees, but it might cause more harm than good because there is no system to replace the caste they are in. Oh, and by the way, common citizens blame the Jedi for the war, both the sith and the Jedi. In fact, they think they are both Jedi, since they don't actually know what's going on.These are the ones I have off the top of my head, but look around and you'll find more reasons. This isn't some epic good vs evil game like the first or Mass Effect, so don't go expecting it. Instead, look for a deep narrative that tells a complex story that has a journey that matters more than the destination. There are definite flaws, since the game was rushed out the door by a poor production committee, but if you overlook those flaws, then you'll notice just how brilliant this game is. Truly, I wish that Star Wars resembled what Obisidan came up with more, but unfortunately we won't see that in Disney canon. However, if you want a taste of Star Wars for big boys, come check this out.			"

												If you're uptight about graphics go away. It's old but it's amazing.I owned SWKOTOR 1 before I even knew steam existed. I loved it. When I saw SWKOTOR 2 years ago on steam I bought it so quick I didnt care at all the price.I honestly believe it was very well worth it. Now that it has steam workshop enabled I'd imagine it'll shine a bit more. But I'd gladly replay multiple time. I've heard it was riddled with bugs by some people but when I played it wasn't that bad at all. Honestly no matter what anyone says good or bad get the game anyway it's well worth it. There is a mod to change many things and make it how the developers wanted it to be however which I find amazing. I love RPG's and this one is by far one of my favorites. Even without any mods I rather enjoy it greatly. Although  I heard the restored content mod is extremely worth it and makes this game 100x better. I personally havent tried it yet due to issues on my part but I'll work them out after I beat the game for the 12th time. Number 11 so far c: I love everything about the game. Finish reading this review clearly means you have not purchased it yet and started playing. Go, now. Unless you did in which case... Think about force stuff! I rate 20 / 10 I would bang so many things out of this game. I would recommend this game infinitely. My wife will also kill me for wanting to bang this game harder than her. But I'm sure she will think the same after tasting this game.TL;DR Just buy it now. It's beyond great.			"

Better than canon storiesSeriously, I'm surprised that Disney quickly went and declared almost all older Star Wars games ""non-canon"", because these games contain better stories than most, in not all, Star Wars movies. KOTOR saga, that goes through both the BioWare game, and this one, made by Obsidian already could make even the Original trilogy sweat for excellence and the depth of the characters in the stories told.But enough about that. KOTOR 2 got recently updated after being released 10 years ago, which is very unexpected. Game got updated with achievements, bug fixes, Steam Workshop and up to 4k resolution support which is VERY welcome. There's also a very certain divide between the KOTOR RPG fans. There are the ones that love both games, ones that love the first, but trash the 2nd (this one) and then there are the ones that claim KOTOR2, to be the superior one. From my perspective, KOTOR2 is the superior one. Why? Here's why:- More detailed characters- More replay value, because there are different ways to approach even Light/Dark paths.- Kreia- Ability to influence your companions and turn them to Jedi/Sith warriors.- More feats/powers and ""Prestige"" classes. i.e. Sith Lord, Jedi Master etc.- Playing with the Restored TSL Content mod, you get all the mising stuff, that wasn't in the original KOTOR2 release and basically get the whole experience, which was the main gripe with the game all these years. - Lightsaber and Force stances (varying kinds of bonuses, depending on situation and enemy type). - HK-47 explaining what love is. - Aged better than KOTOR1- More companion AI behavior options, especially for Force wielding companions.Now, I'm not saying that KOTOR1 is any way worse, it does however deliver a more cohesive and easier to follow story, whereas you play as a random Jedi ""exile"" here, and the real meat of the story gets delivered basically at the end of the game. So it's a lot harder to have a vested interest in the plot (for some). Gameplay itself is fairly straight-forward, as RPG's go, because it has more in common with Dungeons and Dragons then any other video game RPG. In combat you and your enemy take turns (in real time) and make ""rolls"" based on your stats and skills to whoever will get the best outcome, miss, do damage or ""save"" against a status effect, like Fear/Stasis etc. You control your character with WASD keys and click on enemies, select an action and your character follows the order of actions from the list. You can always pause the game at any moment, if you'd prefer to also set actions for your companions in certain order, but on ""Normal"" difficulty that's not really necessary. Just make sure to keep your other guys  leveled up and with decent gear, if you happen to get knocked out and your allies have to pick up the slack or clench a victory in an engagement. I'd say that this game is no-brainer if you love both RPG's and Star Wars. Might not be your cup of tea, if you love Star Wars, but are not a huge RPG fan, because this game is more RPG, then let's say something like Fallout 4 claiming to be an ""RPG"". This game is more in tune, with older types of RPG, where your stats, level, skills, gear and tactics matter in a fight, but it's just complicated enough, not to become a dry mathematical calculation.There's hoping that sometime in the future, we'll get the final conclusion to Revan's story with a third installment, or even an entirely new reboot of KOTOR RPG games, which should be a no-brainer, because now is the perfect time to ""milk"" the Star Wars hype, after The Force Awakens made over 2bln$ worldwide.There was never a more perfect time for a new Star Wars RPG, than now.

												Along with its predecessor- this is a RPG that shouldn't be ignored!More abilties and feats, an advanced gameplay, improved customziation and a story filled with questions and mystery, which leads on to a deeper depth of the star wars psyche.A worthy successor of BioWare's legendary Star Wars game, but has been tossed in the shadows because of the problems it experienced during development.This is a game that deserves more recognition than it actually got.

												KotOR 2, despite being chronically unfinished, is probably the best Star Wars RPG out there and here's why:The story and especially the writing are absolutely phenomenal. The guys at Obsidian have managed to create a game that feels like Star Wars without any of the clichés associated with it. Where the first installment had a whiny Han Solo, a force using Leia and Chewie as carbon copies of their originals, this game puts multiple twists on most stereotypical Star Wars characters, fleshing them out so much more. Hell, even though all a certain Astromech droid ""says"" is random beeps, you know exactly what he wants to tell you, without anyone going ""What's that, Lassie? There's  boy trapped in the well?"". It's just that amazing.On top of it all the game features the best wirtten female character in any video game ever, but it's hard to praise the writing without spoiling the story, so I might as well stop now. Just so much: The game covers a multitude of philosophical questions, especially when reading between the lines, so you should be prepared to think while playing.The graphics are dated, RTwP combat with DnD rules isn't everyone's thing but the same thing can be said for Planescape:Torment and it still is widely regarded as a (the?) classic RPG.Things of note if you have played the predecessor:While the graphics, animations and UI have remained pretty much on the same level when compared to KotOR 1, the characters' build diversity has been greatly increased, making things like a gun wielding Jedi viable options.The combat itself hasn't changed much, except for a few extra skills and powers or new enemies, of course.Loot is now randomly distributed and modding items as well as crafting them have been greatly expanded.The story itself covers quite a few events that happened before KoTOR 1, although the game itself is set later. Due to this, I'd recommend playing the predecessor first (especially since its big twist would otherwise be spoilered). Otherwise, you might get lost, concerning the order in which things happened.As so many others have already stated, the game's main issue is the fact that it's unfinished and unpolished but this can largely be fixed by downloading and installing the TSLRCM, a brilliant modification which restores a lot of cut content to the game, such as the great droid factory. Also, while the game now has widescreen support, I'd still recommend the Widescreen Fix mod to un-stretch the UI.			"

												Knights of the Old Republic II is one of my faveorite games. I've never had a computer without it installed since the day I originally bought it in 2006. The story is extremly unique to Star Wars, and feels almost more fantasy than sci-fi. The writing is top notch, and shines brightest in the character of Kreia. However the game as available for purchase, is incomplete, with a complete planet, entire questlines, and flesh-out ending, absent from the proceedings. In order to fully enjoy the game I highly recommend downloading TSLRCM and M4-78EP, available at deadlystream.com. These two mods(+ a few additional addons) complete what Obsidian was unable too, transforming TSL from a broken game into a masterpiece.Do buy this game, and do get TSLRCM/M4-78EP.			"

												Absolute first and foremost: the first thing you have to do when you want to play this game is go download the mod called The Sith Lords: Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM in short) WITHOUT the M4-78 extension. Trust me.The review: this game is no doubt one of the greatest achievements in the history of intellectual products and will go down in history of videogames defiantly standing as the testament that games are a perfectly viable medium for writers to deliver complex and compelling stories.While not free of flaws, the story, writing, pacing, character development are masterfully weaved together to form one of the best, if not THE absolute best RPG the gaming world has to offer.

The nostalgia factor was and continues to be unreal. The above gametime does not account for the hundreds of hours poured into KOTOR 2.

""I am become death,  the destroyer of worlds.""An intensely philosophical and brooding rumination on war and morality, The Sith Lords is a masterfully written sequel to the original BioWare classic.As brightly as the narrative and writing may shine however, (a worthy successor to the quality of the first), the game often falters in other aspects. KotOR II borders on what could be considered broken; featuring an overall design that lacks polish, quality and ultimately feels unfinished and sorely lacking of QA testing. Granted, this was due to time constraints and pressure from LucasArts, but it is only thanks to the efforts of the community in recent years, (namely the team behind the Restored Content Mod that I'll be trying out next), and the rare update that this can be played and enjoyed as much as it is. Dialogue is frequently skipped over at unreadable speeds, there are significant issues with clipping, camera movement, loading and most animations, and achievement unlocks are all over the place - I got the ""Dancing Queen"" achievement randomly on Peragus Station. The Sith Lords also doesn't feel like much of a departure from the first. Combat is almost identical but yet no longer satisfying or a challenge to play; the developers appear to have compensated for the now ♥♥♥♥-weak enemies by simply adding more of them, with the rare boss fight often amounting to a self-healing tank, bullet sponge or absolute pushover. As a result, you'll die very little and this leaves you feeling as if you're playing on rails; as if combat hardly matters. But for a series that is so reliant and with so much potential depth in its combat and stat management, this was disappointing.As already alluded to though, the quality shown through the writing and branching dialogue saves The Sith Lords from what could have been a disaster. For those who have played the original, the game picks up a short time after the events of the first Knights of the Old Republic and builds upon a lot of the lore surrounding it. A feature for importing your save file isn't available, but there are plenty of options through dialogue to link the choices made in the first. Though admittedly seen as more of a part of the overarching narrative than unique themselves, the companions and major NPCs are, for the most part, fascinating. HK-47 is back, (by popular demand, no doubt), and Kreia personifies the complexities that TSL deals with and, along with Visas, delivers the excellent writing in an equally stellar performance. Remember Malachor V.Very few modern titles use the capabilities that gaming - as a medium - presents anymore, but like the first, Obsidian manipulates both the character and the player with a narrative and means of perspective which is fascinating to watch and all the more immersive to experience. Questions of responsibility and complicity are frequently raised, often leaving it open for you to ponder your choices and the nature of the Force itself. The interwoven plots and rich storytelling of KotOR and the like could not be possible in film or television; and it is this that makes video games such an art form.Play The Sith Lords for the story. Though still worth a purchase, just be aware of what you’re getting into. It is a flawed gem, but a great one at that, and its achievements exceed the faults that could've held it back. A worthy follow up to the original, pick this up along with the Restored Content Mod and make it into the best it can be. A war-torn, Nihilistic thumbs-up.			"

TLDR VERDICTKOTOR 2 is a very worthy successor to the high bar set by the original game. They kept the general gameplay and presentation true the original and put their own unique spin on the story. Many people argue it is actually a superior game to the original. Overall, a rough, buggy and now dated, but still very entertaining game well worth the asking price if you’re a fan of the original or fan of Star Wars in general.FULL REVIEW BELOW“Take the greatest Jedi Knight, strip away the Force, and what remains? They rely on it, depend on it, more than they know. Watch as one tries to hold a blaster, as they try to hold a lightsaber, and you will see nothing more than a woman – or a man. A child.” - KreiaFive years after the events of KOTOR, the galaxy is recovering from the events from the Jedi Civil War. Both the Jedi and Sith have now fallen silent. You have been exiled from the Jedi Order as punishment for following Revan into war against the Mandolorians. You have also been completely cut off from the Force, but was this a part of your punishment, or the result of something much worse?This review is written from a huge Star Wars fan and a fan of story driven RPGs in general.GAMEPLAY AND DESIGNIn terms of general gameplay and structure, KOTOR 2 is designed very similarly to the first game. It features the same turn-based D20 based combat system and character building as the first game and other old-school RPGs. This can be a quite daunting system to learn for those unfamiliar with these types of games, but fortunately the lower difficulty settings are forgiving enough for those without the patience or time to learn it. Combat is important, but arguably not as much as the stat and skill point distribution. Making sure you have characters with the appropriate skills determines being able to deal with obstacles in the world, conversation checks and crafting. The game does feature an automatic leveling up system which will do the leveling for you, which is fine in the late game after you have all the skills you need, but it may be worth doing some research in the early game for leveling up. The companions are all reasonably balanced and they level up with you, meaning that you can take anyone anywhere (at least from a gameplay perspective).The game isn’t entirely open world by any means. It’s similar to KOTOR and Dragon Age: Origins, in the sense that you travel between several fairly small focused areas rather than one continuous land mass. The areas are either mostly linear action packed levels or slower paced story driven quest hub areas. Crafting is important system to pay attention to as you can craft item modifications to create weapons more powerful than the ones you find. This is a fairly simple system that involves breaking down items you don’t need for materials, but it’s just a case of knowing what the stats actually mean. Of course, on lower difficulties you can get away with not paying much attention to gear and stats and still just about get by spamming the same attacks. You won’t find it very challenging, but more than adequate for just seeing the story (which in my opinion, is the main draw of the game).STORY AND NARRATIVEIt’s never easy to develop a follow up on such a beloved game from a different developer, but Obsidian certainly delivered on delivering a sequel that is true to the original and yet unique in its own way. KOTORs story felt very much like a grand space adventure and it captured everything that the classic Star Wars story should be. KOTOR 2 differs from this slightly. It tells a more subtle story with a focus on different themes. In stark contrast to KOTORs overt villains, KOTOR 2s threat is a lot more sinister. The battles with the Sith are fought in the shadows and the themes are a lot darker. An example of the darker tone is a reoccurring idea in the game that to the galaxy’s Average Joe, Jedi and Sith are indistinguishable. They just people with too much power fighting over religion and getting everyone else caught in the middle. This is a really unique and interesting idea and caught me completely off guard. Another good theme was the idea of the absence of the Force and the advantages it has aside from the obvious disadvantages.The conversation system is identical to KOTOR, with the standard light and dark alignment options and the opportunities to use skills (if you have the stats) in certain special situations. In my opinion, morality is much more interesting in KOTOR 2 than in the first one. Picking light or dark and sticking to it not only changes the ending, but the entire game. It shifts your characters goals for the whole game and also effects the gameplay. Dark and light side powers become easier/harder (but not impossible) to do if you are the opposite morality and it can result in some rather large deviations on the story line during some quests. It also affects your companions and over time you can even begin to influence their morality (e.g. enlightenment vs corruption). Overall, I’d say the game changes enough to warrant multiple playthroughs with different morality choices. On the topic of companions, you can expect yet another colourful crew of heroes, villains, droids and miscreants. They are very varied from the original games selection, but just as interesting and unique. Gameplay wise, they still have classes that need to have their stats properly assigned and equipped with the right gear. However, pretty much any configuration of companions is viable to take anywhere, which is good for the story. It makes it feel like you travel with ALL of your companions rather than just bringing your favourites and leaving everyone else on the ship. Your actions also influence your companions, resulting in them liking or disliking you more depending on how you act. Having them like you opens up more story and has gameplay benefits I can’t elaborate on without light spoilers. A quick note on voice acting: personally I found a particular companions voice actor laughably bad (look out for the one-armed Iridonian), but he’s really the only one that stands out. The rest of the game is mostly either passable or excellent.GAMEPLAY AND PERFORMANCEAs is customary with Obsidian games, they are often not given enough time for playtesting and optimisation leaving them somewhat lacking in the performance department. I expect you won’t encounter many problems these days however, as unsurprisingly an 11 year old game runs at 60fps 100% of time and doesn’t look half bad for its age. I did get a crash or two here and there and more than a fair share of bugs, but fortunately nothing game breaking or huge. I didn’t run into any compatibility problems either (running Windows 8.1). Funnily enough, the game actually got a patch recently that fixed a lot of problems, added controller support, support for higher resolutions and some other fixes. The biggest change was the addition was the addition of Steam Workshop for the game, which allows the seamless installation of some mods that restores a whole bunch of content that was cut from the game. Look up The Sith Lords Restored Content mod if you get the game, but it should be the highest rated anyway.			"

												Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2 is a game that I highly recommend playing with its restored content mod: http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcmWhen KoTOR 2 was first released it was rushed by the publisher and then criticized into the ground over missing content. However the developers over at Obsidian were kind enough to release the source material that was cut from the game to the modding community. Over the years the dedicated KoTOR fans were able to fully restore the game to its complete glory. DO NOT PLAY KoTOR 2 without this free and essential mod. With that said, the game is amazing. It really is just as good, if not better then the original Knights of the Old Republic. Any self respecting Star Wars fan needs to play this game.Final Verdict: (5 out of 5)			"

												- I don't know who you are. But, you picked the wrong room to break into.- Yeah? Well, you picked the wrong room to die in.10/10 would break-in again.Apart from that, the recent support that Aspyr gave to this game, revitalized it to a point that it's truly amazing. Even more that it was before. Also, now Steam Workshop is available and the TSLRCM is as simple as just clicking in ""Subscribe"". For a true and beautiful experience with this game, it's highly recommended to download it.This is the game (Counting the first one too, of course) that every true Star Wars fan needs to play.			"

												With the Sith Lords Restored Content Mod in hand, this game becomes more complete than the original ever was. The original game was released far to early, even after Obsidian was promised an extra half year they were forced by LucasArts to ship the game before eveything was properly put into the game. However, most of this content was still left in the code. Brilliantly all the dialogue, cutscenes, levels and interactions that never made it further than code were debugged and added into the game with TSLRCM adding hours upon hours of new content.The dialogue choices will make your mouth water. The difference between Bioware and Obsidian dialogue philosophies is this: Bioware believes in the three choices, good, neutral and bad. Obsidian believes in letting you choose many shades of gray, some obvious evil choices but no obvious good; you decide who your character becomes. The depth within your choices really lets you make your character who you want her or him to be.The characters are incredible. Lines of dialouge are restored giving them so much depth. Your least favorite character within the game might have dozens of new lines restored making him or her your favorite. The crappy romance options have been restored, fleshed out. Obsidian really shows their strong character writing within this game, each character is intresting, and they all have secrets to tell you... so long as you dedicate yourself to talking with them and earning their favor. As you make choices they will approve of you more or less, so be careful for everything has concequences.The combat is the same as it always is. The addition to lightsaber styles and tweaks makes the game more enjoyable than the first, but that is to be expected.But be warned: this game is kind of hard to get running on Windows Vista/7/8. Really the only flaw of the game is that its one of the few that doesnt run on modern versions of windows all that well. If you can get this game running I guarnete if you download the mod you'll enjoy this more than the first however.			"

												You know, this game catches a lot of flack in comparison to the first KOTOR, which is widely heralded as a masterpiece of gaming. Flack which is well deserved, yet easily rectified. The main quarrel most gamers hold to this particular game is that IT WASN'T RELEASED IN THE FULL AND COMPLETE FORM AND THAT THE STORY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. While there is some merit to this claim, you truly need to gaze deeper to fully understand this game. The game was fully intended to be just as perfect as its predecessor. However, Obsidian, the company in charge of the project was forced to play their hand before they were ready to release. The result was a patchwork project that can make a coherent game, and one that stands alone as one of my all time favorites. Was the game released in a complete form? Hell no. Can this be fixed? Now we're talking.You see, others feel the same way as I do about this game. It *is* an excellent game and all it needs is a bit of dedication and elbow grease to get it to shine. A determined group of modders recovered files that were scraped from the final release of the game and constructed a mod that fitted these files into the game. Lost items, recorded dialogue, and even an entire planet were restored and reborn through the crucible of modding. This mod is compatible with the Steam version of this game and I highly recommend you install it (http://deadlystream.com/forum/files/file/398-tslrcm-183/), as well as the sister mod which restores the droid planet M4-78 (http://deadlystream.com/forum/files/file/399-m4-78ep-patched/). Outside of these two mods, there are multiple others I recommend you try as they improve the overall game experience. The mods are now available through the Steam workshop, but I'll just leave these links here anyway.But about the game itself, unmodded, and purchased from Steam without the addition of a single modification. This game is spectacular. Don't let my measly hours of play depicted by Steam deceive you, I played this game extensively on the original X-Box when the game first came out and I still have the disk to this day (although, admittedly, it is a bit worse for the wear at this point). Despite the cries and whines of the gaming community, this game is entirely playable without the restoration of lost elements. It simply takes a bit of digging into the story. On the XBOX version and as a child, I was able to understand the entirety of the story of the game quite easily. You might have to play through multiple times and see each conversation from a different angle, but you can do it. It's not the jagged mess many make it out to be. Inferences and an active imagination may be required to fill the gaps, however. Get ready to think and make connections between different characters and events. Just use your noggin and you'll be fine. Here's where I believe the true root of the problem is: people approach this game thinking that it will be a fun little game they can just jaunt through casually and there will be an exciting adventure story to accompany it. Spoilers: it's not. This game is exponentially darker than the original KOTOR, heck, three of the planets you explore are inhabited only by corpses by the time you arrive. This game was intended to have you question your morals, in fact, there are some parts where no matter which choice you make, dark or light, you are doing something terrible. It was intended to bring to light that in a conflict, there is no middle ground to take, but rather, by doing nothing you hurt one side and allow the other to  gain a leg up and by doing something, no matter the action, the end result is the same. You are full of all the powers of the Force, and yet, you are powerless. And when you can finally change the outcomes of events, the freedom is glorious and all the more worthwhile. Well, that was the intent, anyway. Portions on missing, so patches of this beautiful quilt of morality are missing. But the game is still superb and well worth every hour I've logged. Go ahead, buy it, play with an open mind, mod it, and explore. And may the Force be with you.(This was a review that I wrote a while ago that I deleted and reposted so that more people could view it with ease.)			"

												I recently replayed KotOR 2 after roughly a decade's absence and thoroughly enjoyed my time with it. The game's message resonated with me in a way that it couldn't have back in my early teens, and I gained a new appreciation for the writing because of it. For a die hard Star Wars fan, such as myself, Kreia is a breath of fresh air in a universe that too often falls into the standard ""Good vs Evil"" dichotomy. Kreia provides a glimpse at the space in between the Dark and the Light and serves to inject the concept of existentialism into an otherwise faith-driven universe. If you're considering picking up KotOR 2, or going back to it after many years, the writing and characterisation is absoulutely the reason to do so.However, if that doesn't interest you, this may not be the game for you. Whilst KotOR 2's combat isn't by any means ""Bad,"" it isn't a particularly engaging system and can become quite tedious in places. This will become most obvious if you choose to play a buff-heavy style, with abilities having to be recast far too often in order to be maintained. The game also suffers from a number of difficulty spikes that come in the form of the occasional OP opponent. The most egregious problem that KotOR 2 suffers from combat-wise is, in my opinion, the sections that force you to play your companion characters. There are a significant amount of these sections and they will almost always make you feel incredibly underpowered, especially if you've just trained a companion in the ways of the force and they are lacking in Force Points/Abilities because of it.If you're still interested in trying the game, I HIGHLY recommend installing a mod called ""The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod"", or ""TSLRCM"" for short. This mod, as its name suggests, restores most of the content that was cut from the original release of the game, the most noticable re-addition being the HK Droid Factory, that contrains a wealth of funny cut dialogue, it was a joy to play through. TSLRCM also helps to alleviate the rushed feeling of the original game's ending, though large parts of this particular part of the game steel feel unfinished.All-in-all, KotOR 2 is an absolute classic, despite its faults, and I highly recommend it to fans of old-school Obsidian/Black Isle RPGs and, of course, to Star Wars fans. If you're a huge fan of both, like me, this game is a must play.			"

												Here's another incredibly long recommendation from me :DThis game isn't just one of my favorite games of all time - It's also one of the best RPGs I've played and also the first western RPG I've laid eyes on. Lastly, I find it to be much, much, much, muuuch better than the original Knights of the Old Republic from BioWare. It takes the gameplay mechanics of its predecessor and improves upon them to a greater extent. There's no ridiculous level cap from the first game anymore either. Much more open freedom to build your character with the introduction of the Advanced Classes. Lastly, the writing, story and characters are well-rounded and not drenched up in clichés like the first game. Knights of the Old Republic 2 throws the whole Light vs Dark concept into a bin and then dump it on the dark side of the moon. In retrospect - The game basically views the Jedi & Sith from a broader perspective and then concludes ""Hey, maybe they aren't so different after all"". They both wear morning gowns for a living and carry wide coloured willie exstented swords as a means of defense or offense. Essentially, there is no good or evil in this game, just various shades of grey. This philosophy is something one would find in the game's characters, especially the enigmatic woman, Kreia. Most of the characters are incredibly complex, even the Han Solo-esque ones have a dark secret hiding in the closet. There's no suave, secret, paragon of the universe response that will unlock their hidden feelings and open up to you. There's an interesting approval system, which I do consider a bit flawed but in terms of role-playing, it works. Once you've finally gotten to the heart of their character you'll unlock new abilities for the said characters. The best part: Even when you've gotten that far it still feels like you don't quite know everything there is to know about these characters. I think it is best if I sum up the plot now -- The game takes place a few years after the events of the first game. In classic Star Wars tradition, the Republic is on the verge of collapse alongside the Jedi... AGAIN. There are some tropes that Star Wars can never truly escape from I suppose. You play as an exiled Jedi... Knight? Master? Janitor? Whatever, the game is kinda vague about your previous ranking within the order - You've just returned to the known galaxy and thus missed out on the party of the first game -- I suppose this makes sense given that Star Wars doesn't seem to be restricted to one galaxy, but how the Exile have managed to NOT hear about the whole escapade in the first game is beyond me.. Guess she spent her time in a cave or a remote planet or something, ala Ben Kenobi. For some reason you find yourself onboard the ship of the Ebon Hawke, which people who've played the first game will recognize, and it has been badly damaged, explains a questionably-soothingly-female-voiced-sentient-AI as the tutorial begins. You have the option of skipping this tutorial but it's probably best not to do it since it'll give you a better idea of what is going on and foreshadow danger to come. Not too long after your Exiled Jedi wakes up from her/his comatose sleep onboard an eerie space mining facility called Peragus. The whole place is mysteriously abandoned, and one of the only survivors seems to be an old woman named, Kreia. Like I mentioned she's an enigma and she seems to know a lot about you and the Force, so the next course of action is to figure out what has happened and get off the station. That pretty much sums up the beginning. One of the other things I find that Kotor 2 does exceptionally well is that it allows the player to get easily integrated with the character of the Exile, despite her having an established background -- The well structured dialogue assignment paves way for role-playing a character who doesn't have a clue, as well as someone who's already familiar with the events of the first game. In addition to that - There's also the subtle choice of gender for the previous protagonist and selected occurences of the first game, without the use of an import system, in conversation with one of the characters. A smart way to build to connect both stories together as there'll be plenty of references.  So, I've talked a bit about what to expect from the characters, the story and gameplay -- Now I'd like to sum up some of the central themes. The game doesn't present itself as the ""Save the world from the ancient evil"" type of story. Instead, it sets itself up more as a personal story, about your protagonist and your followers. Every time you exit and enter your ship you'll usually find the party bantering with each other, alluding to a dark secret they are hiding or what have you. This is also brought to light in some of the story cutscenes, where Kreia will downright intimidate your crew by exposing their darkest secrets and have it consume them... Why? Because of The Exile. The Exile is unlike any Jedi or Sith and not because she drew the shortest stick, but because she did something in her past that none other could have done. Something that litterally draws the followers and Kreia alike, to the Exile, but one would have to play the game to understand. Most of the story is a lesson to the protagonist, and the player -- About the ideas of morality, and how being a nice & benevolent saint might not always be the right thing to do; Least of all being cruel and despicable. Relying heavily on the Force is brought up as a sign of weakness, and that true strength comes from not needing it. All of this is dictated through the enemies you fight, the choices you make, the characters you meet and certainly through the character of Kreia. It'sKOTOR 2 is a story of self-realization, different shades of morality, confronting the past and learning from past mistakes to face the future. Knights of the Old Republic 2 gets a strong recommendation from me, simply for being unlike any other Star Wars game and with the Restoration Mod -- A much better game than BioWare's original Knights of the Old Republic! :)			"

												Let me tell you a story.I installed the restored content mod, booted up the game, made a Consular and went into the options to crank up the difficulty to the max before I started. I consider myself pretty good at games built off Bioware systems, and I played KOTOR I on the hardest difficulty without issue.Fine, all was dandy. Played the game going full sith. Corrupted all my companions, which was a very memorable experience. Downloaded it on my laptop and kept playing from there. The first 35 hours of the game was absolutely amazing, and I was rejoicing in my EEVIL.However, around the 30 hour point I noticed how easy the game seemed to be getting. Being the stereotypical arrogant gamer, I thought that was down to my epic skills and great build. I got lazy, thought the game was so easy, I only bothered to level up 3 characters, and the others were left in the dirt.How wrong I was.See, the first 35 hours or so are epic, but the ending of the game is unfinished. There are a lot of endless rooms with the same trash mobs. The restored content mod is a mixed blessing, because it brings back a lot of extra levels which feel very empty, as the devs only half-finished them and didn't put them in the game. By the 50 hour point, I was getting fed up. Just wanted it to be over.Then came the HK factory. Oh boy. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ HK factory is one of the half-finished levels put in by the restored content mod. It's in the ending sequence, so you can't back out once you've got there without losing hours of progress. Would usually be fine, but it turns out the HK factory is a solo mission. A solo mission for one of the characters I'd never bought gear for or levelled up. So I was stuck there. With a character with default starting armor, no weapons and no accessories. He has level 3 stuff, against endless level 23 trash mobs of EXACTLY the same enemy. Let me get this straight, there are at least 100 enemy droids in the HK factory. Every single one of them was capable of oneshotting my character. He did like 10 damage to their health pools of 200+ HP with every shot. Whatever, I thought, I'll turn down the dificulty.To my horror, when I opened up the options menu, I realised that when I transferred the game over to my laptop the difficulty settings had not transferred. I'd been playing the entire game on easy. This was as easy as it got. Oneshots and 10 damage per shot. It seemed impossible.At this point, usually I would just laugh at myself and watch a let's play of the game's end. But for some reason I was determined to finish this game. It played me! I would get my revenge at any cost!So I scraped together all the health potions I had and RAN through the HK factory level. If I got hit more than once, I'd have to start over again. It was absolute agony. I died so many times, as many rooms had 5+ enemies which could jump me at once. So I had to learn, gradually, the exact patterns I could run so that I could avoid taking the damage. It was the most pathetic I've felt playing a game. It took quite a few hours, and I was so close to giving up. But in the end, I did it. I suffered, but I did it. Upped and ran past every single enemy in that large level. And after doing that, I felt more satisfaction that I can ever remember feeling from playing a game - even after defeating Dark Souls bosses or something like that. I was rewarded by the game's real ending sequence (which is awesome).I felt a warm glow of pride from being able to successfully run away from trash mobs on easy difficulty. 10/10 game is an emotional rollercoaster, would recommend the suffering to anyone.

												I think that Star Wars Knights of the old Republic II is an awesome experience and a must if you enjoyed the first game or Bioware games in general. Obsidian released it a little sloppy and missing lots of content, but the majority of cut content can be restored and bugs fixed with 'The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod' (TSLRCM); an aftermarket add-on developed to bring this game up to speed.*Highly recommended, but only with TSLRCM.

												TL;DR: The ambitious and messy sequel to Knights of the Old Republic. Darker than the first game, some very good writing, expect to encounter uneven pacing and bugs. Lots of bugs.Long Version: Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2 is role-playing game where you take on the role of one of the few Jedi left alive after an event that takes place after the end of the first game. Your main character has a choice between three starting classes, Guardian (strong combat class), Consular (strong force-user) and Sentinel (balance between combat and use of the force, emphasis on skills). You have an option to take up a secondary class later on in the game. Throughout the game, you acquire companions, you can have up to two assisting you, while the rest remain at base. Manage your character and follower's levelling up and inventory. Combat is real-time with pause, which means you can pause in the middle of a fight to issue orders. If you unfamiliar with the first game, Dragon Age: Origins would be the closest game to compare this to. Also includes a very basic crafting system, and two optional minigames (a cardgame and a racing game). Familiarity with the plot of the previous game is not required, but in my opinion, highly reccomended as the lore dump might be overwhelming. The game does a very good job at establishing for the first few hours that your ex-Jedi is being hunted by an unknown enemy, vulnerable without your lightsaber and cut off from the rest of the Order. Your connection to the Force weakend, and you are slowing re-establishing connection to it. The starting area is an apparently abandoned mining facility called Peragus. You will pick up the basics of the game in this area. Players already who have already beaten the first game, or replaying KOTOR 2, will find the starting area slow and annoying. It does not need to take more than 30-45 minutes to complete, but it does feel much longer and drawn out. Fortunatly there is a mod that allows you to skip this part.The game picks up the pace when you visit the next area, where you finally get to make interesting plot choices. I would say your choices are more meaningful than in KOTOR. You are railroaded for a bit longer, after which you are presented with a choice of four hubs on four seperate planets to complete in any order you choose. The pacing and content of the four planets vary an lot. Two of the planets (Onderon and Nar Shaddaa) feel much more fully fleshed out and with a great deal of content, with the other two feeling there was content cut from the game (Dantoonie and Korriban). The same could be said for your companions, some being more fleshed out than others. The mood of the game is dark, very dark for a Star Wars game. The Jedi Order destroyed, Republic recovering from a series of devestating conflicts, shades of grey in decisions you are forced to make, and your companions include some very unsavory characters (including a former torturer for the Sith, bounty hunter, and an insane mass murdering Wookie). The Sith are given an lot more dimension in this game, they have their say in this game, and aren't neccessarily cartoon villians as portrayed in other SW games. Playing as a Jedi going down the Dark Side need not have force you to play an unsympathetic psychopath totally lacking in subtlety. Plot may be harder to follow than in the previous game, you may feel slightly at loss around the 75% mark, but I personally felt it was very rewarding to pay attention to it.The version of this game on Steam includes Workshop modding support, some graphical enchancements, support for higher resolutions, controllers and wide-screen. As of now, these enchancements haven't made their way to the first Knights of the Old Republic game. The game is still very much buggy however: enemies shooting through walls, characters getting stuck in areas, and dialogue sometimes automatically skipped. Smart players will keep multiple saves, incase a bug prevents the completion of certain missions. Game engine still runs like ♥♥♥♥, even on modern hardware, I have a GTX 680 and game sometimes drops to the low 20 FPS.Note there is a mod in the Steam Workshop called ""The Sith Lords Restored Content"", which does what it says on the tin, restores much of the missing content. It adds two larger areas missing from the base game, plus a few lines and missions. It is worth trying out, just the once however. You will quickly notice what parts of the game ended up on the cutting room floor, and realise why they were cut. M4-78, a droid planet, involves an lot of back-tracking and couriering messages between NPCs. Buggy, does not add anything to the story, unnecessarily large areas, and introduces some questionable fan voice acting to fill in the lines that were never recorded for the game. The other, a manufacturing plant for assassin droids, is tighter and contains lots of funny dark humour. But like M4-78, it did not add anything to the plot, and it gets tedious very quickly with the many health-sponge enemies.My completed save took me around 45 hours to complete all the sidemissions, the restored content, and Light Side ending. The ending, by the way, also felt rushed and much less satisfying than the previous game. If you are used to RPGs like Dragon Age or Bauldurs Gate, this game may be on the too easy side for you. Turn up the difficulty and don't pick Jedi Guardian as your character class.In conclusion: The game feels very much like the ""Empire Strikes Back"" to KOTOR's ""A New Hope"". Darker, more intriguing, and complicated. Unfortunatly the vision the developers had for this game was never fully realised, absolutely brilliant in some places, felt like a missed opportunity in others. Very much a diamond in the rough.The Good: plot, characters, interesting choices to be made, a fleshed out and realised universe. The recent enchancements added to the game.The Bad: the ending, uneven pacing. Perhaps too easy for most RPG fans. The Ugly: bugs and poor performance.  Thank you for reading, please let me know in the comments if there's anything I should do to improve my reviews in the future!			"

												If ever there was a game that deserved to be judged fairly by history, this is probably it.Everyone interested in this game at all knows the story. KoToR 1 is undisputably one of the greatest games of a generation. The follow up had immense hype, development was going well, and then the publishers pushed it out the door unreasonably early.The result, and reaction, was predictible. A game that for all it did right could never quite measure up. I often referred to it as ""the best public beta ever"". That's something I stand by playing it now. Some people enjoyed it as a flawed masterpiece. Others derided the obvious lack of debugging. We all agreed the final chapter was obviously rushed and simply wasn't done. It was a shame, and it fell squarely on the publsher.Luckily, the game's community was kind. As was this re-release, with some mild enhancements, and Steam Workshop integration. That means there is literally no reason to have this on Steam and not be using the (fabled) Restored Content Mod, that undoes so many wrongs. One single press of a green subscribe button in the workshop undoes a foolish, greedy mistake. A truly great piece of work loaded with bugfixes, and finally seeing the game as it should have been from the beginning in 2005.And what a game it finally is. So many bugs gone, so many plot holes filled with the dialogue that was recorded but never programmed to trigger in the final release, a so much more complete experience. It's a massive, almost overwhelming game. Unlike most Star Wars, it isn't overly sugary sweet, the line between good and evil is rarely clear at points. It's got real depth. And it's an epic adventure for the ages.I love the KoToR games. I always did. Nobody in their right mind disliked the first game. And it really warms my heart to see that, even if it took me 10 years to see the final result, the second game turned out alright after all.			"

												This is one of those oldies but goodies. It does have a few problems like glitches, weird twiching, and skipping cutscenes. However, I feel the gameplay pays for the glitchiness. Plus the glitches are sometimes hilarious. This game is also extremely long. Compared to some of today's games, this is like a 5 game trilogy all in one package of fun. They don't make games like these anymore. This game is great and lasts ages. This game is really good for something that came out in 2005. This game has great text-tree conversations too. While you can't even compare this to Telltales' dialogs, it is certainly much cheaper and provides much more time to enjoy the game. You can finish Telltale's episodes within 30 minutes. After that you wait another month for the next episode. I would say money wise, this is one of the best things you can buy on Steam. These days an hour of gameplay costs $60. This game is relatively cheap and has replay ability. This is definetly a good game for new RPG players. Lots of RPGs are intense and difficult to understand. KOTR II is a great buy for anyone on Steam.			"

												A lot of people give this game a lot of crap, especially seeing that is is the sequal to the masterpiece that came before. There are some glaring issues with the normal version of the game, but that does not make it a bad game. At the end, it ties in quite nicely to KOTOR but there are some things missing from the game. The game seems unfinished at times. That can all be fixed by using the Restored Content Mod (found here http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcm ). This mod adds a tremendous amount to the game. Basically there was a bunch of unreleased stuff that wasn't finished in the game. The makers of this mod made the game more of what it was supposed to be. It really made this game what it is for me. It's a good game without the mod. It's a great game with it			"

This game. Buy it.If you have already bought it, pull it out of your pile of shame and play it already.+Story and dialogue are amazing. +It is still being updated years after release. They added achievements among other things.+Differences in light-side and dark-side playthroughs kept it fun for both.-A couple achievements didn't want to pop, but reloading and redoing it seemed to work. I save often.-Wished I could kill more exchange guards on telos. They quit posting them outside after you kill the fourth one.-Jeez. The lost Czerka twilek is annoying as hell on telos. If you are going light-side you of course want to help out, but the idiot can't seem to walk around random crates on your way to the entrance. Really made my dark jedi come out.9/10. Would force choke my companions again.			"

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II is one of the most underrated RPGs of all time while also being one of the greatest RPGs ever made. Hands down. This game has been plagued with an undeserved negative reputation all across the internet for reasons I can only assume must be both malicious and blatantly fraudulent.Heres my take on KOTOR2 and it's bad rep.1. MAJOR BUGS and GLITCHESI have never EVER suffered a single game killing bug playing KOTOR2 unlike what is said from everyone else which leads me to believe it's all either collective disinformation or people need to stop playing on Win95 PCs, I have beat it 12 times with no mods and twice with many mods on multiple different PCs with both Windows and Linux (WinXP, Win7, Win10, Ubuntu 12.04, Peppermint 4, Lubuntu 16.04) using the DVD version, the Steam version and even the original Xbox version on both the original Xbox and Xbox 360. No game crashes, no freezes, no game killing bugs of any kind, not once, ever. Either I am very lucky, people do not know what they are doing or the internet is full of ♥♥♥♥. I have had resolution issues in the past but that was because AMD drivers suck and because the game was simply not made in the era of HD but it has since been updated to accommodate this very issue amongst other minor things.2. THE ENDING WAS TERRIBLEThe ending was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cliffhanger, KOTOR 3 was already in the works to directly follow the game and got canceled. In other words, the story was not finished, it was to be continued on so in that the ending was actually really good in terms of what it was trying to accomplish which was, once again, a cliffhanger ending in preparation for a sequel that no one at the time knew would never happen. This is also perfectly in line with the Star Wars franchise, In ""A New Hope"" it had a cheesy dumb ending (like in KOTOR1) and in ""Empire Strikes Back"" it had a cliffhanger, a fairly dark cliffhanger (like in KOTOR2) in preparation for ""Return of the Jedi"" so imagine if Star Wars Episode 6 never happened and you were just left with the first two films and a cliffhanger ending of the second... Thats what it's like and people would call you dumb if you said ""Empire Strikes Back sucks because the ending was just so gosh darn terrible!"" If those people knew the facts behind the ending and why it never got explained, they'd call you and idiot and they'd be right.3. KOTOR1 WAS BETTERIn what way? Story? Gameplay? Quality? To my mind it depends on what you want. Kotor1 was very basic, very to the point but yes was well written, well acted and overall well made. No question. BUT what did it lack? - Depth in both story and character development. - It, like all of Star Wars, had a very black and white view of good and evil both visually and in the ways it told the story. - The gameplay had less game mechanics than Kotor2.- The game had far less dialogue options than Kotor2. - It had far less options in terms of how one completes a mission, granted not too much less... to be fair. - Kotor1 in no real way branched off from the rest of the Star Wars universe in any way that would separate it from the rest of the franchise.. In other words, unlike Kotor2, it never questions the philosophical foundations of Star Wars and thus neatly fits within the Star Wars motif, some people may actually see that as a good thing... Whatever floats your Death Star.- Kotor1 has a giant evil military machine floating in space. Kinda getting tired of giant Sith machines.- Kotor1 contains too many damn Star Map dreams.- In Kotor1 your choices do not directly affect your teammates except when you choose the dark side and only near the end of the game.- Kotor2 actually tells you when ♥♥♥♥ is ♥♥♥♥ing empty.- Kotor2 allows you to build/upgrade far more items.- Kotor1's story was NOT written by Chris Avellone.I'm sure I could go on but these are just a few things that Kotor1 doesn't have that Kotor2 did that made it far more interesting, immersive and fun.MY RATING...9/10MY SPECS...Intel i5 446016GB of RAMGTX 980TiWindows 7/Lubuntu 16.04			"

												TLDR VERDICTKOTOR 2 is a very worthy successor to the high bar set by the original game. They kept the general gameplay and presentation true the original and put their own unique spin on the story. Many people argue it is actually a superior game to the original. Overall, a rough, buggy and now dated, but still very entertaining game well worth the asking price if you’re a fan of the original or fan of Star Wars in general.MUST HAVE MOD IS

MOD REVIEW BENEATH FULL GAME REVIEWFULL REVIEW BELOW*MOST OF MY HOURS ARE OFFLINE DUE TO INTERNET RESTRICTIONS WHERE I LIVE*“Take the greatest Jedi Knight, strip away the Force, and what remains? They rely on it, depend on it, more than they know. Watch as one tries to hold a blaster, as they try to hold a lightsaber, and you will see nothing more than a woman – or a man. A child.” - KreiaFive years after the events of KOTOR, the galaxy is recovering from the events from the Jedi Civil War. Both the Jedi and Sith have now fallen silent. You have been exiled from the Jedi Order as punishment for following Revan into war against the Mandolorians. You have also been completely cut off from the Force, but was this a part of your punishment, or the result of something much worse?This review is written from a huge Star Wars fan and a fan of story driven RPGs in general.GAMEPLAY AND DESIGNIn terms of general gameplay and structure, KOTOR 2 is designed very similarly to the first game. It features the same turn-based D20 based combat system and character building as the first game and other old-school RPGs. This can be a quite daunting system to learn for those unfamiliar with these types of games, but fortunately the lower difficulty settings are forgiving enough for those without the patience or time to learn it. Combat is important, but arguably not as much as the stat and skill point distribution. Making sure you have characters with the appropriate skills determines being able to deal with obstacles in the world, conversation checks and crafting. The game does feature an automatic leveling up system which will do the leveling for you, which is fine in the late game after you have all the skills you need, but it may be worth doing some research in the early game for leveling up. The companions are all reasonably balanced and they level up with you, meaning that you can take anyone anywhere (at least from a gameplay perspective).The game isn’t entirely open world by any means. It’s similar to KOTOR and Dragon Age: Origins, in the sense that you travel between several fairly small focused areas rather than one continuous land mass. The areas are either mostly linear action packed levels or slower paced story driven quest hub areas. Crafting is important system to pay attention to as you can craft item modifications to create weapons more powerful than the ones you find. This is a fairly simple system that involves breaking down items you don’t need for materials, but it’s just a case of knowing what the stats actually mean. Of course, on lower difficulties you can get away with not paying much attention to gear and stats and still just about get by spamming the same attacks. You won’t find it very challenging, but more than adequate for just seeing the story (which in my opinion, is the main draw of the game).STORY AND NARRATIVEIt’s never easy to develop a follow up on such a beloved game from a different developer, but Obsidian certainly delivered on delivering a sequel that is true to the original and yet unique in its own way. KOTORs story felt very much like a grand space adventure and it captured everything that the classic Star Wars story should be. KOTOR 2 differs from this slightly. It tells a more subtle story with a focus on different themes. In stark contrast to KOTORs overt villains, KOTOR 2s threat is a lot more sinister. The battles with the Sith are fought in the shadows and the themes are a lot darker. An example of the darker tone is a reoccurring idea in the game that to the galaxy’s Average Joe, Jedi and Sith are indistinguishable. They just people with too much power fighting over religion and getting everyone else caught in the middle. This is a really unique and interesting idea and caught me completely off guard. Another good theme was the idea of the absence of the Force and the advantages it has aside from the obvious disadvantages.The conversation system is identical to KOTOR, with the standard light and dark alignment options and the opportunities to use skills (if you have the stats) in certain special situations. In my opinion, morality is much more interesting in KOTOR 2 than in the first one. Picking light or dark and sticking to it not only changes the ending, but the entire game. It shifts your characters goals for the whole game and also effects the gameplay. Dark and light side powers become easier/harder (but not impossible) to do if you are the opposite morality and it can result in some rather large deviations on the story line during some quests. It also affects your companions and over time you can even begin to influence their morality (e.g. enlightenment vs corruption). Overall, I’d say the game changes enough to warrant multiple playthroughs with different morality choices. On the topic of companions, you can expect yet another colourful crew of heroes, villains, droids and miscreants. They are very varied from the original games selection, but just as interesting and unique. Gameplay wise, they still have classes that need to have their stats properly assigned and equipped with the right gear. However, pretty much any configuration of companions is viable to take anywhere, which is good for the story. It makes it feel like you travel with ALL of your companions rather than just bringing your favourites and leaving everyone else on the ship. Your actions also influence your companions, resulting in them liking or disliking you more depending on how you act. Having them like you opens up more story and has gameplay benefits I can’t elaborate on without light spoilers. A quick note on voice acting: personally I found a particular companions voice actor laughably bad (look out for the one-armed Iridonian), but he’s really the only one that stands out. The rest of the game is mostly either passable or excellent.GAMEPLAY AND PERFORMANCEAs is customary with Obsidian games, they are often not given enough time for playtesting and optimisation leaving them somewhat lacking in the performance department. I expect you won’t encounter many problems these days however, as unsurprisingly an 11 year old game runs at 60fps 100% of time and doesn’t look half bad for its age. I did get a crash or two here and there and more than a fair share of bugs, but fortunately nothing game breaking or huge. I didn’t run into any compatibility problems either (running Windows 7). Funnily enough, the game actually got a patch recently that fixed a lot of problems, added controller support, support for higher resolutions and some other fixes. The biggest change was the addition was the addition of Steam Workshop for the game, which allows the seamless installation of some mods that restores a whole bunch of content that was cut from the game. Look up The Sith Lords Restored Content mod if you get the game, but it should be the highest rated anyway.TSLRCM REVIEWTSLRCM fixes many bugs, quests and all round genral nuisances that affect the game. It adds (restores) lost cutscenes that give better reasons and fixes endings to give a more full conclusion.It completes the game. I personally would reccomend palying the without the mod (or any mods infact) to fully taste the (lacking) game but then when re-playing it would change your experiance greatly.			"

												I don't write reviews on Steam often. This game is one of my exceptions. KOTOR II may also be my favorite Star Wars story. The movies are great, so is KOTOR I, and I highly recommend them as well, however KOTOR II is very much the Dostoevsky to their Stephen King, forgive the dorky literary analog. One is entertaining, whereas the other makes you think. KOTOR II is, on the surface, a rather standard RPG. You're railroaded from point A to B through various locales, picking up side quests, and trying to beat the Big Bad. Standard ♥♥♥♥ honestly. Where the game excels is in how this is presented. Rather than the standard adventure approach we are so used to, KOTOR II instead takes the chance to tell a dark, ambiguous, and complex tale exploring betrayal, anger, hope, apathy, revenge, the nature of good and evil, the nature of the Force, the complexity of human emotions, relationships, loss, and most importantly, finding out who you are. This is not in the sense we explore in KOTOR I, for those of you who've played it. This is not the tale of an amnesiac, it is the tale of a broken man/woman who has been repeatedly betrayed by everyone, and everything they've trusted. It's the tale of someone trying to find meaning for themselves in a world that has repeatedly stolen meaning from them. Even as you make the choices for your Jedi, man or woman, good or evil, Consular or Sentinel, it all ingeniously boils down to who this character is. You can help define them, but unlike the MC of KOTOR I, the history truly means something more than an interesting twist, or a way to move along plot. It starkly defines all that you do, from beginning to end in ways that require you to question every action you make. This might be one of few games out there, where being the good guy can still make you feel like ♥♥♥♥ by the end of the game. As the game so splendidly relates, all that you do has an effect, both seen and unseen, and how neither extreme, light or dark, can be wholly considered right or wrong. Even after all of that I'm nowhere near describing the amazing characters, quest-lines, quotes, philosophical dialogue, and beautiful moody/dark feeling of looming doom, and ambiguity that is summoned by the central plot of this game. Just go out and buy the damn game! It's awesome, and if you're tired of the same old copy and paste characters, and horrendous or uninspired dialogue that saturates most RPG's, look no further. The game is a masterpiece! As a quick side note, get the TSLRCM mod, the base game is good, but sadly Obsidian, as is often the case with them, had a tight deadline, and couldn't make the game as bug free, nor as filled with content as they intended. The mod adds a lot of cut content, including a new planet (It isn't huge, or filled with tons more quests, so don't get too excited.), fixes several game breaking, or quest breaking bugs, and generally just irons out a lot of issues the initial release had.

												This series of Star Wars video games is my personal favorite, Knights of the old republic is by far the best Star Wars game available for single player, I only wish their newest game for Knights of The Old Republic included a single player mode like this one.I loved playing these when I was younger and still do.Their uniqueness of character paths has really made this game one of the best. Like their newest release, you can make your character have their own path, their own abilities, and followers. I strongly recommend this game to people who would enjoy a fun action-packed single player game with various ways and paths to complete it. "

												Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis ""the wise""? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.			"

												Let's get this out of the way: KOTOR2 is not KOTOR1. I loved KOTOR1.  It was the first real PC RPG that I was going to bite into as a kid, despite having toyed with Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale when they were the 'hot things' to hit the market.  From the first to the fourth disc, I was playing out some of the best scenarios I was convinced could ever have existed in a video game; it certainly helped that it was all being played out in the Star Wars universe, which, to any bright-eyed kid who loved the original trilogy, was something to behold. And then came KOTOR2.  As a bit of a set-up: I never had the chance to play KOTOR2 when it was originally released, but I was there to watch the bile and distaste that most gamers had for it.  Reviews from users on a variety of other gaming sites came in, deriding the story and claiming that it was a vastly inferior title compared to the stellar original.  It was incomplete, people had said: the story was unfinished, and for the most part, the game felt empty and had a plot unfitting for the Star Wars universe. Then comes 2014, where I finally had the time to do a bit more reading on the game, including the (now famous) content restoration mod.  I bought the game on sale, installed the mod, fired it up - - and was hooked for the next 30 something hours that I had it installed and played.  I loved the game so much, that it promptly was installed on my laptop, just so I could get a few hours in on the go during downtime.  It was fantastic. KOTOR2, for those unfamiliar and reading this review in hoping to tip the scales, is a Star Wars game, yes.  It takes place in the Star Wars universe.  It involves jedi, lightsabres, starships, the Sith, light versus darkness - except, not really, particularly the last bit.  You see, head writer Chris Avellone never really liked the Star Wars universe - or, parts of it's mythos, anyway.  The Light and Dark sides seemed too binary, too hilariously Machiavellan at turns to really allow him to write the stories he has become so well known for among PC RPG fans (Planescape: Torment being the elephant - or perhaps well-endowed titan - in the room).  He wanted to shake things up, narratively speaking, and it shows: the game is not so simply about the light versus the dark (as, arguably, the original trilogy of films and the first KOTOR are steadfast about), but instead, how such concepts do not work when we apply the idea of secondary belief to the universe at large.  (For some more insight into Avellone's thoughts on the universe, I suggest looking up Super Bunnyhop's interview with the man himself on YouTube).  The game features you as the Jedi Exile - a wounded warrior who had returned from the Mandalorian Wars to the Jedi Council, only to be banished (for reasons unknown) and to have their powers stripped from them.  As you awaken on a mining facility, with a case of amnesia and tremendously weakened from the ordeal, you come to realize that something is wrong with the force, and the Sith, no less, are behind it.  You set out on an adventure with a series of unlikely companions to determine just what happened to you, and what this new face of Sith appear to be up to.  The companions, a highlight of any BioWare style RPG, but particularly for Obsidian (the designers at the helm, here), feature some fantastic heroes.  Some cliches remain, to ensure you're playing in a game set within the universe you signed up for, of course: there's still the charming rogue who represents the Han Solo of the title, the sassy bounty hunter, the wise and mysterious Jedi Master.  But it's not the same.  Something feels 'off', in the most magnificent way possible as you spend time speaking with these characters.  They're thematically similar, yes, but the way they express and espouse their discomfort with the status quo of the Force and the Universe makes you realize how real humans living in the far corners of the galaxy might actually feel about how things work when you're facing space wizards and death-bent cultists.  It doesn't stop at the companions.  KOTOR1 had the bad habit of setting up encounters across its planets in a very blase pattern.  Find planet - fight through corridors - find friendly race - handle problems.  Oh, it's very high adventure and there are several key notes within the campaign.  But that's how it feels and how it ultimately handles for much of it.  KOTOR2 shines in this regard - at least, it does for a limited time, but we'll talk about that later.  One of the largest planets in the game has you splitting up your party, facing enemies alone as your companions in what seems like impossible odds, encountering foes in what you thought were the safest regions of the map, and having traps and battles sprung on you when you honestly least expected it.  There were several times where I found myself popping tinctures and med pacs just to stay alive, staving off death and improving party members in thoughtful ways to defend against some truly interesting scenarios.  But then we have the common problem - and the one that you will probably continue to see across all of the reviews that are written here - is that the game is unfinished.  There are far too many elements of it that are clearly missing, stripped down, or otherwise incomplete that make it lesser than the game it starts off (and is, in the perfect world, ideally meant to be).  Those creative scenarios?  They really only happen on one planet (Nar-Shaddah - and, take note, new players: head there first, if you can.)  Companions suddenly 'disappear' from the final encounter with no explanation as to why they are not with you.  Some character history lines seem to just drop dead.  As the game runs out of steam, the following planets ultimately feel a bit one-note and flat (and veer too close to KOTOR1's rather vanilla campaign).  The ending seems to have written itself in a corner and provides too little closure for what the game seems to be setting you up for.  What begins and ends with a bang, closes with a whimper.  Does that mean that KOTOR2 is a game not worth your time or money?  Of course not.  If you've ever enjoyed Avellone's writing, then it still comes through strong in this title, butchered and shortened as it is.  The characters are interesting and foster genuine curiosity about the world the Old Republic represents.  There are still some genius set encounters, particularly in the early and late game, that challenge what it means to have quests and how to experience a story in a western RPG.  The only problem is, when all is said and done, when you've put in your 30-something hours and you see the final cutscene, you leave with that bitter and sour taste as your final realization is this: What an RPG this truly could have been.

THIS IS A GAME THAT ANY STAR WARS--OR RPG FAN SHOULD PLAY (TL;DR at bottom.) I wasn't sure I'd like it, to be honest. I got it over a year ago because I was almost done with my first playthrough of the first KOTOR game. But as I continued to delve deeper and deeper into the plot, I realized that this game may just be better than the original--I know, sue me; it's just so good. So what made this buggy, old, rushed game so good? Graphics: 13/20; (per 2004, 18/20 on high settings): The engine from the first game was still relatively nice looking at this point, but I can definately tell the difference between the two games. By today's standards, the graphics kinda suck, although they aren't too distracting, becuase it isn't the focus of the game. Gameplay: 19/20: Okay, now when I started this game, I detested the gameplay; it was one of the reasons that I didn't complete it for over a year after buying it. It's hard to get used to, but once you do, it's quite endearing. Second playthrough, still loving the gameplay. Again, though, not the focus of this game. Sound: 20/20: Like literally some of the best voice acting I've ever heard; even after 35 hours, I was not tired of the voices. Music was good, too (Star Wars, you know), but my recommendation is that you turn it down, becuase it's kind of overpowering if you don't personally set it. Story: 20/20 (Considering giving it 21/20): Now... now, young padawans... let me tell you that this is the Creme de la Creme of all games I've ever played, save maybe TLoU or TWDS1. This story--side quests and main quests--is amazing. It makes the entire star wars saga look like it was designed by a child. This dark, sinister story... I could go on and on, but instead I'll give you the gist of it. The theme of the first game was redemption and being true to one's self. This game is about betrayal and loss. I can't go on without revealing too much; I just can't say enough to do it justice, either. I've never been so obsessed with a game. I couldn't stop playing. Sadly, Finals were the next week, so I had to stop playing. Seriously: get this game just for this. Lasting appeal(Characters and world): 20/20: The characters are what make the story; the world is what makes the characters--domino effect. If it weren't for these characters, their dedicated roles of voice acting, and the expanded universe of Star wars being explored, this game wouldn't be as good; it would still be good, but not as good. Since this is a star wars game, most players don't need too much explaining to understand (""Jedi, sith, What are those?"") if they've played the first game, so the story is the main focus. Cons: Bugs... lots of bugs; more bugs in this game than in a Vegan Naturalist's hair. But it's worth it; the bugs can be endearing, most of the time they're just plain annoying. If you can get over bugs, this game is worth it; just get to know your computer and remember that most of the time, just an alt+tab will fix it; if not, try reloading your last save; if the game freezes, you'll need the ctrl+alt+del. Only significant complaints. (P.S. I used the Restored Content Mod, so probably most of my issues came from mods, but if not, try these things.) TL;DR Graphics: 13/20 (2004: 18/20); Gameplay: 19/20; Sound: 20/20; Story: 20/20; Lasting Appeal (Characters and world setting): 20/20. Lots of bugs, but amazing game underneath all the issues. OVERALL: 97/100 Spectacular. Seriously... Great game. Get it. RPG or star Wars fan, don't miss this. Get the first one, as well, even though I don't think it's as good.			"

												The best RPG I have played in my life. I recommend having TSLRCM (It's in the steam workshop) installed from the start, it adds back lots of great content that was cut from the game during development. I personally find this one far superior to the first game, the difficulty is more balanced (doesn't mean that you can't cheese your way through though), the dark turn this game took is definitely more interesting, characters are a lot better written in my opinion. The ending isn't as bad as people make it out to be either. This is less of a review than a recommendation to buy this game right freaking now.			"

												The original KOTOR 2 was & still is a buggy experience. However it all changes with the TSLRCM mod which fixes a lot of issues & restores much of the cut content from the original. While KOTOR 1 started as a nobody who'd eventually become a jedi/sith... KOTOR 2 actually lets you start & play as a force user from the beginning.  However the end question is is it worth it?? The answer is YES.Buy the game... download the TSLRCM mod from the workshop & enjoy a great rpg that's totally worth your time & money. "

												A timeless game that makes you feel like you are a jedi or sith! I played the original Knights of the old republic back in 2003 and absolutely loved it...then I played the sequel and also loved it, though I didn't  dedicate myself as much as I had to the first one! Now I have rectified that mistake. KOTOR 2 is a wonderful game even for todays standards of 2014. I have spent 34 hours completing it and savoured every second. I believe these games transport you to a sweeter Star Wars universe than the one you see in all those movies. 5*.			"

KotOR II: The Sith Lords is best played with TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod). If you don't have it for this game, get it. Most mods you will ever download for this game depend on that mod to function correctly.

Trust me, without TSLRCM the story isn't gonna make much sense, if at all.Alright, let me start off by saying KOTOR II: The Sith Lords is an absolutely incredible *addicting* game - even better with TSLRCM. As much as I enjoyed the first KotOR (and I really enjoyed that game) I enjoyed this game even more.Anyways here is my breakdown of the game:PROS+ Includes 57 Steam Achievements+ Each time you play through the game you may discover/learn something you didn't in the previous playthrough+ Excellent/Addictive Story+ In many ways a contiuation of the first, yet not in so many others (Depending on what you say to Atton, Carth and Bastila make an appearance somewhere in the story; more than once iirc)CONS- Limited Romance Options (Mira is pretty much a no-go, Handmaiden blindly falls in love with you, and Visas confesses her love for you at the end of the game - which is about it. No kissing.)- Too many technical and non-technical issues & bugs to count. Even with all the TSLRCM fixes there's still quite a lot.- Without TSLRCM, the story will NOT make much sense- Your first playthrough most likely will be your worst, like mine (but not your last thankfully)- This marks the end of the KOTOR Games (It's highly unlikely KOTOR III will happen folks)- The workshop makes installing non-workshop KOTOR II Mods a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ (I'm playing a semi-working but broken game right now thanks to the lousy Workshop)My Rating: 10/10 (Highly Recommended) "

												Let me start by saying Kotor 2 is a wonderful game, especially so with the amazing restored content mod.Pros: -Atton, my favourite follower, not only for hilarious 1 liners, but for a highly in-depth and backstory.-A plot that isn't entirely revolved around Light vs Dark, that is intricately woven into the game, forcing you to pay to attention to the decisions you make.-A game where actions ACTUALLY HAVE CONSEQUENCES. -1 playthrough is NOT enough. I love how you can playthrough the game multiple times, but barely scratch the surface of the story.-HK-47. Nuf said.-Multiple styles to play the game.

												THE FUN IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE!I loved KOTOR, but I sadly heard that KOTOR 2  ""IT'S A TRAP!"". Supposedly it isn't as good as the first one and bugged as hell. So I said to myself that ""I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS"" and let my physical copy collect dust without much research about it. In some steam sale, I felt obligated to buy it again though.. and noticed that legends like Chris Avellone and Feargus Urquhart were responsible for it. Then my main gaming PC needed repair and long story short, I am so happy that it did. This game was on top of my old games bucket list and to my great surprise, literally next day that I started to play a great update went live. I felt lucky, but ""IN MY EXPERIENCE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS LUCK"".. ;) So along with an excellent Restoration mod, KOTOR 2 was a unique, melancholic experience. It took me some time to fully warm up to it (unlike original KOTOR), but in some areas it is even better then it's predecessor. And to think that It could have been even better if not rushed in development.. Big thank you to all that still care about the game and enabled me to enjoy this gem. Now I can finally lost myself in TOR. Oh and find some petition for making Kotor 3 happen. MAY THE FUN BE WITH YOU.			"

												Very seriously the best Star Wars game and one of the best PC RPGs of all time.You don't have to have played the first Knights of the Old Republic to follow what's going on here, but if you did, you'll notice that when Obsidian took the license from Bioware they put out a game that just viciously dunks all over its predecessor. It's damn near disrespectful how much better KOTOR 2 is.KOTOR 2 freely gives away things that would qualify as major plot twists in the first game because its most important reveals are so much grander. It repeats archetypes from the first game and sometimes even grabs characters themselves from the first and says ""hold my beer; THIS is how to write them correctly."" I'm on my fourth play through (I'd played it twice before Steam existed) and I'm *still* discovering new things because there's just that much depth. Where the first KOTOR told your typical humdrum legendary hero Bioware story with ""moral choice"" amounting to being a boy scout or orphan-murderer, KOTOR 2 goes deeper. Is light always right? Can dark-sided actions be morally necessary? Are there unintended repercussions to simple acts of charity and kindness? Is anything worth believing in or fighting for?You don't *have* to delve into these questions. You can play it straight forward and ignore so much of the dialogue and character development if you really want. You can speed from start to finish obliterating enemies with Force Lightning and ignore every hint of story. But KOTOR 2 will gladly reward you for the time and attention you put into it. And it's so very worth it.			"

Feel the Force playing the main character and seek the path of complete your knowledge about what happened to you and the Jedi OrderIntroductionFor a Star Wars fan playing this game again, is a luxury. Old memories came back and how I defeated enemies for the first time. I remember the first time when I played it and the emotion of being part of the Geroge Lucas universe. Feeling the Force with these characters, no matter the side you choose, light or dark. Every member of your group,  every planet has a unique story and a continuity carefully created. The chance of gaining influence with your partners and unlock certain things you will discover during the game is being played is fantastic. One of the best ideas of Obsidian and Bioware could see in other games like Mass Effect for example.Here you play the Exile, a former Jedi knight who followed Revan during the Mandalorian wars finishing at the disaster of Malachor V. There's a lot of story about Malachor V and almost a taboo among survivors. Only 5 years passed during that terrible war where the Republic suffered a great peril. You wake up in a station called ""Peragus"" and something is not there. Your powers. And the quest for recovering your connection with the Force starts there. What you do will have great repercussions in the galaxy.There are a lot of history background at the missions, and there is a big plot in the whole game and the main character is the center of this plot, and maybe others, who knows? GameplayYou can play a male or female character and depend on what you'll have different partners and romantic options. Also, the dark or light side will affect some of the decisions you'll take. You even can change the perspective in the middle of the game, I tried and worked. If I'm not mistaken, I played this game like 8 times. Yes, I'm a big fan. You don't do Star Wars? No problem at all. No matter the knowledge of the Old or new Republic, the Force and those issues, this is one of the best roleplaying games. And you'll have to try it if you like RPGs.The player has to think very carefully the decisions, you don't even know when you can gain dark or light side points. That will allow you to gain certain powers or not. Also gaining influence with the onboard characters could jeopardize these points or even influence with opposing members of the group.Comparing with the award winner, Knights of the Old Republic I think this second part is even more polished than the first but the previous one seems to have more choices in travel options.The skills and powers are well established. What I don't understand why a light side could use dark side powers. Of course, Force Storm is the best attack power, and there are some light side powers who will protect you from attacks.They never fixed some glitches and bugs, there are one in a cave of Korriban where you can get a lot of experience, also, there's a bug. You find Kreia and after the scene if you don't have a telepathic communication with her you'll be trapped there.I have to mention something about music and graphics. comparing actual games graphics are not the coolest, but this is an AAA game, and had the best graphics in their time.The soundtrack is one of the best I ever listened in my life. It's just precise and perfect for every moment. I'll make a special mention about the music in Malachor V, fantastic. Try to play that part in the dark and listen carefully. Amazing and a little bit creepy. Pros+ Star Wars, I mean it.+ In my opinion, the best RPG made of the franchise+ The richness story of every companion+ The story of the main character is a great one, full of question and not always a proper answer+ A great soundtrack Cons- They never fixed many glitches and bugs. I remember years ago costs me to start the game again. So, save!- There's a no return point if you had some extra quests to finish. Don't go to Dantooine Enclave after the mercenaries attack.- You'll have to replay the game and pay attention to complete all achievementsFinal ThoughtsAs I said before I loved this game. Not only because is a Star wars game, is one of the best Roleplaying Games I ever played. It's quite immersive game, in a Republic at the point of disaster, you in the skin of someone who want answers. There are a lot to explore and you¡'ll have to play several times to know everything of your party members.Play it. Maybe it's an old game but today we don't have this great plot and storytelling in a game.Rating: 9/10May the Force be with you "

												Developer Obsidian Entertainment was born of former PC RPG giant Black Isle Studios’ closure, and with the name Chris Avellone affixed as lead designer/writer there was an expectation that we’d be seeing something transcending the low standard of video games—even if they were stuck using flippin’ Star Wars (of all things: Really?) as a starting point.What Obsidian’s crew ended up doing was to look at Star Wars, at all Lucas and BioWare and every EU author had accomplished to manipulate the monomythic structure in the creation of something palatable and brilliantly addictive, and just…wrench a knife somewhere in them there guts and twist, twist until everything that gives the Star Wars appeal is torn apart. Piece by piece, the Sith Lords subtly begins feeding you each and every tired expectation, and, as they come, what you feel is this growing sense of relief, this subconscious drive to be satiated on your own literary comfort food—but: There’s always that moment—and you come to expect that too, come to rely on it as the antithesis to your prior highs—there’s always that moment the game asks Why? Of this path so often repeated, what accomplishments do you imagine?A beggar family, torn apart both financially and physically by war, asks for your help--a paltry sacrifice on your part to ensure their safety; maybe, just maybe, nearby stands a man asking for the same outcome, but in place of your own personal sacrifice he offers great monetary gain. It’s either-or, here, and the tendency of players will be towards “good” over “evil,"" so the sacrifice is made, the family hobbles off pitifully to presumed safety and bright futures. You yourself positively reflect on the morality bonuses given for another day saved--and the game stops you dead in your tracks, voicing—almost exclusively through your mentor Kreia—its frustrations with the ignorance inherent in your actions.No matter your in-game answer for Why?, the result is always the same; your choice, perceived as the moral high ground, was nothing but a wasteful performance of ignorant folly. Drawing parallels of your actions to vampirism, your acts of kindness, of Jedi charity, do nothing but steal what power the helpless may hold for your own use (i.e., the experience points gained by your choice, an idea reflected in Star Wars lore itself without any game-y statistics). No matter how buried motives are under the guise of self-sacrifice, helping the needy only serves to weaken them, altering their perceptions on universal modality and, in some cases, making them targets to others more desperate and lethally-driven towards the same goal.By following the ‘goodness’ of the Jedi code—a lie fabricated for self-preservation and personal profit—it's suggested you just led an entire family to their death.This deconstructive direction outside the realm of predictable comfort is what makes the Sith Lords such a massive improvement over BioWare’s excellent predecessor, and, really, the story is just too dang good for Star Wars; its goals far too high and self-aware, but also something the Star Wars brand has desperately needed for a long time.Yet, while the writing of the Sith Lords is far stronger than its prequel, I rate both titles the same, and may, personally, even view the first as a better game. Achievements aside, the Sith Lords is riddled with bugs, moments of atrocious pacing issues and literally a quarter of the game unfinished. Many of these issues have been repaired by dedicated fans over the years since release, but that’s still not enough: The long intro segment and Nar Shadaa still feature pacing issues that stem from more than a rushed development cycle, but simply clumsy planning and writing.Kreia’s continued domination over the players’ own emotional turmoils are what champion this game ahead of so many others, her words forever scarring views of Star Wars as fluffy entertainment. Amidst the wealth of coding error that would come to define Obsidian’s games, it’s that writing--that twisting of archetypal norms and the assumption of a moral compass built from her presence that make this journey so darn good. In the rush to finish this game under a holiday development schedule, she’s written out as Darth Traya, but despite the new name’s implications, despite the donning of black robes, she's never convincing as a villain. (It’s hard to buy her shadow mask when she’s always right, even if she is pushy and demanding. Her role as a mentor is far more believable.)It’s long before she makes her name in betrayal that she raises the avatar and herself from the dead. Five years have passed since Revan redeemed herself and saved the galaxy (the pawn of a Star Wars cliche repeated almost by the decade), and the next galaxy-wide threat is already in full effect. It’s unfortunate that not many seem to know it. This behind-the-scenes orchestration of tragedy is defined by absence in TSL: The concentration of power so great, so abnormal even by Star Wars standards that it threatens itself strictly by persisting, every moment needed to devour the essence of this life that connects every living being. Sith Lords Sion and Nihilus, Kreia’s guiding hand, the avatar herself—exiled by choice from the Jedi Order for her own acceptance of rational, necessary darkness—are all representative of the ultimate consequence of the power sought by good and evil in Star Wars lore, each in their own way black holes eating away at what seems, on the surface, like a coherent system guided by a familiar mythos born long before ’77.The rest of the supporting cast lends a helping hand in reinvent the Star Wars universe, too, with the best among them following the same route the game’s overall quest system takes. The first to join your cause is--of course--a clone of Han Solo even down to the predilection for familiar catch phrases, but as the story progresses his character is turned inside out, his snarky personality made merely a coping mechanism for his horrific past. Another is a twist on the now-stereotyped wookie: A psychopath tortured by his own culture, he adheres under a broken sense of honor to life debts--you know, that cultural norm handed down from his homeworld that would bind him to anyone who saves (or spares) his life--that also drives his psychopathy. He’ll fight alongside those owed such a debt, but not without the constant reminder that his only wish before dying is to gleefully dismember them.It’s this team of equally-lost souls the avatar and Kreia influence and guide on their mission to remove the devouring endgame. Since the conclusion of BioWare’s epic, Revan’s vanished and the Jedi Council lie in ruins. Barely a handful of members still live, and that persisting, devouring force quietly ravaging the galaxy has them in hiding. It’s the Exile’s job to pull these hiding Jedi out of their inherent selfishness either by hunting them down or banding them together to Save the World.Fantastic characterization and dialogue aside, story progression doesn’t bring the same joy or discovery BioWare gave players, due possibly to overcomplication or ridiculous ambition beyond TSL's budget. The series has since become an MMO, and the characters’ fates removed from the postmodern, deconstructive tone of TSL back into comfortable, anticlimactic Star Wars fare.Unfortunate.			"

												A Star Wars game like no other. I mean apart from the dark feeling that I felt throughout, its sheer scale and philosophical tracts made a deep impact on me when it first came out.

												Admit it: the RPG genre had a formula. Start weak. Grow strong. Grow godly strong for some reason, as if it made sense. Did the world-building and story-telling always back up this formula? In my opinion, no.But then there's Star Wars, and its conveniently mysterious ""force."" What an opportunity for an RPG! The first KOTOR was a standard RPG with a classic plot twist. It was a phenomenal game in the traditional sense.KOTOR II takes the RPG formula and turns it into an ethical dilemma on its own. The majority of the game dances around this theme. It paints no one who grows in power as much of a hero, but exposes them as a threat. Personally, I applaud this direction, despite the game's tone overall suffering from a depressing feeling.Be warned, KOTOR II isn't much of a happy game. It's a mature, thought-provoking game. It's a rare game that tells the real story of its own mechanics. You're getting stronger. But at what cost?			"

												Star Wars Knights of the old Republic II, to me, seemed like an awful game compared to the first one, but after going back and playing it again now in 2016, I now see how wrong I was. Kotor 1 still remains superior to the second, but it was pretty close. If you haven't played the first kotor, please play it before purchasing this game, everything will make so much more sense.If you decide to buy this game, I highly suggest downloading this mod 


(English) The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification (TSLRCM) 
A Workshop Item for STAR WARS™ Knights of the Old Republic™ II: The Sith Lords™
By: Hassat Hunter

			This mod's intention is to restore much of the content cut from The Sith Lords, that was lost to the main game due to a rush to release the game.		


This is a restoration mod to add things to the game that originally were supposed to be there, but were cut due to a deadline for the games release. You can download this mod off the steam workshop, so don't worry all of you people who don't like downloading off sketchy mod websites.			"

												Obsidian made it so it's obviously better than the first, especially now that is has the restored content mod built right in the Steam version plus controller support, HD fix for 16:9 ratio (widescreen) which the first one still doesn't have - unless you go out and look for it.Darker, more mature story and better developed characters with new force powers and weapons!Check it out.

When will they create kotor 3?EDIT:So far, I've only encountered 1 crash incident, and no bugs found so far. Though I have noticed that, in higher resolutions, areas of the game would just be 'blue'.And this is the first time I played M4-78... Kudos to the modding team that did it.			"

												With the restored content mod, this is probably my favorite Star Wars game. Graphics, gameplay, sound etc. are all pretty out-dated, but the characters are excellent, story is engaging, and the RPG - mechanics solid. Kotor I and II both capture, IMO, the feel of the old movies, with great relatable characters and humor and so on, but still manage to do their own thing with the story. Plus, there's the dark side playthrough, which isn't completely independent, but still manages to feel different, like Mass Effect. Saying more would spoil much, I'll just say the player kills a lot more people as DS. The player also gets a different party member for light and dark, as well as another one for male and female main. There's a fair bit of replayability, especially if you love Star Wars. Also, there's a DA: Origins type influence system for party members, with serious rewards if played right. It's pretty epic, I played it through maybe a dozen time when it came out, so my laudatory review might be tinged with nostalgia. Still, seeing an old favorite on steam, with a patch released some ten years after the original game came out, with workshop support of all things - as well as the fact, that the game is stable technically, and plays fine on Win 10, make it an excellent look into what a classic game of the sixth generation was like. Something of a testing ground for Dragon Age and Mass Effect, which stormed the industry, while Kotor turned into an MMO. Kind of sad, really. No voice-acting for the player character, dated graphics, and wonky controls aside, it's a great buy. Also, the bit in the beginning on the mining station goes on for some three hours, but after that, the story starts to open up. Warmly recommended for story, characters and writing.			"

													Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II is an absolutely great game. But as many games do, it does have problems. And even though these problems are small and inconsistent, they are still a flaw in the game. And while it might not be as good as its predecessor, it still is an amazing game.Pro's: Compelling main storyline, great characters, beautiful worlds, and the modding community.Con’s: Bugs, and the starting planet.Storyline: 	The storyline of SWKOTOR 2 is a little complicated, but once you get to the nitty gritty, you can see it for its entirety. And while I would love to tell you how intriguing it is, I’m afraid that I will unwillingly tell you what the story is about. But once you start to play the game, and when you do get to the grit of the story, you will be more than interested in it.Characters:	The characters, my god the characters. Never in my life had I felt so much hate, love, and understanding for characters. Not even with most of modern games today. Every character you meet, either side characters or companions, all feel fleshed out. And while there are a stray or two that feel like they are cardboard cutouts, it’s not enough to detract from the world of this game. And your companions are probably the most interesting people you are going to see in this game.	They all have their own agendas. One of them just wants to get out of the situation, one just wants to be in the situation, and they’re all just so damn interesting. Not a single one of your companions are the same. If you were to rob someone blind, one of your companions will tell you that it was worth it because we need the caps. While the other one will scold you and tell you off. The game finds a way for it to work, and it works beautifully.Worlds:	The worlds in this game are absolutely stunning, and not a single world feels the same. If you go to Nar Shaddaa, you’ll feel crowded, claustrophobic, and lost. While on a forest world, you’ll feel like you're in the depths of a jungle. The world’s are portrayed outstandingly, and are an absolute charm to be in.Modding:	The modding community in this game is ferociously great. There are so many mods for the game that I can’t even count. And no, not just the Steam workshop. There are mods that fix the game, make it look better, and make every single part of the game feel much more fleshed out.Bugs:	And even though the game is great and has been patched multiple times, there are still so many damn glitches. One of these glitches, for instance, is a glitch that happens when you play the game for over 3-6 hours. And what basically happens is that is automatically skips dialogue for you. And while this is probably a must for speedrunners, the people who are more than interested in the game's narrative will find this a little more than annoying. But thankfully all you would need to do is simply restart the game to fix it.	But that still doesn’t mean that there aren’t some other bugs. I came to experience one of these bugs via teleportation. One minute I was walking down the hall and the next I was talking to one of my companions, and then the game crashed. And I lost everything that I have done up to that point. It was annoying but it only happened once while playing the game, so it wasn’t that big of a deal.First World:	The starting planet is boring as all hell. The first time while I was playing the game felt like I was about to fall asleep while playing it. I don’t think I can explain it anymore than I have. It’s boring, plain and simple. Verdict:	The game is amazing and it coulnd't be any more so. And it does have a few bumps here and there, but other then that, I couldn't recomend this game any more than I am.			"

												Forget what people have said, with the Restored Content Mod, this is not a broken game.Even ignoring that excellent mod(which you shouldn't), this game manages to having the best writing in all of the Star Wars fiction. The characters, their motives and personalities, along with an excellent plot make this the most enjoyable part of the Star Wars universe.All the other games, comics, shows, movies, etc. all assume that The Force is unquestionably the way to live your life. KOTOR2 dares to challenge this idea, and ask if The Force should even continue to exist at all. The characters all represent the lengths to how far we are willing to go to get what we want, good or bad. They also show how people cope with tragic events.If you even remotely like Star Wars, you should play this game.			"

												Moody and philosophical, brilliantly written and filled with multi-layered characters, immersive and emotionally involving, Knights of the Old Republic 2 is a fantastic game and one of the best stories in the Star Wars universe. It has its share of flaws - the gameplay is rather dull, level design repetitive, graphics outdated even at the time of release. It was also originally released in an incomplete form, but this has since been fixed by a group of dedicated fan who created the The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification. Despite all the flaws, the game succeeds in what matters - sending the player on a memorable journey and leaving such an impact that all these years after its release I still can't get enough of it. Hopefully, one day it will get a sequel it deserves.			"

												After having this sit in my inventory for months and being bugged to play it by my friends, I finally gave it a shot. I am not a fan of this type of combat system, where i'm just clicking hotkeys but I still found myself immensely enjoying the game, as well as (eventually) the combat once I figured it out halfway through the game. I played the game really lazily at first, just automatically levelling all my characters up. I actually played for ten hours as a light side Jedi before I got angry at Kreia and started over as the dark side. The first thing i noticed in playing it, is how similar the first Mass Effect is to it. I love Mass Effect so I appreciated playing its ancestor and there are a lot of similarities to appreciate. I loved the whole inventory system and how much loot you could find. The locations felt similar to mass effect and even the sound of passing space craft on the citadal station over telos sounds like they used the same sound in mass effect. Like I said, I played this game very lazily...i eventually figured out the levelling system and how everything worked after I decided to pay attention half way through. I spent most of the game trying to figure out ways to make Kreia angry, so I was rude to her every chance I could get. I had also started over after running into the jedi on Telos who irritated me so much with their haughty ways I decided to go full dark side. No regrets, even after selling a kid into slavery and convincing a guy to committ suicide within a few minutes of each other. There are obvious flaws to the game which everyone recognizes and I soon came to discover...its buggy, it seems unfinished, the ending (at least for the darkside) felt lacking. It is still a great game, however, primarily because of the story. I don't really need to go into much detail here...its an old game, everyone knows how great this story is. And by the end, I was laughing at myself for basically role-playing my dark jedi IRL by having all my actions decided by my irritation with Kreia and the Jedi. In short, if you haven't played this game yet, from one first-timer to another, seriously, play this game. Now I just have to play the first one.			"

												KOTOR 2 uses the d20 system in the Star Wars universe. If you're a d&d nerd and a Star Wars nerd, that should be all you need to hear. If you need any more convincing, then the dialogue was done by Obsidian; if you don't find the phrase ""Welcome to Mar Shaddaa, watch your step or you'll fall for hours"" to be hilarious, then you're looking at the wrong game. The characters range from charming to annoying, and the dialogue is pretty entertaining,  especially when HK is involved. The game does have its share of bugs since it was rushed for a holiday release oh so long ago, but the Restored Content Mod brings back a fair share of stuff and fixes some scripting bugs. Other than the engine being kinda old and clunky, I have no complaints about this game, and only the highest praise. For those interested in gameplay time: oneone playthrough will take about 35-50 hours (probably closer to 35), and it'll take you two or three plays to get the full experience (light side and dark side, plus gray if you want to).

												Have you ever wanted to play Planescape Torment in Star Wars universe? This is it. Enjoy.Best storyBest characters Best philosophical crisis I ever hadLet me put it this way: gravitational pull of this game is so strong, that I fear that I will never be able to break it. Like the best works of art, this game gives you with one hand, and takes away with the outher: it creates a beautiful philosophical dilemma, a paradox if you will, but the price is steep. The price? A small thing: just a part of your soul and your mind to inhabit forever. It damages you, but in a good way: it forces you to reevaluate your your views, to broaden your horizons, to let in larger world. It shows you... the Force.I am certain in one thing: this 60 hours of metaphysical experience I will carry with me for the rest of my existence.What can change the nature of a jedi?			"

												Took me about 57 hours to complete the light side run... My enjoyment is the story line, however, how many times can you run the story line before it's time to move on?Win 7 doesn't seem to like the game too well. As known, it does like to ""freeze"" the character in place after battles, and on occation also jumps conversations and cut scenes... Minor fixes was to include all processors in the system manager, and set it's priority to high, Then make it compatable with Win 98/XP.For the dark side run, will be attempting to drop some dlls for DirectX 9.0c with it, as that seems to smooth out other older games as well. The reason for this, is the game was indeed not meant to run on DX 11, so a few modifications will be needed, and I believe this to be one of them...Again, a free roaming version of the game, that doesn't really end would be an awsome addition to the collection, for the modern systems. I have a game I keep going back to, cause I can mod it, and even if you finnish the game, you can go back to all the places you had been for more if you so desire.			"

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....Whenever people discuss KotOR II, the word “deconstruction” is used a lot, referring to Chris Avellone's interpretation and criticism of SW as a whole, The Force, how the Jedi are perceived by civilians, Dark Side/Light Side, the infamous “Are you an angel?” easter egg, etc. but the deconstruction doesn't stop there.KotOR II is a critique of the entire RPG genre, in the way it deals with common occurrences and cliches seen in most RPG's. How can you stop your very important main quest, even momentarily, to fetch some irrelevant piece of junk to a random nobody? Why do your party members follow your lead and attack whoever you attack? Why is it okay to loot corpses? Do you have to be good to everyone in a “good” run, and conversely, do you have to butcher little rabbits in an “evil” run? (Not that Light Side/Dark Side is the equivalent of good/evil in other games, just follow me here.) The game was already great at release, just rushed, and now with Aspyr's update and TSLRCM it's even better. Just keep in mind that despite all the official and unofficial fixes it's not perfect and you may still run into technical problems.			"

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 is a tough nut to crack in terms of a good review.The game was released too early and so there are still broken missions, to this day. It was also meant to be a build up for a third installment, which never came due to EA's Star Wars: The Old Republic which (and by trying to spoil as little as possible) leaves you with an incredibly bitter after taste when the credits roll after Knights of the Old Republic 2.And yet, I replay it at least once a year and have done so since its release. Even though this sequal to the classic is a lot lazier in terms of character substance and campaign.So, what is it that takes us back to this unfinished sequal of, what I think is, one of the best RPG's ever made?Star Wars: Knights of the Republic 2 goes dark. There is no better way of saying it. While its predecessor let you choose the Dark Side for the sake of sadistic fun, Kotor 2 shows you what the force really is, and how little it means in the end to be a Jedi or a Sith.I recall a particular moment, very simular to many from the first game, where a beggar comes up to you and ask for money. Choosing the Light Side option as I normally do, my Jedi gave the beggar a few credits and sent him on his merry way. I was given a few Light Side points for my kindness.Then, a wild Treya appears.Treya is an enigma, and the very first character you meet in the game. She will keep a close eye on you, be you Light side or Dark and right there, she shows you a vision of the man, and how he walks off to get himself a meal. She tells you that every action has its consiquence, followed by your vision of the man being robbed, and murdered. You gave him the money. You made him a target.And this is the excellence of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2. It goes further than option one and option two. This game will test you, not only as a player, but as a person. It has its bugs, to the points that it actually needs a MOD to even be playable on some machines, but if you get it running, and if you have the time to put into it, I strongly recomend this game.To me, this is not only one of the very best RPG's, but one of the very finest storylines ever written.May the force be with you.

												This game... This game = SO MUCH WIN. The review might be slightly drawn out and rambly but do try to read it through. Else, putting the TL: DR version here, Buy this game, right now. On any platform you prefer, STEAM, GoG, physical.Follow up to a critically acclaimed RPG by BIOWARE from over a decade back, the original release was severely cut down from the original vision that OBSIDIAN had in mind. Nevertheless the game was strong in its own right and deservedly so. It picked up and iterated on almost every point that BIOWARE had explored in the original, the most obvious being, 1) DIALOGUE: The game improves on this point the most, sure BIOWARE had put in decent dialogue and writing in the original KoTOR but OBSIDIAN's work is a class apart. There are more dialogue options informed by a range of variables apart from the Speech skill of your character. Your standing and influence with factions / characters can get them to divulge information without having to have a superior Speech / Persuade / Force Persuade roll. 2) CHARACTERS: Having been treated to a basic Light Side, Dark Side struggle in the original KoTOR (with a single exception), the player is treated to a more nuanced fare of characters in the follow up game. Sure there are still the tropes but the depth of character play has certainly been explored better in KoTOR II. Your influence over party characters can not only open more character interaction options but confers certain benefits on them when they align with your world view.3) COMBAT: Something as simple as adding another set of weapon slots to make it easier to switch between melee and ranged support roles.  A great game, released a decade ago and still a damn fine game especially with the Restoration MOD guys adding a lot of cut content back inside the title, you can find the content here,

												Because this game obviously needs more praise, I'll throw my two cents on it. Honestly, after having played many modern games these days, KOTOR2 was a great game to come back to. A lot of contemporary RPG games, even those by Bioware, have various issues these days, so I'm going throw out a bunch of points as to what made this game amazing, and even more so now that everyone can easily install and use the Restored Content mod. Because I tend to be wordy, I'll have a TLDR list below.The DnD System: The DnD system implemented in the KOTOR games really does it a great service. Unlike real DND, you don't have to wait 10-15 minutes to hopefully hit something, it all happens quickly. You can even view the detailed rolls for previous combats in great detail, whether they be about enemy or friend. (So you happen to know if it's even possible for you to land a debuff on an enemy.) The movement controls could certainly be tightened up to feel more responsive, as there's a short delay when telling a character to attack, but the slower real time system is far more enjoyable for me than the super fast paced action RPGs that seem more common today. Because it runs at a slower pace, it's far easier to take in the battles, even when a lot is happening at once. There's far less flash and particle effects during the battles than most Action RPGs these days, but I think the game is better for it.Customization Daydream: So much in this game can be tinkered to your liking. You want your wise Jedi Mentor to suddenly just be a sharpshooter? You can level her like that. Probably won't be as powerful, but can certainly be done. There's a wealth of items to make your character fit your style, weapons and armor that can be customized, plenty of feats and force powers. They also added the Seven Lightsaber forms (and Force forms) so you can further adapt to a situation or confine yourself to a certain style. Sad thing is the only real lack of customization is in the character appearance itself, but it also wasn't an industry standard back then.Gray(t) Story: Excusing the awful pun, the story is excellent. It might be difficult to grasp the first time around, depending on your experience with the Expanded Universe or other Star Wars games, but there's a lot going on. Where many Star Wars games tend to play things pretty black and white, especially when it comes to Light Side and Dark Side, this game examines the major elements of Star Wars lore differently. Characters don't always scold you for an action they disagree with if you can back it up with solid reasoning. The choices in this game are wonderful and can lead you to some pretty interesting alternate solutions to getting through a part of the story. This is also one of the non-linear RPGs that I feel doesn't suffer from pacing issues. Games like Dragon Age 3 for example, let me go where I want as well, but I can sometimes just hit a point where what I'm doing doesn't feel as important, so I lose focus and interest. KOTOR2 however does good at keeping major objectives there at all times, large and small ones.Pros-Fantastic Customization of characters and gear.-Wonderful writing featuring compelling characters and tight pacing.-Active-Time-Battle-like gameplay that is enhanced by the wonderful animations. Uses a DnD dice system for most things in the game.-High Replayability since many different builds and conversation choices can lead to some vastly different experiences.-Not your traditional save the galaxy story.Cons-Clunky movement of character and camera. Will take some time to adjust if you're used to modern games.-The music isn't very memetic. The dynamic music the games tries to utilize doesn't flow very well in places.-Can be very difficult in places if you aren't properly prepared.-You'll begin to really loathe the first level if you replay the game a lot and don't mod it out.-Not your traditional save the galaxy story. (Not for you if you're looking to be the undisputed good guy who does no wrong.)So that's KOTOR 2 to me. I would recommend this game certainly and highly recommend it with the Restored Content Mod. It might not be as fast and flashy, your character may not be voice acted, and it might be a little confusing at times. But if you're a fan of Star Wars, Bioware games, or are just looking for a story that isn't so traditional, KOTOR 2 will keep bringing you back to that galaxy far far away.			"

												Here it is, my all time favorite video game. I rented this in a Blockbuster when I was a kid, along with the first KoTOR. It blew my young mind. Action, choice & consequence, philosophy, memorable characters. It was crazy for a youngin who's only played Halo with his older brothers. And it was freakin' Star Wars to boot. I fell in love with everything, from Swoop Racing to lightsaber dueling, Pazaak, and good ol' HK-47. Not to mention the MASSIVE crush I had on the Handmaiden, oh boy.I've easily played over 2,000 hours, I can't count the amount of playthroughs I've done. This game will hook you in, make you think before you choose, and crush your spirits and raise your hopes as you travel the path of the light or dark side of the Force.I easily recommend this game to everyone, whether you're a massive Star Wars fan such as myself, or simply seeking a fun RPG with great combat, real fun mini games, and fantastic worlds and characters. It's on sale! So hurry, buy this. Buy KoTOR I. Buy the Jedi Knight series. Buy Battlefront II. Just buy every damn Star Wars game you can afford.			"

												Just like the first one, this is a classic and a must play. The Sith Lords is much darker and ambiguous than the first, and it makes you think a lot more about your actions and motives and the consequences of said actions. It is harder to tell what is right and wrong--your choices aren't cut and dry, light or dark--and with many choices, you will have party members chipping in on what you should have done. Also, your choices really matter as they can even affect what your party members think about you. It is just as immersive and interesting as the first, and the characters are even better and more complex, each with their own interesting backstory, personality, and views, and you don't always know what they will do next. There are also some cool appearances from characters from the previous game and references to it. Granted, it's an old game so the graphics are quite outdated and I don't love the combat system, but I personally think that the other components of the game far outweigh these negatives. Also, Nexus Mods has some pretty cool mods for it. Overall, this is a masterpiece and easily one of the greatest games to grace the world with its presence.			"

												I didn't play this or KOTOR 1 on release. Instead I played this for the first time in 2016-2017 on a recommendation from a friend. I used the restored content mod as well. I just finished this game and loved every moment of it. It instantly jumps along-side some of my other favorites as the best games I have ever experienced.I remember playing Baldur's Gate 2 and being invested in my party members, and caring about who stood with me. It was the first time in nearly 20 years that I felt the same feeling. I genuinely felt bad when I disappointed Kreia, and made future decisions based on what I thought she would approve of. There's so much mystery and unknown intertwined into the story. If you're a Star Wars fan, or just an RPG fan, play this game. It is a unique experience unlike any other. This is not a traditional ""hero saves the world"" RPG. It is a game of exploration, discovery, morality, and philosophy. Must play experience.			"

-Quick Review-Knights of the Old Republic II (KOTOR2) – The Sith Lords, was developed by Obsidian Entertainment and released early 2005. KOTOR2 is a Star Wars RPG played from a third-person view, and a sequel to the original KOTOR game which was developed by Bioware and released in 2003.There was an update on July 21, 2015 which dramatically improved the quality of the game, adding in steam achievements, steam cloud saves, native wide screen support, controller support, and best of all the Steam Workshop.

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: The events taking place in KOTOR2 take place five years after KOTOR1, the Sith are winning the war with the Republic. You play as “The Exile”, a former Jedi Knight who has lost his/her ability to use the Force.Throughout the story you are given chances to earn “light side” or “dark side” points based on the ethical decisions you make, you also grow closer to your various companions based on choices you are sometimes presented with.All of this gives the game an extremely replayable atmosphere; because you can go back and choose different dialogue, experience a completely different story, and most importantly deal with the consequences for your choices.

Gameplay: Combat wise, the game is identical to the first KOTOR, you have the same types of weapons: lightsaber, Melee, Blaster weapons, Ion weapons, Mines, Grenades, etc.You can (and should) pause the game before and during combat to plan out your strategy of engagement, will your companions lay down range fire while you rush to the front lines lightsaber blazing? Or is this a boss and you need to throw all your grenades? First use force lightning, flurry, auto attack, force drain, then power attack? There are countless strategies for combat within the game.

There are Mini games; Pazaak (Card game) and Swoop bike racing (Racing game). Learning the tricks of these mini games are very rewarding in the game, but a guide would be the appropriate place to learn about these mini games.Achievements: Once upon a time there were no achievements for KOTOR2... ...until the magical day of July 21, 2015! This is one the games I always wanted achievements to be available on, most achievements will be earned with playing through the game twice; Once choosing the Dark Side path, once choosing the Light Side path.There are also several achievements for skill based side objectives, however it's safe to say that all of these achievements are very well achievable. You do need to be willing to go through the story several times to earn them all.Price: KOTOR2 is priced at $9.99, my first play through was 47 hours. The quality of this game is excellent. Personally, I am guilty of being biased for star wars RPG's and playing the heck out of them, but even for a normal person you can easily squeeze out 20+ hours. (RPG's as a genre are designed to be lengthy and time consuming!)Conclusion: To quickly recap, Story: Excellent, the story changes based on decisions you make throughout the game. Gameplay: identical combat rolling system to KOTOR1. Achievements: straight forward, you will need to beat the game twice and maybe three times (depends on if you missed any skill/trait based achievements). Price: Extremely fair, if you want an even better price just wait for a steam sale.I adore the Star Wars universe, and this is my favorite RPG series within that franchise. With the advent of J.J. Abrams, Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens (Because putting “Disney” before “star wars” is still too weird for me), the franchise will regain momentum.Thanks for reading my review!

												tWell first thing first i wil set this review up as i did with the first kotor game and they will be a little similar. before we start , compared to kotor 1 i played or tried to play wholly as the light side. If i did get some dark point a re-loaded an earlier savefile of the game , witch i wont do on my second go. Pro- Great gameplay. With some minor improvement like easy change of melee and ranged even tough i mainly used melee on my MC , also the add off different forces/styles. - Great soundtrack music- Darker in setting or tone the kotor 1. Witch also makes for a darker plot. ( But i probably prefer the original due to a little better pacing ,but is entirely objective/subjective or whatever the say- Overall better and more interesting characters imo and villain . - Again a great rpg with a lot of choices you can make , however the ending you get seems to be dependant on your choice in the end fo the game.-You can play it at you own pace, it starts out linear, but eventually you get 4 planets you can choose to explore and take on in what order you want ,also able to go back an forth.- Just hard enough , even tough the bosses is pretty hard.- Replay value.Cons: However there is some cons here compared to the original, i had problem with the mouse freezing right after cutescens so be sure to save regularly. But it seems too vary very much on people and there probably some fixes for it out there. Also looting from container and especially on npc sometimes i had to loot from a specific angel.- one of the places you visits feel to drag on a little and so does the last location your at.Also i recommend you to use the restoration content mod Great game a little bit worse then the original due to it cons how ever if it was for cons it would be very tight. It would basically be plot vs characters an tone/setting of the game ,a darker star wars or not as dark.			"

												There's something special about this game.In spite of the dialogue skipping, the AI glitches, the funky influence system, and the odd glitched quest, this is the most fun I've ever had with a game.It's got a great plot, sure, and it expands on the Star Wars universe and its predecessor in some really interesting ways, but at the end of it all that's not really what stuck with me. What hit me were the characters, and how I grew to care for them. I learned ""pazaak"" from Atton, sparred with the Handmaiden, shared the pain of a past war with a past ally, sat at the feet of of Kreia and absorbed her teachings, and in turn taught Visas the ways of the Force as Kreia had with me. All of these characters had interesting and involved backstories, but what I liked the most about them was that they were just as defined by their moments with you as they were by the exposition that you could eventually get out of them. Another intriguing thing about the characters is that they all seem to have their own inner darkness, and the way you influence them is either by fostering that darkness or helping to redeem them of it. You can free one companion from their inner rage, or teach them to draw strength from it. Draw a naive student to the light side or shackle them to the darkness. And they're all HIDING something. Why is it that your wise teacher can't seem to read the thoughts of the scoundrel you picked up on a mining station? Why was your wise teacher seeking you out in the first place, and why does she seem to know so much about the Sith? What's hidden away in the memory banks of that backtalking T3 unit? What exactly /happened/ on Malachor V?Sure, the game's got its issues. The combat might get too easy for those who figure out its tricks too early in the game. Some of the time it seems like the game was cut into pieces before its release - which it kind of was, unfortunately. Graphics might seem outdated. I mean, yeah, I'll admit, they ARE outdated, though they aren't unbearable. Basically what I'm saying is that, once you peel back all the issues on the surface, you've got something truly special. I don't know how to explain it - it's like this /feeling/ you get, when you're playing the game into the wee hours of the morning, and you have to get up early tomorrow but your thoughts are drowned out by the dim glow of your computer screen and the soft chuckle you let out at ""Just because I saved her doesn't mean I want to charge up her loading ramp!""I don't actually know how to end this review. Peace.""Between assassin droids, a Sith Lord who looks like he sleeps with vibroblades, and being target practice for a Republic ship, I was better off in my cell!"" - barack obama 10/10			"

Deep, Compelling, Immersive, Philosophical, Controversial, Unfinished: Past Its Flaws, The Sith Lords is a Great GameDate of Review: January 16, 2016Note: This game was played with The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification available from the Steam workshop and no other modifications.Developing The Sith Lords, the 2004 sequel to Bioware's excellent Knights of the Old Republic, was undoubtedly an ambitious task for Obsidian Entertainment. Not only was it their first full undertaking, but also the sequel to an extremely memorable and enjoyable game in one of the most famous settings ever created. Sadly, the final product was a rushed production with a notorious amount of cut content, having had only 13 months of development before going gold thanks to LucasArts' infamous decision to hurry the game to market for the 2004 holiday season.I had never played The Sith Lords up until recently. I played Knights multiple times in the past, loving its story and gameplay, but never its sequel. And now having played it, I feel that there are tragic signs that the game never realizes its full potential, even with the restored cut content, but I also feel that it surpasses its predecessor in several ways. MechanicsThe Sith Lords employs the Odyssey engine and d20 system from first game, effectively translating Dungeons & Dragons concepts to the setting of blasters and lightsabers. Combat is real time with pause and although there are a few oddities and annoyances, I always felt that the combat worked mostly well. The game's item crafting and upgrade system is decent, and thankfully so, as almost all the items you will find are randomly generated, including merchant stocks, and you will need to upgrade your gear to remain competitive.Special note needs to be given to the influence system. Depending on your actions, you can gain influence with your companions and thereby earn their respect, change their alignments, learn more about them, and even train some of them in the Force. The system has significant flaws, as it tends to encourage gamey tactics in order to maximize your influence points. It is also undermined by the fact that you cannot have more than two companions with you at a time, making it nearly impossible to influence everyone in any singular playthrough and restricting access to some parts of the story. However, watching your companions follow you to the Light Side or to the Dark Side is very cool.What is a Jedi without his lightsaber? Without his powers? Without the Force? The background story of the The Sith Lords is far more ominous than its predecessor. Darth Revan has left the known galaxy for mysterious reasons. Civil war has crippled the Republic. And the Jedi, relentlessly hunted by a new wave of Sith assassins, are nearing extinction. Yet, your character, despite being a Jedi, has been divorced from these events right up until the game's beginning.You are an exile from the Jedi Order, who condemned your actions in the Mandalorian Wars and ordered you to give up your lightsaber. Furthermore, you somehow lost your connection to the Force. However, it begins to return.Thus you embark on not just a physical journey, but a spiritual and philosophical journey. Delightfully, you are given the opportunity to opine on the nature of the Force and are encouraged to decide for yourself whose teachings are right, whose are wrong, and if the Force has a destiny for everyone or if your fate is one of our own choosing. In many ways, this game is a successor to Planescape: Torment and it all but explicitly asks ""What can change the nature of a man?""It is not your typical Star Wars story. And here, that is fantastic.The game has excellent dialogue and many times gives you a plethora of dialogue options. Overall strong voice acting and writing permeates this title and nearly every character has depth far surpassing their counterparts from the first game. Admittedly, the writing does have its share of inconsistencies and the story has its issues, including a series of somewhat unsatisfying retcons regarding Darth Revan's motivations and the ""True Sith,"" which cheapens the value of The Sith Lords as a continuation of Knights.  But when the story and writing are at their best, it is wonderful and makes up for nearly every weakness this game has.Do you consider yourself a Jedi? A Sith? Or something else entirely?I was very charmed by the fact that you can play a character that adheres strongly to the Light Side, the Dark Side, or one that rejects both the Jedi and Sith orthodoxies and still arguably be justified in your choice. It is so much more interesting to have genuine motivations for your actions rather than a superficial veneer of rationalizations and this game succeeds at providing such motivations. The character I played prior to this review generally showed charity, courtesy, and hospitality to those around me, but I also decided to exterminate the remaining Jedi masters and constantly criticize the Jedi Order for its many hypocrisies. It was deliciously heretical.Although I love that this game readily permits, and sometimes encourages, toeing the line between Light and Dark, I was a bit disappointed at how it can lock you out of some content. While I could forsake the alignment specific prestige classes, I was far more annoyed that there was a level on Korriban that required a strong alignment commitment, thus prohibiting my only mildly Dark Side-aligned character's entry, and that the ending of the game is merely dependent on how devoted you are to the Light Side or Dark Side rather than on any given choice. I'll also note that I was stopped short of completely and utterly denouncing the usual conception of the Force as having specific Light and Dark natures rather than emphasizing the value of an individual's choices and actions, perhaps because there was still an expectation you would ultimately pick a side. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this run and the game is very replayable. Beset by Unfinished Content, Blemished by a Weak Ending and BugsAlthough almost any game will have its weakness, this game's are pretty prominent. One of the most noticeable was some wildly varying level design quality alongside a relative lack of content in some areas. For instance, Onderon had many sidequests, many locations, and an interesting plotline with many remarkable characters. But Nar Shaddaa and especially Malachor V have some lifeless and rather poorly designed environments. And Korriban was almost pathetically short. The ending of the game's story can also be disappointing, as it refocuses on the aforementioned retcons and takes away choice from you regarding what your character does next. While it was supposed provide a sequel hook, it feels cheap. In a way, it feels like some parts of this game were never fully finished.I also encountered some bugs, including graphical glitches on some of the player character models and some pathfinding oddities. There was also a bug where dialogue would start constantly skipping if I didn't close and reopen the program around every two hours.

Deep, Compelling, Immersive, Philosophical, Controversial, Unfinished: Past Its Flaws, The Sith Lords is a Great GameDate of Review: January 16, 2016Note: This game was played with The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification available from the Steam workshop and no other modifications.Developing The Sith Lords, the 2004 sequel to Bioware's excellent Knights of the Old Republic, was undoubtedly an ambitious task for Obsidian Entertainment. Not only was it their first full undertaking, but also the sequel to an extremely memorable and enjoyable game in one of the most famous settings ever created. Sadly, the final product was a rushed production with a notorious amount of cut content, having had only 13 months of development before going gold thanks to LucasArts' infamous decision to hurry the game to market for the 2004 holiday season.I had never played The Sith Lords up until recently. I played Knights multiple times in the past, loving its story and gameplay, but never its sequel. And now having played it, I feel that there are tragic signs that the game never realizes its full potential, even with the restored cut content, but I also feel that it surpasses its predecessor in several ways. MechanicsThe Sith Lords employs the Odyssey engine and d20 system from first game, effectively translating Dungeons & Dragons concepts to the setting of blasters and lightsabers. Combat is real time with pause and although there are a few oddities and annoyances, I always felt that the combat worked mostly well. The game's item crafting and upgrade system is decent, and thankfully so, as almost all the items you will find are randomly generated, including merchant stocks, and you will need to upgrade your gear to remain competitive.Special note needs to be given to the influence system. Depending on your actions, you can gain influence with your companions and thereby earn their respect, change their alignments, learn more about them, and even train some of them in the Force. The system has significant flaws, as it tends to encourage gamey tactics in order to maximize your influence points. It is also undermined by the fact that you cannot have more than two companions with you at a time, making it nearly impossible to influence everyone in any singular playthrough and restricting access to some parts of the story. However, watching your companions follow you to the Light Side or to the Dark Side is very cool.What is a Jedi without his lightsaber? Without his powers? Without the Force? The background story of the The Sith Lords is far more ominous than its predecessor. Darth Revan has left the known galaxy for mysterious reasons. Civil war has crippled the Republic. And the Jedi, relentlessly hunted by a new wave of Sith assassins, are nearing extinction. Yet, your character, despite being a Jedi, has been divorced from these events right up until the game's beginning.You are an exile from the Jedi Order, who condemned your actions in the Mandalorian Wars and ordered you to give up your lightsaber. Furthermore, you somehow lost your connection to the Force. However, it begins to return.Thus you embark on not just a physical journey, but a spiritual and philosophical journey. Delightfully, you are given the opportunity to opine on the nature of the Force and are encouraged to decide for yourself whose teachings are right, whose are wrong, and if the Force has a destiny for everyone or if your fate is one of our own choosing. In many ways, this game is a successor to Planescape: Torment and it all but explicitly asks ""What can change the nature of a man?""It is not your typical Star Wars story. And here, that is fantastic.The game has excellent dialogue and many times gives you a plethora of dialogue options. Overall strong voice acting and writing permeates this title and nearly every character has depth far surpassing their counterparts from the first game. Admittedly, the writing does have its share of inconsistencies and the story has its issues, including a series of somewhat unsatisfying retcons regarding Darth Revan's motivations and the ""True Sith,"" which cheapens the value of The Sith Lords as a continuation of Knights.  But when the story and writing are at their best, it is wonderful and makes up for nearly every weakness this game has.Do you consider yourself a Jedi? A Sith? Or something else entirely?I was very charmed by the fact that you can play a character that adheres strongly to the Light Side, the Dark Side, or one that rejects both the Jedi and Sith orthodoxies and still arguably be justified in your choice. It is so much more interesting to have genuine motivations for your actions rather than a superficial veneer of rationalizations and this game succeeds at providing such motivations. The character I played prior to this review generally showed charity, courtesy, and hospitality to those around me, but I also decided to exterminate the remaining Jedi masters and constantly criticize the Jedi Order for its many hypocrisies. It was deliciously heretical.Although I love that this game readily permits, and sometimes encourages, toeing the line between Light and Dark, I was a bit disappointed at how it can lock you out of some content. While I could forsake the alignment specific prestige classes, I was far more annoyed that there was a level on Korriban that required a strong alignment commitment, thus prohibiting my only mildly Dark Side-aligned character's entry, and that the ending of the game is merely dependent on how devoted you are to the Light Side or Dark Side rather than on any given choice. I'll also note that I was stopped short of completely and utterly denouncing the usual conception of the Force as having specific Light and Dark natures rather than emphasizing the value of an individual's choices and actions, perhaps because there was still an expectation you would ultimately pick a side. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this run and the game is very replayable. Beset by Unfinished Content, Blemished by a Weak Ending and BugsAlthough almost any game will have its weakness, this game's are pretty prominent. One of the most noticeable was some wildly varying level design quality alongside a relative lack of content in some areas. For instance, Onderon had many sidequests, many locations, and an interesting plotline with many remarkable characters. But Nar Shaddaa and especially Malachor V have some lifeless and rather poorly designed environments. And Korriban was almost pathetically short. The ending of the game's story can also be disappointing, as it refocuses on the aforementioned retcons and takes away choice from you regarding what your character does next. While it was supposed provide a sequel hook, it feels cheap. In a way, it feels like some parts of this game were never fully finished.I also encountered some bugs, including graphical glitches on some of the player character models and some pathfinding oddities. There was also a bug where dialogue would start constantly skipping if I didn't close and reopen the program around every two hours. Massive praise must be given to the people behind the Restored Content Modification for crushing so many other bugs, but the presence of the ones I found still speaks of an abridged quality control effort due to the rush to get to market back in 2004.Summa SummarumFor all its problems and unrealized potential, I really liked this game. I liked it for its story, its characters, its willingness to confront some of the normally sacred concepts of the Star Wars setting, and most of all, its fantastic writing. So long as one enjoys RPGs, is cognizant of this game's flaws, and can appreciate its complexity and subtleties, I strongly recommend this game.			"

												This is where Star Wars gets really interesting. Sure, the first Knights of the Old Republic was a blast, but this is where everything starts to mean something. What do YOU think about the galaxy? What do YOU think about the Jedi, Sith and the force? Do you care what your companions think of your opinions? Companion influence really added another gameplay element. The mix of light and dark points with influence points makes it harder to pick dialogue options without thinking, and sometimes the moral principles of your character have to be sacrificed to gain influence with another. It's far more engaging than the last game and definitely worth playing after installing the restored content mod. Easily one of the best stories in Star Wars for me.			"

												Classic and good RPG, specially for Star War fans. But it's old engine, and this may causes problems: issues/crashes running on modern system. Save your game frequently.I would recommend that you also downloed the The Sith Lord Restorarion Content Mod  (TSLRCM). It restores a lot of stuff that was left out of the original game.			"

												A hugely rewarding, deeply engrossing experience almost ten years on from release. This is my second time all the way through (first time on the xbox) back in 2004/2005. The best thing about KOTOR 2 is the writing, and the characters. It is deeper, and definitely darker (but perhaps with more profound moments of light and redemption due to contrast), than the first KOTOR. As expected the game looks a little out of date, but the sound, voice acting, and as mentioned, excellent story carry things along very nicely. The presentation is really quite cinematic, with nice pacing, good use of dramatic pause, and a poignancy that is rare in computer games.It is an excellent RPG to play driven by your own moral compass etc, intentionally selecting and ignoring the threads to form your character, and party relationships. This is a MASSIVE part of the game, and in many ways is far more interesting than the grinding and combat etc (which is fine, and quite entertaining). Some of the outcomes of choices are a little tired/naff/obvious. For example there are so many problems ultimately solved with violence etc, but hey it's star wars and a computer game... what can I really expect! On the whole the dialogue and outcomes are very enjoyable, especially as you come to understand the personas and motivations of the party members, and learn to pick the threads that yield the best reactions.I highly recommend installing the missing content patch, which is now very clean and tidy, and adds considerably to the experience and sense of completeness. That said it would be nice to see a clearer round up of what you acheived from your choices/acheivements in the wider universe (minor niggle).An indellible experience, and I would love some more.

												Do I recommend the Sith Lords? Of course I recommend the Sith Lords! Why wouldn't I? It's one of the best Star Wars games ever made. It has fantastic characters, great dialogue, and an excellent story. Also it................it broke my heart.STAR WARS(R): Knights of the Old Republic(tm) II has bugs coming out of every exhaust port. I've had important conversations ruined by glitches, a blank screen during climatic battles, the Exile getting stuck for several seconds at a time unless I enable vsync(??). Worst of all, after 29+ hours, when I was at the doorstep of the finale, all of my saves stopped working. All I wanted to do was take a break to eat lunch. LUNCH! What's wrong with lunch? Does lunch lead to the dark side?! Hunger leads to crashing, crashing leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to...oh my gosh. It's true!I'm not saying it could happen to you, but it happened to me. I spent nearly 30 hours on this game, and I couldn't even finish it. What a piece of garbage.---KILL ALL THE STORM BEASTS----------------SPOILERS AHEAD------------------Now that we've gotten the nasty business out of the way, let's discuss the actual game.PLOT: You are the Exile, a fallen Jedi seeking answers. Along the way you are mentored by the mysterious Kreia. Eventually you recruit the motliest of crews, attempt to restore the jedi order; while killing hundreds of alien creatures, space bandits, and Sith assassins.Let's look at the basic structure of the game. KOTOR2 is an RPG, which tends to involve exploration, stats, equipment, and an emphasis on story. The most important aspect is that you're playing an active role. As the Exile, you make numerous decisions, which can affect the storyline in various ways. Going further, the decisions you make influence your party-members. Do something they agree with, your influence over them grows, and eventually they'll answer your questions about their past. This is a relatively low-key game. At times it almost feels like detective work, and not the usual lightsabers & blasters extravaganza (though there is plenty of that). Also, as with the previous entry, the decisions you make determine whether you think like a Jedi, or a Sith. What I like about this system is that it keeps you thinking. There's no silly ""let homeless people eat"" or ""kill homeless people"" decisions in this game. A jedi might carry a lightsaber, but not every situation requires one. Being selfless and using diplomacy can save lives. Even a few lies won't hurt your relationship to the light side. But don't let that stop you from threatening someone to give you a few extra credits, or force-persuading them to jump off a bridge. Giving in to the dark-side tends to be more rewarding, easier, and more entertaining. Getting light-side points requires sacrifice, which isn't something we're used to. I mean c'mon, RPGs tend to involve heroes raiding houses and stealing every last dime. How often are players going to say ""No thank you. I don't need your reward money. I'm a good guy.""? Playing an actual truly honorable person is difficult, and it involves saying things that will make players (and Kreia) really annoyed. Kreia is one of the best-written characters in a videogame. First off, she presents a third dimension to the common tale of good vs evil (or light vs dark in the case of Star Wars). She implores the Exile (and the player) to look beyond the basics of the jedi code, and seek a greater purpose. I suppose her ideals are biased, but that adds depth to her character. As you attempt to influence your party members, she indulges in her own machinations. Secondly, her nature helps keep the rest of the cast on edge. While your party members can trust you, they tend to ignore or even outright hate each other. Kreia's role as a mentor is far from what we'd expect, as she shows little respect for her allies, and will control them to achieve her ends. Also, her betrayal is exceptionally well-written. She turns on you, but it's not ""Haha! I'm a bad guy now!"" This is something that has been hinted at numerous times, and Kreia even all but spells it out to the Exile at one point.The rest of the cast, as I mentioned earlier, is fantastic. At first glance, everyone looks like a bunch of cliches. Atton Rand is the wise-cracking rogue, Bao-dur is the mechanic, HK-47 loves killing, and Han Harr is a wookie. However, everyone has lot of depth to them. This isn't to the point where it becomes overbearing. In the end, this is still the Exile's quest, but the extra care and attention given to the party-members makes them more than just ""along for the ride"". Their interjections fit their personalities, and give you something to think about when you're running from one adventure to the next. KOTOR2 gives you a lot of ideas to dwell on. This is important because the battle-system doesn't require much (if any) thought. You can put together your own party and outfit them however you want, but your strategy will rarely deviate from ""use this force power to put everyone out of commision"". The most difficult parts of the game tend to involve certain boss battles. The twi'lek twins can be a headache, unless you had the foresight to mine the cantina in Nar Shadarr before a certain event. You might also have trouble fighting Darth Sion in a rogue vs sith battle. Before long you realize that Sion is as dumb as he is ugly, and will gladly stand around while you plant a dozen mines for him to be lured into. An optimal player might've just made Atton a Jedi so they could awesome their way through these fights, but I messed up there. While this game focuses on its story and writing, there is a part of me that's disappointed in the lack of any real end-game or post-game content. We can ""thank"" Lucasarts for shipping KOTOR2 in such a poor state, and thank TSLRCM-group for restoring a lot of the cut content, but there's still a lack of...well...return on investments. I look at it like this, when I use a particular party-member, buy equipment for them, and raise their stats, I'm investing in them. I expect that eventually this investment will pay off. Usually the pay-off is in the form of help beating the game, defeating some super boss (like the weapons in Final Fantasy 7, the dragons in Baldur's Gate II, etc) or exploring some grand optional dungeon. When a party-member is killed off (via the story) all I'm thinking is ""Why did I invest in this loser?"" Unfortunately, there's no pay-off for investing in anyone in KOTOR2. I outfit them, invest my time by building a relationship with them, and I'm awarded nothing for my efforts. You can look at it as part of the storyline, or not important to the game, but I think it's an oversight. There were probably going to be 8 legendary Krayt Dragons for players to fight. Alas.As far as necessary complaints go, I figure the level-design deserves to be knocked around. It's mostly bland and feature-less. Also it's spaced out to the point where there's a lot of running around. I skipped a few quests just because I was sick of huffing it from one end of the planet to the other. To add to this, there's a very clear sliding scale in terms of planetary content. Telos, Nar Shadarr, and Dantooine have the most, while Dxun, Onderon, and Korriban have the least. This can be attributed to -- you guessed it -- rushed development. There are other issues as well but let's just blame it all on Lucasarts. Obsidian deserves a lot of credit. Even though this piece of junk failed on me at the worst possible time (my investments!), it's still one of the better CRPGs out there. The cut content is definitely worth checking out as well. However, you may want to be prepared for the worst. Even if you can manage to launch KOTOR2, you're never really out of the woods. It just might break your heart like it did mine.			"

So basically, the game wasn't finished, but that's where ""Restored content mod"" comes is, and fixes most of the stuff.

												Great game, perfect sequel to the first one. Great improvements across the board, literally the only two things I prefer about the first game, is firstly, the length, this game is far shorter, and the ending kinda gets boring so you start rushing through the final level. And secondely the nostalgia, though far more fun to play with, and have on a team, the characters from this game just arent as memorable as Bastilla and Carth. Still an awesome game, would reccomend to anyone who's looking for a good Star wars game. "

												I just realized I never made a Steam review of this f#cking game. God damn it. As usual I will start with the bad stuff, and I will try to keep spoilers out of the way.The first and biggest problem this game has going on it is the fact that it was never actually finished. And let me tell you, I LOVED THE FIRST ONE, and I bought the second one when it came out, years ago. I was confused as HELL with the ending, because it didn't make ANY SENSE AT ALL. However nowadays there's an actual fix for this situation: Last year the devs patched the game on Steam to add Achievements and Mod support, to thank the guys (some of the devs included) who took their sweet f#cking time to, after so many years, finish the game on a mod. You HAVE to play it with those mods, I'm serious. They add quite a ton of stuff, even if some of those new things still seem to be fairly unfinished.The second thing are the bugs. After so many years there still are bugs running rampant through the game.  Granted it's nowhere as close as with other games, however I've managed to do stupid stuff at times and I don't even know how. A few examples are somehow teleporting to the top of a pillar and getting stuck there, forcing me to load a previous save, or having a character somehow bug out and ignore a current quest, not allowing me to finish it. Sometimes this can be fixed by loading previous saves, but not all of them.My last issue with the game is the characters. Don't get me wrong, I like that they brought the playable characters from 9 to 12 or so, but not all of them seem actually interesting. G0-T0 deserves a f#cking special mention as I never actually gave 2 f#cking ♥♥♥♥♥ about him, while Kreia always looked and felt like a smartass who knew way too much.That being said though, is the game good? Oh boy, you bet you ♥♥♥. To begin with, the story itself (if you have the mods to play the actual entire story, of course) is seriously good, long and deep. It takes somewhere across 25 hours to complete, and that's only counting a Lighr or Dark playthrough, so there's another 25 hours waiting for you later on. The characters, ignoring the two I said before, are REALLY INTERESTING, and you can learn their back-story and stuff about them as you play on, sharing adventures with them. The game also has a sort of system which tracks who are you being nice to and who are you being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to, which works perfectly, and characters trully react to your actions throughout the entire game.The rather deep (and even a bit confusing at times) combat system from the original is back here at full force, with even more weapons, more armors, random items, and customization. There's also buttons to switch between two weapons, allowing ranged characters to quickly switch to melee weapons when needed. You can literally play most of the game your way, although using blasters against Jedis and Sith is f#cking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ most of the time.The whole feel of the game changes deeply from the previous game, and it's good. While in the previous Kotor everything felt happy and colorful with the current truce, now everything is f#cked beyond repair. It helps inmerse the player into the current situation, and makes you explore and learn about what changed from one game to the other.Oh, and this game has one of the best video-game characters to ever exist as a rather unlockable: HK-47. I'm not f#cking arround with you, he's totally worth the fetch-quest to unlock him.Overall, this title still stands arround other great RPG games, specially after the fans and old devs finished it together. Do I recommend it? Yes. But if you haven't played the first one, then you totally should, as the story follows in here. And obviously, you should play this one with the mods that fix it. Personally, the base price of the game is already fair enough, but you can wait for a sale if that makes you feel better. For 5€, it's a f#cking steal. You filthy meat-bag.Edit: Whoops, forgot to put the link to the Restored Content Mod. Remember though, there's an extra mod on the workshop that adds an unfinished planet to the game, I suggest getting that one too.

												I rarely play a long game from start to finish more than twice, for me to do so it'd require fun gameplay and a story I felt invested in and wanted to relive. I've played Half-Life 2 (and its episodes) three times over because of how in love I fell with the story. While figuring out how to get this game to work with TSLRCM, I started playing Knights of the Old Republic again, as the opposite sex and alignment but found myself somewhat bored after Dantooine. So far, I have played Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords two full times in rapid succession and I'm roughly a third of the way through my third playthrough. To say I love this game is an understatement.The gameplay is a step up from KOTOR 1 and though I find it very enjoyable, battles can be rather bland and a bit too easy at times. The real reason to play this game is the story. However, that itself is very divisive. The Sith Lords' story is a meticulous exploration of the very basis of the Star Wars mythos: the Force. It portrays the Jedi as flawed, the Sith as broken but ultimately human (or whatever species they are) and the very concept of morality as far more complex than any of the current Star Wars canon does (admittedly I'm rather unfamiliar with the old Expanded Universe outside of these two games). This can turn off Star Wars fans just looking for a Star Wars game like KOTOR 1 that captures what makes Star Wars great. On the other hand, the mouthpiece for all these criticisms and alternative points of view is a character called Kreia who, without delving into spoilers, is... rather questionable to say the least. Though you can't convince her to change her mind, you can declare yourself in disagreement and you can defy her as you wish, or agree with her as you wish. As a Star Wars fan, I found this deconstruction of the Force to be highly enjoyable and cast the movies in a different light for me.The other characters in the game are hardly one dimensional, the weakest ones are two dimensional at worst. It's difficult to talk about what makes these characters great without delving into spoilers so I won't, but I will especially praise Atton as an example of everything a good anti-hero should be. There are a couple that return from KOTOR 1 and their presence is very welcome. Some, such as HK-47, are enjoyable as ever and developed further while others, like T3-M4, are an improvement over their KOTOR 1 incarnations.The mechanics are integrated much better with differet aspects of the game this time around. Your attributes and skills play a role in conversations and the creation of items at workbenches, the latter being itself a huge improvement over its handling in KOTOR 1. Playing as different classes and alignments creates very different experiences outside of combat. As a male Jedi Guardian/Jedi Master I played very differently than as a female Jedi Consular/Sith Weapon Master and as a female Jedi Sentinel/Jedi Watchman, for example. Where in KOTOR 1 you can play Dark Side or Light Side but really only make meaningful decisions towards the end, you're put in a spot where you have to take decisions from the start. As a Light Side player, early in Telos do I refuse this monetary reward to earn Light Side points but risk having to sell my wares to not gain Dark Side points a bit down the line? As a Dark Side player, do I challenge the Jedi Masters early on and engage in difficult fights or save all but one of them for later when I'm more powerful but make the survivors gang up on me?In conclusion, I tend to compare Episodes IV and V to KOTOR 1 and KOTOR 2. Episode IV and KOTOR 1 are the more basic Star Wars adventure. The dichotomy between good and evil is clear and doesn't really try anything new but is more easily digestible and is incredibly fun regardless. Episode V and KOTOR 2 are the more creative one but takes risks that might not be to everyone's liking. While this really isn't a good analogy as both Episode IV and V are rather easily digestible whereas KOTOR 2 is a lot harder to swallow, especially if you just come in for a sequel to KOTOR 1 in body and soul, I think it works as a comparison because one is the safer one while the other is the more daring one. Both are great on their own merits, though I personally consider the latter to be better. With this game you should come in with an open mind. If you do, I highly recommend giving it a whirl and seeing if you can get something out of it. Just please install TSLRCM and possibly M4-78EP from the Workshop, the game is incomplete without at least the former.			"

Star Wars: KotOR II - The Sith Lords is one of my favourite games of all time - in that way, it very much lives up to my love for its predecessor. The two tie for the #1 spot on my all-time favourite single-player game, and are cumulatively my favourite story ever, as far as I can say off the top of my head. (NOTE: TL;DR at bottom.)  KotOR II is a third-person RPG game, with largely turn-based combat. Whilst I certainly have a few problems with it, I truly believe that this game (as well as KotOR) is a game that any die-hard Star Wars or RPG enthusiast need to experience. I'll break this review up into a few short segments based around the story in particular (as the most important part of this game is by far the story), and will be reviewing this from a largely biased position, as I've been a fan of this franchise for over a decade. I'm new to the whole reviewing thing too, so forgive any mistakes on my part. For those of you who are just looking for a TL;DR, here are the pros and cons:PROS -Carefully crafted story, one that manages to touch the heart of most die-hard SW fans in a very powerful way. It’s absolutely great in just about every aspect, and it does something no other game does – it paints in grey strokes about the nature of the Force, not just ‘good’ and ‘bad’. -Aesthetic and visuals hold up in the majority of places, considering its age. Just don’t look at the back of the Ebon Hawk, whatever you do. It’s certainly no stunner, however – if you’re cool with a lot of somewhat muddy textures you’ll be fine.  -Fans of the first game won’t have their love for the first game cast into the dirt like a dead corpse. KotOR II respects the first game and doesn’t undermine it. On an unrelated note, the same isn’t the case with the MMO. -There’re some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hilarious and exceptional characters. HK-47 kicks ♥♥♥. -Combat is pretty damn neat, and becomes more satisfying as you progress through the game. Not everyone will love it, though. CONS-Throughout a lot of the game, you may find yourself doing busywork that takes far too long based almost always on where you have to go. A certain mission sends you back and forth through an entire city twice, which is infuriatingly needless. Additionally, any who were a fan of the “RETURN TO EBON HAWK” feature will have to do without this time around. -There are times when your goal is not clear. The mission overview page could rely a little less on my memory, as it often lists only what I’ve done and what *will* happen, but not what I need to do. -Not all will be a fan of the UI, or the aesthetic – though personally, I like them both. There are places where textures go beyond horrific, but thankfully the majority of the game is free from that. -Thanks to Disney, the game technically isn’t canon. The most we’ve gotten in terms of that is a reference to a planet in the original game, as far as I know. I don’t know why playing non-canon stuff would be an issue, but I imagine someone out there will have a problem with it in one way or another. “Ugh, I’ve tainted myself with “extended universe” filth!”- Music can bug out and become repetitive. - Audio can fluctuate at times, forcing you to rip off your headset and smash your ‘lower volume’ key with a clenched fist. -Voice acting noticeably varies in quality. At times certain characters will suddenly sound as though they’re a different person (because it *is* a different person behind the voice). It ruins my immersion, I tell you!-Some characters could use a little love. For example, Nihilus - the guy in the skull-y looking mask - has very little established story, though what story there about him is certainly engaging. ---STORY - (Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil anything.)This is the jewel of the game - again, much like its predecessor. KotOR II has a story that tugs at my heart, in no small part due to KotOR. If you want to delve into a world that’s chock full of lore surrounding the Force as well as the Star Wars universe at large, then KotOR II is the world for you. Now, as a recommendation before I go any further, the story of KotOR II is hugely complemented by the first game. Whilst it isn’t necessarily crucial to play KotOR first and KotOR II is perfectly capable of standing on its own legs, there are quite a few references to characters and the plot that won’t quite make sense, which would be a travesty in my eyes. KotOR itself, though, certainly has a story that stands better by itself than KotOR II could, as KotOR II makes references that without the existence of KotOR would make far less sense and have barely any impact. If you’re someone that takes a great interest in the Force, paying attention to key details in both games will go a long way. *Sorry for spamming “KotOR” there. The intertwined stories of the two games intimidate me, as a wishfully aspiring author. Now, whilst this opinion is subjective, I genuinely believe that the story (including the first game) lives up to the movie saga itself – an opinion I’m sure I’m to receive a lot of flak for. However, there is absolutely no doubt that the lore of KotOR II is immense, and if coupled with lore from KotOR, they far surpass the lore in the saga – I suspect that nearly all who’ve taken their time with this game(s) will agree with me. There is little I can say about the story without spoiling it, so I can really only recommend that you experience it for yourself. The ‘protagonist’ of the full story is to this day my favourite character in anything. Yes, I even like them more than the likes of Vader, Master Chief and Solid Snake. (to be fair I’ve only played a bit of Metal Gear.) Perhaps that’s because I was a lot younger when I first played KotOR, but I stand by my love for the protagonist. PLOT: The plot of KotOR II keeps the pace going and cuts off loose ends from KotOR, resulting in a very tidy story, with a small few exceptions – important questions that the more curious players may have asked themselves in the first game have been answered in a very satisfying way. It doesn’t need to stand on KotOR’s plot - the story of the Exile is just as enthralling as that of the former game. CHARACTERS AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT: There are noticeable improvements on character development in this game. The characters that surround you on your journey are very in-depth, and less predictable than the previous game’s characters were. A few welcome faces from KotOR also join the mix, something that strummed my nostalgia-guitar to a mellow tune – if you were a fan of say, T3-M4 and HK-47, you’ll be pleased to know they’re back. The only issue I can say I have with this is that you may not get a chance to interact fully with all the characters in one playthrough, especially if it’s your first time. Then again, that’s what replays are for, right? PACINGThis comes down to the player, for the most part. The sooner you get into high gear, the sooner you can blitz through the story if you want that. Given that it’s a game full of stuff to loot, chances are the pacing will be right for you – whether you want to get it over and done with – running past loot – or if you want to take your time and soak in the world. CONCLUSIONBuy it. It’s seriously an incredible experience that no one should go without. Better yet, buy the original and play that first, then this. I’m always going to have memories of this game and the original, and will fondly take them to my grave. If I were to assign it a rating (which I disagree with but some insist on having them in reviews) I’d give it a perfect ten, which is something I don’t think I’m going to do much in my life.			"

												Hello people of the Internet and welcome to my review for KOTOR II, I won't keep you waiting so I'll just cut to the chase. but before that I shall have you kno0w:I own KOTOR II as a physical copy back in 2008 still have till this dad and played it for years and completed it a least a few dozen times, yes thats how much I played the game and I hope you take my word for it .SW:KOTOR II____________KOTOR II is a sequel to the original game KOTOR , a game made by OBSIDIAN Entertainment along with associating with LucasArts.Now for a quick summary for the plot :Summary:KOTOR II takes place approximately 5 years after KOTOR,the first game, you are unconsious on the Ebon Hawk and soon awake on Peragus, inside a mining facility, there you will meet Kreia , one who is strong with the force and will be your guide to guide you through the game, you also meet Atton, the typical smugglers with charms, as you continue through the story you meet new companions which i will not name for the sake of spoilers. Your character is also known as the Exile, your character is exiled from the Jedi Council because you went fighting with Revan for the Mandalorian Wars the rest of the backstory and all is up for you to find out, young padawan.Gameplay:Gameplay is similiar to KOTOR, its the same pause and turn-based combat (if thats what it is). This time around KOTOR II is alot easier than KOTOR, such new gameplay elements include health regeneration which KOTOR I lacked in. You can still level the same attributes and feats and Force powers, however you like so each game through will be different considering the classes you choose and the choices you make.Graphics:Dating back to 2003 for KOTOR I in comparison for KOTOR II, graphical-wise it isnt much of an improvement, but i will say it has improved and is still pretty decents depending on your point of view or perspective. I MUST SAY THE HUD THIS TIME AROUND IS ALOT BETTER THAN KOTOR I, in KOTOR I your HUDS were the size of the a mint, so the HUD improvement from KOTOR I is well appreciated.Final Verdict:(8/10)Though the story for KOTOR II is not as interesting to me as KOTOR I, KOTOR II holds a dear place in my heart and no doubt in a few weeks time , you will see me playing the game over and over again just to experience the story all over again :D. So basically if you want a cheap Star Wars RPG at this time and age you wanna get the KOTOR franchises, because their drive on story and decision-making is amazing at tijmes the voice-acting is pretty convicing it makes me feel bad for being a bad guy on some occasions , so put on your Jedi robes, arm your lightsabers and charge right in this game, young exile  and May the Force Be with You.

												When I bought KotOR, playing it was just epic. After KotOR II was released, I decided to get it as soon as I could. I can say, it was, just like KotOR, one of the best investments I could have done. The game itself offers that much of a story, you can replay it and replay it and replay it. But due to my own stupidity, I lost the CD somehow and due to that, buying it again in store never happened. It changed when I saw it on Steam's Sale for 3,99EUR. Bought it and replayed it again. The best what could happen was the release of achievements. A couple of days ago, it caught me again, because I wanted to get all the achievements for one of my childhood games (plzz Steam do it for more old games :DDD). Now, several days later, I got them all and decided to write this review.I hope, that I might encourage people to buy/play it just like other aged games. Besides, both KotOR and KotOR II are must haves for StarWars fans :D.Regards,Wick			"

												I came for the nostalgia,Yet  I stayed becuase this is a genuinely damn good game.Setting aisde this is a Star Wars game, this game is great, the graphics have aged decently, still can feel immserive at times. Combat is fun as long as you don't mind the pause aspect, and the story while slow to the start, is deep and interesting at times. Now throwing the fact that this IS a Star Wars game back into the mix, if you are thinking of replaying for the nostalgia, you won't be disappointed, it really held up well, and for those who haven't touched it before, BUY IT, and PLAY IT. SWTOR1&2 were great Star Wars installments, among the best in the entirety of Star Wars games, the story and atmospheres are great and it won't be long before SWTOR2 is re-released on the Unreal4 engine, or so it's said. Which it absolutely deserves. IMO the first game is better, better story hands down, better environments, etc, but unfortunately SWTOR didn't hold up well and while the Steam version has a positive rating, it doesn't live up to expectations like it's sequel. Hopefully the original will get the same love and care that this title got, and the developers who currently hold the license will update it and get it into the state it should be. For now, stick with this game, it's frickin awesome.			"

												Black Isle Studios/Obsidian really are THE best at making fantastic and ambitous RPGs, the made a better D&D game than Bioware called Planescape Tourment, they made Fallout 2, they made a better Star Wars RPG than Bioware and the made a better Fallout game then Bethesda (FO:NV). Totally recommended, but I would also recommend the first game as well since that game is still REALLY good, this one is just much better (with TSLRCM, of course)!			"

												10/10 A++   (I run El Capitan on Mac)  I've been pulled back in the Star Wars franchise by the new movie, and recently played through both KOTOR games for the first time.  After throughly enjoying KOTOR, I honestly doubted if KOTOR II could live up to the first game, and hearing how it was rushed and incomplete-ish, I wasn't expecting that much out of it.  Boy was I wrong!!  Gameplay wise, there were a lot of small things that were improvements upon the first game (e.g. when you find a datapad it pops up right then so you can read it instead of having to search through all your belongings for it; your health points heal slowly when you're not in battle even without having to use a medpac, footlocked/corpse say whether they are empty if you've already looted them, no more really difficult to beat turret battles that you have to get through to continue the game!!!)The storyline and characters are wonderful.  There are so many well-nuanced, non-traditional-trope-following characters.  Kreia and the Exile are awesome.  Darth Nihilus is one of the best-designed scariest-looking Sith from the Star Wars Universe ever.  The storyline (to me at least) felt rich and complete up until the final planet/boss showdown.  Even with the Restored Content Mod (which is essential, by the way), the last level did feel rushed, empty, and incomplete-ish.  However, to me it still was a fairly-satisfying conclusion to the game.    I had a few small problems with bugs (namely on Nar Shaddaa and one at the beginning of Telos, so I recommend saving often and having save files available).  All-in-all, I really enjoyed this game and overall found it just as good if not better than the first KOTOR game.			"

												Kotor 2 for a long time has been praised and also criticized since it first released over 10 years ago. Obsidian, again working on a tight schedule(why does it happen to them all the time) still managed to put together one of the best story rpgs ever and now with the addition of the TSLRCM mod improves it to epic status. Its easily one of the best games i have ever played and the story and especially the characters are simply amazing from start to finish.In the game you play as Jedi(duh) who has been exiled due to you following 2 rouge Jedi into the Mandalorin wars. This exile has made you forget/ lose(hello? Amnesia) the force and your journey is about regaining that knowledge whether it be for light, dark or not at all. While on your journey you will also be dodging and fighting the Sith who believe you are the last of the jedi and your death will bring them an ultimate victory of the galaxy. And of course you will also be doing all that awesome RPG stuff of crafting, leveling, building a team, and making choices.I probably consider Mass Effect 2 as the pinnacle when discussing character, story driven RPG's but after Kotor 2....damn its close. And i don't know which is better but thats a great argument to have among fans. The party you build in Kotor 2 is as mysterious, scary, lovable, funny and dark that, like in mass effect, i could not wait to talk to them. Not only are all conversations engaging, but they are brought to life by probably by the best group of voice actors assembled for a video game. I cant recall one voice who does not represent the character they portray nor a voice who was weak, or just plain bad. I can finally understand the appeal and praise for the assassin droid HK-47 who I will never forgot, or Kreia, Atton, Bau-Dor, Mandalore, Mira, and Visas. All memorable in their own unique way and lets not forget about their ship the Ebon Hawk which i will glady place along side the likes of the Millenium Falcon, Normandy and Enterprise.The game play for Kotor 2 is real -time, pausable turn based combat. As you enter combat you can place 4 orders/ turns per character but you will be changing them constantly depending on enemies. In combat you can choose an active skill, buffs, combat stance which is very important and of course force powers. These powers and skills will all be rewarded as you level your character and progress through the story. The level up system is very deep for skills but the point system is i dont know how to explain but i always just hit ""recommend"" after the 3rd or 4 th level. Maybe too many points are given?One of Obsidians staple for their games are choice and Kotor 2 does not disappoint. Of course you being a Jedi your choice is obvious light or dark but the the way it is presented in writing makes it clear. There are no shades of gray for your choice. Those choices carry through to the end as well as what party members you will be able to recruit. There is also a rewarding crafting system though its a lot to absorb at the start but becomes a little easier to understand after a few trial and errors. You will be able to craft equipment, weapons and medicine but because of the limited interface and ease to compare items i used it sparingly. The game is not difficult even on the hardest difficulty and loot is plentiful so crafting is really just an option and not necessity.This is still a 10 year old game and not without noticeable game play staples of today. I would have given a left nut for fast travel, a better UI, and when crafting the ability to compare items and a simple who has what equipped. i dont actually know all the details of what the MOD fixed other than adding lost content, but graphically it looks sharp and the combat with some new added animations looked really cool. Kotor 2 is another amazing title from Obsidian and with the help of dedicated fans has not only preserved it for another generation but polished it to the diamond status it deserves. I finished the game a few days ago and still thinking about choices, characters and the story. Awesome game.Positives:One of the best Story, Character driven RPGs ever made and equals Mass Effect 2 in every wayIt maybe the best voice acting(including robots) cast everGraphics are dated but they still look sharp and the light saber battles look really good.RPG goodness everywherei want to immediately restart and go down the other pathNegatives The UI needs updated. I would rather see an MMO type toolbar than what is in place.You cant compare items and when crafting it just says ""equipped"" but doesnt say by whoA lot of running back and forth and sometimes, where do i go?The point distribution for leveling feels too rewarding? A little easy even on hard difficultyObsidian are not doing a complete remake or working on Kotor 3 Few notes: I played the game on my laptop with mouse and k/b at 1080P with only the TSLRCM mod installed. I experienced 2 hard crashes and i lost my cloud save? once.  To me these are minor and non issue.Steam shows playtime around 63 hrs which i feel is accurate. I tried to do everything, i talked to everyone and even played Pazzak.I am huge RPG fan and Obsidian/Black Isle are my favorite RPG developers. I had held off from playing Kotor 2 because of the constant crashes and problems that seemed to plague the game on initial release.			"

Ony game I've played that you can agree to free someone's girlfriend from slavery, then bring her to him and tell him she's your slave now right to his face, then make her dance for money. Gameplay is fun but gets repetitive, and has some difficulty spikes (better start training Atton). Fortunately the story is so interesting you can't stop playing it.			"

												Kotor 2 was a mixed bag for a lot of fans of the first game. The game is a lot more cerebral then it`s predecessor.The original Kotor was a nice game with a ``Gather your friends and save the galaxy`` plotline. In this game you`re dealing with the fallout of the actions of the previous game. It`s a lot darker of a storyline and it has a nice climax when it ends.The voice acting is simply breathtaking and the storyline itself top notch. Just bare in mind that Kotor 2 was rushed on release and as such a large portion of content was cut out. Thankfully modders have restored most of it since then, so I recommend googling Kotor 2 restored content mod if you want to fully experience this game how the developers intended.			"

												Note: Didn't realize this was on Steam until today. Rest assured I've played the hell out of it. This is the perfect example of a sequel that outstrips it's predecessor in every way. KOTOR2 features the same great combat and exploration (6 planets! 7 if you include the tutorial zone, and 8 if you count the removed one.) The game has GREAT writing, really deconstructing the basic good versus evil methology of Star Wars. Lots of great quests, your own ship, and lots of unique companion characters. Best Star Wars game, period. Be sure to grab the Restored Content mod, though. Without Restored Content: 8/10With Restored Content: 9.5/10			"

												Luke, did I ever tell you about Darth Maul? He was Sheev's apprentice before Dooku and Vader that used a double-bladed lightsaber. He fought against my master Qui-Gon on Naboo, and managed to kill him. Fortunately, even though I was still a Padawan I managed to cut him in half by taking advantage of the fact that he didn't know how to use the High Ground. However, it turned out that his hate somehow allowed him to survive getting cut in half and falling down a bottomless pit, and he somehow managed to escape from Naboo and become a cyborg spider on some other planet. Years later, during the Clone Wars, his brother Savage Opress found him and upgraded his cyborg legs. They went on a rampage across the Galaxy, trying to get revenge both on me and his former master Sheev. It's such a pity that he never told anyone that Sheev was a Sith Lord, that would have saved us a lot of trouble. They eventually took over Mandalore and killed the only woman I had ever loved right in front of me. After that I kind of lost track of him, not sure what became of him. I hope he's doing well, he was a good friend.			"

												Star Wars : Knights Of Old The Republic II - one of the best RPGs of its time. Story - the strongest part of game play. The game is present magnificent pumping system. Apart from the usual skills ( blaster, knives, armor, etc.) and characteristics ( Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, etc.) are present perks that allow a character, such as hacking, repairing or first-aid. The game also has Jedi Force, like healing, lightning, acceleration, suffocation, exhaustion life. They are divided into three types: Good , Neutral and Evil. As its name suggests, the Jedi force depends on your side. You can choose who you want to become, evil Sith or Jedi Master. All depends on your moral choices. You're choose, help the poor merchant defend himself from poachers or kill everyone and take all the money merchant. Tactical combat system is very convenient and effective. To give orders to the whole detachment enough just a couple of seconds. Also can not be noted that the game has a great soundtrack! With this music is associated very many fond memories. This is a great game, any fan of Star Wars or RPGs must play it.			"

												If you don't want to look in depth of what my review is on my score is 8.5/10 Pros: Immersive, Lore-Friendly Gameplay. Choices make you feel more involved with the game's outcome. Character Customization is has many options & gear to choose from. Combat is strategic and immersive.  Many characters with different traits that expect you to convince characters to your liking with the many dialogue options.Cons: MINOR Bugs that you collide into a wall and it interferes with combat. MAJOR Some choices that you make will make the game unwinnable, thus you not being able to complete the game. MINOR Although I said the choices make you feel immersed into the gameplay with the many dialogue options, there are many situations where you can only make one choice thus making the user feel more restricted and less immersed. However there may have been known mods that create more immersive choices. MINOR Some areas in the game are very small and  can make you backchannel a lot and may get confused with the direction in where you're going in some parts. A good example is when you make it to Taris after leaving Peragus you have roughly 4-5 zones to explore and which you'll be backtracking where to go and what to do at some points.Overall this game is very good but with some drawbacks that can be overlooked without too much thought being put in. Star Wars Knights of the Republic II: The Sith Lords is a very good game and it should be condemed as such. If you are interested in an immersive Star Wars RPG, then you have come to the right place. Feel free to explore and fight your way through the galaxy of Star Wars, with your choice of either to become apart of the dark or to be ascended into the light. I hope you found this review helpful and thumbs up if you did.			"

												There has never been a better bunch of ragtag heroes to save the galaxy. Whether they are likeable, evil or a little psychotic there is no better company to shoot up thugs with a couple of blasters and a lightsaber. Honestly this is the only game i consider not skipping every sentence a Companion or NPC has to say. This remains one of the very few Star Wars RPGs out there and is definetly worth a play (especially if you are new to the story). Choices actually matter, the companions are useful and interesting, and to top it off the story is strong and has depth. The ending for KOTOR fans can be a little disapointing, but it doesn't change the fact star wars fans SHOULD 100% buy this game. (Probably should pick up KOTOR 1 as well whilst you're at it, probably has the stronger story - companions can be more one dimensional at times though)			"

												When I was a young kid, no older than 8, I was obsessed with Star Wars, and so my parents got me KOTOR 1 and eventually KOTOR 2 to play. About a year ago, I picked them up on Steam and played KOTOR 1 through again, and it was fun. But then I played KOTOR 2 again (this time with the Restored Content mod and the droid planet mod). And then I played it through again. And then a third time. And then a fourth. This game's story is incredible, the options the player is given are many, and the companions you meet are interesting. This has quickly become one of my favorite games.I think the only way you will like this game is if you are a Star Wars lore fan, even if the story this game tells is not technically canon anymore. There was a recent update to this game on Steam, adding a Workshop for mods, including the Restored Content mod. If you are going to play this game, you MUST install that mod. It includes a lot of content that the developers were not able to get in the game by launch due to time restrictions given by LucasArts. Save often and in different slots. Even with the mods and recent updates, there are bugs and the game can crash and the game can corrupt a save file. Awesome game. Most definitely recommended.			"

												As the preceding game, KotOR II is one of those classics everyone who digs RPGs should play before they die. It was released ridden with bugs because of humanity's base Christmas instincts and I remember having to do a lot of 'hacking' to even get to see the main menu back in 2004. It's said the devs having to rush it resulted in a weirdly incomplete final planet and ending, but I've always been mildly disappointed with the drabness of the first one, Peragus, and it seems I'm not alone in this as there's even a 'skip Peragus' mod out there. One of the many glitches I actually like - infinite Hssiss ('dark side lizards') on Korriban - going to the Sith homeworld and returning incredibly powerful totally fits the roleplay going on in my brain.KotOR 2 is generally exquisite though. It's a lot more complex and dark than the first episode. In KotOR I you were usually given the choice of being either a preachy goody-two-shoes Luke or a butthurt homicidal maniac. The Sith Lords offers shades of grey, even if not quite 50. All the accolades Kreia has received are deserved.Characters with motives alike hers are often the most intriguing in storytelling as a longing for the void is something us muggles can probably never quite wrap our heads around. Making the game truly revolve around you, the main character, helps immersion quite a bit. The influence system fits into the lore very well and I'm pretty sure it's the first game where you can twist your NPC companions quite as much. 'Best Star Wars game ever' rings true, I'd be hard pressed to name any other title that comes close.Too bad we were deprived of KotOR III.			"

												Moody and philosophical, brilliantly written and filled with multi-layered characters, immersive and emotionally involving, Knights of the Old Republic 2 is a fantastic game and one of the best stories in the Star Wars universe. It has its share of flaws - the gameplay is rather dull, level design repetitive, graphics outdated even at the time of release. It was also originally released in an incomplete form, but this has since been fixed by a group of dedicated fan who created the The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification. Despite all the flaws, the game succeeds in what matters - sending the player on a memorable journey and leaving such an impact that all these years after its release I still can't get enough of it. Hopefully, one day it will get a sequel it deserves.			"

												Excellent RPG that still holds up after many years. Combat is turn based but remarkably streamlined and versatile.  The animations and cutscenes are somewhat primitive by today's standards, but still succeed in conveying a very compelling narrative and world. You can definitely enjoy this game whether you are a Star Wars fan or not.The real strength of KOTOR 2 is found in its variety of playstyles and dialogue options - you will definitely need multiple playthroughs to catch everything this title has to offer. Playing the first game is definitely recommended for a full grasp of the setting, but not mandatory by any means.Also a perfect example of a compatability update done right. The added controller support greatly improves gameplay and acheivements are appreciated as well. Still waiting on a similar patch for KOTOR 1.			"

												I have played this game with the restored content mod, most of my play time is off record. I've only experienced a few bugs in the game, and overall have thoroughly enjoyed it. I prefer the first one, which is a game I've played through many times.This game is more ""deep"" then KOTOR 1, and some of the characters are arguably more dynamic. The story in this game is more complex than in KOTOR 1, however, I enjoy KOTOR 1's story more than I do in this game.If you've never played this game, or the first one, than definetly play KOTOR 1 than if you're interested play this. The KOTOR games are true classics, and the graphics don't hold the game back at all. In this day and age where consumers often judge a game on it's graphics, it's nice to play a video game with enough depth where the graphics don't effect it at all.			"

												TL;DR: One of my favorite games ever. KotOR II takes all mechanics that KotOR had and makes them better, plus it adds a ton of new stuff. The companion influence system is one of the most interesting, deep and rewarding to be found in all of gaming history. You get different companions based on your force alignment and sex, and interacting with your companions will not only give you access to lots of personal background and general lore, but also lots of special unlocks - force powers, abilities, and new classes for your followers. The only downside to its vastness is probably that you never will be able to experience all of it in one go - you'll even need at least 2 runs to merely recruit all possible followers, and then probably some to reach maximum influence with all of them (or, use some of the various influence guides on the web). The characters never fail to attract my interest, and draw me into their stories - almost everyone has more to them than meets the eye at first. There are also lots of scenes of banter between you companions aboard the player ship, some of which are hilarious while others are dark and sinister, which lets you experience many different facets of their personalities, and many of them are also based upon your influence with the different companions. There are new force powers, as well as different fighting stances and 'force forms' which let you customize your style of play even more. For example: your a Jedi Master with nearly unlimited force use but a little squishy in hand to hand combat? Use a force form which makes your force attacks more powerful, at the cost of greater drain of your force points - of which you have more than enough anyway. Or you're a Sith Marauder who slays his enemies solely with his lightsaber? Adapt to every situation by employing stances which give you higher blaster deflection, increased defense against multiple melee fighters, or greater attack and defense against a single lightsaber-wielding opponent.Crafting is expanded and more useful, too. For example, lightsabers can be upgraded with 5 different components (2 crystals, energy cell, emitter, and focusing lens) instead of the 2 crystals only, as in KotOR. There are a lot more robes for Force users, with various boni to them, and they also look a lot better than those in KotOR. The story is a bit of a divisive point - some feel its attempt at analyzing the eternal light side vs dark side struggle and putting some moral ambiguity into it strays too far from the star wars formula. Yet, like many people, I think it's the most interesting thing that has been done in a star wars story ever. Overall the story is quite dark and at times melancholy in its tone, which is also aided by the game's fantastic soundtrack. I still don't tire of the atmosphere and the stories of the game, even 10 years after I originally played this game (and countlessly replayed it since). The 2015 update which brings support for widescreens and high definitions is the perfect excuse to finally play this game (again), and with steam workshop support it's easier than ever to experience what the game was meant to be, thanks to the incredibly great TSL restored content mod and the M4-78 enhancement project, which even adds a planet that missed completely in the original release of the game. I definitely recommend to get those mods, but I also loved the original, admittedly unfinished version. If you can't stand open endings, TSLRCM is an absolute MUST.			"

												A little bit rough around the edges, but it offers improved gameplay and a more complex story than the first, and a bit more role-playing thanks to a greater variety of dialogue choices.  It was clearly rushed by LucasArts though, and this can be obvious at times; not just because of the bugs but also with some of the characters who clearly weren't developed as much as Obsidian intended.  Despite this, it's an outstanding game with far more role-playing than pretty much any present day RPG, much like its predecessor, and the story is one of the best there is in gaming.It has recently been updated with native widescreen and high refresh rate support, so now you can just get The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod and enjoy the game.

												 Graphics: For an 05 game, it looks pretty damn good (if you have a good graphics card, that is). Keep in mind though that it 'is' a 2005 game, so don't expect anything incredible. 8/10Story: Here is where TSL shines. I have quite honestly never played a Star wars game with such in depth writing. From the deep and well thought out exploration of the moral grey areas between the Light and Dark sides of the Force to the deviously intricate, and VERY well written main quest, KOTOR II's writing is nothing short of incredible. 10/10Characterization: This of course ties in with the aforementioned excellent writing. The characters in this game feel more like living, breathing people, and less like the one dimensional caricatures of KOTOR 1. The addition of a good influence character influence system (you can't just give characters gifts to 'make' them like you ala Dragon age: Origins) that prevents you from pleasing everyone increses my score from what would have been a 9.5/10 to an outright 10/10Combat: Combat is greatly improved over KOTOR I's rather basic system. As you improve your combat feats, they don't just become more effective: they change visably as well, becoming more graceful, powerful, and masterful-looking all the time. 9.5/10General overview: I probably should rate the game's overall sound quality, but i'm not very good at distinguishing good game audio from bad due to hearing issues. Sorry about that. Overall, i would rate this game a 9.5/10. Besides Battlefronts 1 and 2 and Star Wars Galaxies, KOTOR II is one of the best Star Wars experiences you will ever have (BE SURE to download the Restored Content mod, as it will unlock much of the content that Obsidian was forced to cut out due to LucasArts' unreasonably short Christmas Deadline).

												By far the most amazing underrated game i have ever played, KOTOR 2 was a shining beacon in my childhood. Right from the start the game throws you into a suspenseful story, and it never lets up. Unlike KOTOR 1, where you can clearly define right and wrong (lightside/darkside options), KOTOR 2 muddies the lines that define good and evil and has you make tough decisions, with the early acquired and amazingly well written and voiced companion character ""Kreia"", further blurring those already hard-to-see lines. You want to help that poor homeless man on Nar Shadda by giving him credits? Think again, because that same act of kindess can make him a target to his fellow refugees.But what really pulls everything in in this admittedly rushed-yet-amazing game is the not just the complicated moral choices and quanderies, but the feeling of urgency. Wether you decide to stay on the tride and true path of the jedi, or break out as a rogue dark jedi/sith, you can never forget you are being hunted by what must be THE scariest sith lords ever designed. Obsidian definitly took an already amazing game and, in my opinion, made it better than the original.Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of bugs and holes in some parts of the story, but what IS there is a fascinating take on that Galaxy Far, Far Away.My rating 9.5/10Edit: Finally, Steam and Lord Gaben (of the Sith) has finally decided to fully support KOTOR II in all it's glory! with the TSLRCM, I can safely say now, without a shadow of a doubt, that this game is a MUST BUY! Gone are the slightly annoying bugs, and in with the refined content.My edited rating with full steam support and TSLRCM: 10/10 would kill the galaxy and all the jedi again			"

												""You were whole."" Let me start by saying that the game is largely incomplete in it's vanilla state. Large sections of the game were cut due to time constraints, a tragedy. This game is great without all the content, and I believe I speak for everyone who has played this game that it could have been so much greater had LucasArts given Obsidian the time required to complete it. Knights of the Old Republic III was eventually cancelled, leaving many fans wondering just exactly what happened. Later on, an MMO was made by BioWare in an attempt to complete the saga, to many fans distaste. A book titled Revan was written to bridge the gap between the MMO and this game, however it wasn't the KotOR 3 we asked for. ""Also, in private, we will be mercifully free from the opinions of imbeciles and fools."" Knights of the Old Republic II is a major improvement upon the first game. Don't get me wrong, the first is one of  if not the greatest RPG of all time, but the whole Good/Evil thing is overdone throughout Star Wars and Obsidian changed that a good bit with the sequel (""If you are to truly understand, then you will need the contrast, not adherence to a single idea."") . Rather than having the typical BioWare Good, Evil, and Neutral option, the game presents you with hard choices and makes you think. Perhaps by giving credits to the poor beggar, you have only made his life harder for him. Any who believe that BioWare should be making KotOR 3 and not Obsidian is sadly mistaken.""Find what you were looking for amongst the dead?"" This game despite it's age still has an active modding community, whether it be weapons, armor, or even some updated textures to make the game feel and look much newer than it is. The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod adds back the cut content that was left in the game's code, and the M4-78 enhancement project adds the planet that was cut from the game, designed from the ground up by a modding team who deserves a round of applause. *presses applause button*Oh, and LucasArts, if you're reading this...""You have failed me.

												Meatbag!A new update to the game after 10 years? Awesome.Like the first game, this is a must play for Star Wars & RPG fans.Before starting a new game make sure you have the Restored Content Mod installed from the Steam Workshop as it adds a bunch of cut content from the original release.With the Restored Content Mod installed, this game is arguably as good as if not better than KOTOR 1.

												The Sith Lords proved an imperfect, incomplete and yet paradoxically fantastic epic for an era in RPGs. It can't be defined by what it did right, (the industry-standard that was the first game in the series could be summed-up in such terms) but by those exceptional moments it offers the player in a way no other game by my recollection, has replicated since. The Sith Lords has a botched ending, dated graphics, and ""bare-bones""/minimalistic gameplay by today's standards- falling short in total of anyone's most basic expectations. On paper, it's failure. And yet, despite what little Oblivion did to encite players, lacking the usual flashy bells and whistles that commcerials are made of, it somehow manages to introduce the subject of the story, to a universe which is rich in lore, life, and charm. From the very beginning, you are awoken, injured and alone, aboard what looks to be an abandoned mining facility. The first few moments you spend collecting yourself, is in a morgue with an old, creepy, cryptic women, who shares with you her thoughts on your predicament. From there, you traverse the empty, earie halls of the base in search of answers which are few and far between, encountering next to no one in the process- (Spoilers) save for a handful of murderous mining droids, and the last holo recordings of a crew not long for this world: a bleak outlook to say the least. The atmosphere here is palpable- permeating with a sense of emptiness, mysticism, and awe along the way,  setting the tone for much to come. The unknown is a key theme from beginning to end, as you embark on a journey of self-discovery, putting back toghether the peices of your past, which if you played the first game, should be a familar feature. As you unravel the secrets of the Jedi and Sith, who have more or less, droped-off the face of galaxy- adding to the strangeness of it all, especially for a Star Wars game- you begin to fall deeper and deeper into a thick plot which is all consuming, and from which there is no recourse. But i'd better leave it at that, and focus on a few features which make the game: Dialogue: The voice acting here is par none -in both writing and cadance- with some of the most memorable lines of any game, that will leave you thinking long after you've played your first time through- and if you do pick it up, it will have you going back to pick apart what was meant here or there. Conversation drives the story, so careful attention to what is being conveyed is a must to make sense of whats going on, and from there, what choices to make. Characters: Each is unique, and with all there is to find out about them, I found myself loving or hating them with no such feelings in between. Which is an unavoidable consiquence of the influence system: a game mechanic that just means favoring one character (in dialogue) tends to ♥♥♥♥ off other characters. This adds another dimension to your light/dark side options, and the closer you get to some characters, the more you will get to know them and vice versa (the less the rest will tell you.) Their own personal plots come with alot of baggage to swift through, and dark backrounds to confront, with reveals which are the highlight of the game. Choices: Don't be fooled by Mass Effect and it's ilk; Knights of the Old Republic practically invented player-driven progression, with but a handful of forebarers to draw from. If you do play it, I think you will find that the choices that are available in this game, far surpass those offered by others RPGs. What you say and do matters in this game, and you feel it both in the consiquences and rewards. The impact of each is immediate and meaningful, which, depending on your path, will pan out one way or another in the ending. For every flaw you find in the Sith Lords, two great things pop up. My favorite game of all time, the Sith Lords is a must for story-loving RPG players- and I don't even hardly play or much like RPG's on the whole; I'm a strategy guy- But this story speaks to me and has left it's mark on how I see fiction, stretching the genre to the limit of it's creative ends, and leaving me with impossible expectations of what passes for a good plot on the market today.

												In some ways, it is stronger than the first game. The influence system is terrific as well as the storyline. HOWEVER: It is only stronger if you mod the hell out of it. You'll at least want  TSR, if nothing else.  Downloading some other attended content ones is suggested, as well as ones to make it look better.Your gameplay is about the same as KOTOR, with some added force powers. YAY FORCE POWERS. There's two romances for the females and two for the males, unlike the one you were locked too without cheats in the first one. *cough*Juhaniromancemods*cough*. I also suggest using KSE because some places are a total ♥♥♥♥♥ and a half to get through.All in all, it's a good game and well worth it. KOTOR is still in my top 5 games of all time and this one isn't, but it's worthwihle.			"

												One of my FAVORITE RPGs ever with the restored content mod. Seriously, like, Planescape good. Pick it up, and install TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod) before playing, and it's a masterpiece. When I played this game as a kid, I was kinda upset about the ending and the way the characters felt kinda incomplete and unsettling. The mod clears all that up, fixing the unfixable by implementing the content that was cut to make Lucasarts' absurd Xmas release date. Definitely an experience I'd reccommend to anyone who loves a good story and doesn't mind a few technical inconsistencies			"

												TL;DR: Prepare to become the hobbit that sits in their mothers basement, making calls for buckets to put excrement in, as you will refuse to get up and go to the bathroom. 10/10 would ♥♥♥♥ my pants again. Very much the same type of game as Dragon Age: Origins. Turn based strategy rpg, so if you don't like tactical games where you have to think about your every move, this is not the game for you. As long as you don't have a brick for a computer, anything should be able to run this game fairly smoothly.I have completed KOTOR1 on both the Xbox, and on PC (though it is not in my steam library). And I must say this game stands up to its predecessor very well. You will want to get the Restored Content Mod from the Workshop as this adds much more to the game. With the most recent steam update, you can play in larger resolutions. There is no reason not to purchase this game as well as the original. You will find yourself lost in the story, gameplay, and much more. There is much replay value, you will never make the same choices as you did the previous play through, as there is a Karma system (Light Side & Dark Side). Become a Jedi, or Sith Lord? The choice is yours.Please do yourself a favor and buy these (As they're both currently on sale for $2.49 each! What a steal for 20+ hours of gameplay for each game, not including the Restored Content + other mods)			"

												I highly recommend this game, it has what is in my opinion the best story out of any game I've ever played. If you have never played this and decide to get it, keep these things in mind: The game is super old, and not everything it does has held up over the years.The game was released unfinished and unpolished, so it is *highly* suggested that before you even start the game for the first time you download the Restored Content mod. Due to the age of the game, don't expect the most amazing graphics ever.This is the type of game that will expect you to occasionally solve fairly challenging puzzles and will *not* hold your hand through some of the more challenging areas. As thus, don't be afraid to reference guides if you get stuckThere are occasionally game breaking bugs, but those are super rare and generally very easy to fix. With that, I hope you enjoy the game.			"

												Amazing complement to the first game.  Whereas the first game has a very ""New Hope"" kind of feel to it; a very classic Star Wars type heroic tale of galatic grandeur, this game delves into the more personal and darker elements of the Star Wars universe.  Character development is extremely thorough and integral to the story, along with the tremendous focus on party member relations.  Improves on all fronts.  Easily a top five pick for me.  Worth $10, but sometimes it goes on sale for as low as $5 or $2.50.  At that rate, there's no reason not to put it on your wishlist.			"

												I began playing the Knights of the Old republic series when the first game came out, but grew significantly more attached to the plot and characters of KOTOR 2, compared to the first KOTOR. What the game lost when LucasArts rushed it out the door for a Christmas release, it more than made up for itself due to a colorful cast, and (likely due to Chris Avellone's influence), a total disregard for the standard Star Wars fare of ""Light and Jedi good, Dark and Sith bad."" Grey heavily entered the equation, and this game attempts to honestly give you that sort of choice, as much as an offical Star Wars game can get. However, you must understand when playing this - this story isn't about Revan, per se, or the Jedi, or the Sith - it's about the Exile, and why you (the player, the Exile), went to war against the Mandolorians, why you chose to follow Revan and Malak - and why you came back. You chose your own ambitions, in far greater depth than KOTOR 1's typicaly ""Light Side/Dark Side"" choices. That isn't to say though that you should be any one specific thing on the sliding scale of morality in the game - far from it. This game is a million times more satisfying as any side of the Force though, compared to KOTOR 1, so instead of being a rather...comical imitation of a bad guy who electrocutes people in KOTOR 1, you can get deeper into the mental aspects of the dark side. The same is for the light, but the game (rather, Kreia and through her, totally Chris Avellone), WILL indeed slap you on the wrist for being either side than grey...Which is also a major thing.KOTOR 2 is a wonderful game, that clearly has inspired fans the world over to cling tightly to the runt of the two KOTOR games - but there's a damn good reason for that.Also don't expect to get much romance, but it's not like KOTOR 1 had oodles of that either, so to each their own. HK makes up for it though.			"

												No other game captures the ultimate STAR WARS experience apart from this!It was 11 years ago when I was just 5 that I got this game for my XBOX. Never ever ever did I play an RPG before, never understood them, believe it or not I hated the game the first 24 hours because I could not even get past the first door that requires (SPOILERS) you to use the torch in your inventory (NO MORE SPOILERS) and so after finally getting past that and understanding it more, I played on and completed it about 12 times, different characters, different paths, everytime with new dialogue options and story changes for me to take.Many years on when I first got my PC and Steam (Approx 5 years ago) the first game I bought was KOTOR and KOTOR 2. KOTOR 1 is an amazing game but I do not like the story as much, yes it has an amazing story and brilliant plot twist, but KOTOR 2 had amazing characters, Atton felt like a best friend, Kreia felt like a witch yet who knew what she was going on about. Many other companions had just brilliant stories, even though a few came over from KOTOR 1.I have sank many many many many hours into both the XBOX and PC versions of this game and now that KOTOR 2 has been updated (KOTOR 3 hint anybody ;) haha) and now has STEAM WORKSHOP with full 4-5K support and native resolution support. The game fits right at home, now is the best time to play this brilliant experience of a game, there is none other like it, believe me.1000/10			"

												This is the somewhat disappointing lead-up to the amazing first Kotor. It bears all the strengths of the first game. However, everything is kind of diluted and unfinished. The writing is great, but the plot less engaging; the characters are nice, but the dialogue is annoyingly open-ended; there are more powers and items, but the game mechanics are extremely broken; the game is longer, but there are idiotic gaps and missing content.You can talk through the same stuff over and over again with the NPCs. You can go light side weapon master and still spam force storm a hundred times in a fight. You can get in serious trouble by going to Nar Shaddaa as your first planet. Or by playing even one of the side characters in the wrong way. You can miss important bits of information if you don't choose the exactly right dialogue options. And so forth.I would still say it's worth playing through at least two times. Despite all its flaws and being in the shadow of its predecessor, it's still a great Star Wars RPG. It's not like we have that many of those around.			"

												I recently had the pleasure of replaying Knights of the Old Republic II with the Restored Content mod.  Taken as-is, KotOR II is a fantastic, if unfinished, successor to the first KotOR.  The fanmade Restored Content mod works to add in and finished content that didn't quite make it into the retail release while also stomping out the many bugs that plague the game.  It is an absolute must-have for the game.The game's main draw is its rather ambitious story, weaving a tale of shades of grey in the otherwise bipolar Star Wars universe.  Thematically, the game might even have less in common with Star Wars and be more of a cousin to the classic Planescape: Torment (a personal favorite), which is probably why I enjoy KotOR II even more than its outstanding predecessor.If you enjoyed the gameplay of Knights of the Old Republic and/or Obsidian's singular style of storytelling, give it a shot.

												I played this game on Xbox, it was the first game my brother and I ever bought together. Maybe I'm biased but I will break it down. Story:Pros:Rich story, plenty of fully voiced dialogue.As always, choose your own ending/path.Updated from KOTOR: Character influence/ability to convert companions to Jedi -- YES PLEASE!So good at making the player character ""special"" or all-important, which is crucial to a good RPG imo.Cons:THE ENDING. There is now a mod to help this but overall the build up was 100x overhyped for the provided ending, at least there's a solid ""first ending"" where you finish the jedi master story arch.You majorly have to choose which companions you want to be jedis and sacrifice influence with others in order to achieve this, there's no having your cake and eating it too. A lot of vague hints and questions, particularly involving Revan that will go unanswered forever. Combat:Pros:Many more force powers available, and with 30 extra levels, a chance to get all the ones you wantThough not as well-clarified as some games, the attributes you select will affect the combat immensely, thus your original build will affect how often you hit and how often enemies are ""saved"" when using force powers. You have the opportunity to really boost your combat in the area of your choice.Cons:EIther boring or constant pausing and tweaking, you don't control the movements, only which attacks/items are usedCombat is very basic, all roll based, your roll plus bonuses - their roll plus bonuses = hit/missThe powers/medical supplies/feats are all in their own scroll menu in combat, MMO style key-binding & self-assigned options would've improved the flow of combat much more. If you try to go for middle ground in your attribute choices, I find that you are all around mediocre in combat rather than balanced.Clumsy combat queue, if you want to use a medi-pac immediately, you have to go into the inventory menu or cancel combat before you select it. Otherwise it will queue, and you or your injured party member will likely die before it is used. The idea is good, because you can switch to other characters and choose their next 3 actions but it wasn't smooth. Gameplay:The graphics are dated now, but still not terriblePlenty of character options available, and an added Jedi/Sith Master Class option at level 15While you can choose any order of planets, after your first playthrough, you'll know better. It is better to do specific orders for the characters you want to become jedi. Look up a guide if you're a One-go-Joe.More lightsaber colors.Overall, it's well worth your time, I wish the original KOTOR had a lot of the elements that this one introduced. Every game has some glitches and now that there are a good number of fixes both on Steam workshop and Kotor II Nexus, this game has recovered from its disappointing brokenness to become the gem it always should have been. Just play it.			"

												I played this game a ton when I was younger, and I had to get it when it came out for Mac OS. Although unfinished on release, the Restored Content Mod on Steam Workshop is easy to install and not only fixes many of the bugs but also adds ""new"" parts to the game that I hadn't seen before when I played. Like its predecessor, Knights of the Old Republic 2 has interesting party members and plenty of dialogue, with even more replay value. More items and upgrades, powers and classes, etc. Well worth the $10 and you can get much more out of it than that!			"

												I began playing the Knights of the Old republic series when the first game came out, but grew significantly more attached to the plot and characters of KOTOR 2, compared to the first KOTOR. What the game lost when LucasArts rushed it out the door for a Christmas release, it more than made up for itself due to a colorful cast, and (likely due to Chris Avellone's influence), a total disregard for the standard Star Wars fare of ""Light and Jedi good, Dark and Sith bad."" Grey heavily entered the equation, and this game attempts to honestly give you that sort of choice, as much as an offical Star Wars game can get. However, you must understand when playing this - this story isn't about Revan, per se, or the Jedi, or the Sith - it's about the Exile, and why you (the player, the Exile), went to war against the Mandolorians, why you chose to follow Revan and Malak - and why you came back. You chose your own ambitions, in far greater depth than KOTOR 1's typicaly ""Light Side/Dark Side"" choices. That isn't to say though that you should be any one specific thing on the sliding scale of morality in the game - far from it. This game is a million times more satisfying as any side of the Force though, compared to KOTOR 1, so instead of being a rather...comical imitation of a bad guy who electrocutes people in KOTOR 1, you can get deeper into the mental aspects of the dark side. The same is for the light, but the game (rather, Kreia and through her, totally Chris Avellone), WILL indeed slap you on the wrist for being either side than grey...Which is also a major thing.KOTOR 2 is a wonderful game, that clearly has inspired fans the world over to cling tightly to the runt of the two KOTOR games - but there's a damn good reason for that.Also don't expect to get much romance, but it's not like KOTOR 1 had oodles of that either, so to each their own. HK makes up for it though.			"

												I played this game on Xbox, it was the first game my brother and I ever bought together. Maybe I'm biased but I will break it down. Story:Pros:Rich story, plenty of fully voiced dialogue.As always, choose your own ending/path.Updated from KOTOR: Character influence/ability to convert companions to Jedi -- YES PLEASE!So good at making the player character ""special"" or all-important, which is crucial to a good RPG imo.Cons:THE ENDING. There is now a mod to help this but overall the build up was 100x overhyped for the provided ending, at least there's a solid ""first ending"" where you finish the jedi master story arch.You majorly have to choose which companions you want to be jedis and sacrifice influence with others in order to achieve this, there's no having your cake and eating it too. A lot of vague hints and questions, particularly involving Revan that will go unanswered forever. Combat:Pros:Many more force powers available, and with 30 extra levels, a chance to get all the ones you wantThough not as well-clarified as some games, the attributes you select will affect the combat immensely, thus your original build will affect how often you hit and how often enemies are ""saved"" when using force powers. You have the opportunity to really boost your combat in the area of your choice.Cons:EIther boring or constant pausing and tweaking, you don't control the movements, only which attacks/items are usedCombat is very basic, all roll based, your roll plus bonuses - their roll plus bonuses = hit/missThe powers/medical supplies/feats are all in their own scroll menu in combat, MMO style key-binding & self-assigned options would've improved the flow of combat much more. If you try to go for middle ground in your attribute choices, I find that you are all around mediocre in combat rather than balanced.Clumsy combat queue, if you want to use a medi-pac immediately, you have to go into the inventory menu or cancel combat before you select it. Otherwise it will queue, and you or your injured party member will likely die before it is used. The idea is good, because you can switch to other characters and choose their next 3 actions but it wasn't smooth. Gameplay:The graphics are dated now, but still not terriblePlenty of character options available, and an added Jedi/Sith Master Class option at level 15While you can choose any order of planets, after your first playthrough, you'll know better. It is better to do specific orders for the characters you want to become jedi. Look up a guide if you're a One-go-Joe.More lightsaber colors.Overall, it's well worth your time, I wish the original KOTOR had a lot of the elements that this one introduced. Every game has some glitches and now that there are a good number of fixes both on Steam workshop and Kotor II Nexus, this game has recovered from its disappointing brokenness to become the gem it always should have been. Just play it.			"

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords is a game originally developed by Obsidian entertainment. The game release back in 2004 was riddled with missing gaps, as the game was rushed out and lots of intentional game implementations never made it on release. Fortunately, the TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restoration Content Mod) brings back the missing spots, thanks to the fact most of the ""cut content"" was found in the game files. This game came out on Steam not too long ago, and initially it got bad reviews for having a lack of up-to-date support on Steam, thus leaving people on their own to figure out how to run the game. Fortunately, eventually some developers came in and actually fixed the game with a nice patch. Aspyr Media, being the bros that they are; developed a Linux port for this game which I must say; is phenomenal. Not only did they port this game, but it runs fantastic; but there is no surprise there with a 11 year old game. Still, I am impressed they chose to take this older game and port it. With TSLRC Mod added through Steam Workshop, this game is even BETTER than it was when I first played it back in 2004. The graphics show their age, but there are some mods around the corner that look like they are trying to upgrade the lower end graphics. I am simply blown away that this game was taken and given a nice update on steam as well as workshop integration featuring some really nice mods. The windows side works great too, but now I am playing it on Linux and I am loving it too on Linux! One simply does not play this game without including the TSLRCM, that completes it. 8.5/10.0 - Amazing revitalization of a older game. The Ithorians who are restoring Telos would be proud. Now I would love to see the first Knights of the Old Republic ported over to Linux, with full workshop support!			"

												When I was first introduced to KOTOR my friends have told me that it was one of the best RPGs of all time and an instant classic; quite possibly also one of Star Wars best video games. When KOTOR 2 came out my friends told me it was the worst one. Glitchy, terrible graphics, subpar story etc.After a few years I decided to try them out for myself. I hated KOTOR 1 and fell in love with KOTOR 2. I don't think the first one is a bad game, it just didn't click with me. But the second one, is one of my all time favourites. Admittedly I played this with the Restoration Mod (you can find it free in the workshop along with many other mods), but the game is so good.The combat is based on a D20 system reminiscent of D&D, the story is rich and wonderful, the characters have depth and have polarized the community (I think this is a testament to how brilliantly written the characters are), the game will take you to various places around the galaxy to explore and the game gives a Dragon Age:Origins vibe which of course an excellent feeling to the whole gameplay/character progression. To expand upon this point, the game features actions with consequences, lots of dialogue options (hello Fallout 4), companions with their own personalities and how the adapt to the PC actions and behaviours and of course excellent combat.If you haven't played this yet, do yourself a favor and indulge yourself in one of the best games of the past decade.

												I could drone on about the stellar story, the magnificient environments and how great of an RPG this game truly is, especially with the restored content mod, but it'd be better if I phrased the game like this. This game is a MUST buy for any Star Wars fan, and a SHOULD buy for any fan of RPG's, and stories so deep that it'll leave a permanent grip on your heart as it has mine.I first played this game as a young, young boy, but even know it is still a permanent inclusion on my computer, and parts of the soundtrack from both games are favorites on my Youtube account. This game somehow manages to explore the idea of good and evil, light and dark, and truly make you think about everything in between. The characters are amazing, with returning cast as well as new, in-depth companions that all have their own opinions and goals. Characters well-rounded enough to match Bioware's Mass Effect 2, and 3. I may be biased because of the effect this game has had on my childhood and my view on games in general, but I am very passionate about the KotOR games.Just buy it. Play it. If you're not gripped by an engrossing story, you'll enjoy the fun combat and witty companions that accompany you on vastly different planets, and the vast range of force abilities at your disposal. The Content Restoration mod is a MUST HAVE to enjoy the full potential of this game.Visas Marr is waifu.			"

												Is Kotor 2 a good game? Many reviewers here have already answered that question (read: YES you bloody meatbags) so I will move onto the follow-up question:Is it better than Kotor 1?Yes.If looked at from a broad perspective Kotor 2 is everything you would get from Kotor 1. Same RPG style. Same Combat system. Same adding more lore than needed. Same running around the bloody galaxy across a set number of planets in order to find a set number of plot devices. Since it's more of the same but more buggy (RCM disregarded) so you'd think that Kotor 1  would be the superior. However, what makes K2 in my eyes a much better game (and perhaps my favorite RPG) is two things:1) The story Don't get me wrong, Bioware has an excellent teams of writers and they've made some fantastic stories but the stories are always very simplistic. You are either the King of All Things Good or the World's Most Respected ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fighting against someone so evil (or more evil than you, if you choose to be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) it would take a loon to say [obviously evil guy] isn't.  In other words, Kotor follows the Original Star Wars (and nearly every Hero story out there) to the letter. You answer the call to a quest. You mature and grow in strength. You go and defeat the obvious baddie as one of the two archtypes above and save the galaxy. Boom. Roll Credits. Kotor is a hero story with all your Star Wars tropes.Kotor 2 however takes said tropes and subverts them, throws them into fire, beats them to a pulp, and dumps them off into the nearest sun. What is a jedi without the force? Are the jedi really as good and deaaring as they are made out to be be? Or are they a bunch of jackasses? What is really difference between Jedi and Sith other than one likes red and the other a variety of colors? Or are both ideologies silly and just trying to stamp rules on a force (bum dum tsh) that they can barely understand? These questions and more are asked and played in Kotor 2 and they tie in with the overarching plot.Even with the Binary Moral Choice system there is depth. It actually ties in with your character and companions other instead of being something to change the last 30 minutes of the game. You have incentive to what you do. You are a Jedi Exile returning to a galaxy that has (almost) entirely forgotten you. Are you angry at your former masters and wish to gather power to reap vengence upon every last one of them? Or have you accepted (what you consider) your wrongdoings and wish to redeem yourself and forget your past? This small context of backstory adds metric tons worth of depth to your character and growth.TL;DR Kotor 2 manages to create a complex and fullfilling narrative that ties in both gameplay and story.2) It has Heart No really I'm serious. This is also a bit difficult to explain.At first I though this ""heart"" was just nostalgia ,but I realized that Kotor 1 never had this ""umph"", and Kotor 1 was leagues ahead in nostalgia. Kotor 2 is a game that really makes me care about the world, the characters, and the tale it is trying to tell. This is where Kotor 1 failed for me. Your companions have depth and personality beyond there aligned stereotypes. I can give a couple paragraphs about each of them without needing to describe their appearence. The personal interactions you have with each member of your crew gives volumes more impact and detail and emotion. The main quests of each planet made me feel like I was actually having impact on the galaxy. I felt change. After each planet I felt that something was going to happen and I was apart of it. I think this ""Heart"" is Kotor 2 being a much more ""local"" story. You are not trying to uncover some grand mystery that decides the fate of the galaxy. That is just icing on the cake. Kotor 2 is a personal story of your character and a battle with their past demons. You learn more about the Exile as he/she learns more about him/herself. Everything is a lot more quiet and that is the brilliant part of it. A quiet personal story that deals with the remnants of events long past, all trying to push their ends on a galaxy that no longer cares for them. And you are one of them.I picked Kotor (and this game up) out of nostalgia and to see how my views change on the games I played years ago and see how I view them now.Had I been asked which game was better several years ago I would have said Kotor 1 without a second thought. But after some time and returning I have to switch that feeling. Kotor 2 is better. Much better. The RCM makes it fantastic. And I can't stress it enough. As a small note I suggest you play this game with the Restored Content Mod, as it is more of a patch and less of a mod. and is the closest thing we'll (likely) get to a finished game that Obsidian wanted.

												KoToR II is one of those sequels to a game that is just as good, if not, better than the original. In my opinion, you can't choose between the two games. They're both equally masterpieces and due to the short time period between releases, they practically have the same value in terms of gameplay and graphics. What it really comes down to is the story. Which one has the better story? SPOILERS: Is it the first game? The rise and redemption of Revan who has lost his memory and taken on a new life? Or the second game? The story of an exile whom returns to civilization to find out, once and for all, why she was exiled and who is trying to kill her? As I said before, I can't pick between the two. The games are so well done in terms of RPG mechanics, gameplay, story, voice acting (okay, maybe the voice acting wasn't that amazing) and animation in certain areas.The RPG mechanics is pre whatever we have now. It's a mixture of real time and having the ability to pause the game to plan out your course of attack. The people who updated KoToR II managed to implement the Steam controller, which, in this case, works just like a 360 controller. So it was less of a point and click situation and more so scrolling through the enemies before un pausing the game to continue the attack, if that makes sense. The game ran perfectly, no issues in any areas. The graphics are from 2004 or something, so it's not exactly pretty. At least the levels were really diverse and nothing was repetitive at all. The audio design, of course, was stellar. From the soundtrack to the sound foliage, it's just really well done.Probably the greatest highlight in any Bioware (in this case, Obsidian) game are the characters. As I already pointed out, Obsidian did this one, but it's the sequel to a Bioware game. Bioware always sets a standard when gathering companions and what their perks are and how they interact with the player character during certain random events and whatnot. Each of the characters are unique and have their own unique sets of dialog in various situations, it's what's so remarkable about RPG games such as this. No other developer really goes that far and beyond to create such a wide and diverse set of characters that the player can bring along on their adventure.Really, a great game. A masterpiece. Brilliant ending, too. It really should have led the way for a third game, but instead, we got that MMO. Still waiting on KoToR III Bioware or Obsidian!10/10			"

												SW:KOTOR 2 is an RPG game Developed by Obsidian Entertainment. The game takes place  a few years after the events of KOTOR 1 after Revan defeated Malak and saved the galaxy. But now after departed deep into the outer rim of the galaxy, a bunch of Sith Lords, have appeared and have almost completly destoryed the Jedi order and the remaining Jedi Masters are into hiding. You play as a male or female Jedi Exile which you learn later into the game about why you were exiled from the Jedi Order. After escaping a Mine Fuel facuilty (Either by blowing it up and evading a sith ship) you head to a orbiting facilty above a planet called Telos. After being imprisoned and captured by them you find out the ship you traveled in, the Ebon Hawk has been stolen. After helping a light or dark side corporation and meeting a soldier that knows your character, you travel to many places into the planet until you get your ship back after finding out a Jedi Master lives in a acdemy in a polar region of the planet. After a companion gets the data base at the academy you find out why, your charcter was exiled and leaves you between two roads: Do you gather up the rest of the Masters to help you fight the sith, or do you join the sith and hunt down and kill the Jedi Masters?The companions you meet are all cool and deep. They all have secrets behind them which you have to get them to trust you to find out. Some of them you may not enjoy (like a stupid robot that is a jerk), but alot of them are fun to talk too, a few of them were in KOTOR 1 that make a return like T3-M4 and HK-47.One of the highlights of this game is the Light and Dark side paths. Through multiple parts of the game you sometimes given a choice such as kill an innocent by raiding his house then kill him as he returns (Dark Side) or saving someone from mercneary thugs (Light Side).The gameplay is a turn base or real time action (Can be chosen through menu) game. The game has powers that are ran by a 1d20 system. I'm stupid so I don't know much about the system but if you know stuff from Dungeons & Dragons you might understand it. The level cap is to belive is 30 but that doesnt mean its easy and should be taken lightly. Like how Fallout 3 and NV take a while so does this. This also means you want to spend Attributes when making a character very carefully as messing up might make it harder to clear the game. For example: putting alot of points into Constitution and Intelligence might give alot of VP and skill points to use, but at the cost of FP (force points) which might make it harder for you to use force powers.OVerall KOTOR 2 is a fun game, with it just getting workshop, people can get the restored content mod and get the true and perhaps best parts of the game. Problem is sometimes that game can be difficult with what planets you decide to visit and there are some annoying puzzles. I find the 10$ to be worth it but if you would like try to get it during a sale...This game gets a 9/10 - A fun and amazing game but with some minors problems.			"

												Finally, the game is working on Windows 7 and 8.x (at least it does if you have an Nvidia graphics card). A much darker, in-depth storyline compared to the first KOTOR and if you install the Restored Content mod, many of the bugs are fixed and a lot of the cut scenes are brought back, making the story far less disjointed. An excellent sequel to KOTOR (and coming from someone who hates sequels, that's high praise!) that's well worth the low asking price.			"

												My favorite RPG of all time.Before you play, I recomend downloading the RCM(Restored content mod). Alot of content was cut from the game because it was rushed for a christmas relise, but they left the files in the games folders for the modders to make use of. This mod does just that: make use of it.Amazing game. Limitless hours of gameplay.Everytime you play, its a little different. Weather you chose light side or dark side, Male or Female, or even say ""I will not kill you"" instead of ""You deserve to die"", could change the rest of the game.Tons of levels and powers to unlock. I did almost all of the side quests and I still dont have everything.Fly aboard the legendary Ebon Hawk across 7 different planets(including the final planet), from the fuel rock of Peragus II to the cesspool of Nar Shaddaa.Without the mod I give it a 7/10With the mod its a full 10/10.

												A good sequel to a great game. It improves on the first game in many ways, but was held back by a rushed development (missing content) and buggy release. This can easily be fixed by using the restoration mod - available on the Steam workshop for easy install.Put these things aside and you will still find the game to be amazingly good fun. This and it's prequel are two of the best Star Wars games ever made. Scratch that, they are two of the best games ever made, period. A real shame that we don't get to see more of this kind of genius these days. The new MMO ""The Old Republic"" can't hold a torch to this classic.Jimbo Rating: 9/10			"

Each time you play you discover a new challenge, extra interactions with characters, new possibilities and new gear. Whether you start as a grey jedi, dark or jedi the possibilities are endless.If you enjoy RPGs and strategy games then this is perfect for you- the best thing is, is that you don't need to know much if anything about the first game or Star Wars in general to play.Great game!

												This is an amazing game, but it was rushed to be released and so it has many game-breaking issues. To fix these issues, and add the content that was intented to be in the game, I reccomend downloading the TSLCRM mod and the M4-78 mod. Those are the only ""mandatory mods"", so after that you can get any other ones, provided they're compatible. This game picks up a bit after where the last one left off, so I'd reccomend playing that one first.STORY (Minor spoilers)[Canonically, the protagonist is a human female named Meetra Surik]You play as the Exile/Meetra Surik, a former Jedi who fought in the Mandalorian wars under Revan(The first game's protagonist). However, the Exile, like her name suggests, was exiled from the Jedi Order for going against them by leaving with Revan. This is just the Exile's backstory, as the game picks up on Telos, a space station that is barely functioning and soon going to explode. The Exile must escape the station and return to her ship with the help of 3 companions you find along the way. After that, depending on whether you want to play as a good little Jedi, or an evil Sith, you will try to find all of the leftover Jedi to get their help and find out why you were exiled, or to murder them all, with the help of 9 companions you find scattered around the galaxy.Pros+ Interesting, suprising ending based on your choices in the game+Solid, tactical gameplay.+ Not just an open world, an OPEN GALAXY+ Each companion has a rich backstory and companions are actually very useful+ Detailed crafting and upgrading systems+ Great replayability+ Filled with great Star Wars lore+ Your actions affect the entire galaxy and many of the people in it, including your companions+ Prestige classes change things up early/mid-game+ YOU CAN TURN YOUR COMPANIONS INTO JEDI OR DARK JEDI!+ When you reach end-game, you will be god-like with your force powers; On my way to the final area, I was clearing rooms with just one shot of Force Storm. Cons- Dated graphics- Game breaking glitches are present without proper fixes- Dialogue can be strange and confusing at times- In many cases your quests will fail to update or you'll be clueless on where to go- Some game-breaking glitches can be exploited and make the game too easy- Game rarely presents the player with a challenge Mixed-/+ Forced to use certain companions at timesFinal RatingThis game is a solid 9/10 for me. The game is NOT perfect because of the heavy amount of glitches present, yet the gameplay and story make up for it. I reccomend this game for ANY Star Wars fan or RPG fan.

												Rating 7.5/10Note: I played with the restoration mod. It is HIGHLY recommended that you play with this mod as it fixes a lot of bugs/glitches as well as restore lost content. It brings the game closer to the original intentions of the developers  The Good:+ The game has a lot of robust options in how you build your character. You start by choosing between 3 classes: Guardian, Consular or Sentinel. Each class obviously focuses on different aspects of combat. Further in the game you can then further specialize your classes. You can fully customize your character how you wish between attributes, skills, feats and Jedi powers. All of this leads to many different options and replayability in how you design your character+ The core aspect of the game is that as you can either play as a Jedi that is good or evil. Saving people, being kind and choosing the peaceful solution leads you to the light side while doing the opposite leads you to the dark side. Doing so leads to certain bonuses to your Jedi Powers. Being good means Light side powers will use less mana and dark side powers cost more and vice versa. I find the system to be very effective because it ties morality choices into game play, a feature that seems to be very lacking in today's modern games. + The second core aspect is how you respond and handle situations with your party members. You can gain or lose influence with them. If you gain enough influence with any particular party member, new dialogue options open up resulting in more background to the story, and/or stat increases for you or your party member. It is not mandatory as you can easily complete the game without gaining any influence with anybody but it adds a nice touch to the game and offers more options. + The story, although confusing in the beginning because it throws so much at you does get increasingly better. The story is presented very well because of the great dialogue options and fantastic writing. Obsidian is easily one of the best in the industry regarding writing. + If there is any company that can match or exceed Bioware in writing for npc characters its Obsidian. Every party member that joins you in your quest is well written and interesting. Every party member has alternative motives for joining you which makes things more exciting and not every party member gets along with each other. These ideas are explored the further you progress in the game.  + Every planet you visit feels different. The game throws a few twists in for good measure to keep things fresh. + Well written Side Quests+ modsThe Average:Sadly there was no improvement with combat. The combat in the game is really showing its age. I never particularly liked the combat because it's not very engaging. Certain force powers, skills, feats are game breaking while others are completely useless. The Bad:- The UI especially navigating to find items in your inventory is a chore and frustrating. The inventory screen is a long list of your items. There are options to filter the list based on specific items but this doesn't fix the overall problem of a bad overall inventory management system.  - The game forces you to do solo missions either as yourself or one of your party members. These sections are frustrating and awful only because the combat was never designed around solo play. This problem is further compounded if you auto-leveled up any of your party members. Playing a solo section with a party member that has all the wrong attributes/skills/feats is painful. - Last few areas have cut and paste environments. Obvious that development was rushed at the end.  ConclusionA worthy follow up to one of the best RPG's for its time. Obsidian once again shows that it is one of the best when it comes to writing a great story with great characters. It's sad that it takes a mod to fix a lot of the problems with the game. If you loved the first game then there is no reason not to love this one as well.  "

												8/10Obsidian, the king of sequels! Known not only for the sequel to KotOR, but also the sequels to Fallout 3, and Neverwinter Nights, and also making the 3rd Dungeon Siege game. One thing we can learn from these guys track record is that while they will sometimes make a decent engine seem a lot more buggy, they have a good ability to craft an even better story than their predecessors (most of the time). And that is no different in KotOR 2. Taking the ball that Bioware handed off, and running full force with it, Obsidian brings players back to the world of the old Republic, and puts them back in the role of a Jedi, and his or her team as they battle the evil forces of the dark side, or ultimately succumb to it. More so in this game than its predecessor, you actually feel the changes in your choices having an impact on your entire team, and people you meet.  You can be the good jedi, following the righteous path and helping those in need. You can go straight evil, and fell those who get in your way despite being good natured. You can be sneaky and devious, neutral, or whatever you wish. Most dialogue paths have a good number of options to change the outcomes. Ultimately though, it either leads to a gain in light or dark side points, or nothing at all. So play it how you want!KotOR 2 is a team based RPG adventure game, with 3D visuals, and battles happening in real time, with a mix of turn based elements that use the age old 'dice rules' method for any moves you may choose to dish out to your foes in the heat of battle. You see enemies, you choose your moves. You can also switch between one of the 3 currently chosen party characters at will at any time, during and out of battle to strategize. And over the course of the game, you will find a number of teammates to accompany you on your adventure. Some required for the adventure, and some can tag along based on choices you make. Like in most RPGs, you can gain new skills and abilities by leveling up. Speaking of which, the level cap from KotOR 1 has not been rasied, but rather, removed!Rather than taking place on 1 world, like in most RPGs, KotOR 2 will have you venturing across many different planets on your journey. Aside from a lengthy first few areas, the game opens up into something grand and open ended after about the 3 or 4 hour mark, with several planets to explore. You will travel from planet to planet on your ship, the Ebon Hawk, which is also where can converse with your entire team. Once on a planets surface, feel free to explore the locals. Shop, talk to people. Do side quests. And more! There are a few mini games even to be found in the game, including a card game, and a sort of pod racing mini game. While there is a lot to be said positvely about KotOR 2, it is not without its faults. The game is still a bit buggy, but not as much as when it first came out. Animations can be a little off when interacting with objects. Characters can get still get stuck. Sometimes characters will stand in odd places when conversing, and more. Also, there is little adjusting for graphical settings. You will pretty much need to mod the game if you want to play it at your monitors resolution. It can be a hassle, but it is easily done with the right tools, and very much worth it. Modded, KotOR 2 looks a helluva lot better than what I remembered playing many years ago. Bottom line, if you are a Star Wars, or an RPG fan, you owe it to yourself to pick up one of the games that helped pave the way for games like Mass Effect. Buy this game!			"

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II is a sequel to the first PC RPG game set in the Star Wars universe. Its action takes place roughly five years after the events presented in the previous episode. Since both of the games are nearly identical, most of the points mentioned in my previous review are valid.The protagonist is a Jedi casted out of the Jedi Order for following Revan in the Mandalorian Wars. As a result, the player no longer can play as a Scoundrel, Scout, or Soldier. Instead, one can choose to start as a Jedi Guardian, Jedi Consular, or Jedi Sentinel. Later on, there is an option to choose a prestige class*. There are six of them: Jedi Weapon Master/Sith Marauder, Jedi Watchman/Sith Assassin, or Jedi Master/Sith Lord.The gameplay has not changed much. Everything that we love about the original is there, along with a few additions and improvements. More skills, powers, weapons, items, upgrades, Force points (it's easier to change the alignment), and so on.  Interaction with companions have been taken to a new level (influence points), inventory has been improved, two switchable weapon loadouts have been added, et cetera. Now one can also craft items. Speaking of changes, the atmosphere is gloomier. I would even say that the whole game is more mature – the line between good and evil is blurred.Amongst the things which have remained the same are... bugs and glitches. They are back and strike fiercely. This time, I have encountered a gamebreaking error which resulted in having to load my previous save and replay the whole location. You bet I was not content...In conclusion, this is a textbook of how sequels should be made – this game just feels like home.*As far as I know, you cannot choose one if you're neutral (which is a shame).EDIT: Due to the July update, this game has steam cloud support and achievements.P.S.

												One of the best Star Wars RPG's i've ever played. On par with the first KOTOR, this sequel takes place 5 years after the events of KOTOR 1 and are an extension of the great sith war taking place 4000 years before the Battle of Yavin and the destruction of the empire's ultimate weapon. The story follows a jedi exile, canonically a female, however a choice of male doesn't affect the storyline in any way besides dialogue options, and is a story of loss, betrayal, ardousness and above all redemption. From amazing scenery, to great weapons and an addictive turn based combat system with pause features, this game is one of the most enjoyable from bioware and an integral part of the star wars canon of the Old Republic days. It isn't the graphically advanced games of new, but this in my opinion is the last requisite on a list to enjoy this game. Amazingly done voice acting, dialogue is on point, fantastic environmental work and just a great RPG game that really makes you feel like the hero, or villian if you want to be. choose your path, paragon in action, or a devil in disguise, you play as jedi or sith, be aware that each choice has repurcussions! and the fate of the galaxy will once again rest on your shoulders. An exceptionally made game, easily a 9/10 and even a 10. Would buy it for any price, and would suggest playing the first to grasp the entirety of the plot and story linearity, however is not required. Great game and an absolute Star Wars iconocism.			"

												A worthy sucessor to KOTOR, but beware of glitches, they will strike when you least expect it..........EDIT: I feel obligated to mention that my hours are actually not representatative of the time I spend playing, because I bought this on Steam after I lost my original disk. The actual gameplay is great, but it is buggy, very buggy, because this was a rushed christmas release. This also means that there are segments of the story that were cut, in order to experience them you can download the mod TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod), but even then you may still have issues with bugs and glitches. All and all, however, this is a great game.			"

												Both a massive improvement and a massive disappointment over the first KotOR, this is, unfortunately, another one of Obsidian's rushed games. Through no fault of their own they were forced to release an unfinished game, leaving us with some plotlines that didn't go anywhere and quite a few bugs. Although Obsidian were denied the chance to fix their game through patches by Lucasarts, modders went to work on restoring a lot of cut content and fixing bugs. I waited for a lot of years and saw a couple projects dissolve, but eventually one came out and it's pretty great. I would recommend playing with The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM) on a first playthrough, as without it you may be left with sour disappointment in some aspects of the game.http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcmOn that page there's also the planet M4-78 which was cut from the game entirely. You can try it out but I personally did not like it very much. Even on a modern machine I ran into performance issues, and it felt awkward and long. I wouldn't recommend it for a first playthrough.

												Preface: I used the Restored Content Mod while playing this game.  KotOR 2, this time brought to us by Obsidian Entertainment, at first glance appears to be its predecessor's hotter, younger cousin.  There are many fixes to complaints I had for the first game: better menu system (inventory management still needs work), cleaner, faster, better looking, containers show if they're empty, datapads are read automatically, even walking in spacesuits is faster (although it looks funny, seems they just upped the animation speed).  There are more force powers to use, cool special character abilities, and there's better rollplaying since there are a lot more options to what you can do.  For example if your level in Treat Injury is high then more dialogue options open up for you allowing you to truly play the game how you want!  Or...it actually doesn't.  This game was *extremely* aggravating at times.  Once again the designers felt like it was a good idea to throw you into 1v1 duels, so the belief that you could actually roleplay was a mere fantasy that is ripped from your fingers less than a quarter through the game.  To make it worse, there are sections where there are *unskippable cutscenes* right before duels.  This is the biggest pain ever, especially if you're already getting annoyed at the required 1v1 battles you go through.  I would highly recommend ignoring anything but force and battle prowess (melee too, blasters blow), not only for your main character, but for *all* of your characters.  That's right!  It wasn't bad enough making your main character duel, now a large portion of your companions have to do battles (or even entire segments of the game - ie long dungeons) by themselves.  The worst offender of this has to be the HK factory, where you're expected to use HK-47 against an army of droids.  It was terrible, I literally *could not* play through that section the way I built my HK-47.  It made me feel as if I was playing ""wrong"".  No game should have that effect, *especially* an RPG.  Luckily this game has a console that you can enable because that was the only way to struggle through that section of the game.  As if this complaint wasn't bad enough, the *most important* part of an RPG, the storytelling, wasn't very good.  I enjoyed the journey of the original much more than I did in KotOR 2.  Even *with* the rcm I felt like some of the character's backstories were done halfway through the game and the plot and storytelling was convoluted to put it lightly.  Your companions *attack* each other, seemingly without consequence at times.  It was confusing and distracting.  And the ending straight up sucked.  It was literally dialogue choices, and this is coming from a guy who didn't mind Deus Ex: HR's ending.This game didn't just need a restored content mod, it needed a drastic overhaul, fix, and rewrite - that's the only reason I can recommend this game - the modding community.  It's really big, even to this day.  The RCM is the tip of the iceberg, and if you didn't like the way the game did something you can probably fix it.Pros:ModsUpgraded EngineT3-M4 has a personailty now!Cons:StorytellingBuggyGameplayHK-47's personailty sucks now!This game really disappointed me.  It had so much potential but fell flat on its face.  I recommend it if you like getting your hands dirty with mods as that's the only redeeming factor KotOR 2 has.  If you're looking for a good sci-fi RPG play the Mass Effect series instead - and I *like* Star Wars. B			"

												Have you ever wanted to be a jedi swinging around your lightsaber and force pushing dudes well to bad cause you dont get a lightsaber till about halfway through the game( unless you got mods) but that doesnt take away from the beauty of this game infact it adds to it. You start off as a man or woman on a mining asteroid with mo clue as to how you got there on this asteroid you meet Kreia who will become your mentor in the ways of the force and atton a dude whos a mercenary i guess. well it turns out your the last of the jedi and without spoiling anything everyone is out to get you.this game has an expansive Darkside-Lightside system that effects things from how much Mp a move takes up, if your lightside and you want to force choke someone well say goodbye to your mp cause its gonna take a hit, or maybe you want to heal yourself cause droids are destroying your body welp dont try to use force lightning later cause your mp is gonna be gone sucka. The more evil you are effect how good or evil your teammates are and how much they like you. if your team mates really like you they may awaken some new abilities.  look i could go on and on about this game but youve gotten this far into my ""reveiw"" and i can personally tell you as someone who spent countless hours playing this as a child and now 10 years later counless hours as a young adult just buy the game youll love it. and if you dont you can refund it and you can like internet crucify me (is that what the cool kids do i never know) but that wont happen i know you know and all the other reveiwers know adios amigos			"

												There has never been a better bunch of ragtag heroes to save the galaxy. Whether they are likeable, evil or a little psychotic there is no better company to shoot up thugs with a couple of blasters and a lightsaber. Honestly this is the only game i consider not skipping every sentence a Companion or NPC has to say. This remains one of the very few Star Wars RPGs out there and is definetly worth a play (especially if you are new to the story). Choices actually matter, the companions are useful and interesting, and to top it off the story is strong and has depth. The ending for KOTOR fans can be a little disapointing, but it doesn't change the fact star wars fans SHOULD 100% buy this game. (Probably should pick up KOTOR 1 as well whilst you're at it, probably has the stronger story - companions can be more one dimensional at times though)			"

												I didn't like this game at first. I had just finished Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and was eager to try out the second game, a game a lot of people consider even better than the first. Excited to be absorbed into the Kotor universe again and to experience a new perspective of my favourite Era in Star Wars history.When I first played Kotor, I couldn't stop playing it. I started during a school break and entered a routine of waking up, eating, playing kotor, sleeping. But when I picked up Kotor II, I just couldn't get as invested. The tutorial was boring and lengthy and the first planet Telos was uninteresting. I stopped playing for a while.After a break I played the game again. I'm having a lot of fun now that I have lowered my standards and stopped comparing it to Kotor 1. Now that I have experienced the faults I can see all of the great strengths. My advice for you is to enter the game without raised standards and to accept the game as it is. You will find a fantastic RPG with great characters and an interesting premise.Also, use the Sith Lords Restored Content Mod.			"

												Just get this game. Contrary to popular opinion, I think that this one is far better than its predecessor. While the first game was a classic Star Wars narrative, this story is dark, gloomy, and intricately woven together.However, the Knights of the Old Republic games are notorious for their long, boring starts. After the first two planets the game starts to pick up momentum, and you'll be hooked as the game gets better and better up until the fantastic ending.I wouldn't dare mention this game without also mentioning The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM). The base game was rushed by the developers, resulting in loads of cut content and scenes that without, the story loses some coherency. In addition to adding all of that back, the mod fixes a lot of bugs.This game is a must-have for any fan of the first game, any Star Wars fan, and any fan of good story-telling. If you haven't played the first, I don't find it essential, but there are many references.Get the game!			"

												I have played this game through in CD-version, watched an entire playthrough by DanQ8000 on youtube and almost 2 times through on steam, and i still love it. The story begins around 4700 years bby, and it gives the creators almost free access to put in what ever they want in the game. With amazing characters, (Like HK-47<3) and a great story. Kotor 1 did have a better story, but the UI and overall balance of kotor 2 is better than kotor 1. Even if kotor 2 is a bit outdated, it still gives you alot of fun, and if you really want to experience everything in the game, your playthrough can be around 40-60 hours long :D It is best to play kotor 1 first, to understand everything that is said and what happens in the story. This game is truly something of its own. Recommended for every RPG player and/or Star Wars fan. Epic.			"

												I really loved the first game, so I was excited to play this one. I have to admit, though, that the first time I played KOTOR II, I didn't enjoy it at all. Everything seemed opposite the first game; the planets felt more empty, and the companions all seemed like they had something to hide. It wasn't until I played through the game a second time that I realized what the fuss was about - you. In this game, you play as an exiled Jedi, whose force powers have been stripped by the Jedi council. As you progress through the game, you amass a great group of companions and gain back your force powers, influencing your companions with your alignment. At the end of the game, it's revealed that the exile is responsible for countless deaths, and was experiencing that pain throughout the game. It's almost as big a shock as the reveal in KOTOR I. the Exile's story is one of the most tragic in Star Wars, and Kreia is one of the best characters in Star Wars. This entire game dwells in the moral gray area of the Force, where few other Star Wars games or movies dare to go. Kreia in particular is the antithesis of what Star Wars should be, and that's exactly why she's so great. While I may love the original KOTOR, I have an immense amount of respect for this game, and in particular for Chris Avellone, who is one of the best video game writers of all time. This game is Amazing.			"

It is a classic turn based RPG based around a player created ""Exile"", and it includes a massive roster of returning characters and new characters such as Atton, Kreia, Mandalore/Canderous, HK-47, T3-M4, and more.Pros:Game has aged wellCombat is planned and can be very rewardingDeep and enriched storyline with multiple villainsIt builds upon the greatness of the original gameCompletely unexpected plot twistsExcellent voice actingThe morality system is back and better than everCons:The combat, while rewarding, can be frustrating for those who haven't played this genre of games			"

												Best replay value of any story-based game I've ever played in my 35 years on this earth. I originally had this on Xbox back in the day and it was a popular replayable game for many years, then on PC with mods for many more years. I've played through this game about 1-2 times per year on average for over a decade and it still never really gets old (although certain parts do).   Maybe swap around some mods and decide to go a different direction with your light/dark side choices and which combination of companions to focus on and you get a completely different gaming experience. TSLRCM breathed new life into the game, and just added to that replay value by refreshing it and adding enough content to make it interesting again. The game has enough depth and variable that even with all those playthroughs I still find myself occasionally consulting a walkthrough or guide to get a hint or reminder how to unlock a particular plot point, piece of gear, etc.  I'd normally be loathe to pay more than about $5 for any game this old but it is still a great value at 2-3x that.

												This game is one of my top 5 favorite Star Wars games ever made… but it is still kind of a mess. It has bugs, plot-holes, moments of broken scripting and dialogue that feels like it's missing crucial sentences but it is still a great game. Modders have tried very hard, bless their hearts, but it's unlikely the Sith Lords will ever be made whole.What's here is still absolutely worth experiencing though, so if you have any attachment to the Star Wars universe, buying this is a no-brainer and even if you just like RPG's and story-driven games, I highly recommend giving it a shot.On a side note, my most recent playthrough (of many) was early in 2015, right before achievements were added, and it accounted for roughly 38 hours of play-time. I was playing with the latest versions of TSL Restored Content Mod and M4-78 Enhancement Project. As with the main game, they're not perfect, but a lot of great work has been put into them and you should check them out if you can.			"

												I loved this game, played through it in 2 weeks (school). It has a truly in depth story ranging from the comic lore to where the previous game left off and beyond.  There are little tidbits and easter eggs of characters that exist in the series.  I also loved the soundtrack, which my opinion, gave suspense and serenity where it was useful.  A plethora of unique characters gave it a unique asthetic about the game. When I finished the game I felt so satisfied, because there was so much freedom in the game that you could honestly express yourself through it.  5 stars.  Made me love Star Wars again.			"

												Even though I have only played a few hours, I think I can offer a good review. The game in itself is good. It is not particularly slow, and it is not turn based either. If you hate turn based, and hate fast paced RPG`s, then play this game, If you like having more of a realistic dialogue from a game that was released several years ago, play it. If you like being sadistic, and killing people, I would suggest this game. If you also like helping people and being borring, then play this game.If you find old women attractive play it. If you like strategy games play it. If you like exploring everything  a video game has to offer play it. If you like modding games play this. If you like Star wars play it. If you like Darth Revan then play it.So basically, if you like games play this game.			"

												KotOR 2 wasn't developed by BioWare, who was busy working on Mass Effect at the time, after having the IP yanked away. However, Obsidian did a pretty good job. It had a high bar to try and meet with respect to its predecessor, but this game still has excellent gameplay elements, references and cameos from the first game without becoming campy, and another well-told story. It's worth your time, even if it is becoming a bit dated at this point.			"

												I really loved the first game, so I was excited to play this one. I have to admit, though, that the first time I played KOTOR II, I didn't enjoy it at all. Everything seemed opposite the first game; the planets felt more empty, and the companions all seemed like they had something to hide. It wasn't until I played through the game a second time that I realized what the fuss was about - you. In this game, you play as an exiled Jedi, whose force powers have been stripped by the Jedi council. As you progress through the game, you amass a great group of companions and gain back your force powers, influencing your companions with your alignment. At the end of the game, it's revealed that the exile is responsible for countless deaths, and was experiencing that pain throughout the game. It's almost as big a shock as the reveal in KOTOR I. the Exile's story is one of the most tragic in Star Wars, and Kreia is one of the best characters in Star Wars. This entire game dwells in the moral gray area of the Force, where few other Star Wars games or movies dare to go. Kreia in particular is the antithesis of what Star Wars should be, and that's exactly why she's so great. While I may love the original KOTOR, I have an immense amount of respect for this game, and in particular for Chris Avellone, who is one of the best video game writers of all time. This game is Amazing.			"

												Okay, everyone gives this game a lot of ♥♥♥♥ for not being a worthy sequel of the first one. Everyone talks about how it was rushed, it's buggy, there's a lot of things unfinished, and honestly I can't really dispute those claims. BUT, this game, for me, is actually better than the first one.The dialogue in this game surpasses KOTOR I's dialogue by leaps and bounds. Honestly, I have never, and probably never will, experience such incredible storytelling as Obsidian's writers managed to pull off. Your story of being the last Jedi, exiled from your rightful title after a horrible war, will drag you through the jungle moon of Dxun, the dry, evil sands of Korriban, and the gangster paradise of Nar Shaddaa, to name a few. The first character you meet, Kreia, shoud be forever considered one of the most interesting characters ever created in a video game. She is so mysterious and wise that you can't help but be influenced by her presence, and every dialogue tree with her makes you crave more after it's over.I love the dynamism of light side and dark side in this game. Being the last Jedi, you can choose to walk the path of redemption, reclaiming your rightful title as Jedi once more, or doom the galaxy to eternal pain and suffering, becoming an incredibly powerful Sith Lord. All the possible choices you have in certain scenarios give you Light Side or Dark Side points, and building your character to become an unstoppable force, slaughtering everyone in sight, is hilariously entertaining.I played the Xbox version previously before I bought it on the PC, and I can tell you, if you look up TSL Restoration Mod, the creators have done an AMAZING job bringing back all the things that Obsidian wasn't able to deliver on due to the rushed production. I think that many people think KOTOR II is inferior to I for this reason, but with the restoration, I don't think that there's any real argument that this game wouldn't have completely outshadowed KOTOR I in every way.

												Played it Vanilla. Loved it. But is glitchy as hell. But i hear the fan restoration patch fixes things to be more stable and brings back cut content. However, Ten hours into the game i realized i forgot to subscribe to it on the workshop. Great Star Wars RPG and my only real gripes are stability and the rushed ending. So i highly suggest the fan restoration mod and at least eight save slots. I also enjoyed the main villian's motivation being different than the six films. Too bad j.j Abrams is too busy with rehashing the original trilogy 2.0 to explore villians with such motivations. Highly recommended if the current Star Wars games and films have felt stale to you and you are willing to possibly put up with some minor bugs/freezing on occasion. We need more single player story driven star wars games, Not all this mobile gaming and post-Galaxies MMO crap.			"

												I initially gave this game an unfavorable view, but felt this was unfair because I was 'stuck' at a certain point in the game. I was finally able to overcome my obstacle, and stick with the game until the end (or one of the endings, rather).This game certainly has its appeal, but not without some drawbacks:~The game is dated: and I'm not just referring to the graphics. I'll be honest, the biggest headache with this title (and similarly with its prequel) was compatibility issues with Windows 10. I had to wait a few months until another update fixed what the last update broke. ~There's still a few bugs: or at least my copy had em. I was pretty into the story up until the ending, which felt very anticlimactic because it would skip over all of the dialog that was between my choices; it left me with only a very fuzzy idea of how the story ends.~It has many RPG features that were pretty advanced for its time like item upgrades and breakdown/creation; however the combat style was very clunky, and turn-based feeling, almost like FFX was. It can also get pretty repetitive with the game pausing with every new enemy that enters your line of sight.~The quest info from your journal entries were sometimes pretty vague, which took me much longer to find out where I needed to go, or objectives I needed to accomplish. Nothing the Internet couldn't fix with no shortage of walkthrough guides, but nonetheless made the game more tedious than fun~The added achievements are really the only thing that gave the game any replay value. The story was good, but even going back and finishing with the alternate ending seems pretty empty, knowing all the twists and turns that ultimately lie aheadIf you're a Star Wars fan, I would definitely pick this one up for a bargain price, or in a bundle. It's no Skyrim, so exercise patience while playing. 5/10			"

												The KotOR series was probably one of my all-time favorites, I liked these way more than the movies and KotOR I was the game that truly got me into RPG games. KotOR II is just as good as the first and continues to move onward with the story and events after KotOR I. Age hasn't been too kind to it, the graphics aren't the best and it's buggy at best on newer OS, but that doesn't stop it from being a true legendary classic. And look at that, a decade later and it gets updated to fix most problems and allow for us to return to KotOR II a few more times. Just because it got this big update don't think it's bug free, there's still plenty of them. For me I get achievements in weird locations for no reason - I got the Dancing Queen achievement when I left Peragus and didn't get the Peragus achievement until I got a little further into Telos. Not to mention the money achievement I randomly got when I made a small barter - but that's okay. There's no real game breaking bugs or anything and it's stable. It's a very good game and is usually set at a low price. If you love Star Wars or RPGs on a whole this is a must have along with KotOR I. I recommend starting with KotOR I first then moving on to two as you'll probably get pretty confused. The combat system is similar to an MMO, usually I'm not a fan of this combat system in single-player games but it actually works pretty good. Granted it could be better, but for a 2005 game there's nothing wrong with it.			"

												This game is one of my top 5 favorite Star Wars games ever made… but it is still kind of a mess. It has bugs, plot-holes, moments of broken scripting and dialogue that feels like it's missing crucial sentences but it is still a great game. Modders have tried very hard, bless their hearts, but it's unlikely the Sith Lords will ever be made whole.What's here is still absolutely worth experiencing though, so if you have any attachment to the Star Wars universe, buying this is a no-brainer and even if you just like RPG's and story-driven games, I highly recommend giving it a shot.On a side note, my most recent playthrough (of many) was early in 2015, right before achievements were added, and it accounted for roughly 38 hours of play-time. I was playing with the latest versions of TSL Restored Content Mod and M4-78 Enhancement Project. As with the main game, they're not perfect, but a lot of great work has been put into them and you should check them out if you can.			"

												A classic, now better than ever.In a move rarely seen outside of moneygrabs, a company (Aspyr) has picked up a forgotten game after the collapse of the original owner company LucasArts. Aspyr hasn't added any content to the game, but they have ported it and updated it to run on modern computers. This includes Windows 10, Mac, and even Linux.Plus Steam Workshop support has been added, though it should be used with caution. There's a crippling bug that causes the game to crash if you have more than 5 Workshop mods installed at once. This is easily circumvented, though, since there's still severeal KotOR2 mod sites still online with most of the same mods. I use Workshop for the Restored Content Mod and Skip Paragus. Everything else I install manually.Graphically, there's no escaping that this game was originally designed with the PS2 and original Xbox in mind. The models are as chunky as they come, and some of the textures are downright blurry. Oddly, some textures are amazingly sharp and crisp, while others are not, and there's some fairly advanced shader effects scattered around that seem unlikely to be from the original version. It feels like Aspyr is slowly improving the textures and other graphics, but I cannot prove that.As for the quality of the game itself, it's one of my favorites. I played the living tar out of this on my Xbox back in the day. It's a great story with plenty to explore and a combat system that allows some complex strategy. If you like to min/max stats, this is a great game for you. There's thousands of items all with unique stats and effects, as well as the ability to customize many items with upgrades. Specialize your characters to create synergy in combat.GRIPES!This is far from a perfect game.In terms of Aspyr's changes, the game is much more playable than it was before, but there's still some problems. Workshop is only just working, as I've mentioned. Then there's an issue with the game minimizing every time there's a cutscene. It's only midly inconvenient, but it is worth mentioning. I like to think Aspyr's still working on these issues, though.Then there's the issues with the game as it was and always will be. The start of the story is slow. Like crazy slow. It isn't bad the first time playing though, but after a few replays it gets very tedious since there's not a lot of choice you can make that early in the game. Fortunately, there's a mod to fix that.			"

												If you're a fan of any type of RPG - Star Wars or not - I guarantee that you'll love Knights of the Old Republic 2. It's execution is very simple yet very effective, something games tend to miss these days; being too complex for the sake of complexity. The storyline (while a little cliche) is extremely well written and thought out, revealing itself slowly to the character as they make their own choices through the game. Characters like Atton Rand and especially Kreia have very deep and rich backstories that not only add to the fantastic story and atmosphere to the game, but will also change depending on what you do in the game. Depending on the choices you make, some characters will favor you while others will not. For example, if you decide to execute a criminal, one character might applaud you for such an action while another will disapprove. All these choices affect how much information you can gather from them during your playtime.The combat is simple, and if you've played the original Knights of the Old Republic, you know exactly what to expect. This is not a bad thing, however. If you enjoy pause/point-and-click combat, then you have nothing to worry about.Keep in mind, this game was released in 2005, so the graphics aren't going to be hyper-realistic and since the game was rushed during development constrictions, content WAS cut from the final release. That being said, there was a fan-made mod that actually restored all the lost content - You can find it with a simple google search: ""KOTOR 2 TSLRCM""Had this game been given the time it deserved for development, it would have been WIDELY recognized as one of the best RPG's ever made. Nonetheless, Obsidian Entertainment did a fantastic job taking the reigns from Bioware, and formed a story that was ten-times more interesting and engaging than the first game, introducing rich characters - both fearsome and loving - and bringing moral choices that sculpt your very adventure. Do NOT miss this game - It's worth your time.9/10			"

												 Finnaly got it! I have to say it was much better than I anticipated. It brings a true story about how a jedi can change the fate of the galaxy. Now that Im done with my first play through, I shall install mods and ect., but know this when you get this game it may be similar to kotor but it is not the same it is a more muture game. Not the kind of thing everyone enjoys. The only down side is once you take possession of it the restraining bolt will be deactivated and you will engage in some unadulterated violence.Qualification: Err... of course it shall be quite pleasant to you, should you purchase it.

												So, for all of you holdouts out there, I'd like to talk a bit about my favorite game of all time. The gameplay may not be for everybody (although I and many RPG fans do enjoy it), the original release was a shell of a game, and yet, KOTOR 2 has cemented it's spot as my favorite game of all time for years. 6 years, in fact: once TSLRCM 1.5 (The Restored Content Mod) was released in late 2009 and articles started to circulate, I replayed for the first time in years and fell in love. Gameplay: With the Restored Content Mod, it's essentially the same as the first KOTOR (necessary to really enjoy and understand the second one IMO). There are some new powers and feats, there's some rebalancing, but it feels pretty much identical. Same engine and all. If you've played KOTOR, Skip this.The gameplay involves a fusion of turn based and real time RPG mechanics. You encounter enemies, and can pause to click on enemies and select actions for you and up to two party members, similar to Dragon Age and Mass Effect. Characters level up and learn new feats (vanilla character enhancements and new moves) and Force powers (if the character is Force-Senstive).Out of combat, you walk around in real time and click to interact with things. In conversations, you have many choices for dialogue (over 5 isn't rare) and each one is fully written out (no misunderstandings from a conversation wheel!). Think Fallout: New Vegas (Fun Fact: Obsidian developed KOTOR 2 *and* F:NV).Graphics: The game came out in 2005 and looked kinda dated for back then. The game can clean up nicely with mods, but it will not be looking anything near as good as even the original Mass Effect. Still, the graphics do their job, and the environments and skyboxes are both well done. Characters have a subtle range of facial emotion. Atmosphere is good.Sound: With TSLRCM (I can't recommend it enough!), the sound becomes a strong part of the game. Weapon sounds are more pronounced and consistent, music is timed well and highly atmospheric, and you forget about the early 2000s graphics. Voice acting is excellent, with a few exceptions amongst minor characters you may see in side quests. The main character is not voiced, however. Story: Much of the story and atmosphere of the game is best to be discovered as you play, but a general summary is fine. You play as a Jedi Exile (Canonically Female, named Meetra Surik), who was banished from the order for helping lead a war call to protect planets from the Mandalorians against the orders of the Jedi Council. The Council's reasons for staying out of the war are vague and are meant to be. The war ended with great sacrifices, and your connection to the Force was lost. This unique backdrop sets the tone for a complete deconstruction of everything Star Wars. There are somewhat legitimate Gray Jedi builds (unaigned and with bonuses from certain armor or weapons), Nihilistic overtones, and Sith like you've never seen before. KOTOR 2 is without a doubt my favorite game story of all time, even beating out Deus Ex and Half-Life. It works so well as a deconstruction of everything Star Wars. This is not your ordinary Star Wars game, and if you have at least watched the movies and played the first KOTOR, you are in for what I would dare call a storytelling masterpiece.			"

												If you like RPGs this is one game you just have to play (likewise for the first one).The first game was amazing, but the second one polishes and improves on many things the first game introduced.I played this game about 2 dozen times, each time with a different combination of classes, spells and companions. While some of the stuff ""stays the same"" there's a lot of things that are different each time. Your experience can vary wildly from game to game.I last played this game this year, and i had just as much fun now as i did when it was released.			"

												I have played this game through in CD-version, watched an entire playthrough by DanQ8000 on youtube and almost 2 times through on steam, and i still love it. The story begins around 4700 years bby, and it gives the creators almost free access to put in what ever they want in the game. With amazing characters, (Like HK-47<3) and a great story. Kotor 1 did have a better story, but the UI and overall balance of kotor 2 is better than kotor 1. Even if kotor 2 is a bit outdated, it still gives you alot of fun, and if you really want to experience everything in the game, your playthrough can be around 40-60 hours long :D It is best to play kotor 1 first, to understand everything that is said and what happens in the story. This game is truly something of its own. Recommended for every RPG player and/or Star Wars fan. Epic.			"

												I loved this game, played through it in 2 weeks (school). It has a truly in depth story ranging from the comic lore to where the previous game left off and beyond.  There are little tidbits and easter eggs of characters that exist in the series.  I also loved the soundtrack, which my opinion, gave suspense and serenity where it was useful.  A plethora of unique characters gave it a unique asthetic about the game. When I finished the game I felt so satisfied, because there was so much freedom in the game that you could honestly express yourself through it.  5 stars.  Made me love Star Wars again.			"

												The better of the 2 Knights of the Old Republic game.But only because this has a darker more adult storyline to it.I know EA and Bioware say the canon version is to play a female character in this but dont beleive it for a second.This game makes a ton more sense and has a ton more interaction when you play a male character (dont want to spoil it but a key figure in the storyline only joins your team if you play male character).I have not tried the content patch that fills in all the missing content as Lucas Arts rushed Obsidian to release this originally, but even the content lite version was a excellent game. I strongly recommend people purchase and play this game and dont take just my word for it, judge for yourself and play the male and female character through. You will see how expanded part of the story is as a male character and how empty it feels  when that content missing from the female storyline.			"

												If you're a fan of any type of RPG - Star Wars or not - I guarantee that you'll love Knights of the Old Republic 2. It's execution is very simple yet very effective, something games tend to miss these days; being too complex for the sake of complexity. The storyline (while a little cliche) is extremely well written and thought out, revealing itself slowly to the character as they make their own choices through the game. Characters like Atton Rand and especially Kreia have very deep and rich backstories that not only add to the fantastic story and atmosphere to the game, but will also change depending on what you do in the game. Depending on the choices you make, some characters will favor you while others will not. For example, if you decide to execute a criminal, one character might applaud you for such an action while another will disapprove. All these choices affect how much information you can gather from them during your playtime.The combat is simple, and if you've played the original Knights of the Old Republic, you know exactly what to expect. This is not a bad thing, however. If you enjoy pause/point-and-click combat, then you have nothing to worry about.Keep in mind, this game was released in 2005, so the graphics aren't going to be hyper-realistic and since the game was rushed during development constrictions, content WAS cut from the final release. That being said, there was a fan-made mod that actually restored all the lost content - You can find it with a simple google search: ""KOTOR 2 TSLRCM""Had this game been given the time it deserved for development, it would have been WIDELY recognized as one of the best RPG's ever made. Nonetheless, Obsidian Entertainment did a fantastic job taking the reigns from Bioware, and formed a story that was ten-times more interesting and engaging than the first game, introducing rich characters - both fearsome and loving - and bringing moral choices that sculpt your very adventure. Do NOT miss this game - It's worth your time.9/10			"

												KotOR II is one of the best RPGs of the modern age, rivaling even that of it's predecessor. To this day, after hundreds of games, it is still one of my absolute favorites. It has one of the best stories, a great combat system, gorgeous graphics (even by today's standards).Unlike most games being thrown at us with a big ""BUY ME!"" sign attached to it these days, this game actually makes you feel what you are doing. If you help that random person with a few credits, you feel like you actually matter in the universe. If you kill that person and steal the 3 cr. they had in their pocket, you actually feel terrible for it (unless you really are that cold heartless person that belongs with the Sith). You take note of your actions in this game, and every little detail and encounter/conversation is memorable.That being said, there is one problem I have encountered. Just one. In order to make this game work in wide screen, and higher resolutions, you have to do a little work. But don't let this deter you from playing it, as this little set-back will not effect your gameplay experience at all, only your screen size is affected.I whole-heartedly guarantee that this game will become a favorite for you as well. There is no doubt about it, you will love this game, and may even fall in love with it's characters.			"

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords is incredible. Pair with the restored content mod and you have the greatest game of all time. (At least for me.)If you enjoyed the first game, then you will LOVE THIS ONE. I won't spoil anything, just review the game.COMBAT - 8/10There isn't much new combat mechanics, in fact, not any at all. But, KOTOR I invented time-based combat, and it still feels satisfying everytime you land a hit, whether or not its been done before.STORY - 10/10This story can be incredibly confusing if you haven't read the book Revan. I'll link it below. If you really loved the story of the first game, and love the story of this game, as confusing as it is now, you should DEFINITELY READ THIS BOOK. This book bridged the two games and made a lot of random ""plotholes"" clearer.  such as in Uthar Wynn's old bedroom, the holocron with Bastila talking about Revan  A MUST READ for Star Wars Old Republic fans.LINK: https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q8mcJucrwnEC&source=productsearch&utm_source=HA_Desktop_US&utm_medium=SEM&utm_campaign=PLA&pcampaignid=MKTAD0930BO1&gclid=COD-kdLkt9ACFVIngQodXh8Ovg&gclsrc=dsCHARACTERS - 9.5/10Unlike KOTOR I, KOTOR II makes every character feel meaningful. You genuinely care for the characters, and their background. In KOTOR I, many may remember Juhani, who was the 'character that was only made from a lack of meaningful drama.' It all came down to ""my mom died, I was a slave, I was ♥♥♥♥♥"" etc., etc. As sad as that is, she was just a shallow character. But KOTOR II fixes that. You feel a connection to ALL of the characters.GAMEPLAY OVERALL - 9/10Many may dislike the fact that you start as a Jedi, but is is canonical to the story, and not only that, but you also get more points for force powers. And, the level cap was raised from 20 to 30! The combat is nice, as described above, but even something as simple as the layout of the maps are great. Maybe with the exception of the Dxun Jungle, the layouts are always easy to navigate, so you don't always need to refer to the map. The swoop races, yes they still exist, are still fun, and are even better as now you can jump! OVERALL RATING - 9.5/10This game takes KOTOR I and improves everything. Sure it is a bit buggy, but that's only the steam port. (If you had the original it wasn't nearly as bad.) The game itself, is just purely amazing. Obsidian Entertainment did a great job.ALSO, GET THE RESTORED CONTENT MOD, YOU WON'T REGRET IT:

												I'm going to be frank and say that this is probably one of the best-written video games I've ever played.  With a bevy of plot-twists and an engaging system of character building in d20 format, Knights of the Old Republic 2 grabbed my attention and never dropped it.Obsidian's trademark writing style is in full tilt here as they show off their amazing ability to elaborate on characters such that you know precisely who you're talking to in-depth beyond surface layers that most companies would present, and unlike the way KOTOR 1 was handled by Bioware, you're not a moustache-twirling cartoonish loony if you go for the Dark Side choices.The game is deeply philosophical and looks into what it really means to be a Force Sensitive person; it provides an interesting perspective into the nature of the Force that in my opinion isn't really seen very much elsewhere via both the insight and backstory of one of your companions and your own personal journey through the story.The biggest cons that I would give to it are that it's unpolished.  I'm not sure if Obsidian built themselves up over an indian burial ground or what happened but it seems like these guys just -cannot- catch a break when it comes to actually getting enough time to finish their product before it gets rushed to the market.  There's a lot of amazing content that's restored by the appropriately named Sith Lords Restoration Project and its sister issues, including scraps of what was left of an -entire droid planet- and several storylines that were kiboshed and remained partially in or were stripped completely from the remainder of the game.  This adds several hours of playtime and is really worth it in the long run if you want the full experience even if you can easily tell for the most part what's been spliced back in by a modding team (the scenes in many cases weren't complete).Personally, uh, if you're going to go for the complete experience, though, I'd recommend you skip the Droid Planet. Last I checked that fan-project was unstable and buggy, not to mention really long-slogging and full of lag.  Might be worth it for a completionist, but there just wasn't enough data left to make it seem worthwhile.  Correct me if I'm wrong, folks.Anyway, finishing up, get this game.  It's worth it just to sit back and listen to some of the conversations.  The gameplay's just a plus.			"

												KotOR II is one of the best RPGs of the modern age, rivaling even that of it's predecessor. To this day, after hundreds of games, it is still one of my absolute favorites. It has one of the best stories, a great combat system, gorgeous graphics (even by today's standards).Unlike most games being thrown at us with a big ""BUY ME!"" sign attached to it these days, this game actually makes you feel what you are doing. If you help that random person with a few credits, you feel like you actually matter in the universe. If you kill that person and steal the 3 cr. they had in their pocket, you actually feel terrible for it (unless you really are that cold heartless person that belongs with the Sith). You take note of your actions in this game, and every little detail and encounter/conversation is memorable.That being said, there is one problem I have encountered. Just one. In order to make this game work in wide screen, and higher resolutions, you have to do a little work. But don't let this deter you from playing it, as this little set-back will not effect your gameplay experience at all, only your screen size is affected.I whole-heartedly guarantee that this game will become a favorite for you as well. There is no doubt about it, you will love this game, and may even fall in love with it's characters.			"

It's like KotOR, but with a bigger and better story, and it stood the test of time much better. (Player KotOR on a modern system is more aggravating than playing TSL on a modern system.) The only thing I have to say is that the game was extremely rushed through development and was released with a lot of bugs. So you should get TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restored Conent Mod) before you start. It's basically a mod that put back in content that was blocked out because of the rushed release, and fixes a lot of the bugs.			"

												This game is one of my top 5 favorite Star Wars games ever made… but it is still kind of a mess. It has bugs, plot-holes, moments of broken scripting and dialogue that feels like it's missing crucial sentences but it is still a great game. Modders have tried very hard, bless their hearts, but it's unlikely the Sith Lords will ever be made whole.What's here is still absolutely worth experiencing though, so if you have any attachment to the Star Wars universe, buying this is a no-brainer and even if you just like RPG's and story-driven games, I highly recommend giving it a shot.On a side note, my most recent playthrough (of many) was early in 2015, right before achievements were added, and it accounted for roughly 38 hours of play-time. I was playing with the latest versions of TSL Restored Content Mod and M4-78 Enhancement Project. As with the main game, they're not perfect, but a lot of great work has been put into them and you should check them out if you can.			"

Big, Bold and Beautiful One of, if not the best Star Wars games to date, and an essential addition to anyone with love for the Star Wars universe or RPG games. Runs surprisingly smooth on Windows 10, looks beautiful in 1080p, and is an all-round great storytelling experience that keeps players invested in the characters they create. The soundtrack (like KOTOR before it) is just beautiful - reflecting the locations and characters perfectly. I was also rather impressed with the improvements to customization whether it be aesthetic or abilities. I'm currently back into my 4th playthrough, and still thoroughly enjoying all the game has to offer. If you're currently fence sitting about purchasing, jump right in and I guarentee you won't be dissapointed.			"

												I've owned the CD retail distribution for years, but I ended up buying the steam version for the convenience of the workshop.Many would like to argue that the first game bests this one, and in many ways it does, but I believe that KOTOR II tells a different story that carries its own value, and one that very satisfyingly puts the Jedi and the Sith in an ambiguous position for the player to judge for themself. It's a great game. Buggy, sure, and the graphics don't look all that great. Hell, even the restored content mod fails to correct a lot of audio glitches, especially at the beginning of the game. But this game is quite the work of art from a writing perspective, and I find the characters to be far more interesting and compelling than in the first KOTOR.My suggestion to enjoy this game the most is to play it just how you yourself would react to the events that happen to the main character. Don't try to stick too hard to the light side or the dark side, because then you end up being either overly generous or stupidly aggressive and homocidal to be taken seriously. Just play it like you would, and enjoy the events as they come.I play this game once a year almost religiously. A+, would recommend to anybody who loves the Star Wars universe to bits. ^^			"

												Okay, everyone gives this game a lot of ♥♥♥♥ for not being a worthy sequel of the first one. Everyone talks about how it was rushed, it's buggy, there's a lot of things unfinished, and honestly I can't really dispute those claims. BUT, this game, for me, is actually better than the first one.The dialogue in this game surpasses KOTOR I's dialogue by leaps and bounds. Honestly, I have never, and probably never will, experience such incredible storytelling as Obsidian's writers managed to pull off. Your story of being the last Jedi, exiled from your rightful title after a horrible war, will drag you through the jungle moon of Dxun, the dry, evil sands of Korriban, and the gangster paradise of Nar Shaddaa, to name a few. The first character you meet, Kreia, shoud be forever considered one of the most interesting characters ever created in a video game. She is so mysterious and wise that you can't help but be influenced by her presence, and every dialogue tree with her makes you crave more after it's over.I love the dynamism of light side and dark side in this game. Being the last Jedi, you can choose to walk the path of redemption, reclaiming your rightful title as Jedi once more, or doom the galaxy to eternal pain and suffering, becoming an incredibly powerful Sith Lord. All the possible choices you have in certain scenarios give you Light Side or Dark Side points, and building your character to become an unstoppable force, slaughtering everyone in sight, is hilariously entertaining.I played the Xbox version previously before I bought it on the PC, and I can tell you, if you look up TSL Restoration Mod, the creators have done an AMAZING job bringing back all the things that Obsidian wasn't able to deliver on due to the rushed production. I think that many people think KOTOR II is inferior to I for this reason, but with the restoration, I don't think that there's any real argument that this game wouldn't have completely outshadowed KOTOR I in every way.

												So, for all of you holdouts out there, I'd like to talk a bit about my favorite game of all time. The gameplay may not be for everybody (although I and many RPG fans do enjoy it), the original release was a shell of a game, and yet, KOTOR 2 has cemented it's spot as my favorite game of all time for years. 6 years, in fact: once TSLRCM 1.5 (The Restored Content Mod) was released in late 2009 and articles started to circulate, I replayed for the first time in years and fell in love. Gameplay: With the Restored Content Mod, it's essentially the same as the first KOTOR (necessary to really enjoy and understand the second one IMO). There are some new powers and feats, there's some rebalancing, but it feels pretty much identical. Same engine and all. If you've played KOTOR, Skip this.The gameplay involves a fusion of turn based and real time RPG mechanics. You encounter enemies, and can pause to click on enemies and select actions for you and up to two party members, similar to Dragon Age and Mass Effect. Characters level up and learn new feats (vanilla character enhancements and new moves) and Force powers (if the character is Force-Senstive).Out of combat, you walk around in real time and click to interact with things. In conversations, you have many choices for dialogue (over 5 isn't rare) and each one is fully written out (no misunderstandings from a conversation wheel!). Think Fallout: New Vegas (Fun Fact: Obsidian developed KOTOR 2 *and* F:NV).Graphics: The game came out in 2005 and looked kinda dated for back then. The game can clean up nicely with mods, but it will not be looking anything near as good as even the original Mass Effect. Still, the graphics do their job, and the environments and skyboxes are both well done. Characters have a subtle range of facial emotion. Atmosphere is good.Sound: With TSLRCM (I can't recommend it enough!), the sound becomes a strong part of the game. Weapon sounds are more pronounced and consistent, music is timed well and highly atmospheric, and you forget about the early 2000s graphics. Voice acting is excellent, with a few exceptions amongst minor characters you may see in side quests. The main character is not voiced, however. Story: Much of the story and atmosphere of the game is best to be discovered as you play, but a general summary is fine. You play as a Jedi Exile (Canonically Female, named Meetra Surik), who was banished from the order for helping lead a war call to protect planets from the Mandalorians against the orders of the Jedi Council. The Council's reasons for staying out of the war are vague and are meant to be. The war ended with great sacrifices, and your connection to the Force was lost. This unique backdrop sets the tone for a complete deconstruction of everything Star Wars. There are somewhat legitimate Gray Jedi builds (unaigned and with bonuses from certain armor or weapons), Nihilistic overtones, and Sith like you've never seen before. KOTOR 2 is without a doubt my favorite game story of all time, even beating out Deus Ex and Half-Life. It works so well as a deconstruction of everything Star Wars. This is not your ordinary Star Wars game, and if you have at least watched the movies and played the first KOTOR, you are in for what I would dare call a storytelling masterpiece.			"

												A classic, now better than ever.In a move rarely seen outside of moneygrabs, a company (Aspyr) has picked up a forgotten game after the collapse of the original owner company LucasArts. Aspyr hasn't added any content to the game, but they have ported it and updated it to run on modern computers. This includes Windows 10, Mac, and even Linux.Plus Steam Workshop support has been added, though it should be used with caution. There's a crippling bug that causes the game to crash if you have more than 5 Workshop mods installed at once. This is easily circumvented, though, since there's still severeal KotOR2 mod sites still online with most of the same mods. I use Workshop for the Restored Content Mod and Skip Paragus. Everything else I install manually.Graphically, there's no escaping that this game was originally designed with the PS2 and original Xbox in mind. The models are as chunky as they come, and some of the textures are downright blurry. Oddly, some textures are amazingly sharp and crisp, while others are not, and there's some fairly advanced shader effects scattered around that seem unlikely to be from the original version. It feels like Aspyr is slowly improving the textures and other graphics, but I cannot prove that.As for the quality of the game itself, it's one of my favorites. I played the living tar out of this on my Xbox back in the day. It's a great story with plenty to explore and a combat system that allows some complex strategy. If you like to min/max stats, this is a great game for you. There's thousands of items all with unique stats and effects, as well as the ability to customize many items with upgrades. Specialize your characters to create synergy in combat.GRIPES!This is far from a perfect game.In terms of Aspyr's changes, the game is much more playable than it was before, but there's still some problems. Workshop is only just working, as I've mentioned. Then there's an issue with the game minimizing every time there's a cutscene. It's only midly inconvenient, but it is worth mentioning. I like to think Aspyr's still working on these issues, though.Then there's the issues with the game as it was and always will be. The start of the story is slow. Like crazy slow. It isn't bad the first time playing though, but after a few replays it gets very tedious since there's not a lot of choice you can make that early in the game. Fortunately, there's a mod to fix that.			"

If you help that random person with a few credits, you feel like you actually matter in the universe. If you kill that person and steal the 3 cr. they had in their pocket, you actually feel terrible for it (unless you really are that cold heartless person that belongs with the Sith). You take note of your actions in this game, and every little detail and encounter/conversation is memorable.That being said, there is one problem I have encountered. Just one. In order to make this game work in wide screen, and higher resolutions, you have to do a little work. But don't let this deter you from playing it, as this little set-back will not effect your gameplay experience at all, only your screen size is affected.I whole-heartedly guarantee that this game will become a favorite for you as well. There is no doubt about it, you will love this game, and may even fall in love with it's characters.			"

												This game is quite possibly one of the best RPGs that I have ever played. Once you get a hang of the game, as in what to do when, and where,  it becomes a bit easier than you would expect it to be, however there are often bosses that will throw you off of your game every once in a while. Since the game takes 5 years after the original KotOR it is recomended that you play the first one in order to get the 'full effect' of the story. All in all, this game is definitley worth your money if you are an avid RPG lover, Star Wars Lover, or just a person looking for a good gaming experience.			"

												Generally very good and very similar to the first one. Kreia is extremely poor and annoying character in my opinion and the ending was not satisfying in my opinion. Actually it was quite confused to get what is going on. I could talk more about flaws as it did not impress me as much as the first one. Then why I recommend it? Simply as it is a great copy of the first game, that will give you a lot of pleasurable hours with Star Wars. Great RPG made whne BioWare was at the top.

												I've owned the CD retail distribution for years, but I ended up buying the steam version for the convenience of the workshop.Many would like to argue that the first game bests this one, and in many ways it does, but I believe that KOTOR II tells a different story that carries its own value, and one that very satisfyingly puts the Jedi and the Sith in an ambiguous position for the player to judge for themself. It's a great game. Buggy, sure, and the graphics don't look all that great. Hell, even the restored content mod fails to correct a lot of audio glitches, especially at the beginning of the game. But this game is quite the work of art from a writing perspective, and I find the characters to be far more interesting and compelling than in the first KOTOR.My suggestion to enjoy this game the most is to play it just how you yourself would react to the events that happen to the main character. Don't try to stick too hard to the light side or the dark side, because then you end up being either overly generous or stupidly aggressive and homocidal to be taken seriously. Just play it like you would, and enjoy the events as they come.I play this game once a year almost religiously. A+, would recommend to anybody who loves the Star Wars universe to bits. ^^			"

Big, Bold and Beautiful One of, if not the best Star Wars games to date, and an essential addition to anyone with love for the Star Wars universe or RPG games. Runs surprisingly smooth on Windows 10, looks beautiful in 1080p, and is an all-round great storytelling experience that keeps players invested in the characters they create. The soundtrack (like KOTOR before it) is just beautiful - reflecting the locations and characters perfectly. I was also rather impressed with the improvements to customization whether it be aesthetic or abilities. I'm currently back into my 4th playthrough, and still thoroughly enjoying all the game has to offer. If you're currently fence sitting about purchasing, jump right in and I guarentee you won't be dissapointed.			"

												When it comes down to it, this is simply the best Star Wars story ever written. Mainly, because of it's break from the usual ""the Jedi are perfect and always right"". Of course, it is well known for being buggy and being produced and pushed out so quickly. Obsidian cut too much from the final product if you ask me but there are tons of mods out there for this game. From fixing such annoying bugs to unlocking entire new planets for you to explore. And don't let the hours fool you, I've played this a dozen times on console before I got my PC. Also recommend playing the first one as this game takes place 5 years after the first. Overall, I love this game, because of the story, the companions, and Kreia. And if you can get past the bugginess, I have no doubt you'll love it as well.			"

												An excellent RPG that brings you back to the times when RPGs had a lot of diverse dialogue, unique character interactions and stories. A worthy sequel to KOTOR1 that portrays a story where Jedi aren't exactly the universe's knights in shining armor, until you come into the equation anyway.Each planet you explore has it's own set of quests to do and every companion you come across has their own unique dialogue and back story to find out. Albeit some are more interesting than others.Only issues is that it's somewhat easy even on Hard mode, the start is a bit tedious as you're trapped on a mining facility and even though this 11 year old game got an update to give it a modern shine, it's got a few bugs here and there. Nothing serious though. Also download the restored content mod from the Steam workshop which mods back in some content that had to be cut due to time constraints.			"

												In light of the recent patches to the game, I'm going to have to stick with my very ambitious but flawed gem answer. It's Obsidian doing what they do best, setting lofty goals for their projects and just barely missing the mark because they bit off more than they could chew.The Peragus mining facility goes on for far too long. It could have been cut in half or just cut entirely with you starting off on Telos. The fact Peragus/Telos is so long makes replaying the game unappealing solely because of how much time you have to sink into the game before you're finally allowed to explore the other planets. Many story arcs and companions are woefully underdone and stand in stark contrast to the ones that are well written and very fleshed out. Another minute complaint is that Handmaiden and Disciple are not very well balanced against themselves, they shouldn't have had identical stats and feats.All that aside, I like the more somber tone this game has over it's predcessor. The few story arcs they did finish are interesting, the few companions they did flesh out are really well done. The skills are balanced against themselves, no one of them is so bad it should never be taken by the PC. The crafting was very well implemented. The amount of customization allowed for with your companions and the flexibility of the Exile leaves you for a lot of room to mix and match, something I really enjoy in games like this.Warts and all, I still think the positives of this outweigh the negatives. Look into the Restored Content fan patch, it adds a lot of interesting things and implements some of the content that had to be left on the cutting floor due to time and budget retraints.			"

												I am about halfway through the game right now, playing through for the first time and wow wow wow. I am a huge fan of the first game, and this takes it to a whole new level. Basically the same software as the first game, same graphics and menus and all, but the gameplay has been expanded so much, and there is so much more you can do and NEED to pay attention to.  -The updated crafting system, which involves salvaging items and creating weapons, armor, and modifications for both, is really addicting and much more deep than KotOR 1.  - The dialogue options and personal connections you can achieve with the characters is amazing, including the Lore, the relationships possible, the twists (most of which I have yet to experience I'm sure) are, again, very deep and enjoyable to explore.- The locations and planets you visit are large and worth of the Obsidian/Bioware partnership. These dev's are well known for the deep content they are able to produce, and the large worlds they can create. George Lucas would ♥♥♥♥ his pants if he played this game. There are things about Star Wars in this that he probably doesn't even know. If you like Star Wars and RPG's, MUST BUY			"

												This game was infamously incomplete upon release, with a ton of cut content and numerous bugs which can infrequently rear their ugly heads. At times (albiet not in a long time for me, and on the old 4-disk version, not Steam), it became literally unplayable, blocking me from progressing the story or even being a jittery, graphical mess that's liable to crash from the get-go. But although it can be really frustrating at times, if you're willing to press on, which I highly recommend you do, what we have here is an astounding Star Wars game with a wonderful sense of atmosphere, and a terrific, really dark story about the aftermath of huge wars. While a lot of content is missing from the game (and should you not be willing to try the Restored Content Mod for whatever reason), the stuff that's there is still amazing. The voice actors do a tremendous job and the writing is very solid. In short, gameplay allows you to explore several parts of this war-weary galaxy, learn more about their history and current situations, and even choose your own outcomes - light or dark, adding to replay value. I've lost count of how many times I've played through the entire thing, and whatever the actual number is, it is guaranteed to rise in the future. Despite its problems - and they are big problems, I admit - this has become my favourite game of all time.			"

It had a high bar to try and meet with respect to its predecessor, but this game still has excellent gameplay elements, references and cameos from the first game without becoming campy, and another well-told story. It's worth your time, even if it is becoming a bit dated at this point.			"

												Knight of the Old Republic II.This game. The more you play it, the more it gets better. This belongs to the Underrated category, being superior than its predecessor, biowares KoTor.This game sets up few years after the events of the original KoTor game. This Time you play as ""the exile"" an ex jedi who followed Revan to war against the Mandalorian threath. On your journey you discover a terrible thruth: You are the key to kill the force.This new concept on killing the force is really something new in star wars. Every single star wars game is about ruling something. Lets talk about locations.Tutorial:  This game has an skippable tutorial level, but i recomend you to play it, since there are few mechanics that are different than the Biowares KoTor. The level is located inside the Ebon Hawk. Revan's ship from the last game.1st level. Peragus mining asteroid.Wow. I really enjoyed this level. You face countlets of enemies and try to find out why everyone is mysteriously dead. Venturing deeper this mysterious dead rock you meet your 3 first companions. The level desing is great lightings are marvelous.2nd. Level. Telos shipyard and surface.This location acts like a pit stop. A location for you to catch up what has happened during these years and why there are no more jedis. As location this is the weakest on my opinion. There is much to do, but at that time of the game I really wanted to get the hell out of there. Still enjoyable.(Next locations will be mentioned briefly, because these I dont want to spoil)Dxun moon, Onderon, Nar Shaddaa, Dantooine, Korriban, Malachor.All of them have enjoyable areas. many cool enemies and really beautifull landscapes.Companions: The companions are ALL good. Best written characters in star wars. Depends on your affection to them they are seen wandering around the Ebon Hawk. They argue against eachothers and even plot against some characters. And for the first time it really matters wich gender you pick. Female: gets the Diciple.Male: gets Brianna.And even your Dark/Lightside affects 2 companions. Hanharr and MiraIf you are evil you get the mad wookiee. If you are a saint, a good bounty hunter will aproach you.These details add replay-value, because they add their own story to the game and own dilemas that you have to solve.Many people dislike this game, but to be honest Obsidian made an amazing job with this one. Lack of time and money made the game shorter and many good content were cut off from the final product. This is one of the greatest star wars games that i have played (I have played many). From PC tie fighter to the newest Star wars Battlefront. This Game is on my top 3. Maybe even the Best star wars game that i have played. Surpassing KoTor and Jedi Knight serie.Overall score: 9/10Try it? yesBuy it? yesHave physical copy? YES			"

												Many people criticize this game for bugs and all I can say is that there are solutions!!Specifically you just have to download the TSLRCM mod and it fixes the majority of the bugs and missing cutscenes.The reason the game is so broken in it's released stage is because when they were making it they were suddenly rushed to finished it and what happened was a game with many bugs and missing cutscenes. If you download the mod than this game will be amazing, just like it's predecessor it has a rich story and clever dialogue and is without a doupt worth 10$.			"

												I've owned the CD retail distribution for years, but I ended up buying the steam version for the convenience of the workshop.Many would like to argue that the first game bests this one, and in many ways it does, but I believe that KOTOR II tells a different story that carries its own value, and one that very satisfyingly puts the Jedi and the Sith in an ambiguous position for the player to judge for themself. It's a great game. Buggy, sure, and the graphics don't look all that great. Hell, even the restored content mod fails to correct a lot of audio glitches, especially at the beginning of the game. But this game is quite the work of art from a writing perspective, and I find the characters to be far more interesting and compelling than in the first KOTOR.My suggestion to enjoy this game the most is to play it just how you yourself would react to the events that happen to the main character. Don't try to stick too hard to the light side or the dark side, because then you end up being either overly generous or stupidly aggressive and homocidal to be taken seriously. Just play it like you would, and enjoy the events as they come.I play this game once a year almost religiously. A+, would recommend to anybody who loves the Star Wars universe to bits. ^^			"

Big, Bold and Beautiful One of, if not the best Star Wars games to date, and an essential addition to anyone with love for the Star Wars universe or RPG games. Runs surprisingly smooth on Windows 10, looks beautiful in 1080p, and is an all-round great storytelling experience that keeps players invested in the characters they create. The soundtrack (like KOTOR before it) is just beautiful - reflecting the locations and characters perfectly. I was also rather impressed with the improvements to customization whether it be aesthetic or abilities. I'm currently back into my 4th playthrough, and still thoroughly enjoying all the game has to offer. If you're currently fence sitting about purchasing, jump right in and I guarentee you won't be dissapointed.			"

												GOOD LORD WHAT THE HELL I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHYThis game was never coming to Steam. Never, not in a million billion years, not even in a galaxy far, far away. It was the best Star Wars game they never wanted anyone to play - blacklisted by the publishers, for one magnificent reason - it was the best anti-Star Wars game ever made.But what hurt them the most was it was also one of the best Star Wars games ever made.If you liked the original, you'll love the sequel. Hands-down it improves, tweaks, and drags everything set by the previous game into a whole new light. The only thing holding it back from mythical, genre-smashing record is the fact that it just wasn't finished. It was rushed, pushed out before it was done, and probably through no fault at all of the developer (Obsidian).Seriously, if you love role-playing games, and either love or hate Star Wars, you get this. You get it now and Stop Worrying And Learn How To Love The Kreiya. God-damn. KOTOR2 on Steam.			"

												This may be the single most underrated video game of all time. In fairness, the original version (as I played it on my Xbox) was indeed a bit of a mess.

Playing through this game again - this time with the restored content mod - was an awesome opportunity I never thought I would have.If the philosophy of Star Wars has ever interested you in a deeper way, this game was written for you. The way the story deconstructs the Force - what it means to be a Jedi, a Sith, what generalizations those titles reflect, and what meaning they contain is infinitely fascinating, and I find myself reflecting on the scenarios and characters introduced in this game more so than any other Star Wars property (and most science fiction in general).If you want to unravel the true mysteries of the Force - or just want to find out what happens after the first KotOR - this game is definitely worth your time.

												The first in a series of flawed diamonds by Obsidian.It was a warm summer's day when Bioware was busy working on other projects that they had started and soon discovered that they couldn't fit KoToR 2 into their projects. So they walked over to Obsidian entertainment and knocked on the door and formed an agreement to allow Obsidian to develop KoTor 2 for them. However, Bioware was impatient so they only had a year of development time to work on it. Obsidian sat down and immediatley got to work, as the studio only had around 10-15 people working in it at the time, all the time they had was invaluable. Lots of time was spent making assests that were never put into the final game, thus, time was spent. Obsidians greatest strength was in the writing department, as they did not view moral choices just as a simple ""black & white"" dialogue option. No, to them it was all grey, as in you could save the princess but you had to let the dragon destroy the village choices. In Obsidian's characters, everybody has a personality that expressed what kind of person every character was, just through talking to the player. Obsidian were true nobles in this field.As Obsidian got closer to the deadline, more and more assests were cut from the final game. Leaving the original vision a ""Treasure in a deep sea of monsters."" Many assests were cut and untested and unfiltered bugs were present due to the short QA testing period that was received. Distraught as they were at the final product, Obsidian regretted spending too much time developing certain assests of the game and too little time in other parts. With fear of negative criticism from the press, fans, and of course Bioware, Obsidian took to the internet to see what the public was saying about KoToR 2. To their surprise, the fans loved it with negative criticism going toward the number of many bugs and glitches that were present, and postive criticism going toward everything included in the writing, especially the dialogue from party members like Kreia and Atton. Given the number of people working at Obsidian at the time and the amount of time they had, Obsidian managed to turn a Hardees into a Jack-in-the-box. Kreia even went on to win ""Most Original character of the year"" from Gamespy that year.Obsidian learning from their first project, went on to make memorable game such as Alpha Protocol, Neverwinter Nights 2 + Expansions, Fallout: New Vegas (which suffered a similar experience), and soon to be South Park: The Stick of truth and Pillars of Eternity. If you like RPG's with great characters and grey morality, then Obsidian has it down. "

												It was a thing for a reason in its timeITS GOODThe good:The story, better than any movie of starwars you have seen until nowThe voice acting, excelent everyone has a proper voice for their characters and the ones that should, actually sound baddassThe choices, they are not totally ground-changing but they afect things at the moment and will affect some of the futureYou can kill many annoying NPC's, some of your characters will praise you for thatGameplay, if this was played on real time it would have been perfect but, it serves its purpoise well its enjoyableThe acceptable:Visuals, for its age looks fineDungeons, all are large, this can be good and bad, but you got 2 forms of speed up wich helps took me some time to adjust myself in order to navigate themCustomisation, weapons and armor, are beyond of most games of today, character and powers are good but still missed a little moreCaution, is expected to have many saves in a game like thisThe bad:The dlc for the content that didnt arrived is bad, gets you some answer but the dungeon is a painBeing forced to use all of your cast, there are some characters that you would normally just avoid using them, but the game gives you no choice in some events, and you HAVE to use themYou cannot choose in the end, the ending is there whatever you have done will not change the major outcome  its a good ending and changing it would affect the timeline but still.... You cannot skip some scenes, why is this bad? because you have to poke a lot of choices to have what you want, so you will have to see these scenes again and againYou cannot choose your party, even if you cannot change the cast, not allowing them to go with you would be nice If you're sith in the refugee sector the game will punish you with a wookie instead of the mercenary F#%& that "

												Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II is a very special game to me. It has a well written storyline with plenty of side quests. It has really solid gameplay especially for its age. Being able to take the turn based combat into real time freely while preparing the next few actions you want to take in combat is a brilliant mechanic. The story aside from towards the end where it just felt rushed, was actually better compared to Knights of the Old Republic I. Gameplay was heavily improved over the original game and the companions you have felt just as well developed. The tag story rich is no understatement. This in my opinion is one of the best RPG's of all time. A lot of people find you towards the end of the game are a bit strong at least within my circle of friends who have played the game. Which I find in certain parts is true but Kotor II really does bring a moderate challenge in its gameplay. I felt many of the boss battles were a pretty entertaining. Towards the end i'm not ashamed to say I abused Force Lightning Storm and some kiting strategies to deal with a lot the enemies that i'd be fighting in groups of 5 or more. The game's lightside darkside system as always is just so well designed. My favorite part of my playthrough was me trying to perspective how i'd interact with these characters thrown into the scenario of the Jedi Exile and acting on my opinion and not a light side or dark side choice.The crafting system is really well done I loved the lightsaber crafting options and skill system requirements for crafting. The skill tree for combat was amazing a lot of diversity and freedom. Getting to the force skill tree it's in my opinion one of the best skill tree's i've ever had in a game really one of my favorite parts of the whole game is the amazing force abilities and the progression they make. I only wish there was more because it was so much fun achieving these force powers. Kotor II is the dream sequel to Kotor I honestly all it makes me want is for another one. We all pray for Kotor III because of how amazing these gems of the past are. There are still a few flaws obviously in the game glitches mostly. The biggest issue the game has is its age. Not because of graphics but more because of modern optimization.To start with the issues is how often it crashes. If it crashes at the loading screen for you or something i'm sorry never seen that issue happen to me once fix its resolution in its files. I found the game crashes from being full screen in very specific cutscenes often in world transitions. Hitting alt enter in the loading screen windowed modes the game. This fixed all of my crash issues i'd often just save before a cutscene since in most games they're obviously coming and alt enter if it crashed so I could enjoy my full screen glory. (When it didn't crash happened like 5 times throughout the game no mods installed)The inventory system itself is very poorly sorted wish I had a search bar to find items or certain stat types not even a big issue though. Abusable medpack tricks like activating one during your healing round inside your inventory while casting heal. Albeit I like this trick since it helped me in a situations where I failed to pay attention to gameplay and got chunked down. The AI for companions is pretty bad they like to run into fights repeatedly forcing my to loop between characters to continuously get them away from enemies as they'd run back in on 10% health and no force points. Good times with that I can say that much.Lightsaber on lightsaber combat damage is a little bit too high. For boss battles and even regular lightsaber combat I could say even having half damage on lightsaber damage. Maybe by having a special melee defense perk to reduce the damage would be nice since my Master Flurry Shreds boss HP. While bosses shred my HP way to quick kind of reducing the excitement of drawn out boss battle. This is the biggest fault of the combat system in the entire game and it's still not even that bad. I don't know if there is a mod for this but my final complaint is these older games often have no map markers which helps exploration but is more irritating when you have no idea where to go and the journal isn't helping much. I found this an occasional issue that can be extremely annoying. My last real issue besides the rushed ending is the slow start definitely wish I could skip that start.Also not enough Sith using force lightning abilities that ♥♥♥♥♥ top tier. (Fighting the Sith was really cool in all seriousness)Summing up review in a Tldr;Pro's:-Good RPG gameplay-Amazing Real time turn combat-One of the best written Star Wars stories ever made-Pretty Lightsabers-Strongly developed characters including the player character-Brilliant Force Powers-Decently Challenging-Awesome light and dark side choices-Amazing level up skill tree-Diverse gameplay options even though most of us go with jedi for the sake of our childhood-(Apathy is death)-Great Crafting systemCons:-(Forgot to add this) Getting a lightsaber takes a bit which kind of sucks but some might find this to be a good thing-Slow start (First 4 Hours)-Rushed ending (Last 2 Hours)-Inventory system is in need of a search bar you get a lot of garbage and have a lot of inventory space I think infinite-Cutscenes crash issues which for me were cured by windowed mode in certain cutscenes (Biggest issue in the whole game)-Lightsaber combat damage is really quick the damage to saber users have is too fast I personally just wanted longer fights because how epic they were.-Small abusable glitches nothing special-Not the brightest AI but not even near broken (Sorry if this isn't written that well i'm far from an English major)Overall Kotor II is the best Star Wars game I have ever played hands down and one of the best RPG games I have ever played it's one of my top 5 favorite games and if you get into it you'll understand why.9.5/10Try to get the original first if you can and playthrough it but if not this game can stand alone easily because of how good it is.

												I have heard a lot of people say that this one does not even compare to the original... I strongly disagree. So far, this one is BETTER than the original. In the following ways especially:- Allows you to CREATE items and not simply and only upgrade. Although you can do that to and the variety of upgrades are much larger too. - Walking around is much easier, A and D actually turn your character now. - The graphics are MUCH better should you adjust your settings accordingly. - Swoop racing is much more fun.- Combat mechanics have drastically improved. - Looting things is a lot nicer. It will tell you if something is empty on your screen so that you know you have been there already.- There are three options for hacking/slicing things. You can either slice, bash, or you can use an explosive which really simplifies things.- There are more but I do not want to take the time to list them.I have been very impressed with this game so far and look forward to progressing through it.

												WHat can I possibly say about KOTOR that hasn't been said yet?This game and KOTOR 1 are, to me, possibly the best games in the SW-franchise. I love the setting, thousands of years before the events in the movies. They did well with the vibe and stuff. However, please keep in mind that these games are rather old. They did work well on Steam (while the version I bought at a store and installed from a DVD required a ton of fiddling until they actually worked). They are not looking great anymore, but if you are into the story, check this out... it's such a fun story with a big twist/surprise (which of course, by now, everyone knows about). It's not quite as much fun when you play through it again, even though you can go for a different class, but the whole storyline, visiting those iconic places, unravelling the secrets is a ton of fun. one of the best RPGs ever for me, and if you don't mind playing very outdated (graphically) games, and you like SW and/or RPGs, make sure to get this!

												When I gave away my old PC games I kept few of them, being KOTOR 1 and 2 amongst them. I finished both once when they went out and I was thinking on playing them again but was a bit lazy about it... until recently.If you are a Star Wars fan, play KOTOR 1, then KOTOR 2... these are the games you are looking for.I'm not a hardcore gamer, nor a good reviewer, but I definitely feel like reviewing this game. I'm playing it with the Restored Content mod and I played this game first 10 years ago, so I don't really remember which parts are new.I'll start with the cons, not very important to me, and then get to the real point:- Just few choices on character aspect. - The controls are a bit weird.- Sometimes your character gets stuck.- You felt you had a lot of moving freedom back when the game came out but, for today's standards, you don't really have that freedom in terms of where to go.- Even in places supposed to be crowded, there's not many ""people"".- Sometimes the game becomes incredibly hard and forces you into a combat you're not ready to win, but you can't avoid and you HAVE to win... that forces you to:    a) runaway in circles while healing yourself and/or recover force power (which is boring and you feel like cheating).    b) cheat directly and avoid wasting time doing a) I've seem some reviews complaining about some of your companions being useless/weak or not interesting... that could be true, but the game allows you to show them you think that, so it's not a con to me. Plus, there are situations and dialogues that change depending on which companions you go with.For me, the rest is great... Great story, great characters, great dialogues, attention to details... I think that you can even have an idea of what happens in KOTOR 1 just asking questions (but play KOTOR 1). Oh! and lightsabers!!In my opinion you can face the game in two ways: thinking ahead what do you want to do and choose your dialogues and actions according to that, or don't think about it and just let yourself go. I strongly recommend the second option.The great writing and dialogues (and choices) allows you to do it. If you take your time to read and answer you will have a lot of information and it will help you to get into the story; once there, you will have an opinion of what happened and what to do next that will ""guide"" your path.This second part is not black and white and there are many options from clearly white to clearly black passing from not so clear ones. You can even be white sometimes and black others.I'm not going to make spoilers here but, although I remember very little from my first gameplay, I remember ending up halfway into the dark side using two red lighsabers. This time I'm full light side and I'm using a single blue one. I said you don't have a lot of freedom in movement, but you have that freedom on mostly everything else. You choose your weapons, your armour, Oh! and lightsabers!! You decide to help ones or others, or both, or none... You will stop many times thinking what choice do you want and measuring the consequences... (I confess I spend a lot of time pressing X just to do those lightsabers movement).My final thought is... KOTOR 3, please! How cool would it be a similar game with the roaming freedom of GTA or Elder Scrolls?And works great in Linux!!!Final words: get this game. 9/10			"

												Well, I just powered through my first playthrough, after putting it off for quite a long time. I completed KOTOR 1 a long time ago, and to the day it is a dearly beloved game to me.Some general pros and cons:Pros:-Turn-based gameplay with an active pause system (very handy)-Lots of cool Star Wars lore (and if you don't like that, you can skip through almost all of it)-More weapons/armor than the first game-A wide variety of sidequests-Karmic system: Be a nice guy or a scary madman (Darkside and lightside, baby)Cons:- Not a specific spoiler, but you choose if you want to see it: it will affect your attitude towards the rest of the game.  The ending. WTF?! So so so so many loose ends... -A decent number of weird bugs. However, quite a few can be corrected by workshop content-Space suit animation doe-It's not the prettiest game out there, but it'll do-Balacing issues, in turns of battle gameplay. It seems to roller coaster throughout the gameI can't say I loved this game quite as much as the first KOTOR. I really wanted to like it as much as the first, but it fell short. I would recommend checking out the restored content mods in the workshop to make the game better overall, I wasn't aware that they existed until after I finished my playthrough, so before playing I would definitely install that.I would give it a 8/10 overall. I want to be more critical, but I can't without going in-depth about the game's content (I don't like to spoil).			"

  Star Wars: Knights of The Old Republic: The Sith Lords  Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords is one of my all time favourite games to date. Whilst it was rushed slightly into production due to tight time constraints, the Restored Content Mod is currently available for all on the Steam Workshop if the player desires to play through the game including cut content, for a more full experience.I also highly reccommend playing through the first game beforehand, as there are several links to that game, however it is not vital to understand the story. Basic Plot The start of this sequel is quite similar to that of the previous game, however you play as a new character- the Exile. You a adrift in space in the Ebon Hawk, unconcious, unaware of what has happened. With the help of your trusty droid, T3-M4, who you can play as in the optional prologue, you dock at a nearby station- the Peragus Mining Facility.You awake on the station, trapped, and much like in the previous game you must escape, meeting interesting characters on your journey who all have an important role in the storyline.You escape the station, after encounters with the Sith, who you realise are hunting you as they are led to belive you are the last surviving Jedi.The next system, Telos, is where you start discovering that you are not the last of the Jedi, and that members of the Jedi Council have fled to other systems. In an attempt to start a resistance, you travel around to many planets locating and uniting the last Jedi, as you are the last hope for the Republic. Features The tale is extremely gripping and enticing, and whilst the format remains almost the same as KOTOR, there are suprises around every corner, with things not always going to plan- adding to the adventurous feel.There is little noticable graphical improvement from the last game, and so the graphics still feel slightly aged. This, however, does not create an impact on the enjoyability of the game as they stay appealing.The control given to the player is better than before, with more character influence, dialogue options, light/dark side paths, whereas there remains to be 2 optional endings.However, though, this game is buggier than it's predecessor due to the rushed release, but the game has recieved a fairly recent patch, which will solve most issues.The HUD, combat and controls remains virtually identical to KOTOR, so it stays turn-based, which may appeal to some, and full controller support has been added for the gamers that prefer them to a mouse and keyboard, or want an alternative way to play this title. Pros & Cons Pros:-Excellent story, with great adventure-EPIC finale-Brilliant atmosphere-New characters each with their own extensive background-Further control over your destiny, and other characters-As always, great replayabilityCons:-A few more game bugs, nothing major- but still annoying-Little graphical improvement Final Score -Another 10/10 - Would kill meatbags again Further Information KOTOR II should take a similar time to complete as the previous game, with plenty of sidequests.This game will always be at the top of my favourites. I have never played any games quite like the KOTOR series, set aside by their unparalleled stories.P.S. I personally reccommend installing the Sith Lords: Restored Content Mod to enjoy any lost cut content to give the game a fuller feel- and the widescreen game stretch fix from the Steam Workshop. However, I seriously reccommend avoiding installing 'M4-78' to the game, the droid planet that was cut from the game before release, as I believe it is confusing, and not enjoyable in any way.			"

												KOTOR 2 is a third person action RPG with heavy Dungeons & Dragons gameplay mechanics despite looking like an older version of Mass Effect.  It’s an overall great experience if you want to dive into the Star Wars mythology that took place long before any of the Star Wars movies. However, if you’re used to your RPGs being like Diablo or Legend of Zelda, be warned that there isn’t all that much “skill” involved with playing KOTOR 2. You need to plan and play strategically throughout the game. You do not need quick reflexes or any aiming skills. – 8/10As the title suggests, the story takes place during the age of the Old Republic, when everyone knew what Jedi / Sith were, and most of the galaxy was barely keeping from falling apart after a recent war. A number of years has passed since the events of KOTOR 1, and you play the role of “the exile,” a former Jedi who seems to have lost his/her memory and is slowly gaining back control of the force (by leveling up). The reason you were exiled by the Jedi order is slowly revealed over the length of the game, and it has to do with the fact that you fought during the war instead of staying neutral as the Jedi council commanded. Joke’s on them though since you’re now one of the last living Jedi and the council has been shattered with the masters all on the run. There is a ton of backstory that you can learn by talking to everyone in the game, but if you’re like me, you’re not playing a Star Wars game to read text, you want to kick some ♥♥♥ with a lightsaber. Unlike the first KOTOR game, your customizable character has Jedi powers right from the start of the game so there’s no reason to hold off on leveling. Yeah it can be a little counterintuitive to new players, but unlike many RPGs you don’t automatically level up when you reach the required experience amount. You actually choose when to level up (as long as you have the required exp) and you need to take some time to allocate your skill / attribute / power points that you are rewarded with each time you level. This is why in the first KOTOR, it was a good idea to hold off on leveling up until you become a Jedi a couple hours into the game (before you’re a Jedi you don’t get force power points on level up). As for combat, if you’ve played Dragon Age or Baldur’s Gate, you would be familiar with the way fights happen. The game automatically pauses when you come within range of an enemy, and you queue up a bunch of actions (attack, casting powers, etc.) and then you unpause and the fight occurs, both sides “taking turns” attacking. You can have up to 3 people in your party most of the game including your player character, so take advantage of the pause to queue up actions for all 3 members of your group. This can get tedious by the end of the game when you’re strong enough to stomp on most of your enemies, but this is why I said earlier that there really isn’t much skill involved with this game. Just make sure your characters are well equipped, and armed with decent skills / attributes and you’ll be fine. Despite the fact that half the people in the game use guns, there is no aiming required on your part, and just like most Dungeons & Dragons type games, most of the attacks in the game miss. Get used to the slow combat where +1 to attack is a bonus that you’d actually want.One of the really important aspects of KOTOR 2 is party member “influence,” which is separate from the light side / dark side alignment system. Throughout the game you can gain or lose influence with members of your team (kind of like friendship points) depending on the conversation choices you make, and your actions (killing innocent people or choosing whose side you’re on in a conflict).  When you build up enough influence with a team member you can get permanent bonuses such as +1 to certain stats or special powers. You also have the opportunity to turn a lot of your team members into Jedi, which is always nice. It’s a little weird but you can also turn a party member into a Jedi by losing enough influence, but this will turn them to the opposite alignment. For example I played dark side and kept insulting one of my team members until he became a light side Jedi, maybe just to spite me.The light/dark alignment system on the other hand mostly depends on how you act towards non-player characters (like killing innocent people or insulting everyone) and can have a significant effect on the game’s storyline. There are a few planets you visit where you basically choose who ends up ruling the world. It is possible (but difficult) to completely swing your alignment during a playthrough. For example, you can play as light side for half the game and eventually work your way to dark side by the end. The alignment doesn’t affect combat that much since you have access to almost 99% of the force powers no matter what your alignment is. Play evil to have more fun and get more money though. Pros:+Very expansive story and if you want to read through it you can spend about 40 hours in one playthrough. +If you’re a Dungeons & Dragons fan you should enjoy the game’s role playing aspect and complex character building/planning.+The game has undergone a major update years after release, adding a bunch of Steam achievements and fixing some stuff. Cons:-If you’re not into “talky” games you can get bored of the constant conversations in the game, a lot of which seems repetitive. Also, as I mentioned above you get really powerful by the end, and a bunch of ankle biter enemies can be annoying you without actually being a threat.-The game’s plot is fine up until near the end where honestly the main villain’s motivation is kind of dumb.-There are a number of really annoying bugs in the game but there are workarounds that you can find online.  You’ll want to make a lot of saves in this game because a few of the bugs can be game breaking.I played the first KOTOR game many years ago and wasn’t really planning on playing KOTOR 2 (a lot of game backlog and this game takes 30 hours to beat), but after finishing the game recently on a whim, I immediately started up a second playthrough to play as an evil character. I’m usually into action/shooter games but there’s definitely a lot of satisfaction to be had in building an awesome Jedi who can force lightning enemies into submission.  "

												In general everyone seems to think KoTOR is better than TSL. I am not among the general.That said, TSL has some buggy stuff where suddenly you and all your people are Sith aligned. CTDs. The script language does not always make sense, and the paths forward are not always clear. The said, the scope here is almost as impressive as the philosophy.You are again a mysterious stranger. You don't wait as long to find out who you are. Mentored by an old Jedi, once again you assemble a team and make choices. Some of these forward your relationship to gain character backstory. Some of these increase your leanings. Again, you decide how you want to play: Kill 'em all and let the force sort them out, be at peace with anything that doesn't aggro you, or meh.The depth of the story, though, is impressive. There is betrayal, Jedi gone rogue, some dude who is literally falling apart after trying to kill his master, and a boss that consumes the force for sustenance. They all tie-in to the greater story explored in the novels of who is Revan, was he good or bad (or she, again, the canon is overthrown), and what force exists beyond what can be seen by the Jedi council that threatens all of Republic space? You can also help ""rebuild"" the Mandalorians, train your own Jedi/Sith team, and destroy a planet. It's really cool. Toss in the restored content and other mods (just like KoTOR), and you've got serious replayability.recommended buy, but again, wait for a sale. It happens a lot. Save them dolladolla bills.			"

												I just finished playing the game and it took my 47 hours to do just about everything the game had to offer. I played with the mod TSLRCM.Here are my thoughts on this game: All in all I would rate this as one of the greatest Action Roleplaying Games on PC (Fallout, Baldurs Gate 2, Mass Effect, etc.) but I have to admit this left me with somewhat mixed feelings.Game was developed really fast (less than one year!?) and well - it shows. You cannot rush a masterpiece.Let´s start with the bad stuff (Cons)* All in all game feels so unfinished and there´s so many places and parts in the game where you have to wonder ""I bet this would have been great with one more year of time for developers""* There are some annoying bugs. E.g. after combat ends your characted gets stuck and even though there are tips that say you should turn off/on the V-sync they really don´t help in all cases (e.g. in my case). You can live with this bug as it is totally random and doesn´t happen all the time and when it does you just have to F4+F5 (quick save + quick load) after the battles.* Difficulty is so unbalanced and this most likely is due to lack of play testing. Some parts are almost impossible and some parts (most of the game) perhaps too easy. The difficult parts are the ones where you have to play without your main character and if you haven´t micromanaged and optimized the NPCs in your party really carefully. Also some skills are overbowered and some are underbowered. Same goes for items and weapons and well...just about everything* Ending...let´s just say the last place you go in your adventure takes you gets grindy and repetative. Not a worthy ending for otherwise solid story* Then there are small things which are kinda ""90s"" like the inventory managementBut even with those all flaws I highly recommend this game. Story is great, the NPCs in your party are well written and there´s lots of humour and good dialogue in the game. I would rate this as one of the best Star Wars saga games and to good thing is that this feels so fresh because this takes place soooo long before the Movies that you don´t know the story in advance.

												So I've owned KOTOR 2 for many years now. I got it for Christmas the year it came out, same as the original. Since then, I've owned 2 more copies of the game, one on the original xBox, and then this version on Steam.First off, this game is amazing. Comparing it to the original, it keeps a lot of the good, and makes most of it better. Don't come into this game expecting an amazing story based on your character, however, because rather than that, it gives you an amazing (and in my opinion, better) story based on how your character's actions affect your companions and the galaxy as a whole.While this game's combat and mechanics are basically the same as the original KOTOR, several mechanics are much deeper than before. Upgrading is greatly expanded, giving many options for creating your ultimate weapons. Creating and Breaking Down items has been added, forcing you to decide on what to sell and what to break down into components, in order to create another weapon or item. And since this game focuses on companions, an influence mechanic has been implemented into your interactions with them. Now, what you say and do can change how your companions look at you and change their light and dark side orientation.Now, for the bad. This game is packed full of amazing content, but due to some issues, the game is left… unfinished. The final few areas are lacking. The developers were rushed for the end of the game, and it feels lacking. Luckily, there is a fix for this. The Restored Content Mod is available here on Steam, and helps to fill in the gaps and slightly clear up the problems the developers left behind.As for the quality of this version, it is superior to the other two I owned. The others were riddled with bugs, and frequently crashed. This version hasn't crashed once in the hundred hours or so that I've played it. On top of that, it is extremely easy to get mods for the game, some of which are very important (such as the Restored Content Mod), for creating a better experience for your game.			"

												This game brings back some serious nostalgia. It was one of the first RPG's I ever played and help solidify my passion for Star Wars. If you played the orginal and enjoyed it than this game is for you. If not...its made some marginal improvements but it isn't drastically different than the first. PROSMore complicated morality system. Makes you question wheter your actions are truly good or evil.Intriguing story filled with twists and turns.Likable companions.A large variety of force powers and feats to choose from.CONSSomewhat glitchy.Terrible AI.Severely limited unless The Siths Lord Restored Content Mod is installed.  Overall I would reccomend this game to anyone who like the orginal KOTOR and any Star Wars fan. I would suggest downloading The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod from the workshop for the optimal experience. If either of these apply I would wholeheartily reccomend this addition to your library.

To old of a game to pawn for drug money. kek. The game store told it would be $80 for a copy of this game. I then went home and bought it on steam on sale for $2. I'm very disappointed with the way game companys and the internet mlg players differ.]Kotor is a great game. Full of choices similar to New Vegas. You can say this inspired most games like Dragon Age.I bought Mass effect, dragon age, fallout new vegas, pretty much all of the major roleplay games for the next century after around 2005. I played Kotor 1 at maybe 11. Didn't really know what i was doing and put 50 hrs into the first planet.This game kind of has a really [Quick-not as good as kotor1] ending and left me puzzled as a teenager. So i'm going to give it another go.I remember as a child wanting to be a mandelorian. Glithced my gear in the underwater sea in kotor 1 and made them all warriors. I know i refered kotor 1 but these two games are my all time favorite, secondly red faction gurrila, new vegas, mass effect (whole series). If you want nostalgia for the rest of your life. Get this game. Nuff Said.			"

												TL;DR: Beautifully made game, deep story. Fixes below. You're all meatbags. All hail the Gizka's.Absolutely one of my most favorite games of all time (and I play many games). This game is a gem of both RPG's and the star wars universe because of the amazing depth in storytelling and the way it engages me and allows me to make my own choices, something I've found lacking in games recently. Originally I owned both KOTORs on xbox (and shamelessly logged  hundreds  of hours into each) and rebought them on steam for the third time (original disk broke) just to play it again.---What you need to know---Yes, the game is buggy. This was made for much earlier versions of windows and you're likely to suffer the odd glitch every now and then. HOWEVER there is, of course, a fix! A few of the catch-all fixes that I've used and have worked for the PC versions are as follows; The  swconfig  file which can be found in your game folder installation directory. Open this and check 1) Enable Hardware Mouse and 2) Disable Movies. You miss a little disabling movies and so you may want to go back and uncheck it and see whether it works for you. Last resort you can watch them through the main menu or through the magic of the internet. Editing the ""swkotor2"" configuration file, found in the same directory. Should fullscreen not work out for you as it didnt for me then paste the following line below [Graphics Options] --> AllowWindowedMode=1Then change the ""Fullscreen=1"" to ""Fullscreen=0"" and you'll be playing in windowed mode. Enabling compatability mode. Not difficult to do, which compatability you use depends on your system.The internet is your friend! By no means is this a comprehensive list, just the major ones that I've confirmed to work for myself or others.Truly this is a fantastic game and easily worth its price. Also look out for the Restored Content mod, which flushes out the story to its true potential and adds so much great stuff to the game! Now quit sitting around and buy the game already meatbags.

												TL; DR: KotOR II is excellent, but unfinished. A must play for Star Wars and/or RPG fans. Play through it once without the Restored Content Mod and play through it again with the mod installed.I have owned this game for a very long time. I originally played this game countless times on a disc, so my Steam hours do not accurately reflect the time I have spent with this game. I am one of those people that say that this game is better than the original (although the original is extremely good too).Let's get this out of the way first. Knights of the Old Republic II is an unfinished game. It was rushed to release to meet a Holiday release date. As a result of this, many sections of the game were cut out entirely, including an entire planet, along with vital story dialogue with characters and an ending that actually makes some sense. I am aware that there is a mod that restores a good chunk of the cut content called The Sith Lord Restored Content Mod (which is very good by the way), but I will bring that up into more detail later.Take the Star Wars formula that you know (Jedi = Good, Sith = Bad) and completely flip it on its head. It doesn't do a complete turn around, but you start thinking of the Jedi and the Sith more in shades of grey than in one being absolutely good and the other absolutely evil. You get more of a nuanced education in the Force from one of the best Star Wars characters ever, Kreia. Let's be honest here, Kreia is absolutely the best character in this game and is probably one of the best Star Wars characters ever, yes you heard that right.In KotOR II, you play as the Jedi Exile, a former Jedi Knight that was kicked out of the order due to his/her involvement in the Mandalorian Wars. You were one of the Jedi that followed Revan and Malak off to war, and you were also the only Jedi that returned to face judgment. Ten years have passed since then and you return to find a threat facing the galaxy that hides in the shadows. What follows is a galaxy spanning quest in the same ship as the first game collecting companions to aid you in this threat while rediscovering your connection to the Force. It is one of the most unique takes on the Star Wars license.But, as was said earlier, it was rushed to meet a deadline. A lot of vital content was cut from the final release, but the files were still in the game. A team of modders took it upon themselves to restore this content (what they could, anyway), and it is a crime that Obisidian was not given enough time to finish this game properly. However, I do recommend that new players do not play through the game first with the Restored Content Mod and save it for a second playthrough. Playing through it first unfinished and then switching to the mod gives you a much better idea of exactly how much stuff was cut, and how important the cut content really is. If you are a fan of Star Wars, or of RPGs in general, then there is no question, KotOR II is a must buy.			"

												ERMEGERD ITS MAH CHILDHOOD!I played this game waaay back in 2005 on the original Xbox and played it almost religiously. I knew every quest, every conversation, every inch of the Ebon Hawk. The irony is that I played this before the first game, so many of the easter eggs were lost on me.But now? I played it again and while the graphics certainly haven't aged well, the story is as good as ever. I played with the Restored Content Mod and wow! This game is more alive than ever. The heart of this game lies not with the combat, but with the conversations you have, learning about the Force and the philosophy of the Jedi and Sith. This game accomplishes with a few talks with Kreia more than what Episodes 1-3 could in their combined runtimes.If you play this game, it is a must to get the Restored Content Mod as it brings the game to its full potential. All the broken plot lines are fixed. The crew all have more flow to them. Most of the bugs are gone (I stress most).I played the game as a Jedi Master, and boy do you feel more like a Jedi than the ones you're looking for. I suspect the same could be said if you go dark side, which is what I plan to do after I finish my first playthrough. Yeah, I'm 50 hours in and still not done one playthrough. All of your crew have full storyarchs and backstories. You get to know all of them and have a hand in their future. Interestingly, I somehow managed to turn HK-47 into the pinnacle light side character despite his insistance on murdering the crew.That said, remember when I stressed that MOST of the bugs were fixed? Currently I am unable to continue as I've encountered a bug that breaks the controls. Hopefully its just a one-time thing but I lost an hour because of it. You've been warned.As for the combat, it's alright. It's not the worst thing ever, but it's nowhere near the best. Sure it looks pretty, and the combat moves are really varied, but it does feel clunky with the way it works.If you're a Star Wars fan, this game and its original are a must-own. Together they form the backbone of the lore for Star Wars. There is a reason they are held in such high regard.			"

												Greetings!I want to start out by stating that this game is so much different then its predecessor.This game is dark and brooding; Knights of the Old Republic was a much more friendly feeling game to me.I have played both games multime times through. My dad played these games when I was a toddler, and he introduced me to hem when I was around eight or nine. I played both games on my dad's old XBox, and I recently bought The Sith Lords on Steam. I have already logged over 40 hours on Steam and am still not satisfied.Now for my impressions-KOTOR 2 is a game that allows you to delve into the deepest mysteries of the Force. I will try not to leave any spoilers, but you have a mentor you can approach at any time and learn of the Force, and learn from her wisdom; her mistakes. I loved this element, someone to speak to on your journey, someone to learn from. Th eavailable party members in this game are extremely varied in personality and background. KOTOR 2 introduced an influence system. It was a great addition, although didnt really change your party members opinion of you. Great system, but a few flaws. The plot has a few holes, but that is a result of Obsidian cutting certain content to get the game complete on time.If you have not yet, I highly suggest getting The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification, which fills many of these holes. It added new levels, new dialogue, quest fixes, and deeper character developement. The games has a sense of moral ambiguity. You do one thing, and a party member who will react positively, and another who will react negatively. Also, the mentor(whom I referenced earlier), has a skewed sense of ethical standards. She discourages giving aid, but she dissaproves of common bullying. She is neither a Jedi nor a Sith, and she is likely the most interesting character in the game. I thouroughly enjoy this game after each playthrough; I always find something new I hadn't before.If you haven't yet, I highly suggest you play this game. I sincerely hope it lives on, along with the first one, through the fans. It is one of my favorite games, and believe me, I've played many games.Thank you""It is not the destination that matters, but it is the journey.""                              -Kreia			"

												""Perhaps you were expecting some surprise, for me to reveal a secret that had eluded you, something that would change your perspective of events, shatter you to your core. There is no great revelation, no great secret. There is only you.""As this quote suggests Knights of the Old Republic II's story does not share the same exemplary twists and turns of it's predecessor, but more than makes up for it in it's beautifully written characters and dialogue. The companions, in my opinion, far exceed those in the first game and while the player character's backstory is generally less interesting than that of Revan, the decisions you are allowed to make as the Exile allow for more varied replays. Unfortunately this game is held just short of being superior to it's predecessor because of it's downright exhausting introductory area and completely lackluster ending. It is well known that Obsidian was under a franctic development cycle and was forced to cut a sizeable chunk of the game to meet Lucasart's deadlines. The Restoration mod does a good job of fixing some of the issues caused by this but in no way restores everything that could have been. Despite all of these criticisms though, I can still say with absolute certainty that KOTOR II is not only of the greatest Star Wars games ever made, but one of the most charming and intersting RPGs of all time.Overall: 9/10			"

												Got to play it again through the Star Wars Humble Bundle and with the Restored Content Mod (Which I highly recommend installing). The story is very exciting, expecially its message to the players on the influence of the force itself through the enigmatic character known as Kreia, who in my opininion is one of the most spectacularily written characters in a game. Also, in comparison to the previous title, the story offers the player much more food for thought, and follows a much more complex route than the traditional hero defeats villain formula that the previous title followed. In terms of characters, nothing has changed. They are all very memorable, unique, and full of life.Gameplay wise, it is an upgrade to the first with much better personalization and customization with more feats, and force powers. The game also improves upon the first with the introduction to new Jedi specializations which you may learn alongside the original three classes of Jedi.  With the amount of love it has recieved from the modding community, and with the memorable characters and companions along with their humorous dialogue, this may be the best Star Wars game to this day.10/10 would love to have another bad feeling about this again.

												This Game was released in an unfinished status and you sadly recognise that from the first moment on. I highy recommend the ""Restored Content Mod"", which improves the game a lot. Also this game now has full steam support, which means it should not cause any trouble in terms of compatibility or resolution choice.Even though it's not as well thought out and polished as the first KOTOR (which is my favourite Game of all time btw), it still has a lot of its incredible ingredients with a few usefull gameplay additions. This makes it still a very good RPG with a very high replay value(im surely into double figures at the time im writing this). If you liked the first KOTOR or the Mass Effect Games, this is a good choice. If you haven't played those, then you should try them first.			"

												One of my favorite RPGs and probably the best story I've experienced in the Star Wars universe aside from maybe Empire Strikes Back. This story gives you a completely fresh set of characters (aside from HK-47 from the first game but his return is most welcome) and a fresh story that isn't simply copying wholesale from the movies. The game challenges the broad themes we see in other Star Wars stories while still absolutely feeling like its a part of that setting.I don't have a lot to say about the game play. Obsidian did the best they could with what they were given. I like the way you can unlock abilities for yourself and others in your crew through repeated interactions. If you've played any old school rpgs, the gameplay should be adequate, being based on d20 rules. You at least get some choice for how you level but you always have the option to autolevel if you don't want to fool around with it. You're really here for the story anyway.  And I have to tip my hat to the makers of The Restored Content Mod which, as other reviewers note, is absolutely essential. Google it, download it. I'm on my third playthrough coming back to this game after some months and the Restored Content Mod has been updated to version 1.8.3 in the interim. With this version of the mod, the experience is very minimal on bugs. The only crashes I've had could be attributed to other improperly installed content mods. Aside from this, I recommend googling to find the widescreen solution for this game. It takes a little work sadly to get this game to support modern monitor resolutions (if your monitor is 4 by 3 aspect ratio, you should be fine but if you're using a 16 by 9 or 16 by 10 and you don't want your characters to look bloated, google the widescreen fix and then the minimap fix for the widescreen fix.) So yeah, some up front work to be done but this game is 10 bucks and IMO, even with the extra work, its going to be the best ten bucks you'll spend on an rpg outside of Fallout New Vegas.			"

All was fine, until that crappy ending. Is very know that they game study didn't finish the way it was meant to be, and there is a mod out there that reveal the cut content that was going to be used. So i gave him a 7Gameplay 7/10Is good, like his predecessor, but any notable change in the way you play, also sometimes you want to cast a force but yet the game says ""no hell, first one attack and then the spell"", freaking annoying. Also, don't use the automatic level system, is very crap. I'm giving him only 7 because it reminds me so much to D&D (Yeah, yeah, all the role games came from D&D, but the game literaly puts on the descripcions things like your damage is a ""D6"" or that you use ""Will Saves"", etc"". Also the game is kinda short, i felt that Kotor 1 has more lenghtGraphics 8/10The graphics are good, for his time, but they could do better. The game models repeats too much, is like you go to the store and ""Hello Human Model 1"", then the  go to talk to a crucial npc to end the game and, hello again human model 1.Music 8/10I liked the music, but i felt it lacked some of the classics of the franchise, but still is good.Conclussion: I wouldn't recommended to buy it alone, you better wait for the discount on the Star Wars Pack, but if you want it for the achievements, go ahead, just be prepare for a crappy end, beside everything else, is good.

 Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords To start off my review of this game, let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Star Wars and have been since a very young age; for as long as I can even remember. In comparison to KOTOR I I played this game about 4 years ago for the first time, shortly after I had completed the first title in the KOTOR saga (which I highly recommend playing prior to this game) and I have to say that, as good as the first game was, this outmatched it in so many ways: The mechanics of the game, whilst similar, have a noticeable edge to them in comparison to the previous titleThe graphics, again whilst similar, are refined with more detail to characters and environment, adding a little more spice to the captivating nature of the plotThe plot is much deeper and diverse than the previous titleThere is more interaction with companions, adding a significant deal of choice to the outcome of your adventuresThe side quests have much more relevance to the story and are not simple errands, as it often felt with the previous titleThere are more abilities and skills which have a great effect on your capabilities throughout the world, and depending on your skill sets the game can be a very different experience on another playthrough. As for the game itself, I cannot recommend it highly enough. There is real value in playing the game more than once, as the plot and characters/companions met through each gender are different and both light and dark side users will have compelling choices to make in terms of core storyline as well as companion storylines.I myself have used a mod to skip the opening prologue (do not be fooled, the option to skip this in game at the very start is misleading, and I find the actual prologue VERY tedious and it takes at least 2-3 hours to get through on your first go).I would definitely say that this game is not for those who want to rush through a game for the action and adventure. This is geared for people who enjoy a rich, compelling story which has depth, malleability and maneuverability in terms of what you get out of it at the end. I got this in the Star Wars Humble Bundle, but if it goes on sale on steam for around £5/$7 I would definitely pick it up if you are a Star Wars fan and have played the prequel.			"

												This game features a nice return to the Old Republic era in the Star Wars timeline. The sequel to Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR), this game puts you back in the action as a rogue jedi trying to figure out where you belong in this universe.

												This game is amazing. While the ending is really sloppy, the rest of the game makes up for it. Excellent combat, story, and character development gets you attached to the characters. Its a good idea to play through at least twice to see as much as you can due to the difference in the game because of gender and alignment. Alignment in this game is very well done. Picking light side will make you feel like a saint. While a dark Jedi will probably doing some twisted  things you yourself will have difficulty doing.If you're gonna get this game, you'll definitely need the restored content mod for the full experience, the extra Droid Planet will be good too. Oh, and did I mention lightsabers? "

Do you like the Star Wars setting?Do you like being a Good or Evil character?Do you like a rich story?Do you like a nagging old lady telling you what is going on?Do you like killing NPCs in fun and entertaining ways?Do you like a droid following you arround and calling everything including you, a meatbag?If you answered yes to any of these questions, get this game.

												I played this game when it first came out on the XBox many years ago when it first came out, and like the first game, I loved it. When this appeared during the holiday sale, I decided I ought to have it on a current device and snatched it up. The game and story are still every bit as engrossing as I remember them, but I find the lack of controller support to be super-annoying. Furthermore, perhaps it is just my laptop, but graphical issues abound. I can't Alt-Tab without the program crashing (which means that any time I adjust the volume it crashes); it also crashes frequently during cutscenes. I am sure I could rectify some of these issues with some internet research and some editing of the .ini file, but I don't think I should HAVE to do that. I sort of expect the games to, y'know... work. The game itself is to be recommended, but I really have to grit my teeth and put up with the lackluster port.			"

												A rather sharp critque of the Star Wars prequels if you pay attention. And it's also got brilliant writing in general, intelligent gameplay, non-linearity, and it is so, so, much better than the original in every way possible. Be forewarned, you should download the Restored Content Mod and M4-78 to get the full experience, though.Oh, and it's best to pretend The Old Republic doesn't exist if you want to enjoy the story.

												One of my favorite RPGs and probably the best story I've experienced in the Star Wars universe aside from maybe Empire Strikes Back. This story gives you a completely fresh set of characters (aside from HK-47 from the first game but his return is most welcome) and a fresh story that isn't simply copying wholesale from the movies. The game challenges the broad themes we see in other Star Wars stories while still absolutely feeling like its a part of that setting.I don't have a lot to say about the game play. Obsidian did the best they could with what they were given. I like the way you can unlock abilities for yourself and others in your crew through repeated interactions. If you've played any old school rpgs, the gameplay should be adequate, being based on d20 rules. You at least get some choice for how you level but you always have the option to autolevel if you don't want to fool around with it. You're really here for the story anyway.  And I have to tip my hat to the makers of The Restored Content Mod which, as other reviewers note, is absolutely essential. Google it, download it. I'm on my third playthrough coming back to this game after some months and the Restored Content Mod has been updated to version 1.8.3 in the interim. With this version of the mod, the experience is very minimal on bugs. The only crashes I've had could be attributed to other improperly installed content mods. Aside from this, I recommend googling to find the widescreen solution for this game. It takes a little work sadly to get this game to support modern monitor resolutions (if your monitor is 4 by 3 aspect ratio, you should be fine but if you're using a 16 by 9 or 16 by 10 and you don't want your characters to look bloated, google the widescreen fix and then the minimap fix for the widescreen fix.) So yeah, some up front work to be done but this game is 10 bucks and IMO, even with the extra work, its going to be the best ten bucks you'll spend on an rpg outside of Fallout New Vegas.			"

												When this game was released it was horribly buggy. Now a couple of years later we have the restored content mod, which restores several of the cut features and patches most of the bugs.The gameplay of the game is more or less the same as the last, and graphicly there has been little change.The writing however is stellar. Featuring a more grey side of the story instead of the classic evil vs good as we've seen before in Star Wars. I recommend this game to anyone looking for an amazing story.UPDATE : This game has now been patched (after 10 years) and is now better than ever!Seriously a must buy at this point.			"

												First and foremost is the clarification: this is a very long yet well-made game that is absolutely a successor to the first Knights of the Old Republic. I have only done one playthrough and it took me more than 65 hours to complete. It has all of the features of the original game and has added many new ones that seamlessly integrate with this second entry in the series. The story is rich and in-depth and the characters are memorable for the most part but feel a little flatter in this game than they did in the first. It also cleverly uses mechanics so that you can compete missions and fights in a variety of fashions and lots of your choices have very visible effects, but not all of them. Overall, this is a good game.HOWEVER, I played the first KOTOR on my smartphone and I must say I prefer that one easily over this one, though for mostly personal reasons. The story of the first one felt tighter and more polished whereas with this game it feels like they tried to stretch it out for no good reason. I felt plagued by unnecessarily long fights as a result of too many enemies and zones that are large but I couldn't see the reason why they had to be so large. I also am a completionist so I try to do every sidequest possible and so quickly became annoyed with the constant trecking and back-tracking all over every map. There is also the fact that the characters are there but feel flatter and less developed than they did in the first game; they also don't feel like they are crucial part of stroy like they did in the first game. Finally is the fact that this story just doesn't feel as good as the one from the first KOTOR. I felt like it left too many loose ends, the plot twists fell flat, and it just plain left me feeling unsatisfied as compared to the first entry there just isn't a sense of closure.Now, a lot of this has to do with personal taste and so someone else might completely disagree. As for bugginess I didn't encounter any bugs, glitches, etc. during my playthrough.In conclusion: I would recommend the game, but I'm worried you'll feel less satisfied if you've already played the first KOTOR.

												NOTE: This review is a redux of my original review.Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords is made by Obisidian Entertainment and serves as a sequel to Bioware's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. I've played through this game twice. My first playthrough was on the Jedi path and without the Restored Content and M4-78 mods. Honestly, I didn't like it and I wrote a negative review on it. However, after some time had passed, I tried the game again, but I went down the path of a Dark Jedi and had the previously stated mods installed. This review is based on my second playthrough:Pros:+Slightly better graphics than KOTOR I+Story is decent and more clear thanks to the RCM and M4-78 but does have some minor issues.+Details of the environments surpasses KOTOR I+Like the idea of influence and converting your party to be a Jedi or Dark Jedi+Well designed characters, but I felt their backstories weren't as fleshed out as in KOTOR I (however there are some exceptions to this criticism)+Maintained alot of elements that made KOTOR I great (choice / morale system, path of Jedi or Sith, etc)+Mods like the Restored Content Modification and M4-78 fix most of the problems found in the ""Vanilla version"" of the game. (Hats off to the people who developed the mods)Cons: -The turn-based combat (like in my KOTOR I review, this is something I don't like in RPGs in general)-The ending (those of you who've played the game know what I'm talking about)-The influence and Jedi conversion can be VERY tedious as some characters aren't as easy to convert / influence-I was a bit disappointed that the story didn't really relate much to KOTOR I as I thought it would be. The story is connected to KOTOR I by characters from the previous game but kinda are like side characters and refernces to events and other characters from the previous game.Overall, (8/10) Star Wars KOTOR II: The Sith Lords is a solid game but (in my opinion) not as good as the original. However, its still worth a try if your a die hard Star Wars fan or an RPG fan. NOTE: If you want the best version of this game get: 1. The Restored Content Mod, 2. M4-78, 3. Visas HD Re-Skin from the Steam Workshop.			"

This is a very adult take on the Star Wars universe, with a story that is deep, mature and disturbing.

Download that and you will be set to start on your tale of heriosm or villiany in a broken galaxy far, far away.. This game is a fantastic addition to the KOTOR family and sadly the last. It improves upon much of the mechanics of the first KOTOR, adds a great cast of new and some old companions, nice locations to visit, and a great continuation of the storyline we loved.Sadly, you can feel how frenzied they were to get this out the door. In it's unmodded state it is lacking both in a finished story and 2-3 extra planets/missions. It was cast aside when it was released but, years later it has made a triumphant return and finally got the love and attetion it deserved from a great community of players and modders.In summary 7.5/10 in release-state and 9/10 with the restored content mod. So go ahead an pick this up for yourself and make sure to download TSL:RCM.			"

												I've only logged a few hours on this game, but I've had quite the adventure on this so far. I've played as an Astromech Droid and repaired the Ebon Hawk, a ship that I had many good memories in the game before this one. I escaped a mining facility in space with the help of a rather odd Protocol Droid with Atton, who I picture as the new Carth Onassi. I met a creepy old woman with pure white, or rolled back eyes. I barely escaped that facility with a cracked and fractured man with a white eye chasing me. I made it to Telos and helped Ithorians fight of the Czerka Corporation (Never liked those guys in the first one either.) and the hired Mercenaries. Now, i'm off to find the Ebon Hawk and get off that godforsaken planet. 10/10 so far on the game.			"

												(PROTIP: If you plan to buy KOTOR 2 for PC, you should, beyond a reasonable doubt, download and install the Restored Content mod. Since Obsidian rushed KOTOR 2's release for the holiday season, they had to cut out parts of this game, most of which were pretty integral to the plot.)Synopsis: You, the player, are The Exile (canonically a woman named Meetra Surik). Like many of your fellow Jedi, you followed Revan to help the Republic during the Mandalorian Wars. Revan, who was impressed with your combat prowess, decided to appoint you as one of his top generals.The final battle of the Mandalorian Wars took place near the Sith planet of Malachor V. Since the rest of the Republic's fleet could make it to the battle in time, you decide to utilize the Republic's ultimate weapon: The Mass Shadow Generator, designed by the Zabrak technician Bao-Dur. The Mass Shadow Generator activates, pulling the planet, the Mandalorian armada and the Republic fleet into a gravity field. The death of the planet and all parties involved was so great that it gave you a Wound in The Force, severing and deafening your connection to The Force.However, unlike the rest of your Jedi colleagues, you were the only one who did not fall to the Dark Side. When the war was over, you decided to return to the Jedi Council on Coruscant to face judgement. The Council, both butt furious over your insubordination and incredulous at your voluntary return unanimously chose to banhammer you from The Order. You were then exiled to wander the outer reaches of the Galaxy. Oh, and they took your lightsaber as well.-Fast forward five years later. The war with Darth Malak and the Sith was so costly the Republic can barely defend itself. Strange, phantom-like Sith assassins have dogged the Jedi, hunting them down in an effort to completely destroy the Jedi Order. The crime syndicate known as ""The Exchange"" has put out a bounty for any live Jedi. Strange, durasteel droids have integrated themselves into the Republic government. Meanwhile, the Republic attempts to rebuild Telos IV, a planet bombarded to near destruction by the Sith Admiral Saul Karath. An unknown figure contacts Republic Admiral Carth Onasi, requesting that you be brought from the Outer Rim to act as a diplomat to Telos. Who made the request, and why, are a mystery to you, but other external forces have plans for you...			"

												A good game, and great fun to mess around in.  The story is a huge improvement over the already impressive Knights of the Old Republic, and almost everything else feels like a decent upgrade.    If you're looking for a game like KOTOR, but have played KOTOR till it's become a bit boring, this is what you want.A brief note: I did use the fan mod, I don't know how much of an effect that had but it was highly reccomended.  The game has aged quite a bit graphically.  It's also probably *not* worth a second playthrough: my playtime notwithstanding (I suspect a lot of it is while the game was running but I was doing something else), most of your enjoyment of the story will be in its twists and turns.  Choosing radically different dialogue options will affect your character build and force powers, but it probably won't make playing the same thing again much more interesting.			"

Out of hundreds of starwars games, KOTOR 2 sits at the very top amung a select few (maybe 4) good star wars games.  dont be put down with the pay wall steaming pile of crap that is the MMO ""STAR WARS: THE OLD REPUBLIC"" with bioware at the helm and obsidian making major tweeks to the original, you get pure gold. Bioware shines again as the do what only bioware can do and write some impressive story telling and dialoge.  You dont know the starwars universe if u have not played this.

												KOTOR 2 is one of the several tales of what could have been when it comes to video games getting rushed out by the publisher; but what we do have with the Restoration Mod is still good. KOTOR 2 is probably the most interesting Star Wars story; it takes everything about the series lore on the Force, the Jedi, and the Sith and breaks them down, satirizing the stark black and white morality that the series had fallen into because of those concepts. This idea is personified in one character and that character is probably one of the best characters in video games. KOTOR 2 also actually manages to have in-universe explanations for some of the gameplay elements and it’s really well done.KOTOR 2 is not without flaws however. I found the combat to be a horrendous slog so I actively cheated my way to get to the really good parts, the roleplaying and story. While one specific character is really interesting and likable, the rest of your party is mostly more flat and aren't as good as the party members in say Planescape or Nier. Regardless I'd say it’s still worth playing and at the very least you should check out a Let's Play because KOTOR 2 really is cool.			"

												Not sure where to start with this i'm just gonna compare it to the first KOTOR i wouldn't say this one is better i liked the first as it had some very memorable characters and what not it was also easy to know where i was ment to go and i didn't even have to use a guide or anything. This one though was alright however i got lost most of time and lost interest after a while when i get it though i came back to it about 3 months later There are however two things that really bothered me about this game the first being sometimes you get no audio if you were to tab out so you have to reload your save to get audio this made me miss some dialogue the second which i guess is a spoiler so don't read it if you're going to play the first KOTOR or this one though for this one you are told at the start so not sure if it really is a major spoiler DON'T READ IF YOU HAVE YET TO PLAY THE FIRST KOTOR  I hate how this one you just start as a jedi right off the bat which i dislike the first one had it right where you can become a jedi later on and you are trained to become a jedi it's better when you train to become a powerful jedi and use the force and lightsabers instead of this one where you are already a jedi and don't need any training to become one the only thing that they didn't do was give you a lightsaber at the start you just had to build it which was more annoying then satisfying	 In conclusion if you loved the first KOTOR then i'd recommend getting this game though don't expect it to live up to the first one and if you haven't played the first one then i'd suggest getting the first one before playing this one7/10 it was alright			"

												This is a fantastic game. Obsidian did a great job building on Bioware's franchise. Though the story isn't as good as the original (despite borrowing heavily from it), the gameplay overall feels a little tighter and better. Customization of weapons and armor, the addition of 'influence',  and the ability to craft all make this game feel a bit more personal to individual players and that is much appreciated. Both of the KOTOR games are solid 10s in my opinion and are some of my favorite games I've ever played.			"

												This is one of the most immersive titles from the franchise. The story is brilliant and twists and turns constantly, leaving you with a dawning understanding of something world shaking taking place as you play through the game. Obviously good or evil decisions are mixed in with more subtle or subjective choices meaning that this can be role played properly if you wish and with so many choices throughout the story line it makes it replayable enjoyable for a long time to come. The interface is a little aged but once you get used to it you will be immersed in the story and universe before you know it.			"

												Star Wars: KOTOR II TSL is a classic game. The story is good, and picks up some time after the events of the first game. When I first bought this game it had 7 CD's to install so having the digital version is convenient and more reliable too. I initially made the mistake of playing this game first so if you are purchasing this game I recommend that you go and play Star Wars: KOTOR 1 first. Fans of the SWTOR MMO should also play KOTOR 1 first because it deals with Revan and the story is more relevant to the MMO. This game puts you in the shoes of the Jedi Exile and your plot-convenient amnesia as you piece together who you are while regaining the force and making critical decisions. These decisions impact your party which is an improvement over the first game's mechanics but the story isn't as groundbreaking as the first KOTOR game. I always blamed Obsidian for rushing this game, but in reality they were the ones who were prodded along to finish the game and produced a great Star Wars classic that managed to fill the shoes of the original game. It's worth the money and time to play this game if you're a Star Wars fan, and an RPG fan. The combat is fun and the story is good. Replay value is high.			"

												Definitely better than its predecessor. Here's 3 reasons why:1. You can craft upgrades for your weapons and armor. All your skill can be used for crafting except persuade. A simple blaster can be deadly with the right upgrades and used with appropriate feats.2. Your Ebon Hawk crew/allies interact with each other and now you will actually care more for your allies because talking to them will reveal more than just sidequest like in SWKOTOR1.3. You can use the force early in the game (if you play as a consular) which is cool.			"

												TL;DRA Noir setting in the Star Wars universe. Need I say more?Honestly I enjoyed this game much more than the original.With the Restored Content Mod (which is super easy to download in case anyone has trepidation over downloading something from another site to make your game better) I can honestly say this is my favorite game of all time. In my opinion the reason why this game is so amazing is because all of the party members are so interesting and so well fleshed out that the only thing I can tell you without spoiling anything is if I had to make a top ten favorite video game characters of all time list, I know at least two characters from this game would be on it. One reason why I like this game so much more than the first one is because, again, without spoiling anything, the main character of the original KOTOR doesn't feel like an actual ""character"" until around 80% into the game, until then you're kind of just a blank slate. In this game however, you're a broken jedi with borderline PTSD. How cool does that sound? In this game your party members evolve and change personalities depending on how much influence you have with them. Its an amazing system that can change the core ideals of party members with whom you've curryed favor, and without spoiling anything, (getting kind of hard not to spoil this fantastic game haha), can lead some of these characters to become ""something greater"".On top of this, It also has a fantastically ominous and foreboding atmosphere not unlike Dark Souls of all games. This is a top notch game that checks all the right boxes to create a cinematic experience like no other. It opened my eyes and got me to think in a very different way that has pretty much effected the way I play all my games with morality systems to date: some times neither good nor evil are the way to go, its best to remain gray.

												Very deep and cerebral RPG. Explores the moral ramifcations of having the force in a way that no other Star Wars medium has. Worth playing for the story alone.Gameplay is enjoyable if you can really figure it out, it's based on D+D and the combat is turn based, but it still feels pretty visceral. Being able to properly level your character and knowing where to properly spend points to get the character build you want is very important and very rewarding.The recent update is great, it runs at modern resolutions excellently and the controller support is actually quite pleasant to use. It could be better though, there's no dedicated inventory, stealth or weapon switch buttons despite how important those features are and combat can be a bit finnicky, as the left and right d-pad buttons control both the usable items menu and the combat menu. It would probably benefit from a seperate, controller focused UI, but the controller support is otherwise rather good - there's nothing you can't do with the controller. Due to the nature of the game, there is no benefit to using keyboard and mouse over a controller, or vice versa. It's all personal preference, and since I've played through this game about 10 times using keyboard and mouse, I found it quite nice to be able to relax and play with controller.Performance is a bit dodgy, I'd recommend turning off Frame Buffer Effects to maintain a solid 60fps. This removes some of the effects though, like the stealth effect, so bear that in mind. I found that I got about 25-30fps with the buffer effects on and 200fps+ with them off, so it's quite a difference. This is with an I5-3570k and two GTX 780s as well, so it's a bit ridiculous that I have to turn off any effects.The game is a bit buggy, but far less buggy than it was prior to the recent update. The bugs I had before the update included suddenly being unable to move, which required quicksaving and then re-loading, and dialogue randomly skipping. The random dialogue skipping pretty much ruined the ending of the game for me, as it just skipped all the important dialogue and I didn't realise what was happening. This was prior to the update though, so I'm keen to know if that bug has been fixed. I'll update the review if I experience that bug again.So yeah, if you enjoy Star Wars, enjoy RPG games and enjoy being immersed in lore and thinking about things, this game is worth picking up. Try and play the original game first though, this game is a direct sequel to the original KoTOR.			"

												+ impressive story which isn't so black or white as the first KOTOR, backed up by extensive dialogues+ high level cap which can't be achieved by normal playing (opposed to maximum level 20 in the first KOTOR)+ many quests, skills, force powers etc. and many alternative ways which a player can take+ gameplay which takes between 30-50 hours to finish+ Kreia, hands down to one of the best written game characters- even with TSLRCM there are some minor bugs- some NPCs you're travelling with are rather uninteresting, but I guess that's depends on one's tastePlay original KOTOR first if you're thinking of buying this game and haven't played the prequel yet.If you liked the prequel then go for KOTOR 2 with no hesitation. With the TSL Restored Content Mod the game is almost as good as the first KOTOR and makes much more sense than it did at the time of the rushed release.Read this if you're interested in some 'behind the scenes' of KOTOR sequels.http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-07-31-fear-is-the-path-to-the-dark-side "

												Reguires a lot of tampering with the game files to get it working and even then it crashes every 15 minutes. And it is fun to play in 800x600 window (messes up your desktop, by the way, each time you launch the game), with the mouse escaping every time you move it and the top of the screen not showing. Well done, game developers, well done. (""Well, it's an Obsidian game"" isn't excuse enough)However, is it worth it? Hell yes. It is an enjoyable game (when it works). Until you get the ending, that is. You shove the evil space witch down the pit (Return of the Jedi, much?) and then... nothing. No ceremonies, no parties, no closure, nothing but the credit roll. Even Mass Effect 3 had better ending.Darth Nihilus (the coverboy, isn't even the main antagonist) is pretty pointless. Sure he looks badass as hell, but in the game he isn't established nearly enough until you already destroyed him alongside his flagship. Also he gives no dialogue to even introduce himself.Speaking of which, most of the character intros were a bit short as well. As in: ""The duck are you? Where did you come from? Well, you might as well stay, here's a bloody lightsaber."" Though I have to say I enjoyed some characters more than their Kotor counterparts, and vice versa. (Zaalbaar over Hanharr, and Atton over Carth any day)Also, was it intentional to forbid the Darth Maul -looking guy from wearing any kind of robes? Those work overalls aren't wizard at all.The game is also plagued by the problems that were in the first game also, for example the Dragon Age control scheme is back. You can't aim your blaster rifle yourself. And the messing with game files I mentioned earlier. Only here it is much more complicated.On the plus side, you could become a mercenary and sell your services to the highest bidder and it would show in the story, but there were less smuggling Gizkas and I think there wasn't any bounty hunting.Though despite all that it still was a fun ride, but I still like the first one better; the story and the characters are more fleshed out and makes you care more about them. And you can't import your save from the first game. I was a bit shocked to see Bastila again when I killed her in my playthrough.			"

												Bioware passes the torch to Obsidian Entertainment where Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords is born (TSL). During the initial release, Obsidian faced criticism over the game's abrupt ending which was later blamed on LucasArts's unwavering timeline for a holiday release. Fortunately for fans--from fans!--there is an essential modification to download to restore most of the cut content named, The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM). The game itself features a much darker atmosphere and expands on everything that made the original game great so this sequel is a must for fans.			"

												I'm writing a review for this game because I wrote one for the first in the series. This game is the sequel to the amazing KOTOR I. The graphical improvement makes the game even better and the storyline is still amazing as it was in the first one. These games are a work of genius and deserve all the praise they can get, the sequel to this one is Star wars the Old Republic which is the online game which is nothing, in my opinion too these two games. The descision making, the companion system and the combat system all work so well together as you delve into the Starwars universe. Every quest was exhillerating and this is probably the best RPG game I have ever played along side its other KOTOR I which was also just amazing. Buy this game, love this game.			"

												Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2 takes place 5 years after the events of the first. We now play as “The Exile”, a jedi cast out of the order for going to war without the councils permission. As luck would have it he/she is one of the last jedi after the Sith's successful purge and has a huge bounty on his/her head. The situation really shows in game as a good amount of people will try to kill you or deceive you for that huge bounty. It does become a tad tiresome when the same assassin droids show up time and time again spouting the same dialogue each time.  As for the game itself it plays it very safe and only improves upon a few things while keeping everything from the original intact. It is not made by the same developers as the original. Companions are far improved in this game and now feature a influence system in which they either disprove of you or like you  depending on the actions you take.  This time around there is a much better balance between Light Side and Dark Side companions unlike the original where near everyone had a holier than thou attitude. You never trust any of them either which I found very neat as I half expected the people that have my back to turn on me any moment. Some will flat out refuse to talk to you ever again if you annoy them enough. I still would like the option to kick teammates out of my ship. Which brings me to the ship, it is the same exact ship from the first game. They reuse a lot of material from the first game including planets that are ruin down but the same exact places as the original and much smaller.They really took a huge step back when it comes to environments. Where as the first game had huge unique environments this one has small gray corridor after small gray corridor. Your choices in the last game doesn't really make a lick of difference and they even get the gender of the 1st game's protagonist wrong and they will default to being female. Not a big deal at all but slightly annoying.  This sequel is far more prone to glitches and crashes. I actually had to cheat to get past a game breaking bug.  It has this incomplete feel as if they either rushed the game out or just didn't care.  It does have a few improvements like your teammate AI is much better at following you around, a small improvement to inventory menus though they are still awful and regenerating health which is neither a good or bad feature.Gameplay is pretty much the same as the original but with a few different force powers. I don't think they reused any music and it sounds just as amazing as the first.  You now seem to level up much faster and when I was done with the tutorial I was already half the level of the lasts game's character which I had at level 20 by the end of the game. Same abilities, same skills  and same stats as the first, they didn't really do anything to enhance character building. Story is pretty cool and feels much more mysterious than the first. There is no clear good and evil side in this game which is a huge improvement from the first. You never receive a lightsaber either, you have to build it if you want one. Overall I enjoyed the story more than the originals even though I saw the ending coming from a mile away unlike the first.I mentioned the first a lot in this review but it cant be helped. This sequel is pretty much a carbon copy of the first with a new story and a few highly uninteresting new worlds. It felt like an unnecessary sequel since the last game ended so well and this  game does nothing to enhance the  last game's overall story or makes any improvements to gameplay. Though if you enjoyed the last game and wanted more then it is nearly guaranteed you will love this.  It is definitely more of the same but if that is what you want than this would be a great purchase.			"

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was a good roleplaying game developed by Bioware. KOTOR 2, the sequel, was developed by Obsidian. The core differences here is that Obsidian still legitimately cares about making a good stat based RPG and not a shooter with romance options. I think I'm projecting modern Bioware shortcomings here but KOTOR 2 took everything that was wrong with the original and tried very hard to fix it. The game is by no means perfect, and you WILL need to download one of the Restoration Project mods to fix bugs and add content that was cut but as a role-playing game KOTOR 2 is still absolutely great. Your choices matter, the whole game is seeing how the consequences of your choices play out. This whole game is about choice. The characters are excellent, the writing is everything you would expect of an Obsidian title. The game almost starts out as a satire of Bioware cliches but quickly becomes its own animal, allowing you to explore a deeper aspect of the morality of the Star Wars universe that a lot of games never do.While this game certainly is not perfect, I find it better than the original in nearly every way. That said, I do recommend playing the original before you ever get started on this, the original game is still a good title and deserves the respect its earned. There are better RPG's out there, but you won't find a lot of them on Steam yet. For what it is this game is great and I love playing it. 8/10 would play again.			"

												This game genuinely suprised me. I was deeply in love with the first game, but I never  could get into this game because of all it's bugs and glitches.. until now. I HIGHLY recommend playing the game with The Sith Lords: Restored Content Mod, because it adds so, SO much more content to the game that should of made it to the final cut. The characters, oh my god, the characters.. Intriguiging backgrounds, wonderful dialog. The places.. To see places previously seen, previously unknown, remastered and in some cases, made, is just.. wonderful. The main story is amazing, IMO, even though others seem to disagree. The choices truly make you feel like you are doing a good thing or a bad thing, and the music adds to that. The music also makes the game much better, with atmosphere and such. The beauty in KOTOR games is that you can play through them twice, Good and Bad. Even then, you still miss a heap of content without realizing. I haven't even mentioned the characters that you have seen in the past play a fairly huge chunk of the story, which is amazing.I used to be of the opinion that this game was horrible compared the the first one, but that is because I encountered countless game breaking bugs, because I was playing without the previously mentioned mod. Now, I am of the opinion that this game is almost as good as the original. The only things that make the original better are: 1. It's Revan's Storyline, for peats sake! 2. More polished 3. It's the original! All in all, this was a wonderful sequel, amazing Star Wars game, and you should have it in your library, like, RIGHT now. Get this game or Nilhius will anhiliate Earth. :)			"

												Any Star Wars fan worth their salt must play this game.  The Knights of the Old Republic series of games are the penultimate of Star Wars gaming nirvana.  Sure, there are other good Star Wars games to be played, but none of them will allow you the pure visceral experience of ""being"" a character in the Star Wars universe quite like this.  Flying between planets, fixing droids, shooting blasters, learning to use the force, earning your very own lightsaber, and mingling with the locals in cantinas.  Of course, it's an RPG.  Not everyone likes RPGs.  Those people are morons and we should feel sorry for them.The Sith Lords picks up five years after the end of the last game.  The Mandalore wars are over, the Jedi are all but extinct, the Republic is on verge of collapse, and the Sith wait in the outer rim of the galaxy like a lion in the grass.  You play the role of an exile.  You were once a Jedi, but you have been cut off from the force and cast out of the Jedi order for disobeying them and following Revan and Malak to war.I could say that The Sith Lords is a better game than it's predecessor, which is true, but it wouldn't be completely fair to the first game which laid the essential groundwork.  What makes it better?  First, and foremost:  the story.  The story is top-notch.  I had come across some spoilers, I thought I had it figured out, and the game still pulled the rug out from under me with it's plot.  Then there is the moral ambiguity.  The first game let your choices in conversations with people affect your drifting to the Light side of the force or the Dark side of the force, and the conversation options for each were fairly obvious.  The Sith Lords is more complex in it's dialogues in that regard, and it adds Influence to the fold.  How you interact with your party members affects how they respond to you.  So, disagreeing with a party member might lose you influence with them.  Losing influence means they aren't going to divulge everything they know.  So, appeasing certain party members may create a moral dilemna and how you deal with it may affect both influence and whether you go Light side or Dark side.  Other factors affect it too.  Who doesn't remember the cave on Dagoba in The Empire Strikes Back?  Yoda warns Luke about the cave, but he dismisses him and ♥♥♥♥ happens that leaves everyone scratching their head asking: ""what the hell just happend?"".  Well, you get your very own cave of Force phantoms and the choices you make there also affect your Light and Dark side standing with the Force.  Better still, they make sense this time.Of course, the game builds on the sequel with more items, more powers, more aliens, more...  stuff.  It also pays great homage to the original.  You don't have to play the first game to thoroughly enjoy this one though.  The game goes to great lengths to explain what happened in the previous game.  Not only that, it allows you a chance (through dialogue) to decide what happened in the history of the previous game.  This affects how The Sith Lords unfolds it's story.  A bunch of the characters from the previous game make appearances, some only cameos, and it gives you a sense of what happened to the peripheral characters of the first game.  The game isn't all about you though, you narcissist.  The game will often switch to another party member for you control in their solo outings.  It's a nice change of pace to step into another character who has different specializations and motivations and such.  I thought it was brilliant and reminded me of the movies whenever characters split up and went on their own missions.I could go on...  but bottom line is this is a gem of a game.  And it only gets better with this very special mod that restores cut content to the game:  http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcmThis mod fixes bugs, tightens up dialog and finishes/restores content that was cut in order for the game to meet it's publication deadline.  There is another mod that adds a droid planet that was planned for the game, but don't bother.  It's reputedly bad.  Anyway, Padawan, you need to purchase this game and fulfill your destiny!  ...or something. "

												Both KotOR games are buggy.  There's no doubt.  This one is the buggier one, God have mercy.BUT there are mods to help that and restore unfinished content that are quite easy to install.  Just make sure you only have one, maybe two, major bug fix mods.  In my experience they will start to conflict with each other.Now, bugs aside, this is some of the best Star Wars storytelling I've ever witnessed.  Better than KotOR 1 me thinks.  What I like most is that it focuses on the mysticism of the Force and character interaction.  While there is still the simple Light/Dark side meter from the first game, it almost seems to be more of a ploy than anything.  An action may net you Light Side points, but now your influence on your companions is a factor.  If you want to bring a teammate to the Light, you have to have influence.  But your goody two shoes actions might put them off, driving further towards whatever side you are not.  On top of that, the narrative will keep suggesting that the whole notion of Light/Dark is shallow and inaccurate to how the events of the game play out.  It doesn't try to throw out the notion of good and bad, but it tries to make you think twice about what is actually a good action and what is a bad action.			"

												At the relatively young age of 25 I find this game makes me feel like a wrinkled old senile. I can't tell you how many times I played this game on that old black box with the giant X on it. I fell in love with the first game and was a little dissapointed with the initial release of the sequel. Something felt unfinished and I could never explain it until I read it was basically rushed out a year after the first one to get it out in time for Christmas. Pieces of the game were cut and unfinished just to cash in on Santa Clause. Even with its faults it was an extremely enjoyable game when it was released. I tried every build I could think of, saved before conversations to see every possible story ark, and completed the game as light, dark, and neutral. During the playing of both games in the series I must have filled up the old xbox hard drive several times a runthrough. It was just that good and the possiblities of the storylines seemed endless. Fast forward to today and some beutiful people from the internet have created a patch that finishes the missing content of the game, and a second patch that adds in a planet that from what I understand had some minor pieces of data lodged somewhere in the game but is mostly filled in with the patch team's own storyline. I have to say I can't tell so far what is from the patch I installed and what is the original game, but it feels damn good to play through this story again. And I'm looking forward to seeing the finished content.This game was a strong piece of the last years of my childhood and I can't tell you how much it means to me. While it is true the sequel to Bioware's KOTOR is made by Obsidian it feels very much like a Bioware game of its period.The game uses a modified version of the original Bioware engine and it is well documented that the two companies had done work together during this period. Maybe it's something to do with EA buying out Bioware, but it feels like Bioware is not the same company it used to be. Replaying KOTOR 1&2 and playing Jade Empire for the first time I can see some huge differences between what Bioware once was and the Bioware of today with its ME trilogy, DA series, and SWTOR. While the new Bioware games are very good in their own right I feel like the company has lost a little bit of something wonderful in its current lineup. Other than the Mass Effect trilogy I don't feel like I have the interest to finish games such as DA or SWTOR (Not that one can really ever finish an MMO); not to say that I don't like the newer work from the company I would just prefer they focus on a true sequel to KOTOR over milking the Dragon Age series for everything they can get.If you have any interest in Bioware's current lineup do yourself a favor and give the Knights of the Old Republic series a chance. The series is definitely showing its age but it's still just as well made as anything from the magic Canadian elves who work at Bioware.			"

												Any Star Wars fan worth their salt must play this game.  The Knights of the Old Republic series of games are the penultimate of Star Wars gaming nirvana.  Sure, there are other good Star Wars games to be played, but none of them will allow you the pure visceral experience of ""being"" a character in the Star Wars universe quite like this.  Flying between planets, fixing droids, shooting blasters, learning to use the force, earning your very own lightsaber, and mingling with the locals in cantinas.  Of course, it's an RPG.  Not everyone likes RPGs.  Those people are morons and we should feel sorry for them.The Sith Lords picks up five years after the end of the last game.  The Mandalore wars are over, the Jedi are all but extinct, the Republic is on verge of collapse, and the Sith wait in the outer rim of the galaxy like a lion in the grass.  You play the role of an exile.  You were once a Jedi, but you have been cut off from the force and cast out of the Jedi order for disobeying them and following Revan and Malak to war.I could say that The Sith Lords is a better game than it's predecessor, which is true, but it wouldn't be completely fair to the first game which laid the essential groundwork.  What makes it better?  First, and foremost:  the story.  The story is top-notch.  I had come across some spoilers, I thought I had it figured out, and the game still pulled the rug out from under me with it's plot.  Then there is the moral ambiguity.  The first game let your choices in conversations with people affect your drifting to the Light side of the force or the Dark side of the force, and the conversation options for each were fairly obvious.  The Sith Lords is more complex in it's dialogues in that regard, and it adds Influence to the fold.  How you interact with your party members affects how they respond to you.  So, disagreeing with a party member might lose you influence with them.  Losing influence means they aren't going to divulge everything they know.  So, appeasing certain party members may create a moral dilemna and how you deal with it may affect both influence and whether you go Light side or Dark side.  Other factors affect it too.  Who doesn't remember the cave on Dagoba in The Empire Strikes Back?  Yoda warns Luke about the cave, but he dismisses him and ♥♥♥♥ happens that leaves everyone scratching their head asking: ""what the hell just happend?"".  Well, you get your very own cave of Force phantoms and the choices you make there also affect your Light and Dark side standing with the Force.  Better still, they make sense this time.Of course, the game builds on the sequel with more items, more powers, more aliens, more...  stuff.  It also pays great homage to the original.  You don't have to play the first game to thoroughly enjoy this one though.  The game goes to great lengths to explain what happened in the previous game.  Not only that, it allows you a chance (through dialogue) to decide what happened in the history of the previous game.  This affects how The Sith Lords unfolds it's story.  A bunch of the characters from the previous game make appearances, some only cameos, and it gives you a sense of what happened to the peripheral characters of the first game.  The game isn't all about you though, you narcissist.  The game will often switch to another party member for you control in their solo outings.  It's a nice change of pace to step into another character who has different specializations and motivations and such.  I thought it was brilliant and reminded me of the movies whenever characters split up and went on their own missions.I could go on...  but bottom line is this is a gem of a game.  And it only gets better with this very special mod that restores cut content to the game:  http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcmThis mod fixes bugs, tightens up dialog and finishes/restores content that was cut in order for the game to meet it's publication deadline.  There is another mod that adds a droid planet that was planned for the game, but don't bother.  It's reputedly bad.  Anyway, Padawan, you need to purchase this game and fulfill your destiny!  ...or something. "

												Both KotOR games are buggy.  There's no doubt.  This one is the buggier one, God have mercy.BUT there are mods to help that and restore unfinished content that are quite easy to install.  Just make sure you only have one, maybe two, major bug fix mods.  In my experience they will start to conflict with each other.Now, bugs aside, this is some of the best Star Wars storytelling I've ever witnessed.  Better than KotOR 1 me thinks.  What I like most is that it focuses on the mysticism of the Force and character interaction.  While there is still the simple Light/Dark side meter from the first game, it almost seems to be more of a ploy than anything.

As a legend this game promises the dream of a titanic stuggle, an endless journey in the Galaxy.The surprise comes however when we discover how deep some concepts are taken. The Force is more present then ever. I have to say that I played with the Restored Content Mod through my playthrough and it can be downloaded here: http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcmDespite the fixes the game crashed a couple of times, there were occasional glitches and bugs. Was it worth it?

Knights of the Old Republic is often reffered to as simply KOTOR.This is an often overlooked game because even after fixes it's still rather unstable and unpredictable. The possibility to see the world after KOTOR 1 though pays off in it's own way!Everything remained almost the same since the last game. The Bioware style of doing things persists and shows a deep understanding of RPG game mechanics. It is a solid experience in combat and common storytelling alike. It's not by Bioware anymore...	 The unique traits of an Obsidian title though show after getting more companions and interacting with them. Similar to Mass Effect, Dragon Age.You posses influence over them, she politely refuses to share life stories until there is more trust between you (gained usually by expressing views similar to theirs). As you go along though, these stories are revealead simply through spending time together and showing what a charismatic individual you are. The story told is worth of an entire essay on it's own. By getting to the bottom of it - the proportions of it seem to always lead toward a gigantic revelation, one step ahead of a mystery, great conspiracy - respectively a fitting end.Without spoiling anything I will say that I never expected Star Wars to go so deeply into the philosophy of the Force. Good and evil are simple. There are characters in this game however that twist it into a novel thing altogether.

My feelings on the game are mixed. It definately feels rushed towards the end. The restored levels don't seem to be worth it from the mods. But despite that the journey is as they say, reward enough for that. Should you get it?	  Play it for the great and cryptic introduction. Assuming that with imagination you can get past the long prologue.  Enjoy it's detailed worlds, tours across a couple of planets, guides into ways to shape the Republic.  Reminisce on KOTOR 1 across 2 planets and with a couple of characters. From the beggining of KOTOR 2 there is a tone of urgency of some unseen threat. I had the impression the game ended at a cliffhanger that, hopefully was not the original intention.Despite that, the characters introduced were strong enough for this to be a game worth your money. It is an RPG shifting much closer towards the character and story driven decision-making seen often today.  Play KOTOR 1 and 2 for the full experience!	 "

												Download The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM) and the M4-78EP Mod.  This adds a bunch of cut content back, including an entire planet worth of quests.  With the patches, the game is much more complete than the chopped up version Lucasarts released back in Dec 04.  They pushed an xmas release and robbed us of this great game at it's potential.  Obsidian wanted to push a patch, but Lucasarts nixed that idea.Despite any flaws from it's release, this is still an Obsidian game meets Star Wars.  The insane layered, subtle, nuanced writing of that team shines.  High Light Side alignment, quintessential Jedi, but still my choices make me..uncomfortable.  Is there even good and bad, or is it all based on perspective?  The influence meter was revolutionary back in 2004, and still used in Bioware games today.  Lots of uncomfortable dialogue choices that leave you wondering whether you truly made the correct decision or not.  I can't say enough about these guy's games...(Obsidian, and formerly Black Isle..)			"

												One of my favorite rpgs of the last 10 years and for me this is a top 5 ever as far as writing goes. KOTOR1 was fantastic, but KOTOR2 was even better in my opinion. I liked the story, characters, dialogue and gameplay much more. Wish we could get a KOTOR3 one day, done by Obsidian! Also when you add the KOTOR2 RESTORATION mod to the mix this is even better! Adds alot to the game and the newest version just came out in July.If you want a fun old school rpg give this one a shot! This is also in my opinion the best star wars story yet. It is not so black and white with good vs evil, it is alot more of a grey area. More Obsidian magic, what more can I say?			"

												Great game in general and in sequel to one of my favorite games.  And while it shares many similarities it does a lot to set itself apart from its predecessor.  Although this game was initially rushed to release and suffers on account of it, most of these quirks were covered up by a restoration mod that I used.  Things like fixing low resolution cut scenes, glitches, and adding back in a whole level among many others this mod is an absolute MUST.  One quirk that couldn’t be fixed by this though was the ending being a bit lackluster.  While it can only be assumed whether the ending was effected by this I can definitely tell the ending felt had less interesting decisions compared to the rest of the game.  If you have played the first Knights of the Old Republic, the game play is generally the same but really stands out with great dialog and deep characters as opposed to the original.  I feel like there was a bit more exploration present in the first Knight of the Old Republic as far as the world and environments, but even with a rushed release I feel that most of the components of 2 are on par with 1.  Where KOTOR 2 really shines though, is the sheer amount of amazing dialogue and dialogue choices with the many deep characters in this game.  It’s honestly mind blowing how connected you feel to the characters and how deep they are for a video game; one of the few games I’ve played personally that did so.  There are many dialogue choices and consequences that may block communication with others so you have to choose wisely and it’s not just a game about choosing every dialogue choice to get the most exposition.Like the KOTOR 1 this game also features a sort of karma system so that your actions in game affect your whether you are light side or dark side.  Decisions like this aren’t strictly for role-play however and will affect how well you can use either light or dark side force powers.  As opposed to the first game however, KOTOR 2 provides you with really interesting decisions to really bring out your character.  This game focuses on the grey areas of morality, like the negative effects of blindly doing good and the positive effects of the dark side as well.The deep dialogue, story decisions and consequences make this an amazing game for those looking for a deep role-playing experience and I would recommend this to anyone more into the role-playing aspect of RPG games.  Absolute beauty of a game.Restoration mod mentioned earlier in the review: http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcm "

												I've never played Knights of the Old Republic (and it's 2015) so my review will be based on my experience alone. Personally, I don't think it's aged too well, graphically it looks like a PS2 game, the voice acting isn't great, and the default controls for a gamepad are missing some of the vital commands. (Support for gamepads are from a new update, but don't do the game full service)However, the game seems to be rich in dialogue, characters, Star Wars lore, and filled with RPG elements and plenty of loot to make each step feel rewarding. It does a great job to make you feel like you are in a large Star Wars Universe filled with uncertanties and adventure. (controlling droids is actually pretty cool)The combat system is... kind of dated. It's basically a real time action turn-based system where you select what attack you want to do, and your character will basically move for you and do the attack.  I kind of feel like this is where I was let down.  If there is ever a sequel, I'm hoping that it'll be more like an FPS or Third-Person with more user control. Overall, I feel like it's a good, but a bit dated. If you are a fan of RPGs, want some Star Wars lore, and are okay playing with some PS2 era graphics / gameplay, than I'd definitely reccomend this for $5 or so.			"

If for some godly reason you decide that you want the vanilla experience, well, it's still a good game, but missing vast chunks that by the end of the game make you feel like you somehow missed some of the story.With the restored content mod this game becomes a solid 10/10Without it it's an 8/10Visas best waifu.

												Do not buy this game unless you understand that if you run windows 10, you'll be pressing f4 and f5 a lot because for some reason windows 10 is incapable of understanding the games mesh's unless the music for combat stops/changes.  That being said.  This is easily one of my all time favorite games.  Anything obsidian touches is sheer brilliance, and any gameplay faults lie with the greedy ♥♥♥ developers who forced them to release an unfinished game, and still refuse to let them fully release it.  That being said, there is a restoration mod in the workshop.  Do download it if you purchase this.			"

												Possibly the greatest RPG of all-time and along with its prequel without a doubt the greatest Star Wars video game series. I have invested hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this game the past decade and I still play it to this day and enjoy it immensely. The only MUST for the best experience is to download this mod in the steam workshop: “The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification” (TSLRCM).

												Everybody constantly talks about how Star Wars: KotOR 1 & 2 are amazing RPG and amazing Star Wars games. So I decided to take a shot and try them, honestly expecting to be disapointed and finding a game that only fanboys would love. Boy I was wrong.Even if it's an old game, the amount of flexibility you have on how you want you character to be (not only the look/gender of you character, but also its alignments, skills, relations with other characters) makes it a really enjoyable RPG. Some choice lead to a real change in the story, which means good replayability. The story is really cool. I'm someone who grew up watching Star Wars, but I'm not necessarly an hardcore Star Wars fan, but oh god, how the story is nice. If you loved the background and big story from episode 4-5-6, you're gonna enjoy this game. There's a lot of characters, a lot of things to do. Even a little card game. The game has plenty of mods that improve the overall game, both in term of graphics and content. A must have for this price, and a real steal in sale.Side note: even if you're not a Star War fan, but want a good old school RPG: Get it. Even without caring about Star Wars, this game is freaking amazing.			"

												KOTOR II has been one of my favorite RPGs since the day I first played it. Many people seem to consider this game a disappointment after KOTOR I, but I played KOTOR I first and still prefer KOTOR II by orders of magnitude. In KOTOR II, you're playing as the Exile, a (you guessed it) exiled Jedi whose connection to the force was severed when he or she chose to walk away. As you progress, you slowly regain your character's former strength, and the main plot has you hunting down your former Jedi masters to either save or destroy them, depending on how you want to handle the situation.KOTOR II has excellent writing, first and foremost. Its moral choices are great, much better than those found in KOTOR I (which is a game I love dearly).  It has a better cast of villains that KOTOR I, which is something that can make or break a good story. The cast of party members is great, and your influence over them will affect their appearance, their demeanor, and even their skills. Many of the people who join your crew can be trained into Jedi (or Sith) if your influence over them is high enough, which is a great feature.A big difference between KOTOR I and KOTOR II is that in KOTOR II, you begin the game as a Jedi. It takes quite some time to be able to get your first lightsaber (although you can fast track the process by making the right choices), but starting out as a Jedi lets you build your character that way from the beginning, instead of KOTOR I's awkward pre-Jedi class system. Furthermore, when you reach a high enough level, you can choose a specialization for your character which grants new and unique abilities depending on your choice.It's true that this game has a lot of cut content, but we live in the age of The Sith Lords Restored Content mod, which takes an already great game and makes it into an undeniably better game that its predecessor. I cannot recommend that mod enough. Way back when, Obsidian was forced to rush KOTOR II out the door. As a result, a lot of planned content was cut. However, they shipped all that content with the game, hidden away and unusable, in the hopes that modders would take it and restore it. They did. Now that KOTOR II has Steam Workshop integration, installing the Restored Content mod is a breeze for anybody, and I would go so far as to say it's essential if you want the KOTOR II experience as it was meant to be.KOTOR II is honestly one of the only games I'd go so far to call a masterpiece. If you've ever avoided this game because you heard it's not as good as KOTOR I, I would urge you to give it a try and see how great it is for yourself. INSTALL THE RESTORED CONTENT MOD THOUGH.			"

												I've played through this game fully over the course of my life probably 6 or 7 times, and everytime I come away with something new. I had it on my original Xbox as a kid and never realized how deep the story or the game is if you dive into it fully. It changes you, and changes with you. Sometimes, you just want to be a powerful badass who blows away every enemy in the universe. Other times, you want to spend the whole game just helping people down to the smallest tasks. That's the beauty of this game. If you have not played the original KOTOR, I would recommend them both highly. My only wish is that they should have allowed more of a ""grey"" side approach of neutrality, as things in the world are over all pretty dualistic. It's a beautiful game and I would highly recommend.			"

With the SIth Lords Restored Content Mod, this game goes from a flawed but wonderful game into one of the greatest games of all time.  Everything in KOTOR is expanded and improved.  Play it through both light and dark, and male and female.  So much choice, so much fun!  Don't forget to get the following mods: TSLRCM and M4-78EP.

												This game was my favorite of the two KOTOR games, however when I played on both PC and XBox, there were things missing (More so on the PC version.). However, know with the gift of Steam Workshop, the game is now perfect due to the TSLRCM Mod that restores content that the developers had to cut! This is a huge win for the KOTOR community and I am glad to be having fun with this game! I will finally be doing a series on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_gVjTDjZ4v4YU9EnwgtVw "

This game is very fun but with it's witty dialogue, thought provoking morals and points, and one of the best stories I've ever seen. (Tied along with KOTOR 1 of course.) This game is AMAZING a true masterpiece, Obsidian is known to me for occasionally dropping down games I play, and when they drop them down MAN do they drop them down. Fallout: New Vegas and this game are both in my top ten favorite games of ALL TIME! (I am not mentioning Bioware because they didn't work on this game as much as Obsidian but rest assured KOTOR 1 is in my top ten too.)			"
