								Ok, i bought this game not too long ago, despite the reviews because i saw it had some promise. I thought the system in it to make your own block and design your own armor and weapons via voxel editing was pretty neat. This has been a growing trend in video games as of late. I also thought it was pretty neat that you could build your character like you could. Again, pretty neat. Thought i saw something on the unity asset store just like it.Now that the nice stuff is out of the way...The game is broken. It crashes, constantly. EVERYONE is having those problems. Have some fan boys here, but lord are they really niave to think that this is how normal development is supposed to work. I'm an indie developer. I have an upcoming title that i have been working on, and already have the networking code framework complete and ready to be fleshed out with instantiating objects and players and world events and all that sweetness. Needless to say i have been at this for quite some time. I have 3d modelling experience, animation and loads of forum management, community management, and server management experience. A decade worth. And I know when people are jerking me around for the most part.Now. I burned myself a tad. But thats ok. I mean, i bought a chucklefish game for the gods sake...I bought this game without first looking at their forums. And when i played the game, it crashed. It was a laggy piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I could be lucky if i could find anything that didn't look like a cruddy generic weapon. (Pretty sure i was meant to make my own. so not really a big deal.) And like many others couldn't run the game without a CTD within 5 minutes which is tell tale of a memory leak.So what do i do? Look on steam forums. See they are pretty quiet. ""Hey lets check out the website and see what is happening there!"" Website looked pretty damn good. It represented its game well, and misrepresented it at the same time.Its misrepresentation is pretty much the same as the misrepresentation on the steam store. There is no multiplayer. It was disabled last build because of some issues and stuff like that or something. Not a big deal because they are saying they are going to bring it back next update... Now when i say they, i mean y2bcrazy, because this alleged other developer ""AlwaysGeeky"" is either never on steam posting, or they are really the same person and its and anonymous shield for y2bcrazy to deflect hate with. Which is a pretty sound tactic if you have feelings... Feelings are obsolete and have no place in the gaming industry. There is a difference between caring about your community and letting your feelings run your business. But lets not talk philosophy.Now here is the cold harsh impression of the game and the developers that everyone has been waiting for..I checked their forums.. They were filled to the brim with over 2k plus PORN BOTS. They deteriorated so ♥♥♥♥ing bad that if i had checked those forums before buying the game, i would have never bought it and the rest of you poor guys would not be reading this review, and would probably most likely be making a huge mistake. I mentioned it on the steam forums for them, and got an answer, which was surprising after seeing the state of the forums... His response to the forums porn issue? Shut them off. He took them down, Those forums no longer exist. Took the easy way out.BUT WAIT! Theres more! I even offered on the steam forums to help them. Added y2bcrazy and AlwaysGeeky as a friend, And told y2bcrazy when he accepted about all the♥♥♥♥♥♥i can do and would have even sent them screenshots of a lot of my work when they replied.I got flat out ignored. I would have helped them clean up their forum and get it properly secured which would have taken me about 20 minutes tops.The end result. These ""Developers"" are ♥♥♥♥ing lazy. I know how hard it is to develop a game. I have been doing it by my damn self with nobodies help for a while now. I know its not easy unless you count grass simulator or shower with your dad simulator...But there is really no freaking excuse for not checking your forums and your site and letting them deteriate that damn far... None. Get some volunteer mods. Childs play. Risking your forums being defaced by a rogue mod who might not even have access to an admin CP is nothing compared to having your professional image sullied by porn bots.Thier excuse is they are re-working the game engine. I'm sorry, but i don't believe them at this point. That, and they are ""developing a game they want to play..."" See now, that strikes close to my heart, because i am developing a game i want to play aswell. BUT it irritates me to NO ♥♥♥♥ING END, when people use that as an excuse to treat people who are asking questions, (even if they are being rude.) like dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ It is unprofessional. It is disgusting, they use that saying like it is a catch all to describe how much they care about their project but then contradict themselves when they treat their customers (again even the rude customers.)♥♥♥♥♥♥poorly. It is like saying ""I really care about my game but i don't care if people don't buy it because i'm a public ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥."" ProTip: If you can't be understanding of frustrated customers, either hire a community manager who can, or go back to working your day job at McDonalds and stay the hell out of the game industry. Seriously, if you can't simply hire someone or select a volunteer to be the voice of your passionate hot headed devs, you don't belong here. But you probably won't listen to me anyway. Have fun filing for bankruptcy with your mom at the age of 25... That will probably be embarrasing.Pros: Customization is only as limited as your imagination, EPIC.Cons: Lazy♥♥♥♥♥♥Devs.Waste of money,♥♥♥♥♥♥multiplayer is disabled because,♥♥♥♥♥♥Quests are♥♥♥♥♥♥Monsters are♥♥♥♥♥♥Resource gathering, Seriously♥♥♥♥♥♥Memoryleak,♥♥♥♥♥♥Not mod friendly,♥♥♥♥♥♥Third to first person camera control, horrible♥♥♥♥♥♥Character doesn't actually aim where your camera is facing, basic♥♥♥♥♥♥Devs treat customers on the steam forums who only want to know what the hell is going on like, YOU GUESSED IT.♥♥♥♥♥♥Fanboys who will roll over and accept any excuse like they know what development is all about, Again,♥♥♥♥♥♥Maybe if you sacrifice your first born son, you might get something worth while out of this game. MAYBE.I understand the game isn't finished. But when hell freezes over and my great grand children are down there licking yellow snow cones and starbound hits 1.0 and is everything chucklefish ever promised us with actual results instead of excuses and a useless ♥♥♥♥♥♥ blog...*Breathe in...* (Well maybe not the starbound part, that is really unfair... I guess.)Basically. I will change this review if the game turns out to actually be worth changing it for.♥♥♥♥♥♥i'm not even mad about this game. So here you have it. My review. Enjoy spending your money elsewhere.""Oh but dragir, you only have two hours ingame!""So what? One of the devs only has 20 hours. I'm pretty sure i am not missing out on anything. And i doubt anyone can really run it that long. Rebooting the game every five damn minutes from CTD is a waste of my time. Until its fixed i will be spending my time on things that matter. I also don't need to play the damn game to form an opinion when there are numerous youtube videos and lets plays all over the place that i can form an opinion from. Pick another arguement from your hat of straw men.			"

								Devs say it's still being updated but have little to no evidence to support it. So I will review what the product is at its current state.Pros:    * Finding various things in chests is fun.    * The effects when shooting magic are pretty.    * Haven't found a bottom to the map yet.    * Character and weapon customization are quite in depth.Cons:    * Almost always there is about 10 minutes of gameplay until the game crashes.    * Once you find all of the items in the chests there is practically nothing to do. (there are chests everywhere)    * No Multiplayer! (The game advertizes Co-op & Multiplayer while at the current state there is Neither)    * Glitch into the map often and just kind of sit there thinking about things - kind of like when I'm in the shower.    * No actual updates in about a year or so... (There are a few pictures showing ""updates"" but not much more)    * No triple monitor support. (Personal preference but I like playing games at 6000 x 1080)    * Very empty world. (like there are a couple environmental things like trees, cacti, skeletons, one house. Otherr than              that this game is in very early stages of development.)    * Building mechanics are something to looks away from. (god awful)Who I would recommend this game to:If you are extremely rich, have nothing better to do, AND your life depended on getting rid of money. I would suggest you buy this game then hide it from your game list because you payed around $10 (currently the price) to buy ""warm crap wrapped in plastic..."" -LenkdracheOtherwise leave now and never return!

								Recently built a computer to test it and see if this game was really as bad as people make it out to be.Game is still terrible. Don't waste your hard-earned money. Even the ""developer"" removed himself from the store page. The developer himself seems to be one of those people who aspires to be a developer, poses as one on his Twitter page, but this game isn't even a quarter-way finished. He also claims that Vox is both a game and a game engine as a way to excuse this failed attempt.I'd even go so far as to say he probably made this game to cash in on the voxel-based game craze around the time Minecraft became popular. He probably made this thinking people would flock to this as well and fill in the gaps, in a similar fashion as Garry's Mod.OLD REVIEW:I've had this game in my library for more than two years. Mostly unplayable, no updates. I'd pay Steam to remove this game from my library if I could.			"

								Update 12 january 2016:Installed to check.v0.54  Still crashes; performance still terrible. Checked forums: game has turned into Castle Story in that we get assurances the game is being worked on but no evidence and this has been going on for years. Please, please do not buy this game.Update: 22 december 2014: Just installed again to check. Walk in one direction for a few minutes and bam, down it goes with a crash again. This game has been massively unstable for the whole over a year period it has been available on steam. Don't buy it.30 April 2014 - release of v0.50.I'm changing my review. Previously I was saying I believed in the developer and that he would get the game in a good state eventually but it's buggy and crash-prone now so only buy it if you want to support the dev, not to play it because you can't.Well scratch that. The new version today locked up my computer when I first entered the world so I had to use the reset button on the PC, causing me to lose some unsaved work.There have been too many versions; too much time has passed. I no longer think the developer is capable of creating a game that doesn't crash. I'm not wasting any more of my time on this rubbish or defending it to people, telling them it will eventually be ok. I don't think it will.Do not buy this game. It crashes all the time. I do not think it will ever be fixed despite fairly frequent updates.Steer clear of anything this developer makes.			"

The concept is good and it's fun for a few minutes (until it crashes or burns up your video card), but at the current rate of development I can't reccommend buying it yet, unless you personally know the developer and you know something I don't, then by all means throw your money away.

								As others have said, this game appears to be abandoned, and there isn't really a lot to it to begin with, just a small area and a few hills around it with some monsters and trees and chests everywhere. It's really a pity, because the graphics are really interesting and it has some interesting bits that most voxel-based games do not have, like trees completely falling down once you cut through the base, and the ability to customize your character in really interesting ways. Sadly it's not worth pursuing, and really didn't have enough content to be worth this price to begin with. I wouldnl't suggest purchasing unless it has several very large updates.			"

								When I first saw this game it looked really cool. I really thought it was gonna be a great game, which it could've been. It had SO much potential! But the developers just gave up on it I guess, it's been early access with no updates for years. No one plays it, and it's 10$ too, jeez.

								When I first saw this game it looked really cool. I really thought it was gonna be a great game, which it could've been. It had SO much potential!

Luckily I got it on sale, I feel bad for all the people who paid for it at full price. At least if it worked well I would've given it a decent review, but nah. It doesn't even work well.

								What a hot mess this turned out to be.Like many indie games, the main selling point isn't what's in the game now, it's what'll be there later. You have Minecraft to thank for that mentality.First off, this game is abandonware. There will be no more content added to the game.I'm not going to honor this game by going in-depth, but here's a summary:In Vox, you build characters. You do very shallow, simple things with them like feeding them and making them walk around and that's pretty much it. There's combat but it's no fun.Other fun things:-Runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ even on high-end computers (R9 390 + i5-6600K = 12fps)-Until most recent update (2 years ago) didn't even run on most computers-Crashes frequentlyOverall, take this off your wishlist if it's on there from a couple years ago.

An interesting idea, however the game is largely unplayable, which is why I've not played it that much. The game has been abandoned by the developer and has not been updated for a year. Due to the lack of optimisation the game runs rather slugglishly; meaning it's not even interesting to play as a failed experiment.Leave well alone. This is a game to be avoided.			"

								Please, do NOT buy this game! The devs say they're still working on it (although they haven't released a single patch in like a year), and the game's website doesn't even exist anymore. It's extremely buggy, eats your RAM like bananas, there's very little content, there's a lot of graphical lag and it crashes very often. I'm talking about an average of one crash every 3-5 minutes or so, especially if you're creating an avatar. Even if the devs are truthful and they're still working on the game and not just putting up excuses to squeeze more money off an abandonded product (like Cube World), I would suggest you stay away from it until it gets finished... if that ever happens, which I personally doubt.  I honestly wish I had not spent more than 2 hours ""playing"" (more like getting frustrated with crashes) so I could have asked for a refund.			"

								This game had a great potential, but the developer has the same problem than the developer of Cube World : communication and honesty.You cannot launch a game in Early Access, expect people to give money and don't give information about the development, state of the game etc....The developer has the time to congratulate other people on Twitter for their works, retweet things etc... but not the time (or don't understand the interest) to make a propre news/thread on Steam to show to customers where is Vox going (or if it's dead).- Last update came out last year during summer with no changelog and not a news since.- Nothing done on Github since 7 months (except space added in a readme file)- Not a single topic explaining the situation in Steam DiscussionFor all these reasons I cannot recommend people to buy this. The goal of an Early Access is to play and contribute to a game development. There is no development (or at least no sign of it) and no communication from and with the developer possible. So you better play and buy games from developer that respect the fundamental of Early Access.			"

Early Access Review
								I realize that this is an ""Early Access Game"", so bugs are to be expected.  That said, In the last few days my attempts at play have been met with crashes on loading, crashes at the main menu, and a horribly unresponsive game.  A gaming system that can handle many AAA titles seems to have trouble keeping up with Vox, leading to an less than enjoyable experience.  Even in an ""alpha"" state, I would have assumed that the game would be playable.  As I obviously don't have access to the source, I can't say if the problem is due to naïve data structures,  brute-force coding techniques, the choice of paradigms/libraries, or just the trying to avoid premature optimization, but something is causing it to feel very laggy, both in response to input as well as in animation.Now, bugs and what I will refer to as poor optimization aside, on to the gameplay itself.  I managed to create a character, customize the appearance somewhat, and get into the default world (biome?  It's a world.)  Right away I could see quest givers in front of me.  When I went to gather up a quest or three, I discovered that you can only accept one a time.  Alright, no multitasking it is- time to explore and complete a quest!Except exploring the world is at best tedious.  It is easy for your character to get stuck on block edges, which happens often enough that I end up jumping everywhere.  The only things in the starting area outside of ""town"" seem to be hills and the occasional tree, There weren't any arches or caves that I could fine, although there is a screenshot of one so I assume they are somewhere.Okay, okay, alpha state- I get it.Combat felt...awkward.  It was difficult to have a sense of perspective concerning the monsters I needed to kill due to how ""close"" the character is to the camera, and the right-click ""targetting"" system felt awkward when combined with a left-click-and-hold attack, especially if you come from the 3rd-person gaming background where right click activates mouse look or run.  I kill my required number of bees (more annoying than I would have hoped, it was difficult to get them to ""aggro"" on you without some form of ranged attack to reach them first, approaching them was not enough), and realize that I have no idea which direction town is.  The limited landmarks mean that the simply colored terrain tends to look the same in all directions, and the quasi-random assortment of snow, concrete, grass, and what I assume is desert lead me down a few wrong paths for a bit.  Again, my own fault, but a mini-map of some form, or at the very least a larger draw distance might have helped smooth this out.Turn in the quest, and decide to go check on the Steam sale. When I next opened the game, there was no recollection of me having completed the previous quest, so the same NPC has the exclamation point.  No, I don't want to kill bees again.  Somewhere in this process I leveled up, but I have no idea what that actually did.I don't doubt that Vox could be an enjoyable, fun game, in a similar style to Minecraft or Terraria, but I do feel that the early access release was perhaps too early.  Reading through the notes from the developer, I am concerned that the focus on more content may be somewhat misplaced, especially in a one or two person shop.  I know throwing more people at a late project (or in this case, a project very much in need of more work) only makes it later (slower), so I won't say that more developers are necessary- but I don't see Vox leaving this current alpha/Early Access state for quite some time.  It does appear that the developer is active in the forums, responding to users comments and critiques, which is a good thing, but the desire to add new functionality seems to be overpowering the real need to improve the base game that is in place.Overall, I wasn't expecting perfection, or even anything close, but the feel of the game in its current state is one that I can't recommend.  There is some potential here for fun, and the customization options are definitely a good start, but it feels like it will be a long time before this game is ready for the public. "

								This game recently had received an update that had fixed alot of things, it also had a preformance update. from the start you can see this game had alot of work. its like a MMORPG, without the other charaters, and with more things included. you can even make your own charaters from scratch and edit how the items look, you can mine, and you even need a bow and some arrows equiped instead of just getting out the bow and magically flooping the arrows into existance. the monsters are genius and original and the soundtrack kicks♥♥♥♥♥ I cant wait for the next update. Even the developer cares about what the player says. You should definetly reccomend this to everyone you know. I love this game and i cant wait to play it.			"

								This is a very promising game that is pushing the boundaries of what power we give the players over the content.  This by turning pixels into a cube unit. The 3 dimensional manipulation of items is quite amazing. I do not recommend this game for those of you that want a set storyline or seamless gameplay, being an early access game there are still quite a few bugs that need to be worked out.But I will recommend this game for those of you that love experimenting with new and interesting engines. Because this is a really fun and interesting engine.			"

								Running on a4-3420 and 8gb ram on win7 64bit. Its laggy quite a bit on default settings when trying to do things, menus dont switch tabs and the targeting system when trying to do things is nonexistant, whichever way your character is facing that is where its targeted, even if you are mousing behind your character. Theres hardly anything to craft, ore has to be smelted one at a time, I dont know how to destroy/collect chests, doors, tables etc but then it is early access.For the price it is not worth it but it has potential to be a very good game once more features have been added and game has been optimized more. If you got this in a bundle then great. Ive voted yes to recommend because its worth getting, you'll just have to wait a while for the worthwhile to play it.edit: update has caused my world and character to disappear and loading a new world made my machine freeze/had to hard restart. Wont be playing again anytime soon			"

								This game has great potential and looks like it will become something really fun.However, it is in alpha and does have bugs and game breaking issues.In the short amount of time I have been able to play, here is a couple.Just playing the game causes the used memory to keep rising and rising. After just 10 minutes of play it will be using well over 1.3Gb of ram. Must have a memory leak somewhere, i'm sure it'll get fixed in future patches.Also, I got an item called ""Icarus Boots"" (I think) and they let you fly. If you keep flying, you go higher than I believe you should and you can't see the ground or anything anymore.All in all, very promising but remember, it still is in early alpha.			"

								A recommendation from me:A really interesting game if you like Voxel building/questing/fighthing and exploring.There is a lot of customization to be found if you like such things- every item can be created/modified/etc.The game is still being actively developped and is not bug free however the Developer is very responsive and (even since the Desura times) does his best to fix the issues while adding new content to the game.I am confident that the final version will be bug free and the game already offers countless hours of fun with building/exploring/killing voxel creations.

I know it's still alpha, but with SO many problems, they shouldn't even put it out yet. Wait. Just wait until it comes out.

								NOTICE: This game is a work in progress. In buying it you are investing in further development, which you will benefit from as the game is updated as certain development milestones are reached. Being an Early Access title expect random crashes and bugs. Ignore all neagative reviews complaining about the bugs, apparently some people don't understand what Early Access means.Vox as its title suggests, is a voxel-based sandbox game in the same category as Infiniminer and Minecraft. The game uses a more rastarized art style as apposed to the more blocky style of Minecraft. The game engine uses modern shader effects and lighting in ways Minecraft doesn't without a GLSL Mod. Where Vox differentiates itself from Minecraft is its focus on adventure and role-playing. Instead of starting the game as one character which you cutomize with skins, you create a new character the way you would in most other RPGs and give that character a name. You then create the world you want to enter and you're given some control over the biomes and overall size of the worlds you create. Each new game starts you out in a town populated by named NPCs. Chests with loot litter the nearby countryside, whcih gives you some nice starting gear. Some of the chests are monsters, so be aware of this when looting them. Combat uses a Zelda-style lockon which helps in aiming your attacks, especially when using the bow and arrow. Sound effects at the moment during combat are minimal, though this may change throughout the development cycle of the game.Vox has a fairly detailed crafting system which has some similarities to Minecraft, but goes a few steps further and also allows you to make improvements to certain times like tools and weapons. Like Minecraft you smelt ores you've harvested into bars which you then use to craft items. You can also harvest plants and harvest wood. You can also edit any item in your inventory at virtually any time.Sound wise, Vox is baren with just a single repeating upbeat tune that drones on during the day, and a more melodic and slow tune that plays at night. Day and night cycles go by rather quickly, hopefully this will be fixed, and nighttime doesn't seem to change the game much. Its not like Minecraft where nightime becomes hazardous for the player if you haven't built shelter. This may also change in the future. I'm hoping for more variety in the music rather than the SNES-esque tune that plays now. Over time it can become annoying and you'll find yourself turning the music volume down most times.Overall, Vox holds immense promise so I recoomend that anyone who likes Minecraft please spend some pocket to get this game and help contribute its further development. Additionally, I much give the developer kudos for making the engine for this game open-source. We need to see more of this.			"

								I have been playing the games on Win7 64bit and have had very few issues. It has crashed a few times but not enought to make me stop playing the game. The crashes abort your current quest but your inventory and the world inventory stays intact. So if you stored stuff in chests its still there after the crash.The customization of the character is the fun part. This allows you to create an avatar of your choice. Although as you get armour, helmets, boots and gloves they will cover your customizations. I added a thumb to my hand that stuck out but when you added a glove that disappeared.Crafting is detailed and you can make a lot of equipment, weapons, armour, potions and even furniture.This is definitly worth the money and have already gotten value for money.Well done, keep up the excellent work.

								Imagine if all the editors for Minecraft were included inside the game..  Vox has more creative potential than any other voxel builder right now due to the seemingly endless customization.  Got a phat-stat, ugly♥♥♥♥♥sword?  Reforge it anew piece by piece in the editor and make it look as badass as you can concieve.  Vox is more magical with touches of fantasy whimsy around every  corner.  The environment is also brighter, more saturated, and a bit more kid-friendly; however, the controls are a bit more difficult.  The crafting is much more practical and makes way more sense than MC.  Vox has creativity in spades over the other voxel sandboxes.  World editing rules.			"

Otherwise, most computers within the system requirements can probably run it, if anything at a lower resolution and without the other nice stuff.			"

Unnecessary Minecraft Clone! [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]I did not spend a lot of time into this game, I don't really like the genre and this game wasn't able to change my mind. I guess the idea works quite well, just as it did with Minecraft: you control your character in a world made by little blocks and you can remove and add any block as you would do with LEGOs. These blocks can be combined to create more advanced items and finding these combinations is part of the fun. It is an open world and you can go whenever you want, finding in your journey treasures, enemies or just rare blocks.Now the bad points:- I have a good PC but the game has a bad framerate, that means it is not optimized at all (graphics is just average)- Soundtrack is annoying as hell (a 30 seconds clip repeating itself over and over)- Being part of the Minecraft community is half the fun and of course here you won't enjoy that (also it hasn't the same level of customization)- Game is still in development so you'll have to wait for who knows how long before playing it fullySumming up it has the same problems all clones have: they have to be better than the original to success and this is certainly not the case.Best played with Keyboard and MouseRecommended Buy Price < 3$Score 4/10 "

								I do recommend this game because of the overall opportunity this game presents. It's a wonderful idea.I would, however, agree that the execution leaves very much to be desired. The game is clumsy and not optimized. It can take quite some time to even figure out basic movements, much less combat. Close quarters combat is almost lost at this point and the transperent head shot when you go to zoom in on something is annoying.Overall, purchase the game if you want to get in early and support the author, but you won't be missing much if you wait for it to be a lot more polished.

								NEW (5.1.2015):Okay now that there where some updates i can fully recommend the game.Altough there are still some bugs the content has multiplied by at least 5 and furthermore, the game has more gameplay recent mechanics.The performance has been increased beyond everything i would have imagined.I can now run the game on full settings without lags or sth like that.Also all the chunk bugs, are now as far as i can tell away.I hope that the game will also run as fine in multiplayer since they added greater mobs.OLD:This game is full of potential and has the chance to become a great mix of minecraft, terraria and cubeworld.But at this time in the early access states it is full of bugs.Not minor bugs but major performance and game crash bugs.I am able to play 40 minutes at best before it crashs,while playing the game is very much fun but the often crashs and the huge amount of performance issues like unloaded chunks. Memory leaks and undefined crashs make an end to the fun.I will update this review with every patch because i belive it has a huge potential but at this time for me its unplayable.

								I can't recommend buying this game.There are still (since there are no updates since july) alot of crashes, stupid hitboxes where your projectile just fly thru the monsters, no balanced gameplay you literally just run around open chests wich are like every 2 steps is one of them and loot mighty weapons and other stuff.There is nothing to explore at all. Sadly i could not even finish the first 2 Quests since the Game is crashing that lot and then ruin my savegame over and over again. I liked the way you can customize kinda everything but actually you cant customize♥♥♥♥♥♥since the game wont work for longer than 15 minutes at best. last but not least:We all know this is an early Access Game and surely we can life with bugs and a few crashes from time to time but for my oppinion even an alpha version of a game should not contain that lots and lots of gamebreaking bugs and crashes wich makes it impossible to play at all. I mean what do we pay for here? Literally when you buy Vox you pay for just and only the games title in your library because you can't play it anyways. And with the last update beeing set in July i doubt this game is ever going out of alpha state.			"

								Game has been abit too buggy for me. Just started playing and the amount of crashes is not making me any happier. Just trying to quit the game, causes it to freak out. Not too mention not being aim or lock on to enemies with a bow seems rather stupid. Game has way too many chests just laying around, come on there needs to a sense of adventure. Not oooo, I found a chest out in the open. Maybe traps, dungeons, castles, and or even mining. Not just having ore piles laying around, usually you have to dig to get ore. Game definitely needs to be revamped as some things don't really make sense. Also alittle tutorial would be nice to show players what they can do. There is no type of skills that I have seen so far. Leveling doesn't make sense unless there is something to show for it. How about having some skill trees and loot geared towards certain levels. Like short swords 1-5, long swords 6-10, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swords 10-15. Game is not bad, its just unfinished.			"

								EXTREMELY buggy. Constant crashes. Mouse occasionally stops responding, so you can't look around (making the game unplayable). You get to choose between unplayably slow, and turning off the graphical options that let you see where the edges of blocks are (making the entire thing a visual mess). Forced third-person perspective means that the majority of your screen is taken up by your character, so you can't see what you're doing. Multi-player is listed as a feature on the store page, but has actually been disabled in the game itself. The Options menu lists several tabs (Gameplay, Graphics, Sound, Interface, Controls) but all possible options are actually listed on the same single page. There's no in-game list of what the controls are, so you have to guess-and-check everything. ""Take all"" from chests won't work if your (tiny) inventory is full, EVEN IF the chest only contains stackable items you are already carrying. Map doesn't save at all if it crashes (which it will, because even quitting through the menu will cause a crash). Put something valuable in a chest to make room in your tiny inventory? It's gone forever now.But enough about the programming faults. As to the gameplay itself, it leaves a lot to be desired. ""Tutorial"" map contains no actual tutorial. Walk speed is incredibly slow, and if there's a run button I didn't find it. The ""Tutorial"" map gave me the mission ""Kill 10 Skelebobs"", which were not among the FOUR enemies (so many!) that I managed to find. Bees, bats, slimes, mimics..... Speaking of enemies, let's talk about combat: Weapons only attack directly in front of your character, which is not always where you're looking. Health doesn't regenerate - at all. Any damage you take in combat is permanent, so you basically can't explore at all in this exploration game.Long story short, it's a buggy mess of a Minecraft clone. Currently it's not worth buying at any price.			"

								terrible game.....nothing will keep you playing this:-terrible laggy controls-the control scheme is a total joke, you pick up coins by walking over them but for items you have to click left mouse button.....a lot of times it doesnt work or you will punch the ground with your pickaxe-caves are nothing but big holes in the ground. Its not even a cave, its just like a big sphere would have been cut out of the ground and they are huge, so huge that it can be quite impossible to climb out of them (or at least extremely tedious)-the UI is clunky and bug infested-crafting system is no fun and just so user unfriendly, there is no point in crafting since you will always get better loot in chest lying around anyway.-graphics are dull, I dont mean the voxels, there are simply no textures.....if you are underground in a ""cave full of stone"" you will only see one color of grey, nothing else. It feels like beeing in an unfinished testing area of the game, like a untextured matrix-character creation is weird and not fun-performance is so bad, for a game that doesnt even use textures, it crashes quite a lot-the customization part is there, but what is it good for when the game keeps on crashing and the overall gameplay is no fun at all?Stay away from this game, even on sale, its simply just broken and seeing how much time past since I got it and played it, this is never going to change! You could rather play Minecraft or something else.			"

								You guys are so unsupportive. Okay so first off, this game IS NOT bad, not at all. It is just that the players are a bit too old for this game and since thus outdated it. This is supposed to be some kind of way for children or younger people to play and not be exposed to what the everlasting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ multiplayer combat we have now.The game has great items and an easy to learn process, the quest are kind of fun and have a funny feeling to them. The people (NPCS) are not so daring to talk too, and give you a choice to kill them which is funny because they one hit you. I reccomend this if you wanna start your child out on an easy game to show them what an MMO or RPG is.			"

Need more things to do and gameplay still needs improvement instead of slapping monsters all day.UPDATE: January 2nd 2015I am sad to say that this game hasn't updated in ages and thus leading to the theory of the developer ditching the game and taking my money along with him. I cannot recommend this game as it is a pointless and boring scam on steam. Not as bad as starforge tho. Lol. Still don't buy this game.			"

								I'm not going to bash the game, despite the recommendation. The game is spot on about the 100% character creation. It -is- in Alpha, crashes are expected. But until the game reaches beta, to me, it isn't worth the $10 to get it. I got mine on a sale. So if you're going to get it, wait for a sale and try it out yourself once, with it in mind, that it's an alpha game.My only real quirrel right now is that, the News page for the game has not seen an update since July of 2014, and I haven't noticed any sign of updates thus far. I haven't looked extensively either, admittedly.Put simple, I cannot suggest this game until it reaches more stable versions and more content is there, such as Multiplayer.			"

								I find it extremely complicated to like this game, for the fact that the Minimum requirements are way off and aren't even close to being correct. Even if the Minimum requirements were replaced with the Maximum, the game still serves its purpose: ""LAG SPIKE,"" some people are flexible about how their computer affects the game but I for one can't handle the constant freezing and crashing. My FPS is so far off from the game being playable that sometimes when I enter the starter town, the town is just a big flat platform with nothing on it.Further more... Saving almost never works at all, every time I try to save it either works or the game just crashes completely, I literally have to save every 30 seconds just to prevent the game from crashing on me and a loss of data.

								This game is marvelous.People would say its a rip off of Minecraft, or Cubeworld, but its not.This game has ALOT of potential. It's vast environments and endless character creation fits right into the storyline, if you do so wish there is one.This game is worth the money, and seeing it was made right before my eyes on twitch.tv by a wonderful indie game creator, I cannot say this is a copy, because it isnt. It is like a cake, yes everyone has made a cake, but they're all unique, and this game is unique in a certain way some people cant seem to grab.Pick this game up for a great immersive experience, 9.2/10 ~Lucariocios(BTW, the Marty Mc.Fly character in the game was suggested by me :D) "

								Well, I have owned this game for years, seen it's good times and bad times. I have waited to post a review of the game due to the fact that it's simply so far from finished.I find myself no long able to wait. When I first bought VOX the devs were very active with the community...positive and upbeat, always answering their critics with fair answers.  Slowly however, as game sales started to drop and the patches became fewer and farther in-between the dev(s) simply disappeared from the forums.  A year went by without a word from the dev, and also without any updates to the game...then 2 years.All of a sudden a big update hits, great news right? When the community asked for patch notes the dev responded with sarcasm, saying: ""everyting has changed"", and he was not kidding. He did not even want to take the time to release a changelist after not updating the game for 2 years. Well, it's been about a year since the last patch...the engine is now open source but the game is still for sale here on Steam.  The dev still refuses to interact with his supporters on Steam, but you can find him screwing around on Twitter all of the time.I had high hopes for VOX, I really did; as of now though I have uninstalled it. No doubt the dev is upset that the game has not gone as planned...but when you ignore your paying customers for years at a time it only compounds the problem.			"
