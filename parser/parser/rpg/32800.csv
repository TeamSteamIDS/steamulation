												If I could sum up this game in one word, that word would be ""fine""The game does everything just fine, but you can find other games that do everything better. The RPG elements are fine, but other games are better. The Fighting is fine, but you can find better elsewhere, The graphics are fine, but... you see what I mean?Nothing wrong with the game, actually it's.... well, fine... just nothing spectacular			"

												You get to progress through the story playing one of three characters (dwarf, human, or elf) while being able to swap characters at any point in the story. The two other characters that you did not choose become AI and help you on your journey. You get to explore Rivendell, Brill, and many more and talk to some of the Fellowship, but your journey is not with them, instead you head north towards the Grey Mountains to fight this game's antagonist, Agandaur. The game is fairly short, but there is a lot of replay value. You can play through the story as another character and find secrets that you couldn't with any of the other characters. Once you beat a difficulty, you unlock the next one and you can continue to level and gather further upgrades.The scenery is very beautiful but the levels are as linear as ever. Nothing is destructable with the exception of barrels and boxes and a few certain locations where you have to blow through a door. The gameplay is decent. It's a basic hack and slash with various ranged attacks depending on the character. As you level up, you can put skills into your talent tree and unlock a few more skills on your action bar. The cooldowns are lengthy enough to keep you hacking and slashing until you get to unleash your abilities again. I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys the lore or Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. I learned a few things I never knew and there are a couple easter eggs. I got this game for $1 dollar during the bundle and I would NOT recommend you buy this at $19.99. There are a TON of bugs. There is a brightness bug during some of the levels. Side Quests sometimes disapear. Your saves can get deleted. Some game mechanism are poor as well. The hit box on all the characters are huge. You can shoot an arrow to the left of them and they still get hit. When you want to squeeze past your friend, you get stuck by invisible barriers. The barriers are everywhere as well. WORST OF ALL...the game is abandoned. The ownership of the game was sold and then the game was abandon. No more patches and no more support. Wait for a sale and see if you can get this cheap.			"

												There need to be more co-op RPGs like this.It might be an easy and short game, but I really, really enjoyed it. If you have two friends you often play games with, then you should definitely check this one out. It's best played like that, with this game only benefiting you from playing co-op. Each character has their own secrets which can open up areas that hide loot, and each character has a race skill which can help the other characters out. The combat is very satisfying, because you can pull off some awesome dismemberments and decapitations, and even do Fellowship strikes or kills when all characters are attacking the same enemy.At first sight it looks like it offers the typical character selection, being a Mage, a Warrior and a Ranger. But none of these characters HAVE to be played like they usually are. I played as the Ranger, and you would assume he would mainly use his bow in combat. I really only did when there were enemies you could only reach with ranged attacks. The game gave me the option to use two-handed weapons, dual wield two one-handed weapons, or use a one-handed weapon in combination with a shield too. There were plenty of skills which would increase my effectiveness with either of these weapon combinations, as well as skills which would give me new archery abilities or give specific bonuses to me using my race skill.I feel like this game is a nice combination between an action-based hack-and-slash game, with the looting system of an Action RPG/Dungeon Crawler, and a story and setting which fit right into the LOTR series. I'm not saying the story is interesting enough to make every LOTR fan play this game, but it's also not ruining any part of the lore. It might just be a little more interesting for someone who likes the LOTR story than for someone who doesn't care for it at all.			"

My score: 7.5/10Playthrough time: 16 hours 30 min (single player: main story and most side quests, listening to most conversation)Pros:+Good action RPG combat, severing orc limbs is fun+Lots of well put together LotR story elements/locations for fans to enjoy+Enough levelling and loot to keep things interestingCons:-Gameplay can probably get repetitive if you play more than 1-2 hours each time-Combat system and leveling/skill tree isn't that deep for hardcore players-Fiddly character change system-A few glitches may crash the gamePerformance notes:The game is great for using the Xbox 360 controller and playing on the TV from the couch.Graphics performance R9 280X, 1080P max settings: 60 FPS (V-sync) all the time except for a few stutters when loading new textures.Main review:If you will enjoy LotR: War in the North depends on how you're going to play the game, and if you're a fan of the LotR world. The game is best played casually a few hours at the time, If you play it that way, and you're a fan, the game will probably keep you entertained all the way through and has a lot going for it when it comes to the story and locations.If you're not interested in the Lord of the Rings world, and come just for the action RPG, you'll probably find the game lacking, especially if you put 3-4 or more hours in to the game each go, then the game will probably feel quite repetitive.The game tells a story of three heroes (man, dwarf, elf) indirectly helping the fellowship during the LotR story. You run in to quite a few characters from the books/movies, and visit familiar locations as Bree and Rivendell. The locations in this game generally look great, and all the characters has quite a lot to say, so the story builds up well with lots of background information available if you like to listen to conversation.The main part of the game has you battling mostly orcs in a third person action RPG style. The combat style doesn't differ much through the game, you can select any of the three characters (but switching between them is only allowed upon clearing a section of the current chapter, or after visiting towns, and is a bit clunky), use a light or heavy attack, ranged attacks and magic/skills. You level up and unlock/improve skills and get better gear/other loot that improve stats, but the gameplay doesn't change that much. You're still hacking/shooting at orcs most of the time.I really enjoyed the combat, and the levelling/loot was enough to keep me interested all the way through, and combat is fun. Sometimes after getting the enemy HP down enough you get a prompt to use a heavy attack for a limb severing finish that for me never got old. Just as satisfying every time.The game has some nice boss battles as well, and every chapter has a few events that mixes things up. The game also supports online co op (up to 3 players in total). Unfortunately, I haven't been able to try this, but I can image this game can be lots of fun with 1-2 friends.As for the glitches: At the final chapter, there was a game breaking glitch, for some reason when navigating the tunnels the game got really choppy and crashed when the frame rate got too low. Apparently a common problem, and the solution was to set the graphics to minimum and get through that section with as little on screen as possible (aiming at the floor while moving helped). When out of the tunnels, restart the game and everything is well again.Update: Apparently the problem is AMD related and another way of fixing it is by installing the 12.6  version of AMD Catalyst, Click for a guide.I enjoyed the game and will do a ""New game+"" some day.

												Lord of the Rings: War in the North surprised me. I bought it expecting that it wouldn't be very good, as movie adaptations often suffer from a multitude of issues. This one, though it does have some issues, manages to avoid the worst of them.It does so by not making the main story or characters have anything to do with the content of the movies, instead focusing on some other folks doing a different quest during the same time span. You get to cross paths with the heroes of the main story, but your story does not really impact the main events of the movies. Some have criticized the game for this, but if you look at it as just another adventure in the lands of MIddle Earth, it's fine.War in the North takes you through a series of events unfolding, unsurprisingly, in the north part of Tolkien's maps. The villain is a bit contrived, but the rest of the journey is filled with the same kind of delicious aesthetic that the movies used to bring Middle Earth to life. I don't remember everything in the appendices of the novels, so I don't know how much of this stuff they just made up for the game, but it's all believably Tolkienesque enough that you won't think about it much unless you're a Tolkien scholar. In short, they nailed the flavour perfectly.The gameplay is solid third-person action-RPG fare. Controls and movements are fluid, there are skill trees, and item upgrades galore. Each of the three characters plays differently enough, while still allowing the player to customize the skills and abilities toward their preferences. All characters are capable at both melee and ranged combat, all have damage-boosting abilities, and all have support abilities, so you get to decide what you want to be good at.There are a couple issues I found with the game, namely the crafting system feels tacked-on and falls short of its potential. Inventory space is limited as well, so you run out of room for all the crafting materials. The two issues are certainly related. Part of that stems from the fact that you occasionally get gems that you can socket in your items, but using them means that you must either destroy them or the item you put them in, which disincentivizes their use. Further, they're rare to find, and have randomly generated stats, like all the rest of the gear. Which is another sore spot.Gear. The game tries to do the fun loot hunt minigame, but falls short. The items generate very random stats. It incentivizes collecting ""set"" items that unlock powerful additional bonuses, but there are so many of them and not enough drops happening to make that worthwhile. I found that I was better off just using the best individual pieces of gear, regardless of set.Sidequests are all pretty bland, fetch-quest type stuff, and kind of feel like filler, or an excuse to involve a given character in the story. Not a high-point, but could be worse.Each area has enough secrets in it to keep you going back for more if exploration is your thing, and you will have to go through with each of the 3 characters (or play multiplayer coop) in order to find them all. That's not a bad thing necessarily, as I found the world was a joy to explore for the mostpart, and each of the characters was fun to use and level up.It's priced appropriately, is on for 75% off pretty regularly, and actually a good deal at that price.

												Starting a new branch of JRR Tolkein's ""Lord of The Rings"" series, this quest based game plunges the player into Middle Earth as either a human (Eradan), elf (Andriel) or dwarf (Farin) to fight against the dark lord Agandaur in the North providing the fellowship with time to destroy the ring. This game was a personal favorite of mine. You battle through the North, accompanied with loyal friends, on a variety of dificulties with boss battles at the end of each level providing a harder challenge each time. On completion of the game you can restart to where it all begins with all your gear and complete it on a higher difficulty. The game also has multiplayer for those missions you need help with. Again this game is a personal favorite and I HIGHLY recommend it as a game easy to spend multiple hours on with an enjoyable gameplay and ending.			"

												While it certainly isn't the best hack n slash action game you'll ever play, Lord of the Rings: War in the North proved to be a fun game despite its flaws. This game was designed as a multiplayer experience, so you should play with a friend if you can, if not prepare yourself to constant variations is gameplay as you'll have to change characters more often than not. In the end this was not a setback, as each has a slightly different play style so changing characters (ranger, elf, dwarf) proved to be varied and amusing.This game is first and foremost aimed at Lord of the Rings / Tolkien fans. If you count yourself among those, you'll be satisfied. I played this game as I was reading The Silmarillion again which proved to be a good choice as the story is not focused on the main events at the end of the Third Age but on the fight against the forces of Sauron in the north of Middle Earth. Don't expect Bethesda or Bioware levels of lore in this game, just relax, enjoy the story and focus on what this game does best - combat.The fights are intense, combos are easy to execute and enemies' limbs fly all over as you chop Orc after Orc. If you want a good hack'n'slash experience, look no further.“The world is full of peril and in it there are many dark places”  "

LotR: War in the North. A worth side-story? Mh. Let's see.In ""LotR: War in the North"" you will play as a dwarf, a ranger or an elf. The events play parallel to the main story of LotR, so you will see some known faces. The story is simple: Sauron wants to rule ""middle-earth"" (as far as we know from the movies/books). One of his leaders Agandúar (?) is stationed in north of ""middle-earth"" (no sh*t) and you have to stop him. So you play behind the scenes. Yeah, nothing big, but it's ok and exciting.NOTE: The desciption says, that ""War in the North"" is an Open World game - that is not 100% true. You run from map/location to the next and you are able to visit this place again (although does not make any sense).To the facts!++ for fans: a must have++ familiar soundtrack++ known spots, enemys and characters+ some ""untelled"" background knowledge+ easy controls (hack & slash style)+ good atmosphere and nice sound effects+ nice special-moves+ good animations+ some sidequests- you can't save on your own (but it saves every 10-20min)- the (german) synchro was horrible- the dialogues sound like from Google Translator- flat characters- the endboss was...too damn easy - I died more often from a troll- little playtime (about 10 hours)- graphic vulnerabilities (from 2011...)- the multiplayer is nearly dead- no choices that affect the storyAs you can see, there are 1:1 positive/negative arguments, but I still recommend this game (because my expectations were not too big)!So! If you want a short-hack&slash-(koop)-LotR game - this is the adress: http://steamcommunity.com/app/32800Must have for fans - Must look for all the others. I don't regret these 5€ (sale) and it was a nice game in between (three days).War in the North: 6/10 dead orcs "

												The Lord of the Rings: War in the North is an action RPG. When starting a new game you are able to choose one of three heroes to start your adventure. Each of these heroes have their own unique abilities. However you are able to change the character you play as at any point by leaving the game and coming back to it, this means that you will not always be stuck with one character during a playthrough.Earning XP works like it does in most other games - (killing Enemies = XP, Completing Quests = XP)Once you have leveled up you will be provided with a few points to level up your stats such as stamina and will. You will also be provided with an ability point to unlock a special ability.

												Good solid game that I would definitely recommend.  Pros:- good storyline with lots of lore- good voice acting- just enough sidequests to not detract from the story- skills received a noticeable, but not overpowering bump when leveling them upFew things that could have been better:- wish voice acting was same as the movie, but still good- inventory management was sort of a mess.  No good comparison mode when looking at vendor to inventory, too much junk loot and not enough loot you'd want to wear even towards the end- AI for your companions is not very good, but I imagine a ton of fun to play co-op- save points are a little strange. i.e. beat the boss, go back to town, interact with a vendor and see save icon after, quit game > log back in and I have to fight the boss again?  Strange.  I could see this being an issue on the harder difficulties that might take a few times to beat.- respec should be much cheaper imo - probably figure you'll do it in heroic and legendary- companions on solo play - I was fortunate enough to read up on this before I started giving good loot to them.  Apparently it disappears so you should only trade to another play and never the computer.I do like that you get to pick up where you left off when playing through the next difficulty level.  I'll probably come back and give at least heroic a whirl.  Legendary sounds brutal.			"

												Pros:- Gameplay- Story- Graphics- Well developed co-opCons:- Unfixed bugs & glitches- Bad voice actingYou can play as either:- Eradan, the 'Ranger' and a dúnedain. He can use a sword and shield, or dual wield swords and has a bow and arrow for ranged attacks. He also has access to stealthy attacks. He has the unique ability of finding secrets.- Farin, the 'Champion' and a dwarf. His combat style focuses on melee but he also has a crossbow for ranged attacks. He has the unique ability of mining for gems.- Andriel, the 'Lore Master' and an elf. Her combat style is mostly focused on magic but can also dual wield a sword with her staff. She has the unique ability of creating potions from items found throughout the world. With that said you can use her very much as a 'support' character.It's a lot of fun using all these characters with friends, without them you'll get bots as partners that aren't as useful. I strongly encourage co-op! Single-player won't be the same... Also those glitches ARE there! And there are a lot of them! Get it cheaply and enjoy the dollar or so you spent :)			"

												This game got some really lousy reviews, so I went into it expecting the worst. But as it turns out, it was not as bad as everyone says. It's a pretty - albeit shallow, linear and generic -  action game that was a welcome change after the huge open-world of Skyrim.I think one problem people had with this game is that it was originally advertised as an RPG. This game is anything but; it's a third-person melee fighter in the vein of Hexen or Dark Messiah. Yes, there are some rudimentary RPG elements (quests, stats) but at its core ""War In The North"" is pure action. Although the graphics aren't jaw-dropping, it does boast a number of spectacular vistas. The characters are generic but appealing nonetheless, and the story likewise. It does lack in variety, however; your avatars only have a limited moveset and you'll be fighting off the same handful of monsters throughout the entire game. The levels are more varied, but are incredibly linear and despite some impressive set-pieces nothing you haven't seen before. This definitely limits its re-playability, even with the co-op mode, but as a change of pace from larger games it was still a welcome experience. "

												I'm gonna be honest, I didn't knew what to expect from LOTR: War in the North, I only decided to play it because The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug was almost coming out here. Let me say this right away, I haven't had so much fun in a LOTR game since LOTR: Return of the King on the Xbox. War in the North is basicly an Action RPG, it reminded of Dragon Age at some times gameplay wise. You can play with one of 3 characters, Eradan (Man) which is the Ranger class, Farin (Dwarf) which is the Champion class and Andriel (Elf) wich is a Lore Master (mage). When you level up you can upgrade each one of your stats (stamina, will, strengh, dexterity etc.) and you can also level up a skill which is either passive or active and you use it during combat. Storywise the game takes place on the North while the Fellowship make their way to Mordor. The game plays really well ( I did found it easier to play with a 360 controller though), the combat is satisfying yet I felt like it was somewhat simple with a lack of combos and variety to it. You also have an inventory to store your items and your loot, which I don't know if it's random, and you can sell the stuff you don't want at a store or certain ""checkpoints"" that appear on each level. Two things I really like about LOTR: War in the North is that the game rewards exploration, by gaining access to secret areas and finding extra gear to either sell or equip, the other thing I also liked is the character design and the dialogue system. Basicly the dialogue system works like in Mass Effect, Dragon Age and KOTOR, I don't know if this was made on the Bioware dialogue engine though. Eitherways, either if you're a fan of the LOTR world or not it is certain that this is still a very good game and that you don't need to be a fan of LOTR to enjoy it, it's satisfying, it's fun and the plot is very engaging, you can't go wrong with this one, play it!

												War in the North is an action-RPG built with a strong focus on co-op. All of the familiar characteristics of the action-RPG genre are here, from shops and loot to blacksmiths that repair weakened or busted weaponry; as well as some combo-based swordplay.War in the North is all about action, and the action starts when you pick one of the three characters.  No, you can’t pick any of the actual LOTR characters.  You’re stuck with these relatively generic goofballs, doing relatively generic things in a generic fantasy world populated by generic quest givers. Several builds exist for each character though, and you can even build the wizard in melee combat and kick ♥♥♥ surprisingly.  Other than her, you’ve got your typical LOTR ranger and warlord archetypes to play as for sword and bow combat. The control scheme doesn’t really lend that well to a keyboard and mouse, so I highly recommend making the investment for a controller if you don’t have one already. With a completely forgettable character lineup and story that only serves to get in the way or set up the next hub/killing field, it’s been a long time since I ran into a hack and slash that I really never feel like loading up again after putting down.The highlight of the game, as every LOTR game should have a great soundtrack and voice acting to back it up, and this delivers. While the actual context of the story is pretty pathetic, the production values are high enough to keep you listening rather than skipping cutscenes.Games graphics are also rather good. Given sufficient hardware, the game will shine and shimmer even in the bloodiest of fights.While it doesn't reach the heights we wished it would, War in the North is still a solid experience with more than enough content to justify checking it out. Overall 7/10.			"

												The Lord of the Rings: War in the north is action role-playing game. The game takes place in Middle-earth, the same timeline as the fellowship of the ring, except you're not going to be with the fellowship here, not even you're going to join the battle of Helm's Deep or the Siege of Minas Tirith. You have your own battle here in the northern part of Middle-earth. You will be able to explore Rivendell or you may call it Imladris, the town of Bree, Mirkwood and more. You can choose 3 different characters, each from different race, different abilities and different secrets to found throughout the game. Choose Eradan, a human rangers from Dunedain, Andriel, an elf lore-master from Imladris or Farin, a dwarf from Erebor. Any characters you choose, the rest will become your AI companion.The game has good and decent gameplay. It's basic hack and slash game but each characters can also use different ranged attack such as crossbow. The story of the game is linear which makes the level also very linear. Items are vary in this game, and items with better quality can be found as the characters level progress and playing more harder difficulty. Once you beat a difficulty, you can continue playing from the start point on the next difficulty level but retaining your characters level and items. You can also play cooperative with your friends here.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North has good graphics. Each level and stages in the game have great detail on the environment, which makes Rivendell have really beautiful scenery and the enemy castle a very bad place to see. Animation is also good, though sometimes there is a small animation glitch when an orcs dies.But I also will tell you that this game has downside too. Unfixed bugs and glitches are common here, you may see a sword thrown up without reason, the AI companion is somewhat foolish too, using ability when their foe is already dead, or sometimes they even will become your problem. The acting is also not that good, even the voice acting too. But this game is still recommended from me.+ Gameplay+ Cooperative+ Storyline+ Graphics+ Replayable- Bad AI- Bugs- GlitchesRating 8/10			"

												Just started playing throught this with two friends, it's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.1. You each have a different role and different gear associated with it - Champion: Straight up heavy DPS, uses big two handed axes and maces, he can also use 2 handed swords with one hand. - Ranger: Agile DPS, can dual wield swords/maces/hammers and can use greatswords. - Lore-Master: Healing and procective magic, she can also use her staff as a melee weapon when needed.2. ♥♥♥♥ING LOOT IS AWESOME. Each of you get your own seperate loot that covers all 3 classes, so you'll need to take breaks every now and then to give eachother the items for their class and vice versa.3. Combat is kinda like Dragon Age on a console. You know, the hack and slashy ♥♥♥♥. But it's extremely satisfying for all classes.The overall feel for the game is kinda like an MMO and Borderlands mixed together, it's really well made and is up to standards even 3 (nearly 4) years later.If you've got an odd number of friends that you regularly play games with (like myself), I would definitely recommend this to you!9.5/10			"

												This game was tremendously fun... dont get me wrong, but the shuttering and crashing of the game quickly weather the players experience to a minimum. Chapters 2 and 8 took me and my girlfriend well over 10 hours to complete because of the sheer amount of resets, computer crashes, and shuttering that we had experienced. I have heard that these problems only occur with AMD cards, so you could try your luck with NVIDIA.I do recommend the game on the grounds that it is tremendously fun when it is playable. The graphics are great and the camera angles do not impede on the experience very often. If youre into swords, shields, bows and arrows, and magic... this may be right up your alley.			"

												I just finished War in the North and thought this was a seriously underrated action RPG. Really enjoyed it. The progression is linear so if you are looking for a Open World Sandbox go find it somewhere else but don't let that dissuade you from giving this a shot.  I played this Single Player so cannot speak to the Multplayer game here but had fun playing it alone. It started off a little slow but I thought the story was believable and the voice acting were good and it was the right amount of tough (on Normal Mode). Whenever I thought I was starting to breeze through Orcs, I got hit with a boss or some Trolls that made me have to actually think about how I was going to progress. The only downsides were that the camera angles got a bit jumbled in big fights (Dodge Dodge Dogde!!!), bows were ehh (even as a Ranger), it was kind of short (I beat in in 18 hours and I'm OLD), and don't plan on respeccing because it costs a LOT. I picked this up cheap and got more than my moneys worth. Hope this review is helpful.			"

												While the gloriously grisly combat was immensely addicting and the authentic lore was the perfect vehicle for the ride through Middle-earth, unfortunately, unaddressed and well documented issues persisted.   During my second play-through with the difficulty elevated, my over powered Dwarf wrecking ball encountered too few a challenge.  The stars of the show though were a giant eagle voiced magnificently by John Patrick Lowrie of Halo and Half-Life fame and the coup de gras was the minacious dragon voiced by Keith Szarabajka's guttural and orotund vocals.+ Flawless Widescreen for FOV adjustments and resolutions above 1080P.+ ReShade with SweetFX 2.0, Profile ""More in the North"" by Atyth for visual enhancement.

												Great game to be played with friends, but i wouldn't recommend it if you're going to play it SOLO!Pros:  - Coop Campaing (up to 3 players) - LOTR history based. - Explains why the eagles didn't help frodo to carry the ring to morder xDCons: - BUGS, BUGS EVERYWHERE! (Chapter 8 - part 2 was a living bug) - May not be recommendable to be played solo if you're a casual gamer. - Some communication problems (Client <-> Host) while playing coop (not much of a problem, but still)So if you really want to buy it, try to find a cheap reseller or wait for the closest sales (christmas in this case) because it's not worth to pay $20... or at least not for me haha			"

												This game is, for sure, canon to the Lord of the Rings and it's also awesome.First of all, the player will experience the world of middle-earth by views unique, some of them shown some of them not in the 6 movies, also many references to the 4 books and the notes of mr. Tolkien. This game is a piece of art and it should be treated as much. It's price is more than reasonable for its long story and content and those who were unable to have access to the 4 books, might find this game for informative and interesting than they thought. Though the gameplay itself is not bad, I will give cons to this game because of the following 3 : 1. Very small lvl cap, in other words you cant max out your character ( dont worry you can buy respec item ;) ). 2. sudden difficulty changes, for example there is one sequence where you have to go from agile goblins and orc, to Uruk and Trolls. 3. No actual need for skills, yes you may fall in battle and yes you may get grabbed by that troll, but dont worry, only if the entire team falls before one gets up you may be able to lose, also in addition to that if you fill your pocket and sell whatever you dont want, you can get extremely good equipment, which will turn current, suppossed to be, strong enemies into childs' play.Although this game is good and if you are a fan of Hobbit or Lord of the  Rings you might find it interesting and even sometimes exciting. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!!			"

												Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a hack and slash RPG and takes place in the north during the trilogy in Middle-earth. While the game is NOT canon, it tries to fit into the lotr lore and it does a decent job at it. You can play as a dunédain, a dwarf or an elf.  It is even supposedly possible to play this in coop mode with up to 3 players, but I heard there are some problems coming with it.+ The premise is good+ Lots of fan service if you are into that kind of stuff+ visually good looking+ good skill tree+ This game made the protagonist ask gandalf why the eagles don't fly to mount doom to destroy the ring. :'D+ you can pick up a lot of different weapons and armours. + there are dunédains in this game that were CUT in the movies. damn you, peter jackson- deus ex machina eagles. please no more- the looting pop up message is annoying since you always have to find your mouse that is all over the place- soundtrack was underwhelming- only one save slot and it's not possible to manually save either- lots of invisible walls. also, the maps are very linear (console port)- I haven't tested it, but the coop mode has supposedly some problems like desyncs, crashes etc.Technical informations: Be warned if you have a AMD graphics card. If you have a nvidia card, you can try out disabling vsync for this game in the nvidia control panel in order to increase your FPS from 60 to 120. It's still capped though, but it makes much more fun playing at 120.Replay value: Potentially high if you are really digging this game, but for me ""average"" is more fitting hereRating: 7.0/10Recommendation: Yes if you are a lotr fan or like the setting			"

												I'm gonna do something crazy as hell in this review: I admit I haven't finished this great game yet.And you know what else? It's one of the most underrated, excessively bashed on, unfairly abandoned games in my entire collection, and even that I've encountered in my career. All because it came out something like within a week of Skyrim, but that's a personal view.What do you get for <$20 (its cheaper during sales obviously)? one of the most fun cooperative hack and slashes around, that's what. Blending awesome combat, a fairly original story quite true to Tolkein's work, and basic RPG elements like customizable gear and a full inventory as well as basic side quests, this game had true potential and I really do hope someone who cares gets a hold of the rights to it and shines it up proper. Until then, it's more than worth it's cover price. Consider buying if it's up your alley, but I won't pretend this is a game for everyone.			"

Can switch between characters per chapter too+ New charater perspective on Hollywood favourites such as: Radagast, Elrond and Strider+ Plenty of scenery to enjoy. Rivendel looks great in this game!+ Tells the tale of a story most fans won't be familar with; so its a new adventure for some+ 12 hours game time (for the story) with extra hours for side line questsCONS- Repetitive combat at times so try to switch character- Requires a lot of looting during gameplay- Skill tree cannot be reset easily which is annoying- Character change is also annoying as it requires re-loading- Encounted 2 glitches but weren't super frustrating- Movement is clunky at timesHighly recommened to any Middle-Earth fans.

The hitboxes are kinda big for your character and the enemies and this can be good and bad at times.- Movement and combat is kinda clunky/rigid, it is a bit annoying at times.- Invisible walls are everywhere.- The AI of your companions can be kinda stupid, if you fall, instead of them going to your help they will try to kill any enemy first then go to your aid and this can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ sometimes.Aside from that, this game is fun and the story is good.

												This is a fairly decent action rpg experience, set in the world of Middle Earth.  The environments and characters are what makes this game worth playing in my opinion.  There are some locales that will be very familiar to LOTR fans as well as completely new areas, all of which are done fantastically.  There are a ton of familiar faces to see and converse with such as Aragorn or Gandalf, and quite a few new characters to get involved with.  Other than that it's a pretty generic experience.  Pick your class, fight through a level full of continuous bad guys (orcs, goblins, Uruk Hai, etc.), then a big boss battle at the end of the level.  Rinse and repeat.  This game should definately be played in co op with some friends to make a far better experience.  All in all it's still a good game especially if your'e a LOTR fan, I would recommend picking it up on sale.			"

												Review of Lord of the Rings: War in the NorthAre you a fan of adventure?Are you a fan of replayability?Are you a fan of collecting incredible amounts of original loot and gear?And most of all: Are you a fan of LOTR?If you answered yes to these questions, this game is absolutely for you. And if you answered no, it's also absolutely for you.The game was released the same year as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and i think it has been overshadowed by it. Don't get me wrong, Skyrim is by far one of the best games i've ever played, but still. This game offers a whole lot of things Skyrim (and other rpg's) didn't. One of the best things about this game is the combat. You will be slashing your way through a huge collection of different enemies with great pleasure. Decapitating orcs and Uruk-Hai has never felt better!And while it's an old game the graphics still hold up quite well, and with the ReShade by ScureHD it looks really good.All in all this game is amazing, but i think the price on Steam makes people unsure on weither or not to get it. A tip: Buy it on ♥♥♥ for £2 (hush hush)			"

												Rating 6.5/10Overview: Third Person Action RPG The Good:+ Choose between three separate characters each with their own unique passive and active abilities. + Story, dialogue and voice acting are solid and do a great job making the lord of the rings universe feel alive.+ Lots of different locations to explore within the LOTR universe + Challenge levels+ Great sound designThe Average:Not the best-looking game, some areas look decent while others are bad. I would have liked better use of colors as most areas seem to be a mix of brown and green. Certain textures seem lo-res as well. Characters give great details about side quests which help flesh out the universe, the problem however is that every side quest is a collect-a-thon. Plenty of loot to find and the loot itself looks great when you equip it however the items you find are not very exciting. The only stat you will be looking at is whether it increases damage/armor. Combat, although controls well starts to feel very repetitive half way through the game.  The character skills are not diverse enough and the combat isn’t deep enough so gameplay starts to drag out. The Bad:- Terrible, terrible technical performance. Framerate drops, stuttering after major events, graphical glitches etc. This seems to happen at very odd times. Most of the time the game will run smoothly but then for some odd reason the framerate will drop drastically, the game will start chugging even though very little is happening. The worst was at the very last level where I was getting 1-10 fps even though nothing was happening. Setting everything to the lowest option seemed to have fixed it however.  - Multiplayer is dead which may not be a bad thing because playing co-op tends to cause game breaking bugs. Conclusion:I believe this was Snowblinds last game. Like most average games there was a lot of potential here but failed to live up to it due to lack of time and money.  If you love lord of the rings, this is a good game to play however the numerous technical problems and average gameplay hold it back.  "

												This is a fantastic game. Great story and detail. I don't believe being able to choose the dialog is necessary, unless it actually changed the outcome of the conversation. Some of the lines are pretty epic though. And the power of the sappers is a bit rediculous, just like the Dwarves explosive bolt (over the top with explosiveness, but super cool). The fighting can sometimes be a little repetative but is awesome enought that you forget about it. The fighting style of each character is so different that each new play though you have the coolest fighter. Yeah good game. One of the best Lord of the Rings spinoffs ever.			"

												Lord of the Rings: War in the North, is a fun game to play. It has a Skyrim feel to it, in my opinion. Different storyline from the actual series of films, but, of course, has bits and pieces of original subject matter. Tons of action, weapons, and magic - which generates a favorable way to blow off some steam (on Steam). I also admire the option of choosing between characters, whom each have their own role.I have come across a few glitches, but overall, this is a satisfactory game to play.			"

												I must say I got this game for £4.99 on the steam sale and I was not expecting it to be very good! I was proven wrong it's highly addictive once you get going, I never get tired of killing orcs and trolls and it's even better when you slice off their heads arms or legs and it splatters black orc blood all over your armour! better still is the slowed down action as you deal the killing blow to an enemy reminding me very much of the film 300. The village of Bree looks great as does all the places you visit. I would of preferred the actual actors voices from LOTR but you soon forget about that as the game itself is well thought out and is interwoven with the quest of the ""one ring"", even though it is a quest which is entirely seperate from that. I hope they make another game set in middle earth because I really like it as would any LOTR fan I rate this game at 9/10			"

												The combat and a lot of aspects of this game make it a fun and really enjoyable experience. It's a pretty straight forward game. Fun skills, Different heroes have varying playstyles.Unfortunately, even with the communities extensive efforts and file fixes, this game still crashes me into blue screens at certain points making it unplayable for me. The Barrow-downs is the first place when general bluescreens begin and later on chapter 8, The Sewers crash to BDOS. In a ""good"" run the game just closes. One of the fixes is to change a bunch of general video options to minimum and use iron sights on a character and stare at the ground in order to get past the sewers. This is not ""a fix"" just a way to dredge through an area. As of making this review, I have 36.9 hours in the game and have enjoyed everything not involving the blue screen errors and general crashes. So, this is a regretful ""not recommended"". I have restarted the game 2 times in order to enjoy most of it as much as I could again. I do feel like I've got my enjoyment from the game unfortunately, I simply cannot finish it at all. The crashes are too prevelant by the end of the game and I simply can't find a fix that works for me.			"

												6.5/10grapghics-7/10gameplay-6/10story-        6/10controls-   7/10replay V-6.5/10If a 5 is truly average, then this game is above a 5. The graphics are nice for the for the time that the game was release and they still hold up ok today. The controls are simple and there is a watered down skill tree with a few spells and tricks to spice things up a bit. The only issue I saw with the controls was that if  I paused the game or went into a menu, the d-pad and joystock had to be neutral when you return to the game. For instance, I could not pre move my d-pad or joystick  and unpause the game or the game would think the stick was still in neutral and my character would not move. I would have put the stick back into neutral and then move my character. It's a small thing but it did impact my gameplay. This is not an open world game. I think linear path work well with some games but this would have be a better game if the gamer has the ability to explore the world and not be stuck on the narrow path. In this story, you are not the main character working to save the world. You are more like a B-squad with a side mission that will make the A-squad's mission easier and instead of saving the world, you save a region. There are many challenges that you will face but the game boss that is suppose to be so powerful is not even mentioned in the any of the LOTR books or movies. That's a huge downer. Each town is unique in appearance and there are a few characters to interact with. There's tons of loot that gets better with each difficulty which can be unlocked by beating the game. There is a leveling system that allows you to customize your character. You play as one of a trio that you can switch between after completing each stage. The other characters fight along side you as AI unless your play with a friend or two.Overall I would rate this a 6.5/10. It was able to keep me playing but there are other games that I could have spent my time on. Get it on sale and it is worth the money. "

												Let me preface this review by saying do NOT play this game by yourself. It's really boring and frustrating as the AI for your companions can be a little stupid.Summary:If you're looking for a good co-op experience, this game really brings back the old Lord of the Rings: Return of the King gameplay with some nice surprises like loot for your character and while it's not very appealing to the eyes and the story is silly, the experience you get from the co-op gameplay outweighs all that.Things I like about this game:RAndomized Loot (Players will not find hte same loot in chests and stashes and there are even item sets that you can complete)Leveling up is similar to borderlands, There are three branches of the skill tree, each focusing on a specific aspect of your character's classUp to 3 player Co-Op (LAN or Internet connection)Encourages and rewards exploration of levels (even though the game is linear, there are secret stashes of loot that players can find if they take a little extra time to explore the level)Small Mini QuestsOrcs and Goblins are the main enemy here but there are also other enemies like Undead that you face as wellThings I don't like about this gameThe animation of the bad guys seems like it was worked on more than the good guys, and the good guys animation feels stiffI think even by 2011's standards the graphics are a little lack-lusterThe beginning is bassically ""3 heros meet in a bar and talk to Aragorn and decide to go slay some Orcs, have at it player"" there's not a strong sense of direction here as to what you need to do when you first start your new game "

												Alright. Here we go. I finished this game about 5 minutes ago, and I actually want to go play it again. I read some pretty scathing reviews on this game, and while there was a fair share of badness, the satisfaction of cutting someone's head off with a staff far surpasses it. 9/10			"

												This game is strangely compelling, given that in its core it's pretty much a mediocre brawler-type, corridor-driven action ""rpg"". I'm playing it in local coop, which undoubtedly adds to the fun factor. What probably provides the most fun for me are the random lore tidbits you find out through dialogue with the various less-explored NPCs like the Great eagles and the random Dunedain rangers you encounter all over the game world. The dialogue is okay, with characters sometimes directly quoting the movies/books. The story is actually fitting the lore strangely well, dealing with a secondary force of Sauron stemming from the cold north and preventing an imminent attack on Rivendell (if I remember correctly, Gundabad was always an Orc nest, and was never really explored/explained in the source materials).The fetch ""quests"" are as basic as you can get, including one painfully tedious quest at the beginning of the game where you literally go tell a girl that a guy is in love with her, and then go back to the guy to tell him she also loves him... I mean, wow, go tell him yourself, he's standing literally twenty meters from you, and you're both doing absolutely nothing!The loot system is bland and basic, as is the skill ""tree""- with a total of maybe three or four skills per character. Your ""skills"" are extremely basic, especially with the ranger class, where you get a ""skill"" to strike hard at one guy and a ""skill"" to swipe your weapon through multiple enemies. The combat is actually not bad, all things considered- you have your roll dodges, block, various defensive options including a magical anti-arrow barrier that also heals the party, and the enemies can be relatively varied and requiring different approach methods to defeat. Still, everything seems a bit basic and unenthusiastic, especially compared to something like Shadow of Mordor.The loot system is made so that everything is completely separate for every player (a la Diablo 3), but that also includes experience- it seems that kills made by one player only award experience to that player- leading to the relatively support-oriented elven Loremaster ending up underleveled compared to attack-oriented dunedain Ranger and dwarven Champion and having to replay some levels to gain enough experience to buy better equipment.The graphics, while pretty and completely in-line with the movies' visual design, are nothing to write home about. That does provide a benefit of working well on older hardware, though!Overall, I'd recommend getting this game while it's on a heavy sale (75% off or more), especially if you're able to play it in LAN coop with a friend or two. It did keep me playing for a relatively long while, and I plan on completing it, so it gets a thumbs-up from me.			"

												LotR: War in the North is an action, hack and slash RPG. I must say, i not played many hack and slash RPG in my life as they are mostly console games and not the most popular games on PC. After this game, i might look for more.You take command of an elf, a dwarf and a human. However you can play only with one at the same time:-) you could play together with your friends or if you do that allready in other coop games and you want just some single player game then its doable so aswell. If thats the case AI take command of the other 2 characters.This game is from 2011, i believe its pretty good game for that year. Not exceptional, but a good one. The story take part at the time of the adventure of Frodo and co. Your job is to sabotage the northern army of sauron and assasinate the leader of this army. Your actions are important so they cant pursuit the ring-bearer and so they cant lay siege on northern elven/dwarf/human settlements. The story is linear (well, allmost all games has linear storyline, thats not bad if its good).Your journey will bring you through many, so far unseen areas and allready known areas of Middle-Earth. You will meet brand new characters and known heroes. The game isnt epicly long but it took me good 20hours until i finished the story (with some afk) so i really suggest to buy the game, you will get a long entertainment for your money and if you see it on sale, well, just grab it, less than a movie ticket price for 20hours:-)The combat is well designed, offers some variatons and different tactics, there are many points where you can swap between characters. Game isnt repetitive, there are a huge variation of enemies, you wont face just orcs. The bossfights are different, some are pretty challenging but its not too hard on normal.I think it is or was more common for this genre, that you cant jump, space is an evade button. The game map is pretty straight forward, you cant wander around, this is not an open world rpg.I would really recommend the game to anyone who looking for some fantasy hack and slash game and eager to kill some orcs/trolls/spiders.

												Bottom line is, if you own an ATI card, don't buy this game. Even for $5, it's not worth the headache of constant crashes and disconnects. I wish I had scrolled down the reviews more to have seen warnings about ATI cards. It started out as a pretty great co-op game, with slightly jaded graphics and not top level game mechanics, but still playable and enjoyable. Then chapter 2 hit, and it all went to hell in barrow downs. Missing textures, random disconnects and system crashes at various intervals, especially in the middle of hard fights - problems either for you or friends connected to your game. The first few were just a minor annoyance because the game was quite fun but, when it kept happening, my friends and I just had to give up in frustration. It was a sad thing too, because the game is pretty addictive.The biggest annoyance for me is how the game's minimum requirements actually state that ATI cards older than those from 2006 will run this game, and how that is basically untrue after the first chapter. I begin wonder if I can get my money back just for that partially false statement. I don't want to go through the trouble of listing my system specs, but it runs anything recent like DA:I or FC4 on ultra without issues. I use an ATI 290X.			"

												9/10This game is enjoyable to play, as the main aim of the game is to slice orcs. Some people say it gets boring after a while as the whole game is the same (to slice orcs) Which gets true, But i always seem to go back and play it again in a few weeks. The combat is great, and uses a variety of skills (depending if your Man,Elf or Dwarf) to defeat Agandaurs minions. The only other problem i had with this game was it is too short, There are about 8 levels (Including Fornost,Barrow Downs, Ettermoors, Gundabad, Mirkwood, Uglost Lair, Nordinbad and Carn Dum) This roughly takes about 15-25 hours to complete. Of course, you then play it at a harder difficulty afterwards and find new armour,weapons etc. Even though the game is fasirly short I still highly recommend it as it is one of my faviourite games, and is very fun to play.

Unfortunately, War in the North is broken on several AMD gpus, and has the potential to blue screen your computer in various sections of the game (specifically chapters 2 and 8).

												Although the graphics are a bit outdated, and most of the world textures are of low quality due to the game actually being a console port - the combat is very addictive and fun. The ""bleached"" out color palette can easily be changed by using sweetFX. The game is stable, didn't crash a single time and works very smooth on maxed out details. I absolutely recommend it!Too bad most of the map pins can't be accessed and are there just for lore info. But still - you'll get 10-15h from it by just playing through the normal mode.

												Lord or the rings War in the north is a nice game. It isn`t perfect but I myself found it very entertaining. Games combat system is okay. Little repeating but what game doesn`t have kinda like repeating combat. The repeating is like tried to fix by adding multiple different enemy types, unique combat having bosses etc. Games combat can be a little glitchy at times. Sometimes enemy teleports to a different location, you cant hit critical strikes or enemy dies and dissappears or just dies and looks still to be alive. (All lags I remember to have experienced are on private multiplayer match). Overall game is great it is fun to play on co-op and without co-op. Storyline in`t the best but you dont have to follow everything. Main goal is just to beat up Agandaur thats it. I will rate this on scale 1-5 to 3.5/5.			"

												This is a fantastic, old fashioned, co-op quest game. If you're looking for something fun to do with a friend, this just might be the game for you. Because it is a little old, there are some bugs. For instance, my friend had trouble with it crashing on his computer after a few minutes because of a graphics application for touch-screen computers, but once he looked through some forums, he found a way to fix it. The graphics in general are not the best (I have several screen-shots of floating trolls XD), but the fun story and mechanics more than make up for it. This is definitely a game to play for the experience and fun, not really for the high quality visuals. I loved every minute of this game, and I will more than likely play through it again in the future.			"

												Two years after release, Lord of the Rings: War in the North is on sale for a very meaty price of $73.99(AUD). It is a sub-par 3-player coop RPG ailed by a number of gamebreaking bugs including connection issues, lack of display and audio options, framerate issues and awful screen-tearing. Dialogue choices have no repercussions - you can threaten or remain passive and nothing will happen, although the 3 classes do somewhat complement each other in combat.  In-game chat is always on (rather, unable to be switched off)- and strangely enough, or 'logically' perhaps, your voice echoes markedly when you step into a cave- actually, they just echo anyway. If the developers thought it would make the game more immersive, newsflash- It's just f****ing annoying. Dare I say it, not even a bucketload of Athelas could fix this lame title, whose gameplay utterly bemuses the casual fan.			"

												This game at first feels a little shallow, but over time it's true colours emerge.  It really feels like a 3d version of Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance 1 and 2, which makes sense as I think some of the same developers were involved.  The combat is fairly good and would most likely be a blast playing with 2 other friends (I've only been playing solo at this point).  This game is well worth the $5 I paid.  I would say it would be worth buying even at $20.I'm very fussy with the games I spend my time on, and I can say that LOTRWITN has been enjoyable and I look forward to playing through the campaign a few more times at different difficulty levels.

												The story of this game plays neatly alongside the Lord of the Rings and it's 3 episodes. I found it interesting how faithful it was even to The Hobbit before & the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the narrative. You'll see. The graphics are of high quality and gameplay is in 3rd person mode. In anticipation for Shadows of Mordor which apparently plays between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, this was a decent filler! The effect of their efforts is negligent on the original Fellowship (Frodo and his partners), BUT, the effect of Frodo's efforts is felt by our trio as he destroys the ring! We have an excuse to emerse ourselves in a Middle-earth game here so WHY NOT! A worthy Lord of the Rings game.Game on.			"

Solo[/b] : the AI is dumb as ♥♥♥♥, the only thing they do good is that they evolve their stuff. I can't finish the game in solo because the AI is too dumb to make the 2 characters use their spells together, the healer never heals, and the dwarf tank never stays attacking the same target, so the ennemies were all at 95% health when the dwarf died :DMulti[/b] : you can't play with 2 friends, one will always get disconnected. There are some guides to make it work but you have to use some third party software like hamachi or something like that. But it's kinda fun when it works. The race exclusive secrets you can find are cool, sometimes you drop nice stuff, and fights can be epic with bosses when you are using your abilities right.

												It took me close to 20 hours to finish this game and I have not played it in co-op mode. The multiplayer lobby is always empty.I cannot with honest heart recommend this game to even to the most hardcore LoTR fans. Let me explain why:This is a console port, one of the worst I have seen yet. The UI is awful and there is no way to remove the annoying overlapping key binds from the screen.I haven’t seen any game more linear than this. Invisible walls everywhere and i mean EVERYWHERE. You can go only in one direction: forward.The combat is extremely boring and repetitive; you will be doing the same moves over and over again in a course of the entire game. The skills (spells? or powers?) are simply laughable.  The only positive thing I can say about this game is related to the story. The point when you meet few of the characters from the original movies is cool. Well it is, until you get to hear them speak - the voiceover wasn’t done by the movie actors, but by some random people.The graphics are bad even on the highest settings, sometimes the game freezes and/or crashes for no reason. There are too many unfixed bugs like floating dead enemies or enemies stuck in walls.I say, don’t waste your time and specially money on this game.			"

												Updated since completion!If you've got a buddy that you want to play this with, and you're both able to drop the $5 while it's on sale, DO IT. I think playing solo isn't terribly fun, but playing with a friend is awesome. The game itself is pretty average, but we're having a blast having it as a cooperative game. It feels a lot like a throwback to some of the PS2 LOTR games that you could play coop, but brought to more modern graphics and other standards.You can see this game is 5 years old, but for the price of $5 on sale, it's great. I may not drop the current regular price of $20 on it, but for the sale price, awesome buy.The story is surprisingly interesting - I wouldn't say it's terribly deep, but I didn't expect it to be nearly as good as it was. You run into a lot of characters from the film and even some characters from the books, as well as many new characters that we've never met. I was expecting everyone in this game to be kind of dull and boring, but the game is more rich than that, thankfully. The gameplay is a little repetitive, but if you're someone that likes hack and slash games with some skills on the side, you'll enjoy this. I definitely did. Tldr: Buy with a buddy, solo will probably be too boring. Surprisingly deep and fun world.			"

I love the combat system,everything in this game is easy to understand and nicely arranged. If you are a fan of LOTR,you will definitely like this game,and even if not,it will still serve you with heaps of fun.			"

The mic issue can be handled with a virtual in line mic [there's a procedure in the forum on this], get two shmoe-er friends, and boom! Crazy 3 player fun!

												Fantastc Game!9/10It is one of the only good Lord Of The Rings Games ive actually played and i had loads of fun singleplayer and co-op.Pros:Great combat system and it flows very well.Good storyline and lots of lore.Nice to be able to switch characters during missions and then not loose out on levels for that character.Graphics were godd for a 2011 game.Very fast loading in no waiting at the load screen for up to 5 minuites. It just loads in almost straight away.Interesting Characts and the option to play each one.Good ranged weapon combat flows well.Love being able to upgrade you're stats and skills.Loved the fact that you could choose you're own path in the final mission.I liked it that when you completed the game it went onto the next difficulty and kept all you're skills and upgrades and all of your inventory. So it was like carrying on the games but restarting (if you know what i mean) and it felt nice not to have to loot up more and more.Cons:Voice actng was not that good and they used the same actor for the two sons of Elrond.Looting. Although you dont have to loot half of the game is spent looting around the maps if you want to be able to have money or good rare items or stones. Looting for me wasnt so bad but it seemed that f you didnt lott you would end up completing the mission with no health pots, coins and other good weapons and armour.The amount of missions were lacked. I completed this game in 9 hours without trying to speed run. It just felt to rushed (the storyline) and it was ruined at the end. It could have had missions interlinking with what was happening with frodo and his felowship.I think they also should have put in a skip all option for dialouge scenes.(when you had to choose what you wanted to say)I am not sure if it was me and my other friend but we experienced major co-op lag. We would only be able to play for an hour before he lagged out and whenever he joined it just lagged him out again.But All around This game was great! I have always loved Lord Of The Rings games and this is a definite must for fans like me!  "

												Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a 3 player co-op God of War like, Diablo style action RPG with a 12 hour campaign, lots of rare loot to find, and a surprisingly enjoyable story. A lot of the time, these types of games just have a story to push you through the levels, but I found myself really liking the characters and caring about what was happening a long the way.The story takes place parallel to the main Lord of the Rings story, where you occasionally cross paths with the Aragorn, Frodo, Gandalf and the rest of the Fellowship, on your way to fight the War in the North against Agandaur, a powerful servant of Sauron. And spiders. Lots of giant spiders.This ended up being one of the best co op games I've ever played and one of the few really good Lord of the Rings games besides Shadows of Mordor. If you're looking for something fun to play with 2 other people or just want a good action RPG, pick it up.			"

												Played the game with a friend, had fun for the whole duration I believe.There are three characters to choose from... To best explain the three choices, think Warrior, Rogue and Mage/Priest (They aren't called these in the game though). You don't have to stick to one character through, you can change after every level if you wish to.The combat is nice, I played the Lore Master (Mage/Priest) most of the time, I liked the skills. You aren't really limited to only ranged attacks though, melee is effective as well.There are some class-specific secrets but we did not replay (yet, maybe in the future, but not for the secrets.. Just to have fun again!)I haven't played it solo but it should still be fun but co-op games are (almost) always more enjoyabled with friends, no?			"

												I DO NOT recommend this game to be play in Co-op mode. You'll be stuck at Barrow's Wight boss fight if you are the joiner and get disconnected from the host after defeating the boss. The host will passed that stage to Rivendell without a problem and be farther ahead. This what happened to me while I was playing Co-op with my cousin. The problem was I could not proceed from there while I went back to single mode. There is a invisible wall that exists during the boss fight that keeps you from running up toward him. The possessed ranger was already dead, but all the sound effects, dialog, and music was going as if I were fighting the boss. It corrupted my saved game. The SOLUTION was I joined someone game who was at Chapter 2 The Barrow-downs and proceed from there to Barrow's Wight boss fight and then to Rivendell. I know it will waste your time, but just hopefully the host won't kick you or leave the game. You'll get disconnect from the cutscene for Rivendell. I joined back to the same host as quickly. Then I exit the host while I was at Rivendell and from there on I was at Chapter 3. Other soulution is to start the game all over in a single mode.This game is fun, but have glitch, and issues when playing in multiplayer mode. Most of the time you'll get disconnected and saying you lost connection from the host.Best to play it in single mode. Just to let you guys know ahead.			"

												Just got through the campaign in nine hours - and that's WITH revisiting some areas to finish a couple of side quests.  That being said, that's how much time you're going to spend on a single play-through.  If you're going to do a run with all three characters, and on both normal and heroic difficulties, you're looking at 50 to 60 hours of semi-original gameplay.  Coop is something I'd like to do sometime.  Maybe that'll add another 20 hours.Have you guys ever played Lord of the Rings: Third Age?  This feels like that game if it were shorter and didn't have turn-based combat.Really quickly, I'm going to give a run-down of what I definitely do and do not like - spoilers ahead.I liked the world: The devs of this game did an absolutely outstanding job of creating their world, however stunted it may be in certain areas.  Rivendell and Nordinbad were good examples due to how outstanding the architecture was, but the best area for me was the Barrow-downs.  They NAILED the atmosphere for that area, and looking out at all the outstanding crags and jagged rocks planted in the rolling green hills gave me chills.  Inside Gundabad was epic as well, being able to look across the void and see all these different things going on.  I like the weapon system: There are a bunch of weapons in the game: hand-axes, battleaxes, short swords, long swords, hammers, staffs.  You can dual-wield one-handed weapons after unlocking a specific perk thing.  While I've only played as the Ranger, there was still a great deal that I could toy with.  It seems to be about finding your style, but there's also moving between dual-wielding and broadsword wielding in order to balance damage and speed.  Also, weapons break down after time and need to be repaired by a forger.Similarly, I like the equipment system:  Giving yourself the best armor while looking for repairs on what's about to break.I like how weapons and equipments can be imbued with properties: You know, stuff like ice damage, fire damage, shock damage.  Boosts to strength, stamina, health, power.  Same kind of gimmick from Skyrim, but executed well here.  Some equipment/weapons do not have slots - others have multiple.   Fun figuring out what to trade off - damage or health?I like the checkpoints: almost every level will have checkpoints where you can sell your loot, buy very basic things like weak armor and potions, and you can return to the last safe area (Bree, Rivendell, Nordinbad).  Good for getting out if you need and dumping inventory.I'm conflicted on the lore.  I like what it tries to do, especially regarding fallen Dunedain cities and Carn Dum and the dwarves, but it comes off as something that these three characters should not be able to rise up against.  Aragorn wants you to defeat Sauron's right hand man, like no big deal champ thanks for the help?  Oh wow check out these sick dwarves taking out the whole of Mt. Gundabad with this awesome secret weapon?  That's literally Deus ex Machina.  I'm conflicted on the combat.  It's monotonous, but the perk(???) system makes it a bit interesting.  Once again, that's not something I've fully explored, but it breaks the monotony of LMB spam and the RMB coup-de-grace.  The only real hate I have is for a Mannish faction that follows Agandaur.  The grunts of this Mannish faction are overpowered.  Their swords extend beyond what their model shows, and they attack FAST.  They do not get knocked back.  Don't expect an easy one-up over these guys.  Spam your special attacks and ranged.  Or the devs can fix these guys, whatever.Can't think of anything else that I really do hate.  As a Tolkien fan who wanted more but knew this wasn't canon at all, I give this a 7/10 because I got it on sale.  Do not get this at full price. "

												Okay, so, I spent an hour writing out a lengthy review of this filled with insight, in depth information, pros, cons, and fully described aspects of the game with no spoilers. Then Steam decided it was going to not going to let my review go through, then proceeded to crash before I could copy what I had written (lesson learned: type out the review in Word or Notepad before copying it here). Because I don't have the energy to write out that lengthy of a review anymore, we're going to shorten what I wrote down to the important aspects of it.Rating 3.5/5-0.5 points for Difficulty scalingThe game has a co-op feature for up to three people. I beat the final boss in less than five minutes on the first try, yet other battles in the game took me an hour because I was playing solo. The game shouldn't punish me for playing solo. I shouldn't need to cover two different sides of a battle with hopeless AI that can't do it for me when solo playing.-0.5 points for Combat/MechanicsI chose to play just the dwarf for the entirety of the game rather than switching in between missions. Perhaps sticking with one character was the wrong choice because the combat is overly repetitive. Once you unlock some of the skills, it becomes a tad more varied, but then quickly goes back to repetitiveness. Atack, attack, dodge roll, attack, skill 123, attack, rinse and repeat. Nothing special. Also, there is no jump but instead a dodge roll, which is fine. However, there are many aspects of the game where the designers definitely made it seem like there was a secret on a ledge, but lo and behold, you can't jump. A few bugs where you can't attack, or can't hit a crate, or can't move around an object were present, but didn't take away from the experience.-0.5 points for MiscellaneousLack of a save function other than visiting a shop or travelling to a different place. And my biggest gripe is the inability to compare weapons when trying to buy something. I shouldn't have to look at my gear, memorize the stats, go into the shop, look at the boots there, realize I forgot the stats of my equipped item, back out, and do it all over again. That is beyond tedious. And the last miscellaneous complaint is the challenge missions. Much like any game like this, there are challenge missions where you have to defeat multiple waves of enemies. Unfortunately, after spending 30 minutes on a challenge mission, you get nothing for beating it other than the experience from killing the monsters. I went through 20 healing pots and didn't get a single reward for my troubles?+1 point for Visuals/Voiceover The game isn't anything spectacular visually (it IS five years old), but it has a certain charm to it and does what it can to honor the world of Middle Earth. The voiceover work was a real great point of interest for me as a voice actor. Most of the voice over was well done with fantastic casting. +1 point for Lore/StoryFor any fans of the books/movies, this game definitely does a good job of immersing you into familiar territory. There will be quite a few familiar faces, and a whole myriad of new ones. There are familiar locations like Rivendell and Bree, and a few new ones like Nordinbad (a Dwarven city). +1 point for Skills/Gear/LevelingThis one was on the fence for me. I was afraid the system was going to be too simple, but it turns out it's rather nice. Leveling up grants three points to be spent in either Strength (melee damage), Stamina (health), Will (mana), or Dexterity (ranged damage). Then you get to put one point in your skill tree. Each character has three active skills you can unlock with respective trees underneath those skills. Unfortunately, each tree has randomly thrown in skills that often don't have anything to do with the skill you unlocked. The gear isn't visually impressive. Finding a new sword won't WOW you visually, but a clear stat difference can be seen when using it in combat. I could go into more detail, but, the entire system is just meh, but I don't have many complaints on it.Overall, the game isn't too bad. The replayability is pretty good because once you beat it on normal mode, you unlock heroic mode where you can play through again but stay the same level so you can unlock more things and get better gear. I would recommend playing it with a friend rather than going solo. tl;dr Not bad. Not good. If you're a fan of LotR, give it a try. Play with a friend.			"

While it certainly lacks polish in some moments like inventory management and NPC interaction, you would want to at least play it through once(I know I want).You may get lucky and miss all the crashing business with this title, but chances are pretty thin, so even on sale this is a questionable purchase.(Can only imagine the frustration from the multiplayer when one of the players gets the crash-out...)

												A fun co-op RPG with a fairly linear story, LotR War in the North is an entertaining game. Don't expect to be blown away by anything in particular with this game, it's just solidly good all around. Not amazing, but good. The 3 playable characters are all fun, but there are only 3. The looting system is decent but the lack of shops bugged me, selling items to a glowing patch of the ground seemed weird and cheap. The combat is responsive, but repetitive. The co-op is alright, but buggy. Do you see where I'm going with this? All in all, the game is fun. If you can grab it on sale or as part of a bundle, do it. If not, you choose.			"

												This game is surprisingly fun, even for someone who is not into the LOTR franchise like me.This game is designed for 3 players, but can easily be played with 2 players aswell. If you are 2 players, I recommend nobody picking the dwarf, since he is too overpowered and you will just be brainlessly stomping through the game with him.However, the game has a few technical flaws. For example, the built-in voice chat is not mutable, and when restarting the game some of your preferences get lost (like the game's audio settings or the arrangement of the items in your inventory). I've seen quite a few other reviews mention alot of crashes and bluescreens, I never experienced such an occurence though.If you can live with a few technical downsides like these, you can have a few great hours with this game. As reference, it took me about 25 hours to complete the game 3 times (once on each difficulty).			"

I wish I had played this game years ago. Going to probably buy it for my family to play it too now. The only thing I think this game could really use is cheaper health potions in the beginning. At around 200 silver a pop, I felt like you had a harder time starting off. But after you get further in, all my money problems are solved and I can blow tons of money on potions and not even feel it. Great game guys! Pick it up today!!			"

												LOTR: War in the North is a fairly straight forward action based rpg, which nevertheless brings on many hours of fun.Plot: the game seeks to expand on Tolkien's Middle Earth by presenting a side story that happens along side the War of the Rings. You get to play as either Eradan the ranger, Andriel the lore-master, or Farin the champion, to thwat the plans of Sauron's commander, Agandaur. While exploring vast landscape from the Shire, to Grey Mountains, and Mirkwood, you get to meet members from the fellowship of the rings, side characters such as Radagast the Brown, and even a mighty dragon. If you've played LOTR: the Third Age, the narrative of this game is fairly similiar.Gameplay: the 3 aspects of a good RPG are present in this game, namely - statpoints, skilltree, and itemization. As there are limited points and inventory space to go around, decisions must be made into how your character is created. While the diversity of types of character is definitely limited, it is enough to keep you entertained for a 20-50hrs long game.Unlike The Third Age, this game is a action based RPG and each 'encounter' with orcs requires some sort of finesse to defeat them. However, the game is not too hard, and it actually becomes easier as you unlock the heroic, and legendary difficulty levels. On the same note, a major flaw in this game is that the difficulty is based on the character you choose *winks* Farin, rather than the level you are playing on. Also, unlocking the 'legendary' difficutly, requires you to complete the game two times on it's fairly short storyline. This may get boring, although the lure of better items, hitting the maximum level, and uncovering all the secrets/collecting all 50 achievements is enough to keep a player going. Quests in this game is fairly one dimensional as most of them cannot be missed as long as you diligently explore the maps and talk to the NPCs. More details shoud be added to the  backstory to make this game more vibrant and interesting. 'Secrets' on the other hand requires some time spent exploring and manipulation of the ever annoying 'game save' mechanics, and this may frustrate players unless they find a guide (which there are surprisingly few online). Lastly, this game UI is clearly based on the console version, and some mechanics such as character movement and inventory management, feels clunky and poorly done up. However, this is not a problem after taking some time getting used to it, although, a PC game controller will certainly improve the experience.Audio/visual: the landscapes and character design are extremely well done for a 2011 game with details such as seeing the weaves in Elrond's shirt, rock patterns in the background, and blood splatter as you chop off the orc's head. While the game's background music and action sounds are vibrant, the voice acting could be better, to add more life to the storyline, and make the hero jouney seems more epic. Together, the atmosphere of the game felt a letdown as the good visuals such as the never ending rain in Bree is not complimented with audio effects to bring about an immersive expierence.Verdict: Overall, War in the North gets more fun as you progress along the difficulty levels, and your character feels truely powerful on the final difficulty level. However, the clunky mechanics, limited depth to the character's development, quests and backstory limits this game from  being an epic RPG. Also the game design restrict it to around 60hrs of gameplay before it gets repetitive. Thus, this game would be a good buy during steam sales as a form of pasttime, but definitely not a must-have, unless you are a Lord of the Rings fan.Disclaimer: this review is written based on solo-play only, and I have yet to encounter any bugs with this game.

												I had this game in wishlist for some time, because I wasn't sure if it is worth full price. So when it was on sale I grabbed it. And I was very pleasantly surprised.  Story isn't ground-breaking creation, I would say decent or average is more accurate. But its strength is in addictive fighting system and LOTR setting, accompanied by beautiful soundtrack. And of course coop mode gives some extra points. Also you will meet some old friends from movies, mainly in Imladris(Rivendell). I wouldn't believe I could spent 55 hours in this game, but it was well spent time.Positive:-LOTR setting-coop mode-talents, secrets, weapons and armors unique to each playable character-fine voice acting-Farin is really OP(in solo play it can be great help, mainly on harder difficulties)Negative:-simple story-Farin is really OP(on the other hand in coop, it can be annoying)I suggest you to wait for some sale and then it is must have.

												Good Story (also they good job with how it ties with the rest of what's going on), Good Music (Inon Zur!), and the gameplay while not amazing has it's gratifying moments (Like the Slow-Mo Finishers).Pros: Good StoryQuality Voice-ActingGood Music by Inon Zur (Who also composed for Dragon Age and such)Gameplay is neither too hard or too easy (by the end I had to do some potion jugging but not to the point of binging like some RPGS)Cons: Swapping Characters is practically like playing a new game, some of the gear resets so it's best to play with the character you started with, which when you go back to the character you begun with the characters have the high-level gear you put on them prior to the swap on again.Would be nice to have an actual Map of the Area instead of just the one that shows the places you can Travel to.That's pretty much my two cents.

												I really wanted to like this game. I was beyond excited to see a co-op LOTR game, and I snatched it up for friends and family. I started playing and enjoyed the story and loved the characters. I was even willing to overlook the black hole that your companions cary (NEVER give your companions anything, you must equip manually or risk loosing it forever).  I was eager to join in on campaigns with my BF, and just let the game absorb my soul.So what went wrong...well the inability to play after a certain point. For some reason a few chapters in, the game just freezes and crashes. I have tried everything I could find in the forums, I did everything I could think of. Months went by with me loosing faith in a game I was enjoying. Now the only fix I have is to uninstall the game and resentfully look at it in my LIbrary. I also feel a bit guilty for buying such a glitched game for everyone.			"

												As an avid LOTR fan, I can say I'm awfully disappointed with this horrendous turd of a game. Since there aren't any PROs, I'll just go ahead and list the CONs.- Pointless story which is completely irrelevant to the LOTR movies/books.- Terrible gameplay. To sum it up in one word: REPETITIVE. Expect to grind through the same mobs of enemies and reused bosses for the 10 hour length of the game.- Awful dialogue and voice acting. Hearing the same cheesy one-liners from the characters over and over again drove me crazy.- The graphics for this game are totally outdated; even for a game that was released in 2011. (Playing on ultra settings, I saw no difference between the visuals in this game and the visuals in LOTR: Return of the King on the ♥♥♥♥ing Gamecube.)- Bad UI and inventory management. This makes the process of navigating menu's and matchmaking incredibly painful.- Poor level design. Each chapter is basically a rinse-and-repeat. (Field, Cave, Building. THIS x INFINITE.)Unfixed Problems/Bugs/Glitches:- InGame mic voice chat. It allows players' mics to constantly be open and there's no way to disable it. (A complete bummer for some people that use external VOIP software such as TeamSpeak or Ventrilo.)- Black screens and game crashes. Expect to replay entire segments of the game because of this. (These issues are even worse for AMD users.)- Issues with savedata.This game seems nothing more than a cash-grab and is a complete disappointment for true LOTR fans.Please save your money. Don't buy this game. "

												Played it for almost 100h on different accounts now. The game is quite simple actually, but you can get a lot out of that simplicity. ** Basics- Three different characters (Ranger, Dwarf, Elf) - Direct movement (WASD/Left Stick), direct aiming (Mouse/Right Stick)- Always all three characters in play. Coop or NPCs. (Many people have technical probs with coop. You might want to check that out.)- Different levels with multiple Zones (Mirkwood part1/2 ...)You enter at one point, exit at another one and destroy everything that moves on your way. - Grab the loot! Obviously!- Enter different towns between the zones. Sell/Buy/Repair/Get Quests. - Unlimited free travel to replay visited locations. (However the many boss mobs are not thereif you revisit a location.)** Visuals- Not high level for current gen, but it looks decent. - Sets and Landscapes are very well designed. Some areas felt like walking through the cover of a classic fantasy book. ** RPG- No real character based roleplaying. You can choose between a few conversation alternatives. But you cannot change the NPCs or your characters or the story in any meaningful way. It is about as linear as Diablo.- Very small number of town based quest. Almost all quest are about gathering loot during the fights.  ** Fighting- Hack&Slash + Ranged Shooting. You will be using both and it is quite fun. - Dwarf and Ranger use crossbows and bows, Elf uses magic bolts. - Some meele weapons are also class character exclusive. - Basic combo slashing ""AAA"", get a note for a critical attack, ""B"", knockdown/kill. - You fight smaller groups along the way and bigger mobs/bosses in arena type areas. ** Skills- Specific skill tree for all three characters. Kind of similar but the trees help to enhancedifferent playstiles or at least different feel. - Each skill matters but might be less usefull depending on your build. - Respec token available, so don't worry. ** Leveling- Level 40 is max. - Level 20 is roughly what you get after a first playthrough. - Unlimited playthroughs. Difficulty raises up to 'legendary'.- Attribute points are more important for equipment requirements than stat changes. ** Some Notes- Don't go for that one ultimate item set. At least not until you approach legendary. You will grow out of items a lot. Use that to have fun and replace them many times. Use your elfstones, try different weapons. In the next playthrough you will laugh about the stats of the former one. - Helpful item boni change over time. In the beginning you want more armor, more health, more coints etc to not die. In the end you want damage multipliers and cooldown reduction to get through those puny orks fast. - A single item with x5 coins can remove all your money worries. - Rare items are rare! You need quite a few playthroughs to get the 'perfect' equipment.You will be finishing the game with eyes closed by that time. - Your item inventory is large. Keep alterantive weapons for different situations. - Use mirrors to customize your appearance. Made the characters a lot more likeable to me. - Switch between characters if you cannot finish some area (should not be the case) or maybe a quest requires a certain character. *wink*- Don't stress yourself over lost items/opportunities etc. You can replay as many times as you like. Just carry on. - Special boni carry over from weapons to special moves. A good reason to go for dual wielding. ** Suggestions- Dwarf is considered the most powerful character. He has a broken overpowered ranged attackthat takes the whole challenge out of the game. Spare the dwarf for later, if you are interested in the other characters too. Its hard to fight big mobs and strong bosses with an axe, if you can one-shot them anyway. - Ranger is the most 'dull' (and kinda dumb looking) character. But if you want to play a sword and bow fighter, you can have a lot of fun with that guy. Ranger is a good start for a first playthrough and does not suffer from game ending op attacks. - Elf is primarily written as healer/supporter for the other two. You become the nanny for them when you play the elf. Makes the fights different and more rewarding. ** Elf tips- You are the NPC healer. But as a player you have to look after the other guys. That can be very frustrating when you play with two NPCs for dwarf and ranger. Make it your challenge to keep those little dummies alive. - When one NPC dies, the other one instantly tries to revive them. Even if they run into a mob and get killed instantly. After that you are the only target left and have the mob all to yourself. And not time to revive your buddies. Annyoing, but also challenging and a great reason to curse those stupid NPCs!!- Yes you DO need dexterity for your magic missiles damage. But all characters get high ranged damage without dexterity anyway. Attributes don't effect damage output that much. Focus on meeting item requirements. - A very rewarding build is to go for the Elfs AoE attack. A nova/splash attack that can later take out entire mobs of the strongest enemies. No Dex needed. Not much power (mana) upgrade needed.- Ranged attacks have a high mana cost and don't profit from casting cost reduction. - Elemental attacks and other modifiers take over from melee weapons to AoE attack. - Collect the ingredients for potions and USE them. Your inventory will be full with that stuff, so at least drink it.  - You can build an AoE based Elf that kills almost any enemy with a single splash attack and does rarely need a potion for health/mana at all. VERY rewarding after all the babysitting. - There is one boss towards the end that your gf might find very disgusting. ;)""She"" drops a staff sometimes. Take a good look at that one and think about dual wielding and some quest rewards you might have collected...			"

												Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a great game, following the story of the original Lord of the Rings series by J.R.R. Tolkien, yet providing an alternate part of the story. Here you control one of the 3 heroes from the legendary races, Dunedain ( Human ) , Elf and Dwarf. Talking about graphics, this game is pretty good considering it's from 2011 and uses the Dark Alliance Engine, which I find extraordinary for a hack-and-slash game like this. This game earns his name as an RPG, having many characters to talk to and having enough side quests to make the story not seem linear. As for battle mechanics, this game does pretty well. Fast paced action and fast responce allows the player to make extraordinary combos. To top it off, there is the ""Hero Mode"", which activates after a critical hit has been made. This allows the player to inflict massive quantities of damage, provided that he can hit constantly and elude the blows of enemies, most of which you knock you down or stagger you for just enough time for you to lose your combo.The game lacks a bit if it is to be compared to Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, with less to barely any combos, which made the first title so enjoyable. Yet the second title compensates with alot of loot, sprinkled with that I believe to be legendary weapons, some even imbued with fire.Other factors to keep in mind are multiplayer and replayability. The game seems to have extraordinary capabilities for co-op support, even non-LAN-based, which LotR:RotK lacked, yet I haven't had the opportunity to try it. As for replayability, this game seems to have 3 difficulties : Normal, Hero and Legendary. Considering that you can combine different classes with your friends to make the perfect team, where each player can chooses the character best suited for him, I'd say that you can defilitely replay this game.

Hard to find games like this that has co-op. Story rich game, and fun combats.

												Definitely a worthwhile play.  If you're an RPGer that likes a little co-op play then this is perfect.  THe storyline keeps you wanting to know more while the combat and gear machanics are interesting enough to warrant a little exploration.  A little short for my tastes, but I'm also an old fashioned RPGer so I typically expect 70+ hours out of my games.  I'd say you can finish this entire storyline in about 5 hours.			"

												For the most part, War in the North delivers a satisfying romp through Middle Earth. It looks good, sounds good, and you get to explore a few really interesting places and meet some fun characters in search of random loot. In a rare stroke of ambition for a Lord of the Rings game, you're also presented with an original story rather than going on the adventures of Frodo & Co. for the umpteenth time. Some parts get more than a little fanfiction-y, and combat isn't as fluid as it needs to be, but even in areas where the game has glaring flaws, you manage to have just enough fun to overlook those shortcomings.

												Overall, it's your standard beat 'em up hack and slash, but it's got a great amount of LOTR flavor thrown into it.  You can chose between three rolls, a human ranger, a elven mage, or a dwarf warrior, giving you a fair bit of variance between how exactly you kill Orcs and Uruk-hai (and a lot more.)  The maps are quite a great sight seeing experience with a large bit of map interactivity, rarely leaving the feeling of playing the same thing.The setting itself is just so perfect for a video game, leaving you to follow your own unique LOTR story while maintaining everything which has already been made.  It truly casts you into the line of your favorite story hero, even during the co-op experience.  Which leads to the games greatest feature - Co-Op.War in the North is AMAZING in co-op.  The game was seemingly made for it from the ground up.  If you're looking for a hack and slash co-op game, this might just be the one for you.Similar games:  Warhammer 40k: Space Marine, Fable 3, Batman series, Darksiders series, Brutal Legend, Witcher 2.

												8.7/10 LOTR: War in the North sheds a whole different light on the story.This game has got to be my favorite LOTR game (Haven't played Shadow of Mordor, thats next :p). What is really cool about this game is it doesn't just retell the story of the fellowship but rather a group of three with a quest equally as important. You do get to see all the characters from the movies at one point but the main focus is on your group. One thing that is rather strange is that everyone you meet is always saying how this story should be written down, but I guess that was to stress the importance of your mission. The combat in this game felt kinda dull, while you had a range of abilities you run into enemies that are just copies of each other but with different skins and greater stats. So once you master how to defeat a troll you shouldn't have a problem again. When you play singleplayer your two companions aren't really helpful for anything but reviving you. They will keep guys occupied but have no finishing capabilites. You find at the end of the mission you did 3/4 of all the damage dealt. Overall this game was a lot of fun. The side quests aren't too interesting but the main questline is where everything comes alive. If you have yet to, pick up this game and give it a shot.			"

												Cool co-op : 3 player mode. You can try to play alone but it's way fun in 3 ( some levels are too hard to solo).Nice settings, lore rich so those with a hard-on for R.R. Tolkiens LOTR and The Hobbit will see familiar faces and get some cool insight. So even if this is a 3rd person LOTR hack and slash, expect dialogue ( skippable, OFC) . Combat is interesting as you are not heavely restricted to a fighting style: you can go headfirst to melee a troll with the Mage ( see what happens :P ) but encouraged to follow the classes. Nice loot and high replay value.AMD users: do not buy! this game si poorly optimised for AMD VGA and constant crashes will plage your experience.

												I bought this game because of the co-op and because there aren't many RPG-Action Co-Ops out there. It seemed like a great opportunity to play my favourite game genre with my friend. And it might be a decent experience, if you get around the bugs, some of which might force you into restart.My rating without the bugs is 7/10. My rating with bugs is 4/10. I would not recommend this game for its full price, but with discount and some friends to play with, you might give it a try.PROS:Apart from being a co-op game there really isn't any other positive outstanding feature in this game, because as an Action-RPG game it provides only a mediocre gameplay experience and boring dialogues.CONS:-Pour graphics even for 2011. Compared to Witcher 2, which was released in the same year, LoR: War in the North is something from Stone Age.-Simple battle system: just fast attack and strong attack, blocking and few skills. There are no combos and, if you are patient enough, you can just hold block and attack simultaneously, without taking any damage (apart from ranged attacks)-Confusing crafting system, unless you learn the names of all the plants and components, it's hard to understand what will be the result of your crafting.- There is no push-to-talk, you are forced to listen to all the background noise from your gaming buddy's microphone.-If you finish a quest, you can return to complete it again. I can't understand whether it's meant to be like that or it's a bug. Either way it doesn't help you to understand what to do next.- No mini-map. It's a big problem in Burrow-downs cave system and Forest for apparent reasons.- Bad camera work – does not always follow the character.- BUGS!!!1. Some quests get stuck. No solution. Restart the game or change the host (if co-op).2. Completed quests revert back ""in progress"", if you return to the same area.3. Some enemies (bosses), which should spawn, do no appear.4. Sometimes it's not possible to revive your allies. Normally it's possible.5. I started to play this game with my friend. But on our second co-op session this game told me that he has progressed further than me and that I will not be able to get achievements and to save my progress. However none of us had played the game in single-player mode after the previous session, so we were on the same line.6. Graphical glitches.			"

												I recommend this game if you run an Nvidia card. It was never designed with AMD cards in mind and it shows. Frequent CTDs and driver crashes, even after turning all the effects and detail off. Game may not work if you run Windows 10 without verifying cache and re-downloading the runtime stuff again.

												Another game which shows how action RPG should look like. Maybe it haven't got open world, what is important in that kind of games, but i don't really care about it. It is good product and i'm planning to finish this game soon.For now, i'm giving it 7,5/10. It's not best RPG i played, but it's addictive.			"

												Great hack and slash game with coop up to 3 players total. The graphics are a bit sketchy, you'll run into some clipping, and you may encounter some glitches which stops you from completing side quests. Also, you cannot mute your coop partners voice (mic) or use push to talk. You and your whole team will be speaking freely, so dont fart, cough, spit, puke or crunch loudly or you may annoy your team lol. There is a workaround for this that worked for my friend, but it did not work for me. I got this game for a great price and it was well worth it.			"

												Dear fellow gamerAfter just 17 hours me and my friend finished a single playthrough of the game in co-op. We discovered something: this game is a must in co-op! We had loads of fun and we were frustrated more than once when we couldn’t kill a boss or troll. But in the end we got through and concluded that this game is more than awesome!! On the other hand we were let down by the final battle, which was simply tooooooo easy, since we had more difficulty defeating the first boss in the game. THE STORY: We were pleasantly surprised by the fact that the story is interwoven with the actual storyline of LOTR. You even come across characters as Aragorn, Gandalf, Lord Elrond, Legolas and Gloin (known from the Hobbit-trilogy) and even Frodo and Bilbo Baggins. You follow three companions (Eradan, Andriel and Farin) on their quest to defeat a minion of the dark lord Sauron. On their way they make several friends and stops in the north of Middle Earth.GRAPHICS: Not bad at all for a game that is already 4 years old. We saw a fair amount of detail on armours, buildings and the like and didn’t realise we were playing such an old game.INTERFACE: Convenient use of hotkeys and a useful minimap! The inventory was a little off, since you had very limited space and images for additional and trivial objects in the world of Middle Earth.GAMEPLAY: We found it very useful that you could see the name of your friends on screen even if they were in an entirely different place/room. A very useful feature of the game is that you have the option to exchange items with other players that are only suitable for that particular race. Conveniently enough there were several sell/buy/return to civilisation-points.- For the Ranger: Very smooth movement of the character during a fight and one of the current reviewers enjoyed the swordplay a little too much at times. We liked the convenient switch between two-handed, one-handed, dual wielding and bow very useful. And, contrary to some other RPG’s,  the realism of being attacked whilst you are looting or switching weapons was very satisfactory to us! We loved the critical, brutal, legendary, etc. strikes with the swords and headshots with the bow too. They lead to some pretty funny ways of dying! We would’ve loved an alternative attack with hotkey ‘2’ while using a two-handed sort, but that could just be because we didn’t unlock every skill in the skill tree. Conclusion; Eradan was a great ranger.- For the Lore-master: Andriel has some great abilities to use in combat, as a supportive mage. For example, she can conjure a magical shield that can protect you against arrows and magical blasts. She also can use her staff as a melee weapon, that is actually quite strong. Because of her Elven ancestry, Andriel can use herbs to fabricate potions to support herself or her companions. This can be decisive at some points in the game.- For the Champion: Not applicable (yet), but Farin is awesome!! He got us out of trouble more than once…more like a thousand times…LOL. ALSO FUN;	- You can use your Eagle friend to do all the heavy work for you.	- You meet a dragon; Which seems to be very popular amongst gamers.	- Turrets!Overall conclusion: 'The Lord of the Rings - War in the North' is a must have if you are a fan of the LOTR, RPG and/or co-op gaming, with a bit of hack & slash in it. We had hours and hours of fun (and yet more to come) and we didn't get bored with the storyline once, even though all those trolls were a pain. Me and my friend decided that we definitely are going to play this game a few times each year... *Totally not addicted*Enjoy the game!			"

												This game is definitely one of my favourites that I own. It isn't exactly amazing, but it isn't bad at all. The story is pretty good, nothing too exciting however. You don't really get any sort of connection with the characters. You're kinda just an elf, dwarf and a human who are tossed together, it feels. Throughout the game you get to visit places such as Fornost, the Barrow-downs, Rivendell and even Carn Dum, the capitol of the old Angmar empire. As far as pros go, the story is alright, and you can tell the devs did put a bit of research into things. There's a few nice name drops here and there as well. The soundtrack is pretty good, and none of the levels are exactly impossible, though in some cases it can get that way pretty easily. Combat is alright, consists mainly of LMB for light attacks and RMB for heavier attacks, or a critical attack when the enemy has a yellow arrow over their head. You also have 3 abilities for melee and 3 for ranged, used with the 1, 2 and 3 buttons. You also have a handy eagle to call with the fourth. Combat isn't exactly amazing however, I'll admit, though it's pretty simple to get the hang of. Isn't slippery or hard to adapt to whatsoever. You and your companions are, in a way, tied in with that of the Fellowship, and several things that occur in the movies happen because of things you did, which is pretty neat.Now to the cons. This game is pretty well known to have a LOT of bugs. There's a few quests in particular that are very buggy, and you can easily screw yourself over with them. If you're focusing on whether this is canon, I've seen mostly people saying that it is not canon. The achievements aren't very bad at all, either, though the ""strength of our alliance"" achievement is extremely tedious to get in my experience, and is very buggy as well. There is a lot of issues when it comes to balance. As Farin, the dwarf, unlocking the explosive bolt can do up to 150k damage from what I've seen personally. Which can instant-kill trolls and usually 2-3 shot a boss. Took around 8 shots or so to kill the final boss with it. Now, what I said earlier about the levels sometimes being crazy hard comes down to you. If you run out of health potions, you do NOT have the option to save manually. So, if you go into a level, run out of potions and can't leave (example being a later stage of Nordinbad) you're pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed, and you have to do it on your own. Ended up doing this myself and trying to do it with no health potions, which isn't too easy. To 100% complete the game there's a minimum of 3 playthroughs to get the achievement for beating the Legendary mode. This is a little bit of a con as well, in that there isn't really any sense of a challenge. Mobs do a little more damage and take some more as well, but it never really is an issue.Now, be warned, two levels in particular, the Barrow-downs and Carn Dum are very well known for crashing computers. I run the game flawlessly on ultra settings, but I crash constantly in these spots. I read that it has something to do with AMD drivers or something along the lines, but I don't know much about that. Just be warned that it does have some crashing issues.In the end, the game is pretty good, has a good bit of replayability, it isn't boring or stretched thin, and it's pretty well rounded. It does have a lot of bugs and isn't the greatest with balance in the second and third playthroughs, (being in your favour as opposed to being in the enemy's favour) but there isn't really any game breaking issues. The community isn't too lively, though if you really want the one online achievement, you only need to post in the forums of the game that you want help and people flock to it. I believe the game has a built in system that causes open mics constantly, which is EXTREMELY annoying when you're an English speaking man, but get stuck with a very angry spanish child being scolded by his father while a Russian laughs and calls him a ♥♥♥♥♥ for it. It isn't amazing, but it isn't bad at all. I personally really like the game, it has a great feeling to it, and it's nice to be able to have a good lotr game. Be warned that the voices of the few fellowship members you meet are not the same as the movies, so don't get too hype thinking they'll make a cameo. I'd definitely recommend this game. I'd give it an 8/10, only lacking the two points for the crashing issues, lack of a challenge in the later levels, and balance issues that break whatever challenge would have been from the Heroic and Legendary difficulties. (Probably worth mentioning you have NO interaction with Mordor, Sauron, Isenguard or anything of the such. You have your own quest that you and your companions are going on dealing with the North. Don't go in expecting to see the black gates.)			"

												Spent hours upon hours of my life playing this outside of Steam when I was younger.I beat the game several times on each difficulty, and then started all over again. Awesome game with a very complementing atmosphere, crisp visuals, three great protagonists, and gruesome combat.Unfortunately, LOTR: WITN is rather linear and only has an illusion of being 'open world'.Still I HIGHLY recommend it, and for the sales price of $4.99, it's definitely worth it.

LORD OF THE RINGS: WAR IN THE NORTH
REVIEWYes, this is yet another adaptation from Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings novel trilogy, one of the best fantasy book series of all time. It also uses characters-model from the movies...but...it's a totally different story. Kind of. In the south, war breaks between the Dark Lord Sauron and the free people of Middle Earth, as shown in the movies/books. But the game shows a ""hidden"" story: a fellowship composed of Eradan, a Dunedáin (man), Farin, a dwarf and Andriel, a she-elf. They too, embark in a journey to fight for the north of Middle Earth, at the same time of the LOTR trilogy battles in the south. It's an interesting idea and the plot develops really well. With the presence of beloved characters that will make a LOTR fan smile, a decent villain and some good character development for Beleram, an Eagle that helps in the journey, i liked the story. The ending is also epic and amazing with a challenging boss fight. Talking about boss fights, the game have a lot of them and they're all pretty good. The game is challenging even in the lowest difficult (normal) because of tough enemeis in high quantities. Sometimes is frustrating because of your companions AI when you die in combat, but it's pretty rewarding, as this game is about loot and there is a lot of it. You can choose one of the three characters to play, and all of them have unique skills to upgrade and purchase, that's real nice. Also they have unique abilities and usable weapons, making the variation of playing with each one of them unique. You can even play online, whick makes the game a lot more enjoyable. But while playing offline, the companions AI is pretty bad, and sometimes you die just because they messed up while trying to ressurect you. It's frustrating. The graphics are outdated, and the facial animations are bad, but the scenarios are really awesome. The combat is very cool with all aplicable skills and upgrades, use of potions and weapons, inclding ranged weapons. But it gets too repetitive. The whole game is a bit repetitive, there is no puzzles, just go and kill a thousand enemies, proceed, then do it again. It may have RPG elements, but it's pretty linear besides the fact you can travel to some places, and challenge maps in scenarios from LOTR trilogy. There is dialog system too, which have zero impact on the story and only serves to know more about events/begin side quests. There is some side quests and some of them are decent, but there is only a few. The soundtrack, as expected, is awesome and have some beautiful melodies and epic combat tracks. You can call for Beleram support, which is awesome and helps a lot. The game length is good for an action game and you can replay in higher levels of difficult with the same weapons and equipment (there is armor and other stuff in good quantity). Kind of new game+, adding replay value because you can use other characters. You can swap characters during the campaign by only going back to menu or at certain points, and giving them items mean nothing, they don't use them and you should switch at least one time to up their skills and equip the loot they found because those dumbasses don't do anything alone. The game have some bugs too, as usual.+Replayability+Boss Battles+Epic ending+Decent plot+Beautiful scenarios+Lots of weapons, armors, skills, upgrades+Secrets and loot +Good characters+Absolutely epic ending sequence and boss fight+A few sidequests+LOTR Trilogy characters! +Lots of enemies types+Challenging and cool combat+Epic soundtrack+Unique characters skills, weapons +Challenge maps +Co-op+Eagle support-Some bugs-Stupid and bad AI-Outdated graphics and poor facial animations -Very repetitive-Horrid UI-Dialog does not impact nothing in the story-Very linear-Sometimes frustrating -Boring sometimesA decent Middle-Earth tale with some good inspiration on it, but nothing impressive. 7,5/10 "

												It’s sadly just a very generic game. Every aspect of the game screams mediocrity from the story and characters to its unbelievably basic hack and slash gameplay. The dialogue and voice acting is very poor, I ended up skipping most of the conversations it was too boring to sit through. The writing in this game is absolutely awful, it comes a across like someone who is still learning English wrote it. They had the opportunity to tell an original story in the Tolkien world and they completely wasted it by making the plot very by the numbers and bland. It’s the gameplay that kills this game for me, I couldn’t stand how basic and repetitive the whole experience was. I had to eventually mute the game and listen to youtube videos in the background just to get through the game. The game also has this low budget feel to it, like all the animations all feel very stiff for example. The lack of variety in the level design and the environments also make the game a massive chore to play through. The very basic rpg mechanics save it from being awful but it’s not enough to save it from being a bad game.3/10 (Bad)			"

This simple bug can be fixed with In-Game Voice Chat On/OFF options but developers seems to be caring less about audience than they care about a fruitfly.Other parts of game is above average, you might expect to pay 5 to 10 dollars on discount and enjoy a good multi- NO you can't because you will hear achoes all the time and game is designed to be played multiplayer so this game is worths nothing.

												Let me describe the experience of attempting to play this crappy port of what maybe could be a good game, but I couldn't tell you because i've never been able to play it. It starts off with you loading up and inviting your friends, while you are using your 3rd party chat server, you have now discovered that voice chat is forced, and there is no way to change any of the settings in game to eliminate it. Not to mention the steam voice option is just terrible in general. After you decide that, hey we will just use keyboard to chat in game, after wasting hours of time trying to fix the voice feature. Trying to join up with friends is awful, you can connect and stay in the lobby and load up the game, but once you are in game, it kicks someone randomly. Why is it that we can play so many games flawlessly and yet this game has such issues? It's because they pushed out a port of this as quick as they could, and then never patched anything, They couldn't even be bothered to put an option for disabling the chat feature.I'm so disgusted and now i'm out of hard earned money, not to mention my time that I spent trying to troubleshoot this awful game into working. I spent my entire weekend trying to get this game working being optimistic and hopeful. It's not worth it. Just stay away, go get it on whatever console that it was intended for, maybe that version will work better, but I would definitly research that carefully as well.TL;DR Version: The game is buggy and unplayable, touts a multiplayer style of gameplay that doesn't work, and doesn't allow you to disable or change any microphone settings that are very terrible. Stay away from this game at all costs.			"

												This is an ok game. Very interesting to see another side of the LotR universe, but it gets pretty bland honestly. But the reason I can't recommend it is simply because if you own a Radeon card, be prepared for much frustration. The game is so unoptimized for these cards that it becomes practically unplayable. Two whole chapters require workarounds just to make the game playable. If you don't heed this warning and try the game anyways, be prepared for a lot of crashing, blue screen and every other error under the sun.			"

												An absolutely wonderful game. Then why the negative review? Let's see:Pros: -great story ( the action happens in the same time with the fellowship of the ring)-you can co-op through the campaign with 2 other friends-you have multiple builds for your character with various spells, armours, enchantments etc.-a handful of sidequests-quite easy to get 100% of the achievements.-when you finish a difficulty, you can advance to the next one with all of your gear, coins, and your current level ( Diablo stuff)Cons:-well, if you are an AMD graphic card user, good luck playing the game! Since the release of the game (2011) it's almost impossible for you to play the game. I have an HD 8850M which is more than enough for this, but it's so poorly optimised, that you will get stuttering every 2 minutes and the game will crash every 10 minutes. Fortunatelly I have a 4th generation i7 and I was able to play the game on the integrated graphic card which struggled a little on medium settings, but the game was playable.-this game has the most  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice chat I've ever seen since I play multiplayer video games. If you join a lobby with your friends or any random person, the game will activate your microphone all the freaking time! It's almost impossible to stop it. How is it possible for someone to release in 2011 a game in which you can't deactivate the voice chat?After many tries, I finally managed to get rid of it.All-in-all this is a great game, I would say it is very underrated and it is perfect if you don't have much time to spend on, as the campaign can be finished in 8-10 hours, but unfortunatelly, the voice chat and the AMD graphic cards problem have a huge impact on it and I'm really sorry but I can't recommend it.

												Been ages since I've last played a Lord of the rings game and this one sure is one of the best. Alright where to start? Well the fighting mechanics is really good, except when you fight the enemies it will get repetitive. The game has a nice leveling system, especially for newbie players new to the rpg world. Almost all the boss battles feel the same. In single-player you can only choose one character at a time, you can only change at the end of a level. Co-op is very fun, especially with the right group of friends! Graphics are very nice and don't need a lot to run for a good gaming PC/Laptop.My rating for this game: 6/10			"

Also, the game saves automatically if you're at a safe location.  I kept looking for how to save.  Now I have to figure out how to swap characters easier.  Fun game with a good story.

It is fun, frantic, gory and has a wide range of enemies for you to hack and slash your way through.Graphics for the time of release (2011) are above average, in my opinion.Unique Areas that are not in 'The Hobbit' or 'The Lord of the Rings' gives this game more appeal and a nice fresh quality to it.Definately worth a play through, the game is on the short side but with Heroic and Legendary difficulties to play through and a nice amount of side quests, this is worth the money you put into it.I would personally give it an 80-84 myself.

												One the the best Lord of the Rings games I have played! The graphics are VERY well done the story is great. I love how your story takes place as Frodo and the fellowship travel to destroy the ring, so you are  a silent helper for their cause by doing things to lesson the threat of Sauron in the north. Definitely recomend this game, it is absolutely fantasic and worth every penny (not to mention the music is beautiful and sets the mood wherever you are). Double thumbs up!!!! :)			"

												Been ages since I've last played a Lord of the rings game and this one sure is one of the best. Alright where to start? Well the fighting mechanics is really good, except when you fight the enemies it will get repetitive. The game has a nice leveling system, especially for newbie players new to the rpg world. Almost all the boss battles feel the same. In single-player you can only choose one character at a time, you can only change at the end of a level. Co-op is very fun, especially with the right group of friends! Graphics are very nice and don't need a lot to run for a good gaming PC/Laptop.My rating for this game: 6/10			"

												First off when I started playing this game i was expecting more of an open world style, and i was surprised just what consisted of this game at hand. The style of game play was enjoyable, it had a classic/RPG style. The world was more like a path way that you keep on moving by to get the next part, with some hard boss battles but if you get stuck all you have to do is join someones game online and then simply play with them till you level up, which in turn allows you to progress. I found the voice acting a little poor, the graphics are decent and would run on a budget pc grand. the online co-op was great fun. all in all I am glad i purchsed this game. story line 7/10voice acting 6/10features in equipment and upgrades 8/10 * quite like an RPG game in the sense of wepons and abilltys abilitys 8/10overall 7.5/10			"

												I originally gave this game a negative review. However, after putting some more time into it, I feel that if you get this game on a heafty discout (as I did), you will definitely feel satisfied after the experience. However, I highly recommend you only buy this game if you either a) plan to play with friends, or b) have a high tolerance for frustrating games (see below).Here are a few things I think you should be aware of before you purcahse this game:- The UI is terrible. It is cleary optimized for console/controller use. Even then, it's full of nonsense. Also, be aware of the fact that unless you're using a Microsoft Xbox360 controller, you'll run into problems (I have a Steelseries 3GC, a PDP Afterglow Xbox360 controller, and a MS Xbox360 controller).- The AI is stupid. Your AI teammates are of little help, and tend to get in your way. If you play as the Loremaster, you'll spend a fair amount of time trying to heal them. If you play as one of the other two classes, you'll find you're doing most of the work yourself and reviving your AI teammates often.- The interface is terrible. The Keymapping makes little sense, is not customizable and is frustrating when dealing with 'Skill 4' and summoning Eagles (they're mapped to the same key and I have not found a way to change that).- The inventory system is a nightmare. Your inventory is only accessable on your current character, meaning you cannot equip your AI teammates. The AI is left to auto equip whatever inventory you're not currently using and thus makes managing it quite difficult. In multiplayer, some traded items would just disappear.- You cannot switch characters in game. This makes it a chore to keep your teammates up-to-date with stats. Often you'll find yourself three levels ahead of your teammates in terms of equipped skills before you get the chance to sort them out.- The save system is out dated. It's based off of a checkpoint system which is poorly thought out.- Finally, this game is poorly optimized. It is filled with bugs that may not be game breaking, but are certaintly frustrating and annoying. Including a particular graphic bug which causes a transparent white flashing throughout and entire level. I could not find a solution for this problem, and after searching the internet, I can confirm it is not my graphics card as many are plagued with the problem.In the end, if you can get this game on a great sale and have a craving to play a Lord of the Rings themed video game - and you're willing to tolerate some frustration - this is worth it. I would also suggest Lego: Lord of the Rings. The voice acting and music comes straight from the three movies; it's very well done.As a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's works, I think it is worth it to mention that this follows Peter Jackson's movie version, sadly. Although, it is to be expected from a WB published game.			"

												The War in the North is a simplistic co-op RPG that'll have you hacking and slashing your way to Carn Dûm. The pathing and story are linear, but if enjoy the lore from the series and like teaming up with your friends against bands of Sauron's army then War in the North should not be passed up. The only questionable aspect of the game is the pricing and value so you might want to catch a good sale for this particular item since its gameplay is limited.			"

												If you are a fan of Middle-Earth, then you must play this game. This game does a phenomenal job of being true to the Tolkien's writings. The 3 main characters aren't found in any of Tolkien's tales but all the supporting characters are more than fimiliar faces. Many times you will talk to NPCs and they will make refrence to events in The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and even The Silmarillion. If you have absolutely no interest in the Lord of the RIngs, then this is still a fun game, but don't excpect quality on the level of Dragon Age or The Witcher.			"

												Pretty fun game. Only played a couple levels in Co-op and it's much better than doing it single player, but it's still lots of fun.It fills in some lore around the war of the ring, mostly taken from Christopher Tolkien's ""history of the war of the ring"", which is pretty cool. There are several interactions with members of the fellowship of the ring. Character models based on the movies, and they got voice actors that sound kind of like the hollywood actors, but they're far enough off that it feels a bit cheesy.Otherwise the game is super generic, but has strong action controls and is pretty fun. It's basically a LOTR beat-em up. Graphics look like early XBox 360. The port is pretty lazy, so you can't tweak too much. Everything's pretty nice looking and artistically great, but it really looks like a console game.A single playthrough takes about 9-10 hours and there are 7-8 varied environments and plenty of different enemy types.RPG elemements are minimal. The skill tree is pretty cool and there's plenty of loot to be had, but companion gear management is awful and it's pretty unclear about how they level up.Note that keyboard controls are awkward. This game was designed for consoles and the port is a lazy one, so best to use a 360 controller.All in all, a fun game that gets way better if you have some friends to do co-op with. Definitely worth picking up for around $5 which will get you a nice 10 hour playthrough. The are 2 New Game + modes that make the enemies a lot harder and the loot better, but unless you're playing with friends I can't see anybody actually wanting to do this.			"

												Well after about 2 hours of setting up it finally worked. For us, there was a specific order in which we had to set everything up, one of us had to switch to a different computer, the other one had to be the host and every one of us had to make some funny sound settings to disable the ingame voice.But after all that I really did enjoy venturing out with my friends. The combats were somewhat interesting, though we only finished on normal mode were everything is a little bit too easy, and the abilities matched the characters. We played the default MMO setup with healer (my role), tank and damage dealer, which worked great.Some abilities seem to be a little overpowered. There is, for example, this big shield (we called it ""the bubble""), which deflects every projectile anybody shoots at you and heals you. This includes bosses. Therefore you sit in it waiting and shouting in order to get the bosses in melee range.All in all, the dialogs are linear but believable and well made, the story feels good and the atmosphere is deep, even though it can get a little monotone after too long periods. The graphics are not the best I've seen even for the time the game was released, but they are still not too bad to look at. The textures of your armor and characters are somewhat well made even though some animations may be a little set off. Sometimes the voice isn't fully synced.We finished the game in about 10 hours in 3 sessions.			"

												I had fun with this title and would recommend it to action rpg fans in general and anyone interested in Lord of the Rings. I got it for a decent price around $8 and it provided me with around 12 hours of gameplay so I think I got my monies worth :)You pick one of three characters and journey to stop one of Sauron's generals who plans to start war in the northern realms. You can pick a ranger who can dual wield, a lore master (healer mage) or a tanky dwarf. They generally all play the same with a few unique skills attached to each class. Combat consists of mashing the normal attack and hitting the strong attack once enemies are weak to cause critical damage or finish them off. Levels consist of areas where you have to defeat waves of enemies before the next area is unlocked and you pick up gear for your characters and level up.I played this game solo but I can see the real fun is with playing with friends which I haven't tried, not even sure if it works or not considering this is an older game. Your AI companions can be pretty dumb often getting preoccupied fighting one weak goon while you get swarmed by enemies. You can only switch between the characters at checkpoints which is a shame and only your main characters look will be affected by what they are wearing.The music and the voice acting are great although some of the dialogue is cliche. You do have some dialogue choices during the story but it doesn't really matter what you pick. The story itself is weak and predictable and when you finally defeat the last boss you instantly find out that the original Fellowship completed their epic journey making your efforts seem kind of pointless.Overall great game and still playable in 2016. I only wish you can freely swap between characters in battle and setup all your characters with loot and equipment that you find in the game.			"

												This game is the definition of mediocre, yet in its simplicity I've found that I've had a ton of fun with it. The hubby, roommate and I picked it up off of the WB Bundle and were surprised with how much we've enjoyed it. It reminds me a bit of the PS2 LOTR titles from back in the day: simple skill trees, linear progression, differences in loot being numerical, etc. That said, it's definitely a nice romp to go through with 2 friends at night when you don't feel like committing to a deeper game. I plan on 100% completion for it, and if you've got some free time and a coupel of buddies, its definitely a guilty pleasure.			"

												Took me awhile to start this game, because of all the lack luster reviews and whiners about it. However once I finally found the time to sit down and start this up, I was pleasently surprised. Ok so its not a hard core RPG, nor has an extensive gear database, and your companions are only good for distraction. However the game was ""fun"". I found it a worthy use of time, and I never felt like I wasted money (granted it was free with something else I bought haha).Only one point in the game I was very ticked off with (the part with the two trolls, and a door, in the Siege). I must have failed so many times with that, and ONLY passed it because the trolls 'glitched' and just stood transfixed on the door instead of hitting it. Only bad part of the game, ridiculous difficulty (worse than the end battles!), and only passable due to a glitch.Anyhow, I enjoyed this game. Smooth graphics, wonderful locations and atmosphere. Also had great audio and music. Well worth the time as I found it ""fun"" (which is all a game should be!).			"

												This game is REALLY average. The combat consists of LEFT CLICKING and Spacebar. Oh, and right click when you see an orange triangle. The combat is extremely boring, and unengaging. It's also really annoying when enemies constantly stun-lock you. Enemies with 2 weapons are the worst, you'll constantly be hit and stun locked unless you block them, but if you are constantly being hit in the first place, you won't be able to block because you are already being stunned. The game throws tons of enemies at you, mostly to hide the fact that the game has a shallow combat system. You can press space to roll, which clips you through enemies, and is extremely effective. There's not even a penalty to spamming the roll! Meh. The enemy types in the game are also usually very meh as well.   Your AI teammates are the dumbest people out there, if the last one is alive, they will constantly try to revive you, NO MATTER WHAT. Even if there's only 1 hit left to finish the boss. Or they won't even try to evade the enemy, they'll just take it in order to revive someone. Regarding certain enemies, there are big ones who smash you, and toss you and make you ragdoll around. These are easy to beat, but when there are multiple enemies, it's a chore, because you'll be forced to hit them 1 or 2 times, roll away, come back and hit them again. You'll be able to use abilities here and there, but those aren't very effective and they cost 'power'. The game also has an RPG element that is very basic. You get XP from killing stuff, then you level up. After you level up, you put points into attributes and you pick abilities, either passive, or activated.  There are very few abilities, and they aren't very interesting, save for the Ranger's Stealth, the Lore-Masters bubble shield thingy, and the Dwarfs War Cry that supposedly does something useful. The game also has really bad AI management. You tell them to attack or defend. That's it. AND even when you tell them to defend, they will often times, leave you to kill an enemy. When you give them gear, they will throw it away most of the time and use one that sucks, because you can't manage their inventory. They will usually throw it away once it breaks or reaches low durability from what I can tell. This is also very annoying, because they will toss away high tier gear in order to replace it with ANYTHING that isn't about to break. You can't even tell if it's about to break, you just stare at your teammates and check if what they are wearing looks cool. If it doesn't you probably need to add new gear to them. The story in this game is incredibly bland. SURE, it's staying true to the book, but that doesn't mean you can't add anything that makes it interesting. The main characters are also just people you don't really care about, you don't even get to know their real backstory, and you get no emotional ties with them at all whatsoever, unless you get hard looking at the elf. Regardless, the story is also only about 10 hours long, longer if you do it alone, and shorter with friends.That's including the side-quests. There are about 20 ( or less ) side quests in the game. I'm not even kidding. And the rewards are usually rendered useless by 2-3 levels anyways. The game's matchmaking found me with no players, so I assume no one plays this anymore. You can trade items to other players, but that only matters if you can actually find someone to play CO-OP with.Overall, the game is really bland. It doesn't have any variety, and it's KEY selling points are average. I thought the game would be better, but I am disappointed with what I saw. It could have used a better combat system, better AI, better enemy variety, and better RPG mechanics. If it had all of those, I'd give it an 8/10 if I were to score it. But if I were to give it a score right now, I'd say 6/10, and that's being generous, as I do know the series, and I appreciate the amount of time they put into the lore. ( not pointing out the bug where the dwarf calls a ranger 'KINSMAN'  )			"

												my friend and I beat this game a few times all the way up to legendary and stopped. Its a good game. AMD cards will have issues. I couldnt get it to run without work on windows 10 but it's been a while. COOP is where it wins. If you have trouble with the game taking the mic oh well deal with it. It was a port and works pretty well all things considered, thats one of the few major problems. Would have loved to see them make more games like this. (without the mic always on)			"

The game is ment to be played with coop and with the coop experience you get to not only play with friends or random people but you also get to do more things such as finding secret room and defeating enemies a lot quicker instead of dying all the time.ProsStory is amazingSwitch characters during missionscut limbs off of orcsequiped character with different itemsbosses follow the LOTRConsForce voice chat onlineOnline bugs get disconnected almost all the time			"

												This is a good game to play alone and even better to play with your close friends because there will be missions that with extra human help will go smoother. It has plenty of story, (voice acting could be better but isn't bad itself), most places you'll relate from the movies and good characters to please the fans. The gameplay has some minor bugs, nothing that ruins your experience in my point of view, because you emerse yourself in the action of the story and look aside of that to save someone or to give that finishing blow on a giant troll/giant spider XD. The controls take a couple of minutes to get used to but if you are used to play this tipe of games then it will be a piece of cake for you to play it. To me, being a fan of the lord of the rings movies and all, this game is quite good and shows another side of this epic battle against evil and you feel good being a part of it and helping the heroes gain time to destroy the ring of power.And besides, just to see your character fly in one of those giant eagles like gandalf in the movies is just priceless XDI absolutelly recomend this game! :D			"

												I played this game about 5 years ago and came back to it recently in the hopes that it's many issues at the time would be fixed. I really enjoyed the game and co-op was a ton of fun, but I experienced the very same bugs and technical issues that made the game unplayable for me since day one of release. Certain areas in the game cause crashes and disconnects and when you're not crashing to desktop you often have to restart the game completely due to some bug or another. It has great gameplay and potential for fun with friends, but it's not worth the dozens of crashes and hours wasted on them replaying areas just to crash over and over again in an attempt to get through a single playthrough. Sadly it's just another sloppy and unpolished game that developers make and never give it another glance after it's release, the kind of game you really want to enjoy but it just won't let you. If you want to give the game a try on sale and you've got a lot of patience, go for it. But I wouldn't drag your friends into it with you if you want to keep them :p			"

												I liked the old lotr hack n slash games and this is close to that.The RPG elements could be better but I shouldn't matter much if you treat this like the old hack n slash games.There is however a game breaking graphics problem with some AMD cards.The game crashes often at certain parts of the game and makes it almost impossible to pass.I have tried multiple times to pass these sections and what it comes down to is a big waste of time for me.I managed to pass one such section by doing something ridiculous like zooming at the floor the whole time while your graphics settings are at it's lowest.But in the next playthrough where there seem to be more enemies some parts seem to be unpassable.Have tried the numerous reported fixes ( lowering all graphics settings, rolling back to old graphcis drivers ) but none of them work for me.Not sure if this is something AMD or the game devs should fix but as it stands nobody is fixing it.So I would recommend this game if you do not have a AMD 7xxx card ( Which I have ). Otherwise I cannot recommend it.			"

												“It's a dangerous business going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off ... “Hearken to me fair folk of Middle-Earth - are you a devouted follower of the writings of the linguistic, literary mastermind and father of modern fantasy, the one, the only - Professor J.R.R Tolkien? Are you ripe for adventure, lore-exploration and feisty combat? If so - then, The Lord of the Rings: War in the North is most certainly a game you would enjoy.As a person who revels in the realm of fantasy and enjoys reading, watching and playing anything related with it, I am of course a loyal acolyte of Tolkien's Legendarium. Therefore, I have played almost all the Middle-Earth related games out there, starting all the way back with The Fellowship of the Ring (2002) all the way to this game. Seldom could I find a game that gazed it's lofty magnitude upon me and capture my thirst and love for Tolkien's world - as War in the North. While some might compare it to the works of legendary games such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (my all time favourite game of all times), I find such thoughts folly, as The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, offers a far different experience: to put it frankly and to the point - 'tis a game for those who truly enjoy the vast amount of Tolkien's books (with references being pulled from works such as The Unfinished Tales, The Silmarillion and The Hobbit). Yet, even those who aren't particularly die-hard fans of the series, such as a good friend of mine, could still find this game's storyline, it's quests and characters and the combat system itself, interesting. Character customization is limited, yet quite sufficient in my humble view, game combat is entertaining and fun, if a tad repetitive, the locations and plot are top-notch. The three character races you can play being: Dwarf, Elf and Man have their own unique playstyle (the Dwarf is  your tanky all-weapons master that can pretty much take on Sauron's forces on his own, the Elf being that vital link healer/mage that can provide your little band of heroes that so needed back-up support, and the Man being a sneaky, archer/ranger who can also duo-wield and perform sneak attacks. Additionally, I found it equally rewarding to play the game in single player and in multiplayer with one or two friends, for a true 'Fellowship' feel! And while, indeed the game has aged somewhat in terms of graphics - I believe it still remains an amazing testament to the power of Middle-Earth. In short - I full heartedly recommend The Lord of the Rings: War in the North to anyone who wishes to further deepen his understanding of Middle-Earth and explore the largely untouched story of Sauron's attempted conquest of the North.

												TL;DR: A must-buy if you you're running NVIDIA; get ready for giant eagles with majestic pants.LOTR: War in the North is easily my favorite hack and slash style game. It has a pretty decent storyline, good voice acting, and good graphics, and excellent replay value. You get to talk to some major LOTR characters, and fly around on giant eagles that look like they are wearing amazing feathery pants (I'm not even kidding). The inventory and level-up systems are great, making the RPG element of the game extra fun. The co-op feature is definitely worth getting into as well. I've honestly yet to find a game like this that I've enjoyed nearly as much. Biggest issue I have with this game is the crashes. In graphics-intensive parts (specifically chapters 2 and 8) it almost never fails that the game will freeze, then crash altogether. This seems to happen with AMD cards and renders the game unfinishable for anyone running on AMD from what I've been able to research. If you're running NVIDIA you should be fine. I actually purchased War in the North used for xbox 360 to avoid a lot of these issues because it was less hassal than swapping out my card. It's a shame they haven't fixed the crashing problems (it seems the developers have written this one off), or this game would be A+, and well worth the $20. As it stands, however, I'd suggest purchasing the game when it goes on sale, and be prepared to deal with a few bugs. Apart from the bugs War in the North is everything I personally want in a hack and slash RPG; the game itself is fun enough to inspire me to buy it, again, on a separate consol- if that says anything.

But even with the glitches I can't really walk away from this game.  For any fan of Middle Earth, this is just stunning.  The graphics are beautiful and incredible and the lore is pretty spot on.  You play as a small group that fights in the north to buy time for the fellowship of the ring.  You get to encounter six of the members of the fellowship, along with other notable characters.  And they really bring a sense of familiarity, the character models were designed to resemble the cast from the films.  All in all, I really, really love this game.  Glitches be damned.			"

												It's a decent game, there are just some flaws which bring it down. I originally played through basically the entire game on PS3 until a glitch occurred that made it so I was unable to progress past the spider boss regardless of how many times I beat it. The game is quite a bit of fun on co-op and the combat is simple and satisfying. However, quite possibly the biggest problem with this is that the game forces voice chat upon you. There is no options in-game to disable the voice, make it push-to-talk, or to even mute other players. There is no way to disable the voice in this game without disabling the audio entirely. This wouldn't be a problem if the game chat was half decent, but from my experience it's delayed, echoey, and just overall unpleasant. Apparently there are work arounds for this, but I couldn't manage to figure them out, and really, I shouldn't have to go through that just to do something that should be so simple. Eventually I found the voice chat as part of the game's charm, but I don't really mean that in a good way.The skill trees offer a basic variation to each of the characters' playstyles without getting unnecessarily complex. Treasure chests and hidden caches give a reason to off the path in search of better gear. There isn't much exploration to do otherwise, though. If you enjoy always getting new gear and improving stats (like me) then you will enjoy the equipment aspect of this game. Combat can get a bit tedious and there doesn't seem to really be variation in objectives. It's always going to be go here, defend here, open this all whilst holding off waves of orcs and the like. This is kind of to be expected, though. It's not like there was much else that could have been done with this style of game, but in long sessions you may find the game becoming repetitive. If you have friends to play this with I would recommend it. Maybe not for $20 though. If you don't have friends, well, the AI isn't all that sturdy from my experience, so you'll be doing a lot of reviving.Gloin / 10.			"

												TL;DR: A must-buy if you you're running NVIDIA; get ready for giant eagles with majestic pants.LOTR: War in the North is easily my favorite hack and slash style game. It has a pretty decent storyline, good voice acting, and good graphics, and excellent replay value. You get to talk to some major LOTR characters, and fly around on giant eagles that look like they are wearing amazing feathery pants (I'm not even kidding). The inventory and level-up systems are great, making the RPG element of the game extra fun. The co-op feature is definitely worth getting into as well. I've honestly yet to find a game like this that I've enjoyed nearly as much. Biggest issue I have with this game is the crashes. In graphics-intensive parts (specifically chapters 2 and 8) it almost never fails that the game will freeze, then crash altogether. This seems to happen with AMD cards and renders the game unfinishable for anyone running on AMD from what I've been able to research. If you're running NVIDIA you should be fine. I actually purchased War in the North used for xbox 360 to avoid a lot of these issues because it was less hassal than swapping out my card. It's a shame they haven't fixed the crashing problems (it seems the developers have written this one off), or this game would be A+, and well worth the $20. As it stands, however, I'd suggest purchasing the game when it goes on sale, and be prepared to deal with a few bugs. Apart from the bugs War in the North is everything I personally want in a hack and slash RPG; the game itself is fun enough to inspire me to buy it, again, on a separate consol- if that says anything.

												This is a underrated action hack n slash rpg.  The storyline is decent, the games graphics look pretty good.  Obviously it has some issues which is why it has a 60 something metascore at the moment.  The biggest of these issues is chapter 2 and especially chapter 8 there is a very bad bug for amd users where they will constantly crash and be unable to finish the game.  There are ways to get past this though if you check on the forum.  The main characters aren't really well developed but I believe thats how the developers intended it to be.  The characters ingame are portrayed as the same actors  that were in the movies.  Sometimes you will wish you had a few more moves to use, but regardless the game was still enjoyable for me even though its a bit short, especially considering I got this in a cheap humble bundle I can't complain.

												As many people have mentioned already, this game is great with friends while playing alone does not quite grant you the same level of enjoyment. Your AI companions remind me a lot of Resident Evil 5 or early Gears of War companions - kind of just there for flavor, they have some uses like putting up a shield to protect you from arrows but don't give them your items and don't expect to customize their skills.It's heavily loot focused - finding armor set pieces is the best way to capitalize on your character stats, but require that you grind out areas to find the pieces that you're looking for (unless you're looking for the Marksmen set, those pieces seem to be EVERYWHERE). You'll always find yourself lacking in needed inventory space. Inventory sorting goes as far as you dragging and dropping items in the order that you want them, so if you like a neat-and-tidy inventory, prepare to have to maintain that yourself. Item stacking only goes so far... 10 potions per stack, and if you're making your own potions and hope to save them for a rainy day, prepare to not be able to hold anything else very quickly.Of course, money doesn't seem to have a lot of value. Money isn't that hard to come by, things to sell are abundant, and there isn't much that merchants are selling that make you want to part with what you've already earned. Occasionally they'll sell a set piece you're missing, but otherwise it's just generic equipment or more potions you don't have room for. Money REALLY isn't hard to come by too when you find out you can easily duplicate items in coop sessions, but that's for cheaters, so you wouldn't do that now would you? Sometimes when you give items to your friends, they'll just never receive it, so hopefully it wasn't too valuable!But I think the biggest annoyance I have about this game is the fact that I have to change my computer's microphone settings to eliminate the in-game chat during coop sessions. There are no microphone options in the game itself, so if you're using another chat client to communicate with your friends, you have to do some adjustments that eliminate the echo you hear from both chat mediums. All-in-all though, these are very nitpicky complaints. It's a great game to just pick up and dive into without having to invest a lot of time in understanding mechanics or the story (if you're not in the mood to listen - the story's not bad in my opinion). Combat is fun, investing in different skill trees feels rewarding and really highlights your character strengths, and artificially supping up certain stats through equipment so you can wear something you don't normally have the stats for is, in its own way, kind of funny. Timed slow downs during dismemberments feels really satisfying and certain combat animations when doing a coop attack or against particularly large enemies makes you feel really awesome afterwards.Overall, pretty fun game if you just want to run in and hack and slash enemies. RNG's kind of ""meh"" if you're really looking to beef up your characters through equipment, and it's highly recommended to play with friends because the AI really isn't the best, but you can frequently find this game on sale, so it quickly becomes a game easy to justify having in the collection for ""game night"" with the pals.

												This game is based in the lord of the rings universe, and the story takes place, at the same time as the first lord of the rings movie.If you know something about lord of the rings, you would properly like this games story to some extend. The game builds on the lord of the rings universe, and you have to visit locations, that are kind of new to the averige lord of the ring knower.The game still focuses on main charecters such as the fellowship of the ring, and many more main charecters. Your journy in the game has nothing to do with the fellowship, but focuses on killing Saruns right hand (sorry if I spell some names wrong, but they are not so commen)Your journy starts at an inn, and then you move on througout the lord of the rings universe. This brings you far around the country, and you get to visit many interesting locations. There is a forrest with spiders, an underground cave with undead, A fortres with orcs just to name a few of the locations.You can take controle of one of three charecters. Each charecer, has his or hers own thing to do for the team. We have a dwarf, who functions as tank for the team, which mean he will be the first to attack, and the one to take the most damage, but still have enough life to surviev. This character uses heavy weapons and crossbows mostely, but can also use small weapons to channge things up.The secound charecter is a human, who mainly focuses on range attacks, but can also go into combat with duelweld, or a sword, and a sheild. Since this charecter is mainly focusing on damaging, he is the one to damage enemys, while the tank, takes the beating from all the enemyes. Of couse the dwarf can fight by themselves, and thats why the game is great, becouse you can basicly do whatever you want, when it comes to classes.The last charecter is an elven mage, who focuses on healing. She uses magicel attacks to attack enemyes, but is the weakest of the three and therefore needs the most protection.The gameplay is a bit different for each of the three charecters, and therefore you can have a different experince with each charecter. But the goal is the same with all three, kill all the enemyes as a team.The game is best to play with you friends, and since there is only three classes, you don`t have to hold the big gamer party, in order to have fun with this game. I completed the game with two of my friends and we really enjoyed the game, all the way through. We can say though, the story felt a bid lacky at the end, but I will of couse not spoil it. But if you know your lord of the rings movies, you will know what happens at the end of the first movie, and therefore the ending will not be a huge surprise for you. The loot and trade system between charecters is a bid odd, but besides that, you can clearly see when your charecter evolves on he`s or her`s equipment througout the game, this gives a really satesfing feeling, which you will know for neally all RPG`s.Now I want to talk about the ending, that is not about the plot, but more like the events at the ending. In the end of the game you get all kinds of awesome items, and you get all new and great talents. But then you fight an easy end boss, and all that awesome stuff you just got, can`t be used, I know you can play your charecter on another person playthrough, but still, the game is far to short to do all the stuff you want to do.A note to end on, the AI in this game is good, but only for your enemyes, if you play the game alone, you will see your allies are really bad, and don`t really contebute with anything. This is a problem if the charecter you need is the healer, since the healer won`t. Well, heal at times.This game is really good, and I highly recommend to play it with you friends to get the full experince of the game. But you can of couse play it by youself, and still have a good time with it. This game get`s a thumps up. 6 out of 10			"

												A decent game, if you know what you're going to getI really did enjoy this game. I love the Tolkein universe and I think the idea of the story running parallel to the story from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy worked well here. Do not expect an RPG experience, this is much more of a hack and slash, and there are many moments that break the 'immersion' of an RPG game (randomly buying items, mid level, from a floating pool of light, etc.). Story/Presentation: 6/10Agandaur, a high ranking commander of Sauron's forces is marching to destroy the north, and you must stop him. That is the meat of the story. Whilst this is nothing original, and there are no plot twists and things to keep you guessing, it serves its job well enough. The story is fleshed out with characters from the Original LOTR story (Gandalf, Aragorn etc.) and it works well to keep to the original lore (from what I know). There are side quests, but they are sparse and sometimes hard to give a crap about. I finished many of them without even realising (found an item from killing an orc, turns out a dwarf wanted it for a quest).I say 6/10 because as stories go, it is hard to go wrong when Tolkein has done the bulk of the work! The thing that brings this score down to me is how bland the playable characters are. There are many characters in this game that have quite interesting personas, the playable characters are not among them.Gameplay: 5.5/10Nothing inventive here. I played the ranger all the way through, and although the abilities that you learn (from a talent tree similar to world of warcraft), I found that most of the time you'll be mashing the attack button from start to finish. There are some AI problems, if your allies (who were clearly designed to be played by friends) see a ranged unit, they will walk slowly towards them, shooting at them, whilst melee heroes hack them to pieces. Other than that the AI is actually quite fine. I will also note here that you can 'switch character', but you lose all items from your first character unless you switch back again, so I really don't see the point. It seems like a big design flaw to me, but I had no need to change my character anyway. 5.5/10 because it serves its purpose fine, and there's a lot of gore and fun to be had, but at the end of the day its too repetitive.Visuals: 8/10Whilst the graphics are nothing to rave about, they are really quite good. The linearity of the game means that the surrounding environments look quite beautiful, and there has been quite a lot of effort clearly put in to the design of the scenes. I am also going to mention the gore as well, it is nice to see a bit of blood and severred limbs that is startlingly absent in almost all Lord of the Rings games. The hack and slash gameplay IS quite repetitive, but lopping heads and arms off never really gets old.Replayability 6/10Whilst I doubt I will play through the game again, there is the option to do so with a higher difficulty, and naturally with another player character. I think this is a nice idea, but personally I would have rather put the difficulty higher on my first playthrough, than be forced to wait until I've completed the game once. That being said, it's a nice option, and I think many will enjoy playing through again with a second character.Conclusion: 6/10A fun game, nothing special, but worth a play through. I don't think this game is worth a full price purchase, but if you see it on offer definitely give it a go. I got this game from the humble bundle, and I thought I'd end up brushing over if but I'm glad that I didn't. Take that for what it's worth!			"

												I love this universe. So when I learned that it was going to be a new story I was definitely looking forward to this game. Plus the mature style of gameplay is something I always wanted in a LOTRs game. I cannot get enough of these types of games (RPG) and being in one of my all time favourite universes is just a bonus! If youve ever played Dragon Age or The Witcher Series than youll enjoy playing this. Although, it can be rough around the edges sometimes, emotionally and character models wise its still a pleasure to play. Pros: Mature LOTRs gameplay         Taking focus to another storyCons:The Characters you play are pretty plain.(Youd think if your on a quest with two other people youd talk to them and           develop a relationship)         Weak story Emotionally. Just didnt pull me in to take about whats happening. I could see how the concept of it works but didnt translate and for a developer I believe this to be the hardest things to create in a videogame.8/10If youre on the fence about this one pick it up.

												6.5/10War in the North is the tale of a dwarf, elf and ranger wandering the wastes and plains of Middle Earth away from the main events of J.R.R. Tolkien's book and films.It's a respectful hack and slash action rpg, with the major gripes being the lack of much ability progression and a lot of the same enemies appearing over and over again. A mildly coherent tale against a relatively unknown antagonist is only brought back from boredom due to the rich lore that has been previously established.Reminded me of the Two Towers on PS2 back in the day. Three characters playing on screen, Each one has their own unique moves, spells, and abilities and you fight against Sauron's minions in the North. One can get involved with alchemy, another with breaking down walls to find treasures, upgradeable weapons, gear armour etc. Other games do everything it offers better. There are a few short appearances from the major LOTR characters in Rivendell but their sudden appearance and disappearance only cements the insignifance of the playable characters. Campaigh is about 10-12 hours long, bit longer I would think on higher difficulties. Best fun is the 3 player co-op. Got this on a Humble Bundle nearly a year ago, but worth a look if you have it and are itching for an average Action RPG or a LOTR game til Shadow of Mordor arrives.			"

												TLDR? Go to bottom for list of pros, cons.Lord of the rings games to my opinion tend to be good just for having that vibe.But forget about lord of the rings for a moment, because what you have here, is the one and only game that pulls it off to actually FORCE people to play together without the feeling that you are ""forced"" to play together!!!!This game is all about the team. You have a ranger (DPS), a warrior(tank) and a loremaster(support) class. Each class as before mentioned having their own task. Loot is given to each individual, which negates fighting over loot. The loremaster will have crappy damage, but great supportive skills, the tank can take a lot of damage and aggro, while the ranger has low health but can deal massive damage. Besides this, areas can only be finished when everyone is together, but the action always leads you towards it. Besides this great job, is the story compelling and very similar in feeling to the movies.Pros:- Great story- Best co-opperative gameplay EVER!- Great combat mechanics (per class different)- Reasonable replayability (switching of classes)- Good leveling mechanics that keep you compelled.Cons:- Medium to short campaign.- Ranged attack is too spot on.When in doubt. Buy this game!			"

												THIS IS A BIASED OPINION As I am a Tolkien who_ re.I was really pleased about all the lore and the storytelling. The gameplay is kinda repeatitive because theres not much combo or abilities to use. But at least you can switch between 3 characters.  I like how you get to see more gandalf, more eagles, more radagast, more aragorn (briefly) and also bilbo. Old dear Bilbo.`Been a Tolkien fan I'd give this a solid 9/10. But in reality its more like a 7.5/10.   8/10 if you play with 2 friends. and 10/10 if you are 3 LOTR fan. "

												It has a great potential, but it is simply full of terrifying bugs, which will make your way through the game in some parts, a nightmare.ATTENTION: there's that problem with AMD graphics drivers, if you want your game without crashing you need 12.6 or older drivers for AMD, otherwise your game is very prone to crashing, especially in chapter 2 and 8.(Nvidia should be OK)Honestly if you are going to play this game with your friends like I did, you will have a lot of saving bugs (saving disabled for the one who's not host), then for example that bug with your friends armor (sometimes you can't see them wearing it) or you won't be able to finish some of the sidequests because you missed that part too fast...I would recommend this game only if you really like Lord of the Rings and you have some friends to play with.

												I love this universe. So when I learned that it was going to be a new story I was definitely looking forward to this game. Plus the mature style of gameplay is something I always wanted in a LOTRs game. I cannot get enough of these types of games (RPG) and being in one of my all time favourite universes is just a bonus! If youve ever played Dragon Age or The Witcher Series than youll enjoy playing this. Although, it can be rough around the edges sometimes, emotionally and character models wise its still a pleasure to play. Pros: Mature LOTRs gameplay         Taking focus to another storyCons:The Characters you play are pretty plain.(Youd think if your on a quest with two other people youd talk to them and           develop a relationship)         Weak story Emotionally. Just didnt pull me in to take about whats happening. I could see how the concept of it works but didnt translate and for a developer I believe this to be the hardest things to create in a videogame.8/10If youre on the fence about this one pick it up.

												This is really an excellent game. I have no idea why it scored so low in the reviews. A good story, excellent voice acting, nice graphics with tons of options for the PC version, and it never crashed on me once. it's a pretty long game (expect about 15-20 hours your first time through on Normal), lots of secrets to find, three different characters to play (each with their own play styles and each of them fun), and it has an absolute metric ton of loot to find, all of which alters the look of your characters, to go along with some good customization options.The combat is simple but takes awhile to master, and it does get more involved on Heroic and Legendary difficulties, both of which are excellently balanced (though there are a few huge difficulty spikes in certain quests.)All in all, this is an awesome game, well worth 20 bucks.

												As many people have mentioned already, this game is great with friends while playing alone does not quite grant you the same level of enjoyment. Your AI companions remind me a lot of Resident Evil 5 or early Gears of War companions - kind of just there for flavor, they have some uses like putting up a shield to protect you from arrows but don't give them your items and don't expect to customize their skills.It's heavily loot focused - finding armor set pieces is the best way to capitalize on your character stats, but require that you grind out areas to find the pieces that you're looking for (unless you're looking for the Marksmen set, those pieces seem to be EVERYWHERE). You'll always find yourself lacking in needed inventory space. Inventory sorting goes as far as you dragging and dropping items in the order that you want them, so if you like a neat-and-tidy inventory, prepare to have to maintain that yourself. Item stacking only goes so far... 10 potions per stack, and if you're making your own potions and hope to save them for a rainy day, prepare to not be able to hold anything else very quickly.Of course, money doesn't seem to have a lot of value. Money isn't that hard to come by, things to sell are abundant, and there isn't much that merchants are selling that make you want to part with what you've already earned. Occasionally they'll sell a set piece you're missing, but otherwise it's just generic equipment or more potions you don't have room for. Money REALLY isn't hard to come by too when you find out you can easily duplicate items in coop sessions, but that's for cheaters, so you wouldn't do that now would you? Sometimes when you give items to your friends, they'll just never receive it, so hopefully it wasn't too valuable!But I think the biggest annoyance I have about this game is the fact that I have to change my computer's microphone settings to eliminate the in-game chat during coop sessions. There are no microphone options in the game itself, so if you're using another chat client to communicate with your friends, you have to do some adjustments that eliminate the echo you hear from both chat mediums. All-in-all though, these are very nitpicky complaints. It's a great game to just pick up and dive into without having to invest a lot of time in understanding mechanics or the story (if you're not in the mood to listen - the story's not bad in my opinion). Combat is fun, investing in different skill trees feels rewarding and really highlights your character strengths, and artificially supping up certain stats through equipment so you can wear something you don't normally have the stats for is, in its own way, kind of funny. Timed slow downs during dismemberments feels really satisfying and certain combat animations when doing a coop attack or against particularly large enemies makes you feel really awesome afterwards.Overall, pretty fun game if you just want to run in and hack and slash enemies. RNG's kind of ""meh"" if you're really looking to beef up your characters through equipment, and it's highly recommended to play with friends because the AI really isn't the best, but you can frequently find this game on sale, so it quickly becomes a game easy to justify having in the collection for ""game night"" with the pals.

												A fairly good movie-based game dressed up as a Gears of War-feeling Diablo clone.The plot follows TLoTR from a group of heroes parallel to the main story of Frodo, adding a lot of backstory and ""meanwhile..."" kind of lore for diehard fans. There's a lot of good exposition and the custscenes are well done.While the game is firmly planted in the Action-RPG tropes of Diablo and Titan Quest, it plays a lot like Gears of Wars, minuse the cover mechanic. Sprinting feels like the ""roadie run"" and the rolls are almost the same. It's made using Epic's Unreal Engine 3, but its strking how much this game borrows gameplay mechanics from Gears of War with an ARPG shoehorned in and then told using the trimmings from TLoTR's plot.Visuals range from good to great and the sound is satisfying, but nothing amazing. Combat is fun and it's a delight to knock a big, ugly orc's head off and then fel his friend by slicing his leg off.In case you're wondering, yes there is a multiplayer mode that allows you to play through the game in co-op.Overall, a nice buy for anyone a fan of ARPGs and/or TLoTR with a farily decent amount of replayablity.

												It's unfortunate that this game didn't get as much traction as planned.Although short and tedious at times, LoTR: War in The North is a great 3 person co-op game that takes place at the same time the fellowship is being formed. From the same team that brought you Baldurs Gate: Dark Alliance, comes a third person LoTR game. A very simple hack and slash with not much else in terms of variety. Yes you have an inventory, yes there is a good amount of items to obtain and equip, but it's a very run of the mill RPG.The one cool thing about this game is that it's rated M, which doesn't sound like it's a really game changing feature, but it shows a lot that other LoTR games can't, and it gives a certain realism and gritty feeling while playing the game, which really brings you in to the Middle Earth Environment.I would recommend this to anyone who likes LoTR, or Baldurs Gate. make sure your friends play with you too, because going through middle earth by yourself isn't a lot of fun.

A decent mutiplayer-focused adventure, best consumed with friends.War in the North capably follows in the footsteps of the old LotR action games. While not as tightly constructed as its predecessors, the broadened RPG elements and online functionality safely glides the game into the recommendable category. Each character plays uniquely enough, with three skills trees each to vary things even more. The combat plays similar enough to the aforesaid games, albeit with some Arkham counter-attacks thrown in. Very fun. Very silly.But be warned...That said, if you're searching for an expansive single-player RPG, keep looking. This game was made for online coop, something blatantly evident during offline party management. Simply described, there are two inventories: the player's inventory and the AI's inventory. The player's inventory encompasses any currently controlled character (whichever they may be), whether offline or online. But the AI's exists utterly autonomously (as it would with another player).So say you're playing the ranger when you pick up a nice axe you'd like to use when playing the dwarf. To trade it, you need to save and exit the current game and reenter as the dwarf character. Think of it as logging and relogging between two toons on an MMO, except all of your characters share the same loot bags. Conversely, and this is IMPORTANT, if you just trade the axe to the cpu version of the dwarf, the item will be cast into the nether: the cpu's inventory. You will not get it back. You cannot force the npc to wield it. When you log into the dwarf character, you will not find it.This extends to leveling up as well. As much as you may enjoy playing a particular character, I highly advise you regularly redo previous missions with whatever characters you've been neglecting. They will not level up or progress their skill branches on their own. They will gain XP, to be fair, but they become increasingly outmatched as the game goes on. So if you rock the first six levels with the dwarf and decide to finally switch things up and finish the game as the elf, prepare to be overwhelmed.			"

												Really good action-adventure game to play with friends. Good graphics and very easy to grasp. Some of the challenges can be difficult but its always a good challenge. Only issue with the game is that if you play multiplayer the will be in game voice chat between you which you are unable to get rid off. So its somewhat annoying when your on skype and you have to listen to the echo from the game.			"

												It's unfortunate that this game didn't get as much traction as planned.Although short and tedious at times, LoTR: War in The North is a great 3 person co-op game that takes place at the same time the fellowship is being formed. From the same team that brought you Baldurs Gate: Dark Alliance, comes a third person LoTR game. A very simple hack and slash with not much else in terms of variety. Yes you have an inventory, yes there is a good amount of items to obtain and equip, but it's a very run of the mill RPG.The one cool thing about this game is that it's rated M, which doesn't sound like it's a really game changing feature, but it shows a lot that other LoTR games can't, and it gives a certain realism and gritty feeling while playing the game, which really brings you in to the Middle Earth Environment.I would recommend this to anyone who likes LoTR, or Baldurs Gate. make sure your friends play with you too, because going through middle earth by yourself isn't a lot of fun.

												A fairly good movie-based game dressed up as a Gears of War-feeling Diablo clone.The plot follows TLoTR from a group of heroes parallel to the main story of Frodo, adding a lot of backstory and ""meanwhile..."" kind of lore for diehard fans. There's a lot of good exposition and the custscenes are well done.While the game is firmly planted in the Action-RPG tropes of Diablo and Titan Quest, it plays a lot like Gears of Wars, minuse the cover mechanic. Sprinting feels like the ""roadie run"" and the rolls are almost the same. It's made using Epic's Unreal Engine 3, but its strking how much this game borrows gameplay mechanics from Gears of War with an ARPG shoehorned in and then told using the trimmings from TLoTR's plot.Visuals range from good to great and the sound is satisfying, but nothing amazing. Combat is fun and it's a delight to knock a big, ugly orc's head off and then fel his friend by slicing his leg off.In case you're wondering, yes there is a multiplayer mode that allows you to play through the game in co-op.Overall, a nice buy for anyone a fan of ARPGs and/or TLoTR with a farily decent amount of replayablity.

A decent mutiplayer-focused adventure, best consumed with friends.War in the North capably follows in the footsteps of the old LotR action games. While not as tightly constructed as its predecessors, the broadened RPG elements and online functionality safely glides the game into the recommendable category. Each character plays uniquely enough, with three skills trees each to vary things even more. The combat plays similar enough to the aforesaid games, albeit with some Arkham counter-attacks thrown in. Very fun. Very silly.But be warned...That said, if you're searching for an expansive single-player RPG, keep looking. This game was made for online coop, something blatantly evident during offline party management. Simply described, there are two inventories: the player's inventory and the AI's inventory. The player's inventory encompasses any currently controlled character (whichever they may be), whether offline or online. But the AI's exists utterly autonomously (as it would with another player).So say you're playing the ranger when you pick up a nice axe you'd like to use when playing the dwarf. To trade it, you need to save and exit the current game and reenter as the dwarf character. Think of it as logging and relogging between two toons on an MMO, except all of your characters share the same loot bags. Conversely, and this is IMPORTANT, if you just trade the axe to the cpu version of the dwarf, the item will be cast into the nether: the cpu's inventory. You will not get it back. You cannot force the npc to wield it. When you log into the dwarf character, you will not find it.This extends to leveling up as well. As much as you may enjoy playing a particular character, I highly advise you regularly redo previous missions with whatever characters you've been neglecting. They will not level up or progress their skill branches on their own. They will gain XP, to be fair, but they become increasingly outmatched as the game goes on. So if you rock the first six levels with the dwarf and decide to finally switch things up and finish the game as the elf, prepare to be overwhelmed.			"

												This game is amazing co op.There's a great amount of loot to find. Wich I personally think is one of the best parts about the game.Many orcs, trolls, spiders and so on to dismember and slay. Awesome battles. And fairly gory which is kind of cool really.Your character can learn some pretty sweet combat moves. The combat isn't super deep though, but that didn't bother me.Quite a lot of characters to talk to if you're interested in the lore aspect. If not you can just quickly click through the conversations.I also find the graphics to be pretty nice looking at some points wich is a +But beware! A big warning!! This game can be pretty ridiculously buggy and glitchy. I played the entire game in a LAN setup. One of my computers handled it without a problem. My second one had really bad stuttering and some crashes. Also at one point the character I used on that computer somehow lost all his equipment and gained the same equipment my friends character had instead. Not sure what went wrong there.If you accept all the problems some computers might have with this game it is awesome and you should get it. And should propably play it cooperatively.			"

												As many people have mentioned already, this game is great with friends while playing alone does not quite grant you the same level of enjoyment. Your AI companions remind me a lot of Resident Evil 5 or early Gears of War companions - kind of just there for flavor, they have some uses like putting up a shield to protect you from arrows but don't give them your items and don't expect to customize their skills.It's heavily loot focused - finding armor set pieces is the best way to capitalize on your character stats, but require that you grind out areas to find the pieces that you're looking for (unless you're looking for the Marksmen set, those pieces seem to be EVERYWHERE). You'll always find yourself lacking in needed inventory space. Inventory sorting goes as far as you dragging and dropping items in the order that you want them, so if you like a neat-and-tidy inventory, prepare to have to maintain that yourself. Item stacking only goes so far... 10 potions per stack, and if you're making your own potions and hope to save them for a rainy day, prepare to not be able to hold anything else very quickly.Of course, money doesn't seem to have a lot of value. Money isn't that hard to come by, things to sell are abundant, and there isn't much that merchants are selling that make you want to part with what you've already earned. Occasionally they'll sell a set piece you're missing, but otherwise it's just generic equipment or more potions you don't have room for. Money REALLY isn't hard to come by too when you find out you can easily duplicate items in coop sessions, but that's for cheaters, so you wouldn't do that now would you? Sometimes when you give items to your friends, they'll just never receive it, so hopefully it wasn't too valuable!But I think the biggest annoyance I have about this game is the fact that I have to change my computer's microphone settings to eliminate the in-game chat during coop sessions. There are no microphone options in the game itself, so if you're using another chat client to communicate with your friends, you have to do some adjustments that eliminate the echo you hear from both chat mediums. All-in-all though, these are very nitpicky complaints. It's a great game to just pick up and dive into without having to invest a lot of time in understanding mechanics or the story (if you're not in the mood to listen - the story's not bad in my opinion). Combat is fun, investing in different skill trees feels rewarding and really highlights your character strengths, and artificially supping up certain stats through equipment so you can wear something you don't normally have the stats for is, in its own way, kind of funny. Timed slow downs during dismemberments feels really satisfying and certain combat animations when doing a coop attack or against particularly large enemies makes you feel really awesome afterwards.Overall, pretty fun game if you just want to run in and hack and slash enemies. RNG's kind of ""meh"" if you're really looking to beef up your characters through equipment, and it's highly recommended to play with friends because the AI really isn't the best, but you can frequently find this game on sale, so it quickly becomes a game easy to justify having in the collection for ""game night"" with the pals.

												War in the North is an interesting mixture of action-RPG and cRPG.It has the fun third-person action and excellent itemization of a good action-RPG. But it also has the extensive dialogue and great worldbuilding of a good cRPG. Add in the Lord of the Rings setting and you have a recipe for a wonderful game.The game is set during the events of the LotR books and movies, but mostly covers events in the north that weren't depicted in the books and movies. Those who have played the Battle for Middle Earth games, or Lord of the Rings Online, will find some familiar elements. But this is very much a different story and it takes a little more leeway than most with LotR lore.That being said, the LotR setting is used to great effect. The game is very consistent and the extensive dialogue features a lot of attention to detail. Many iconic locations from the books are depicted beautifully, such as Bree and Rivendell. And the characters all look like the actors in the movie trilogy. That's where this game's most crucial flaw comes in: voice acting. The familiar characters from the movies (of which there are a fair few) do not share the same voice actors. As such there's a very real disconnect with most of them.As to how the game plays: you choose one of three characters. You then travel with this entire party, and can switch characters between chapters. You can even play the campaign in co-op with friends, but with the heavy dialogue and cRPG elements it lends itself better to singleplayer. The AI takes over the other characters in singleplayer and you can give them some of the loot you don't need to boost their effectiveness. And there's a lot of loot, and item sets, and all sorts of stuff!Both the story and environments are linear, with very few choices in either. The story would only have been even worse were it non-linear, as is it's passable and the dialogue carries it through. Likewise the environments are extremely linear, but very detailed and interesting. These may seem like flaws, but in my experience they didn't hinder my enjoyment of the game overly much.As such, I'd say LotR: War in the North is a surprisingly good RPG. It has strong cRPG and action-RPG elements and offers a very enjoyable experience. Reasonably lengthy too, without overstaying its welcome too much.Recommended.			"

The same formula is applied here, with instanced dungeons leading from point A to B with some chests scattered through-out. Multiplayer coop is an asset to players, though opting for solo will include the two other classes on your journey under AI control.The interface is polished and pleasant to use, with tabs for skill trees, inventory, stats, and quests. The graphical quality is good and I have not noticed any blurry / lazy textures. It is an interesting use of the Snowblind-style engine combined with the LotR universe.			"

												You may find this game to be a hidden gem; the visuals are good, they really develop the characters and story, and you have a decent number of options for advancing your character and choosing whether to play the warrior, ranger, or mage with abilities designed to suit each. You will likely be impressed by some of the cameo appearances and interactions with well-known LotR characters and background lore.			"

												As I look back, there are a lot of LOTR games for a single setting that is. War in the North is a 1 to 3 man co-op game. It is played in 3rd person and at its core is a Hack ‘n Slash. Your character choices are a Dwarf Axe wielder, Human Ranger, or an Elven Magic User.  The game can be entirely soloed but for a complete more enjoyable and manageable play through I suggest teaming up with 2 friends. Combat Monotony: So this game’s simple system of Heavy Attack Light Attack, Roll, and Block really took its toll on my attention span. I would not go as far as to say I was bored with it, but it was very repetitive. Coming from a history of very grindy, time consuming titles, I was fine with this.Weak Story and Characters: So the story without ruining anything runs parallel to the LOTR Books/Movies. That is to say Sauron is still trying to rule the world but you’re after his Lieutenant or something. It’s that unmemorable.  In fact I don’t remember getting all the achievements for this game. Bland is the word I’m going to use here. It’s all I have. No innovation.Beyond that it has your typical RPG Elements with Skill Trees and various weapon upgrades. The Visuals: The most memorable part of this game for me was the Visual look and feel of the world. It has a movie like feel and has the graphical strength that should have been applied to LOTR: Online MMO. Final Thoughts: Die hard LOTR Fans will still enjoy the bits of story that crossover from the rich world Tolkien created. Always play with Friends and never forgot to call an Eagle to fly you home after a Hobbit Feast.As Always watch gameplay videos before buying! "

												A Hack and Slash adventure that is simple and fun for 2 or 3 friends. Beautiful environments. Good graphics. A well done game overall. The skills may be a little simplistic and the attribute system as well as the items may lack luster, but this is a solid game. A gem in the mines of Erebor!

												This game shines in coop-multiplayer!I bought 3 copies and played it with my kids, and so far we have not been disappointed. If you are looking for an interesting, simple hack n slash game that works fine with 3 human players, this is it. Basically an action game, with some simple role-playing thrown in and a linear story to follow, it allows for some really interesting coop playing if you have 3 human players. The whole story depends on your party of threee, so the game already looses much of its charm if only one of the 3 heroes is AI-controlled!!!I would not recommend it if you want to play alone, there are better single player hack n slash games around. For a good 2 player hack n slash experience I can recommend ""Hunted"" - but if you have 3 players, go for ""LotR: War in the North""!			"

Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a fun game to play both solo and in (2 or 3-player) co-op.The story is straightforward but well themed, gameplay is fine and the soundtrack is very nice.Despite a few issues which I will point out below, the game still gets a thumbs up for me. The game can freeze or crash on certain systems with AMD video cards and the lastest drivers. On average my game crashed every about every 2 hours. I reinstalled the video drivers and even tried beta versions but this did not resolve the problem. Some say you have to install a really old driver to fix the issue but I have not verified this. Otherwise, the game runs smooth on highest quality, except for the last area which seems to be laggy for a lot of people even with newer GPUs or Nvidia ones. It feels like the difficulty doesn't scale up in Heroic and Legendary modes. I would not have minded e.g. twice the number of enemies on hardest difficulty. The game only saves when you see the save icon, so not necessarily after travelling or a boss fight. You might want to talk to a shop keep or smith and cancel out to force a save if you just got some new loot or a reward. The AI can be derpy at times too. Buddies and enemies can get stuck in some areas or teleport around. One optional mission (the mithril one) can not be completed without someone playing as dwarf. If you are playing by yourself as either lore-master or ranger you will have to revisit a certain area as a dwarf. I think there is a money glitch which gives you infinite money once you reach 999,999. At least you can buy some nice equipment for your buddies (like 300k crossbows). Level capped at 40. It would be sweet to be able to unlock and upgrade all skills and be even more OP. Oh well.Played on: Windows 7 with Xbox 360 controller, 3 playthroughs as lore-master (1 in co-op), all achievements.			"

												The game is EPIC! It's definitely worth it. The game has amazing graphics, great gameplay and a LEGENDARY storyline. The event in this game is during what happens in the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. This is just on the far North. A battle on a different front, but just as important. As for the graphics, they are getting a bit old, but are still very appealing and good looking(for a game made in 2011, it's amazing). And last, but not the least - the gameplay. Amazing - you can switch between a dwarf/elf/human. Also you have level, gear, gems, skills - its amazing. The targeting system is quite good and not your typical click-to-target. Overall the game is great I would give a 10/10. I love it. Especially if you play it with friends it's even more FUN! Yeah, I would also recommend playing the Dwarf. He's the best! :D			"

												With all the myriad of Lord of the Rings games, we have all have seen the good, the bad, and the inbetween. This one... is AWESOME.There really is not exxagertation in my use of this term. The graphics and voice acting and constant freshness of the storylines inspire awe and leave you feeling the effects of it on a level that is just pure enjoyable FUN. I have played close to every Middle Earth based game that has existed to date, from pen and paper campaigns to console to old school computer varieties and I can honestly say-I have not played such a purely great Lord of the Rings/Middle Earth game in more than a decade.A wonderfully fresh and unique storyline within the LoTR Universe,the beautiful graphics, easy controls all add up to make it great. To to top it all off, it does not even come with any sort of steep or long term learning curve. Less than 30 minutes in, and you will be a pro at controlling every aspect of your character from simple combat to speclized moves. The voice acting is beautifully done for all cut scenes, both full and user input questioons/responses. Just a truly wonderful Middle-Earth game, and well worth the investment.Want more information? You start your role as not one of the major movie characters-but rather, a enitrely new storyline. Connected to the same time as the events of the main LoTR books and characters, but your own adventure. This gives two major advantages: One, the story is fresh and new. You don't automatically know what the next turn in the story will bring. The second bonus is that by having your own character, you have more 'freedom' in the way your character plays out. You have your own opinions and thoughts on the events that happen and are given different options to discuss and respond to them. This makes the character fel like it is yours, rather than you just steering a well-known character down the same, well worn path that everyone knows by heart from the books and films. The con? If there is a con here-it would be that it may just be too addictive. You can easily lose yourself in it for hours at a stretch.  I honestly have nothing bad I can say about this particular RPG and in such a vast genre with so many options, there are very few games within it that can get this level of praise from me.Long story short: if you are only going to get one game in a month at this price, any fan of the RPG Genre, and especially lovers of the Middle Earth world, would be well-advised to choose this game to spend their hard earned cash on. It is worth every penny.			"

												Starting a new branch of JRR Tolkein's ""Lord of The Rings"" series, this quest based game plunges the player into Middle Earth as either a human (Elladan), elf (Andriele) or dwarf (Farin) to fight against the dark lord Agandaur in the North providing the fellowship with time to destroy the ring. This game was a personal favorite of mine. You battle through the North, accompanied with loyal friends, on a variety of dificulties with boss battles at the end of each level providing a harder challenge each time. On completion of the game you can restart to where it all begins with all your gear and complete it on a higher difficulty. The game also  has multiplayer for those missions you need help with. Again this game is a personal favorite and I HIGHLY recommend it as a game easy to spend multiple hours on with  an enjoyable gameplay and ending.			"

War in the North has those too but not in the grandeur u would expect. War in the North is a really nice hack and slash rpg game whose quality rises expodentially when u play it on 3 person coop mode.

But beware if you plan on playing this game you will have to play co-op or have to play as the dwarf to get the skill taunt, as in chapter 7 part 3 its pretty impossible to kill 2 trolls whilst needing to protect a gate. The game also has more flaws such as this being an RPG you cant swap characters and this is very annoying as you cannnot choose what upgrades for them nor can you change thier equipment, you can only give them items, whether they use them or not is another matter so you have to take notes down as to what defence and strength they have.

												3rd person, hack and slash, story driven, action RPG in Lord of the Rings universe, that follows the story of the Lord of the Rings books / movies, yet is presented from a different angle, where you play as one of the three heroes set on a quest to eliminate Sauron's mysterious ally in the north.Story is very similar to the movies, and you meet many known characters throughout your journey, like Gandalf, Frodo, Bilbo, Aragorn, Legolas and many more. Most of the time you can only interact with them in ""safe"" hubs like towns and scripted cut-scenes.Even if you didn't watch the movies, there's fair amount of lore available through dialogues if you chose investigate dialogue options. I didn't encounter choice and consequence in dialogues, so probably they are straight forward and just there for information, lore and story.Combat is mostly hack and slash, with melee weapons as well as ranged ones, depending on hero. You defeat enemies, find loot in linear levels with some hidden passages and secrets here and there. After leveling up you get skill points you can spec into 3 trees, and stats points you can increase stats with, so your basic RPG elements.You can find, buy or get as a reward different kinds of armor pieces and weapons. I have no clue if you can equip your AI controlled allies, but you can trade with them, and if you play in co-op, it's a good idea to trade and offer items you don't use to party members, as you often find items not wearable by your hero.Co-op is strongest aspect of this game, it's really fun and enjoyable, with great synergy between heroes. Dwarf can be tank or tanky melee warrior, Elf has healing, shields and support spells, and Human is basically archer or rogue damage dealer. All heroes have some sort of ranged attacks and require some aiming to successfully hit enemies.Game offers some side quests and challenge locations besides the main story. You can revisit almost any level for additional loot and XP. Dwarf can collect ore and bash through weak walls to uncover secret areas. Elf can gather herbs and brew potions as well as dispel magically sealed areas. Human however can only gather hidden cashes of supplies, and is a bit dull compared to other heroes.There's decent variety of enemies in the game, orcs, trolls, spiders, humans, wyrms, dragons, just to name a few. AI is straight forward, usually rushing you head on as melee or shooting from range with ranged attacks, bigger creatures and bosses have special attacks and require careful positioning or dodging to not get hit. You can easily fall in battle after couple direct hits, unless you dodge or block the attacks.Environments look good yet lack detail, texture quality on characters is decent with somewhat low quality on environments. Visually game looks similar to ""Game of Thrones"" game. Voice acting and facial animations are decent enough and sound similar to the characters from the movies, yet I doubt there's any line from the actual actors in the game.For a game made in 2011 it doesn't look that good, and could be much better with serious polish, never the less the story and 3 player co-op makes this game very enjoyable 12 hour experience. With hero switching and story replay on harder difficulties, this game will give you up to 30 hours of ""content"". I experienced some disconnects while playing in co-op, so it has some network issues, make sure if someone disconnect to not advance in story, and just remake the lobby.Enjoy.			"

												Terrible brawler, everything about the game is wrong down to the most basic mechanics.Even though the game runs at 60fps with no drops on my system it feels like 25, everything is sluggish and delayed like I'm playing through OnLive. Every movement or action has input delay and recovery animations from being knocked down can take control away from the player for 20+ seconds. Enjoy wailing on an enemy for an entire minute while they make no effort to counter or block you, the enemies in this game are mindless sponges, the only danger comes from being overwhelmed by the endlessly respawning minions as 20 of them crowd you at once. Invisible barriers and clipping issues are rampant, every object and character has an invisible sphere extending beyond them that will clip with anything you get within about a meter of, making judging distance completely unintuitive. Laugh as all 3 characters get stuck in a doorway that looks like it should easily fit 5. It isn't hard to make a brawler, and yet this game fails in every category.			"

												I got this game in a humble bundle expecting/hoping for something along the lines of Return of the King from the days of old....but nope. Terribly shallow, boring gameplay. Mindless button mashing combat. Forget about combos, just press A for quick attack, or press B for power attack, or Z for weak ♥♥♥ ranged attack. Abilities are so dull that you almost never notice that you've used them. Equipment/loot is just like any other ARPG of this type, except with no flavor whatsoever. Story was cliched dribble on top of hilariously cheesy dialog and voice acting. If you want a solid ARPG there are literally hundreds of better choices out there. This game is bottom of the bargain bin at Walmart, but with half decent graphics. It wouldnt meet the expectations of a child raised in the wilderness by wolves who doesnt even know the concept of a video game. Avoid at all costs			"

												It pains me to do it as a fan of the LOTR series but I'll be giving this game a no-go. While there are good aspects of the game (storyline, LOTR lore, cameo characters and decent graphics for a 2011 game) the gameplay is quite frankly, just terrible. It feels like the developers of the game didn't spend enough time fine-tuning the game and making it user-friendly, such being able to compare items efficiently in your inventory when buying weapons and armor - you do get the basic up and down atk/def comparison but nothing for slots or other stat bonuses so you're stuck with exiting the shop and checking your item again. I found that a real pain as I was constantly changing armor and weapons throughout the game. The game was overall buggy with the AI support characters being ridiculous and getting stuck in certain areas. As I played most of the game single player, it was really hard to make it past certain levels without getting help. Yes, I know it's a co-op game, but the single player option is there isn't it? At least give me decent AI or options to customize their skills or armor!I liked the story and thought the script writers did a pretty good job of working around the LOTR universe and making it feel real. Some cutscenes and story bits were pretty good - until I got to the gameplay. It just spoiled it for me :(			"

Tired repetitive combat that I actually fell asleep during, awful pacing, uninteresting characters, uninteresting side quests, uninteresting generic fantasy environments that you haven't seen hundreds of times before. The story is also, utterly forgettable, which is the final nail in this game's coffin. Don't give these people your money or your time. The only saving grace is the passable voice acting, which is only passable because the moments it doesn't suck are pretty good. Unfortunately there are just so many awful moments of sucking.			"

												One of the best LOTR games I've played in awhile. The parts I enjoyed the most were the concurrent story that takes place along with the story of the fellowship and the history that is easily accesible to learn more about Middle-Earth. Another great part of the game was the story and the empathy and true friendships you make through the story, and nothing will make you feel more than during the dwarven siege quest. Oh and you get to meet a dragon (and i bet you think Smaug is bad).			"

												--- THIS RECOMMENDED IS UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT YOU PAID LESS THAN 6 EURO ---This game shows 100% why the PC master race hates the consoles so much.Now lets list all the things they did wrong:Character switching: you cannot midarea switch character, now i cannot for the life of me figure out if its just cause consoles are so weak they couldnt implement it, or if someone actually thought it was a great ""feature"" to have....cause reasons?Inventory management: its just a mess, clicking on a weapon on your character dont mean its marked in your inventory, so when selling or repairing, you better make sure its the right thing you actually have marked, and not what appear logical. (a free punch in the jewels, tells me more than 1 person have sold an item they were using)Dont get me startet on how incredibly weak the gear switching is, if you play solo you have to log out, switch char and then gear up, so unless you can remeber exactly what the other 2 are wearing, it just a massive hassle.No going back: ye gods, how i hate that completely linear console way, where you drop downa a 30cm drop and now you cant go back, its in the top 5 reasons why consoles are the worst.Durability: its just so meh to have durability, and having to repair stuff, yuckCompanions: When you play solo, they dont wear the gear you give them, or play by the skills you put point into, thats just weak sauce.Im sure there are a ton more stuff that i forgot.But when all is said and done, i played the game to the end, and didnt regret it, my ragemeter was just maxed, at seeing that a few core changes could have made this game great, now its just mediocre.The combat is fun, albeit i am partial to blood, gore and dismemeberment, you have RPG elements, and gear upgrading, story and VA is decent.

												War in the North delivers a well-paced narrative which was born in the non-canon events of Tolkien's Middle-earth. While Frodo and the Fellowship were dangling from a pitchfork above a kettle, the northern lands were defended by stalwarts (unknown) heroes, of which you happen to be part of. As you progress through the story you'll come to realize that, no matter the difficulty, your NPCs are dull and won't serve you well in dire situations.That's where CO-OP mode kicks in. Secure a Teamspeak server with your friends, form your heroic trio and go kill some of Sauron's lackeys. FOR GONDOR!			"

												Don't get this game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cash-in licensed drivel. Tired repetitive combat that I actually fell asleep during, awful pacing, uninteresting characters, uninteresting side quests, uninteresting generic fantasy environments that you haven't seen hundreds of times before. The story is also, utterly forgettable, which is the final nail in this game's coffin. Don't give these people your money or your time. The only saving grace is the passable voice acting, which is only passable because the moments it doesn't suck are pretty good. Unfortunately there are just so many awful moments of sucking.			"

												I love the game. It's a great hack and slash, with lots of loot.Pros: -Great Art work and level design-Music is Great-Vocals are great-Story is great-Long game of good action and battles-It's LOTRCons:-Game has a few mechanics with combat that are ok could be better. Just remember ROLLING is your new best friend which will get you out of a lot of annoying situations!-Game crashes are a major issue with this game. I did manage to figure out what was my problem and fix the crashing. I made a GUIDE on how i FIXED my game which may work for others.GUIDE:

-Inventory system is not the best and there is no static placement of items in your inventory-can't replay zones that you currently cleared to find more loot. (if you are playing the game how it was designed.)-some creating private game issues. (after a full pc windows reinstall, all of these issues were gone! )			"

												The game is a real fun to play but it's very unstable. After playing with my friend all my characters' stats and inventory were replaced with his. The second time I wanted to play I lost entire game progress and had to start over. Also the game constantly crashed when I tried to complete Lorien level. Despite that I still enjoyed the time I spent on playing it. I never completed it because of the issues mentioned before but I still enjoyed it.			"

												This game looks like ♥♥♥♥, plays like ♥♥♥♥, and is just terrible.  Multiplayer is super bugged.  It separated my friend and I when we both clicked on the map to travel to the same place.  We got stuck and had to exit.  The more I play, the more bugs are revealed.  Enemies have the ability to blink and skate around.  Dead things vibrate uncontrollably on the floor.  Potions never drop.  Some parts are extremely easy and some parts are extremely difficult.  There is also this dumb thing where your voice echoes when you're in caverns.Running into Gandalf and Aragorn was not that exciting.  They both had the same stupid look on their face.The dumb bird was useless.  It needed me to use a feather for it to attack my enemies.  If its smart enough to talk, it should be smart enough to see me getting ♥♥♥♥ed in the face by a horde of op terrorist bomber gremlin things.The more I play, the worse this game gets.  I keep fighting the same trolls over and over again.  You have to click each item to repair instead of repair all.  I keep getting separated from my friend.  The characters say the stupidest things ever and Arwen looks pregnant.The dumb eagles should have went with Frodo instead of this random three man fellowship.  We are extremely useless and in no way helpful in stopping the evil Sauron.  The eagles are so op and powerful.  They should have been more useful.			"

												One of the best LOTR games I've played in awhile. The parts I enjoyed the most were the concurrent story that takes place along with the story of the fellowship and the history that is easily accesible to learn more about Middle-Earth. Another great part of the game was the story and the empathy and true friendships you make through the story, and nothing will make you feel more than during the dwarven siege quest. Oh and you get to meet a dragon (and i bet you think Smaug is bad).			"

												War in the North delivers a well-paced narrative which was born in the non-canon events of Tolkien's Middle-earth. While Frodo and the Fellowship were dangling from a pitchfork above a kettle, the northern lands were defended by stalwarts (unknown) heroes, of which you happen to be part of. As you progress through the story you'll come to realize that, no matter the difficulty, your NPCs are dull and won't serve you well in dire situations.That's where CO-OP mode kicks in. Secure a Teamspeak server with your friends, form your heroic trio and go kill some of Sauron's lackeys. FOR GONDOR!			"

The combat is gritty and satisfying. Story and characters are decent, but not particularly memorable. The adventure is fairly epic, and sends you to some interesting places in middle-earth. And now that we've covered the positives, on to the regretable bit: It seems proper quality assurance wasn't implemented or Warner Bros just said the product was ""good enough."" I've played this game on the Xbox 360 and the PC, and BOTH versions have severe game crashing bugs. It is so bad, that I cannot progress any further in either version, though I did get much further on the PC. WB was apparently working on a patch years back, but that seems to have gone nowhere.I had bought the 360 version used, and the PC version through a humble bundle event. If I had bought it at normal retail price, I'd have demanded my money back. It's a shame really, since the game is pretty fun otherwise. I can only hope WB realizes the full value of good quality control and testing. I get the feeling they just cut the QA department's budget (or the dept. completely) to save on development costs.A real damn shame...PS: So far I've only heard of issues plaguing gamers with AMD GPUs.

Although some character skills will break the balance of the game which influences your game experience(For your game experience, you should never or less use those skills), I still want to play second or third times after I complete a playthrough. If the game has more freedom, it will be much better. 动作爽快，剧情丰满（我没看过原著），不需要刷刷刷（虽然有个别技能会让游戏进入“无双”模式，不过你不用或是少用就行了）。即使通关了我仍然愿意继续二周目甚至是三周目。不满的地方只是希望能够再自由点，不过其实已经做得非常好了！			"

												A well balanced game with a good coop gameplay, but on the other side the game seems to get easier as you progress and for some user the stuttering just kills it making it impossible to play. Overall I would say its a good game, but it has some issues so it all depends on what kind of experience are you looking for, personally I would like to see the game get harder as you progress trough the campaign, for that I give it a 7.5 out of 10!

												LOTR: War in the North is.....difficult...to recommend. It's a really fun to play action rpg, especially in co-op, and has some good (albeit visually dated) designwork. The combat is gritty and satisfying. Story and characters are decent, but not particularly memorable. The adventure is fairly epic, and sends you to some interesting places in middle-earth. And now that we've covered the positives, on to the regretable bit: It seems proper quality assurance wasn't implemented or Warner Bros just said the product was ""good enough."" I've played this game on the Xbox 360 and the PC, and BOTH versions have severe game crashing bugs. It is so bad, that I cannot progress any further in either version, though I did get much further on the PC. WB was apparently working on a patch years back, but that seems to have gone nowhere.I had bought the 360 version used, and the PC version through a humble bundle event. If I had bought it at normal retail price, I'd have demanded my money back. It's a shame really, since the game is pretty fun otherwise. I can only hope WB realizes the full value of good quality control and testing. I get the feeling they just cut the QA department's budget (or the dept. completely) to save on development costs.A real damn shame...PS: So far I've only heard of issues plaguing gamers with AMD GPUs. Nvidia owners might not experience these bugs.			"

												This game is more linear than your school ruler. You move in straight line from point A to point B like a train on a rails. Step fight, step fight over and over again. Pathetic dialogs do not contribute into the atmophere.If you wana kill mobs you better look into Diablo style games. This one looks like an attempt to make a game than a game itself.Whats good: amazing work of artists, Middle-Earth scenery and backgrounds are breathtaking. Too bad you are not allowed to step aside from your rails to deepen into the surroundings.Characters are set but some kind of visual customization is present. Thanks for that at least.Recommeded only for most dedicated LOTR fans, consider it a museum excursion interrupted by annoying fights.If you wana good gameplay you better not to bother.			"

												LOTR: WITN is an adventure/hack'n slash/RPG game aimed to be played in CO-OP. If you can't recruit 2 more friends to play along, brace yourself, 'cause you gonna suffer. As I said, aimed to co-op, means the whole history is played with 3 characters at the same time, of which you just can control one. The other two, if you don't have anyone to share the struggle with you, will be given to the most annoying/dumb/♥♥♥♥♥♥ IA ever made. This is kinda annoying but if you have friends to play with you, the experience is very rewarding and funny.From my PoV, I find odd how this game was abandoned by the developer. It will not require THAT much of effort to tune this game and adjust some minur stuff.Needless to say, the lore is very interesting and the overall 'RPG experience' is nice (concerning loot and build-craft). I would like more choices to make and not only the illusion of choice. ps: About bugs, I just finished the game with friends, but one of them was not able to save the game and unlock the Heroic Mode. So we went back there to help him. But Agandâur just bugged big time, and my char is stucked in the last piece of land in Carn Dum, without hope to be released.			"

												Let's make this review as the game is: short, but juicy.The obvious +'s of the game are it's lore, background and story. It plays in the original LOTR world, with the original lore, original characters (you will meet the fellowship, Bilbo, etc, albeit only a few have the original voice actors). The plot and quests are believeable and fit nicely into the original LOTR plot.The graphics are fine. Controls, too, which is a surprise, given it's a console port. Might want to take this as an example for other *coughDScough* games.The Coop mode is nice and definitely upgrades the game's feeling. If just because the AI is horrible and needs to cheat the rules to actually be remotely useful.So... it looks nice and has a nice story? You already noticed what's lacking? Jep, the gameplay.The gameplay itself consists of running through linear levels, picking up loot, chests and secrets along the way, whilst slaugthering pile after pile of enemies with a few 'bosses' in between. Albeit those 'bosses' are often ridicolously weak, with the game's toughest points being the 'defend the gate' style horde attacks.Which fades right into the next issue: The game is too easy. It comes with two further unlockable difficultys, but actually the game becomes only easier on the 2nd run, given you, by now, have a pretty well-skilled character who (if you know your numbers) is built towards synergizing mass slaughter. (Note that me and my mates got too bored of the game to try a 3rd run on the highest difficulty setting, but I don't expect things to change.)As you can guess, inbetween nice (but boring once you know them from the first run) dialogues and repetitive slaughter is only boredome or exploring the map for glitches (floating trees are my favourite). The game definitely does not offer a lot of content.As mentioned above, the AI (at least for your teammates in singleplayer) is lackluster, nuff said.End result? 6/10It's fun to play once or twice, short enough for it'S repetitive melee system not to become boring, but not exactly an awesome game by any stretch. If you see it on a cheap sale (5@ and below sounds good) AND have someone to play it with, grab it. Otherwise, not really worth it.			"

												Jeez, I don't even know where to start. To make things simple, if you can buy this on sale for $5 or less, then I'd say it's probably worth playing if you're into generic hack and slash RPGs. Otherwise, this could have been an awesome reimagining of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance or Champions of Norrath but falls flat in so many areas. Combat encounters are loads of fun at first because you're not hindered by the awful AI partners; they can actually kill enemies, revive you, and face groups on their own without your constant babysitting. About 6 hours in (of around 12-14), the beefier enemy types stop reacting to your moves which turns the fun hack and slash combat into a chore of ""XXY, roll away or block, XXY, etc,"" and reviving your AI partners because they don't block or roll. About another 2 hours after that, though, you run into enemies who interrupt your attacks and can stun lock you, so good luck reviving anyone once one of your partners is down unless you're lucky (or play Ranger and abuse his Evasion skill). There's also no sense of empowerment as you gain new abilities and equipment. Even ignoring the fact that most abilities (for even the Lore-Master/Wizard) are just boring power attacks that have a cooldown, they never end up doing enough damage to make them feel worth while as you progress through the game. New enemies are thrown at you in such a way that by the time you're doing significantly more damage, the enemies have double the health they used to.I'm not sure how common the technical issues are (seems like more of an AMD thing), but unless you want to downgrade drivers you can probably expect to deal with an inconsistent framerate that BOMBS for seemingly no reason at certain points in the game. Bugs are littered throughout as well, but I didn't run into anything that wasn't solved by quitting and reloading a checkpoint.I should note I didn't play any coop in the game, so maybe that saves some of the issues with its combat, but it's hard to believe the studio that made the amazing Dark Alliance and Champions of Norrath released this. It could have been so much more.			"

												If you're a fan of the universe this game will satisfy your needs.The game itself is nothing special. The combat is bland and repetitive, the level design is uninspired, and the game can break on a whim. My friend and I were playing co-op and travelled back to town to repair (the repair mechanic itself was not explicity explained, and we had to figure it out on our own), once we repaired we tried to teleport back to our original position. The only problem was the game only placed one of us in the original setting, while the other player was placed in another map. Its bugs like this that ruin a relatively entertaining experience.I only recommend this game because its one of the few Lord of the Rings experiences to be had on PC, and I feel it serves its purpose adequately enough to warrant a reccomendation. If you're not a fan of the universe its best to avoid this game.			"

There's also no sense of empowerment as you gain new abilities and equipment. Even ignoring the fact that most abilities (for even the Lore-Master/Wizard) are just boring power attacks that have a cooldown, they never end up doing enough damage to make them feel worth while as you progress through the game. New enemies are thrown at you in such a way that by the time you're doing significantly more damage, the enemies have double the health they used to.I'm not sure how common the technical issues are (seems like more of an AMD thing), but unless you want to downgrade drivers you can probably expect to deal with an inconsistent framerate that BOMBS for seemingly no reason at certain points in the game. Bugs are littered throughout as well, but I didn't run into anything that wasn't solved by quitting and reloading a checkpoint.I should note I didn't play any coop in the game, so maybe that saves some of the issues with its combat, but it's hard to believe the studio that made the amazing Dark Alliance and Champions of Norrath released this. It could have been so much more.			"

												Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a great game for fans of this series and Tolkien's world. Graphics is really good, those sceneries are just beautiful, also cutscenes are done well. Story is a small side story about 3 brave warriors who do their best to defeat their enemy. Gameplay is worst part of this game, of course there is rpg elements (leveling, looting and trading), but those all hordes which you should slain, aren't special and boring to kill. If you love Lord of the Rings or Hobbit  world then of course it must have, but if you want play good RPG DA:O awaits. reVote 7/10			"

												This game is a lot more fun than initially expected, the mechanics work well and the levelling process is interesting enough to max. The story is compelling though not as much as the serie it is derived from. It plays easier and is more compelling when played with two friends. The side stories are nice and give for a fine additional touch. However the game does not arrive without it's flaws because If played alone (speaking from own experience) it might get repetitve. Creating the combination strategies with up to two friends and trying to complete the hardest modes is what makes the game fun. With a possibly ignorant AI the latter is difficult to achieve. Therefore I recommend the game, however do not buy it just because you are a fan of the series because you might get dissapointed without your favourite heroes being playable and but little references made to them throughout the story. Besides all this I hope you have fun playing it if you decide to buy it.			"

												If you're a fan of the universe this game will satisfy your needs.The game itself is nothing special. The combat is bland and repetitive, the level design is uninspired, and the game can break on a whim. My friend and I were playing co-op and travelled back to town to repair (the repair mechanic itself was not explicity explained, and we had to figure it out on our own), once we repaired we tried to teleport back to our original position. The only problem was the game only placed one of us in the original setting, while the other player was placed in another map. Its bugs like this that ruin a relatively entertaining experience.I only recommend this game because its one of the few Lord of the Rings experiences to be had on PC, and I feel it serves its purpose adequately enough to warrant a reccomendation. If you're not a fan of the universe its best to avoid this game.			"

												Jacko Rating 7.5/10What a hidden gem this game turned out to be!  I bought this game on sale and was greatly surprised and impressed with this LOR Hack n Slash.  Better than just about every LOR game to ever be released apart from the latest one Shaow Of Mordor, in fact although a few years old it still has one of the best Co Op modes if not the best Co Op mode in any LOR game to date.Graphics and sound are average but the combat and team format that you play in (team of 3 which 2 of which can be Co Op) is what makes the game and gives you such great enjoyment.  With a touch of open worldness about it in some parts (especially Rivendale) this path lead hack and slash is easy to pick up and gets you in the thick of it right off the bat.Reccomended to buy on sale and try not to pay more than 10$ to really get your value for money.

												If you have an AMD card, don't bother, you're just going to have a mess of problems in Chapter 2 and Chapter 8. I managed to get through Chapter 2, despite the crazy amount of frame drops, stuttering, crash to desktops, had to restart the computer a few times, etc. Chapter 8 though. I just can't do it. I manage to get to a part where I'm supposed to find a lever after travelling through a series of sewage pipes under a fortress and the game just freezes up after a crazy amount of stuttering and frame drops. Just not good optimization for AMD cards.The game itself isn't bad. It's a fun action RPG in the Tolkein universe, so I was sold right away. You get to choose one of three characters, a man, a dwarf, and an elf. And you're not stuck with just that character, you can switch off in the main menu and continue from where you left off with any of the other characters. The combat is neat, but maybe a bit repetivie. The graphics are okay, but the character animation is pretty terrible. The combat animation, however, is actually great. The story isn't too compelling but you get to explore recognizable parts in the Tolkein universe as well as areas that have been mentioned but not necessarily explored in the novels or films. Basically, the plot involves the three characters banding together to fight off an evil force to the north while the Fellowship travels south towards Mordor.I should mention the gameplay as well. It's extremely linear. Basically, you enter an area which is counted as a ""Chapter"", and you continue along a path in that area in Middle-earth until the end of the Chapter. So it's not open world if that's what any of you wanted to know.If you have an Nvidia card and are a Tolkein fan, this game is good fun for its duration. No real replay value though.7.0/10 (Nvidia cards)5.0/10 (AMD cards)			"

												Do I recommend playing this game? Yes.What's the catch? Of course there's a catch:STORY: The story in this is interesting, but don't expect some major twist. If you played the Third Age, it's kind of that same setup. Your mission is to support the fellowship by distacting Sauron's forces away from Frodo and gang. You'll meet the likes Aragon and Gandalf, but there's one problem: the voice acting. I'll give Gandalf's voice actor credit, he really tries to sound like Sir Ian, but he just falls short. Aragon's is just awful. It's not to the point where I can't listen to it, but don't be suprised when he sound's nothing like his film counterpart. GAMEPLAY: The gameplay is what I imagine would happen if you took Dragon Age and Skyrim and paid them to make a baby. You've got the run around and find loot off of enemies and hidden chests like Skyrim (Yes, I know Dragon Age has it but I don't have to go find a Rogue whenever I find a chest in this game). The combat itself feels like a mix of Dragon Age, Skyrim, Arkham, and only the slightest hint of Gears of War. You have your two team mates that do somewhat support you unless you're playing in Coop (That's an entirely different discussion) and in a way it reminds me of Dragon Age, except that I have no control over them. It's like Skyrim in that there is no pause feature; you are constantly in the midst of the battle. It's like Arkham in the sense that you have really neat slow motion finishing moves occasionally (Yes, I know Skyrim has those, too, but I think that Arkham's has more in common with the style this game has). When I saw Gears of War, though, I don't refer to the cover shooting mechanic, I mean more of the coop system. Even in a singleplayer game, when you lose all of your health, you will go into a downed position and can slowly crawl to your teammates like in Gears. The constant, ""Get on that turret!"" command also seems reminicient of Gears to me, also. Aside from combat, you will be navigating a fairly linear world populated with breakable barrels, secret caches, and tons of Orcs. It's fairly simple in that regard. You progress through the level, break barrels for ammo, loot, and coins, occasionally stop at random places to purchase new gear or sell loot, and then carry on.GRAPHICS: I would say these Graphics remind me of Dragon Age 2, particularly in the environment. The way it's textured and modeled just reminds me of it. The ground doesn't look like, say, Halo or Crysis where you look at the ground and think how pretty it looks (I know that sounds weird, but seriously look down sometimes.) The ground looks like it kind of all blends together and there is no distinct place where a rock sticks up or grass ends and sand or dirt starts aside from a bland change in texture on a flat face. The characters, on the other hand, are an entirely different story. The characters look really sharp and well rendered. The clothes flow when you run, there aren't random sharp edges on the character, etc.OVERALL: Overall I'd say this is a neat game. If you like Lord of the Rings or want an RPG that you won't spend 50+ hours running around in like Dragon Age or Skyrim, absolutely invest in this game, but I'd stick to buying it on a sale. This game is by no means remarkable. It isn't going to astound you with its story, blow you away with its soundtrack or voice acting, etc. It's a game that manages to ride right in the middle where you'll enjoy playing through it, maybe play it again with some friends, and then occasionally look at it as you scroll through your Steam library and think how much fun it would be to play Shadow of Mordor which sits right above it.

												TLDR: Third Person hack/slash RPG similar to Dragon Age 2, but set in Tolkien’s Middle-Earth. Melee combat has a similar feel as the first Witcher game where you kind of need to flow from one hit to the next to build up strike power. The game appears to be built around multiplayer co-op, but I’ve only played single-player thus far. WARNING: If you have an ATI/AMD video card you will probably have technical trouble with this game. Big thumbs down for the game breaking bug (near the very end) - 2/10. Would have been 6/10 if the game actually worked.If you liked Dragon Age 2 more than you liked Dragon Age Origins (not many people do) you might want to give Lord of the Rings: War in the North a try. The game is more linear and focused on combat than world-building. This might have to do with the fact that the “main story” is happening elsewhere (Fellowship of the Ring) and you’re just the distraction to help Frodo sneak into Mordor. You play one member of a trio of adventurers at around the start of the first Lord of the Rings novel. Before Frodo, Aragorn, and their buddies start their journey to Mount Doom, Farin the dwarf (melee fighter), Eradan the ranger (archer), and Andriel the elf (mage) are fighting the good fight against the servants of the dark lord Sauron, who are led by a bad dude named Agandaur. Since Agandaur is Sauron’s right hand man fighting the bad fight in the north, your goal is to smash him and draw Sauron’s attention away from the south, where the Fellowship of the Ring are making their way into enemy territory. The game is played in the third person perspective and while you can only play as one of the three characters at a time, you get opportunities to switch which character you’re playing between game chapters. Really though, you should probably stick with one character per playthrough because the game will auto assign the stats and skills of the characters you aren’t using when they level up, and you won’t get much opportunity to customize if you keep switching around. Unlike the Dragon Age games, you don’t control the whole team, just the guy you’re playing. Also, you’re controlling all your character’s attacks as well, not just designating a target.Like many hack and slash action RPG’s you run into a lot of loot and equipment in the game. You pretty much have as many equipment slots as Diablo 2, but most of the gear you find is “non-magical” and can be easily compared to similar pieces. This means there isn’t much in the way of randomly generated loot stats, and you don’t need to spend much time grinding for items. In fact, you probably shouldn’t even buy weapons from the vendors because chances are you’ll just find something better in about 10 minutes.Pros:+Co-op gameplay available so you can go through the single player campaign with a friend or two. Each character has a unique “secret finding” skill that can only be used when a human is controlling the character (in single player, you only find secrets that your character can “see”) so if you have a full team of human players you can find all the secrets in a level. Also, bear in mind that like many squad based games, you can revive your allies if they’re knocked out. So you don’t need to spend too many healing potions if you know your buddy can just bring you back to life at full health.+Decent story that takes you all over Middle Earth (well, a lot of it) and involves some of the characters from the Lord of the Rings books/movies. Why don’t the eagles just fly everyone everywhere? Play the game and find out!Cons:-This is the big one. If you have an AMD video card like I do (Radeon 7850) you will find the game has extremely poor frame rate at many places. I was unable to finish because at the last chapter, the game slowed to a crawl and would crash out repeatedly at the same place. Searching online, this seems to be a problem for a lot of people. My friend has an nVidia GPU and didn’t have this issue.-The “critical hit” system of the game can be fun sometimes but after a while it gets really repetitive. You built up power by continuously hitting a single enemy uninterrupted and eventually you can use a power attack with a chance of instantly killing them. Problem is, this means it takes like 2 minutes to kill many of the more powerful enemies, especially near the end of the game. Also, you only hit one enemy at a time no matter how wide your swings look, so attacking large groups of bad guys is really annoying (the little ankle-biters keep interrupting your combos against the big guys).-Despite how linear the game plays, it’s still possible to miss side quests because many of the quest items are randomly dropped. Cleared the whole area and didn’t find the special quest rock? Too bad for you, play through it again.-You can’t see the enemy’s life (except for bosses) and most bad guys seem to have a ton of life. This is probably intentional to force players to use the critical hit system more, but it means every fight seems artificially prolonged. Should it really take 50 hits to kill an orc?Overall, the game is fun (when it’s working) if you enjoy hack and slash and want to dive once again into Lord of the Rings lore, but there’s a lot of room for improvement. The fact that there are 3 playable character classes is reason for replay, but from what I’m told they’re mostly the same. If this game is in your backlog you should push it back in favor of something better, but it’s worth playing eventually: IF you have an nVidia graphics card. The game’s developers have abandoned the project so the crashing/low frame rate issues will not be fixed. The 90% of the game that I got to experience was sort of fun. "

												Multiply my ""hours on record"" by 2 or so to get closer to the real amount of time I've so far spent with this game.Greatly underrated game. While certainly not perfect, it does its job really well of delivering a battle-heavy stroll through really beautiful and atmospheric locations of War of the Ring Middle-Earth, following a plot that is simple and yet of some very respectable quality. Gameplay is straightforward click/key-to-hit combat with a number of abilities based on button combos. While the characters do not always respond optimally, a few hours of play and you'll be more than at ease as you go toe to toe with big nasties. A regular stat & talent-tree based progression with unlockables as well as upgradeable equipment give it the little RPG flavor that deepens gameplay a bit, without complicating things too much or making the game try to be something other than it is: a very decent hack and slash experience.The rendition of all the places we visit is beautiful due to how much personality and distinctiveness each environment has and the characters certainly work well, surprisingly being generally closer to book than film in terms of how they speak and behave, which is really pleasant. The focus on oft-neglected Book 1 environments (Barrow Downs, Fornost, Ettenmoors, Misty Mountains... with a very nice escape through Mirkwood) is also a very pleasant change from the usually inevitable tropes of Rohan and Mordor.While somewhat repetitive as all games of this type are, the game throws enough action and enough variety in enemies (from goblins to trolls all the way through uruks, savages, spiders...) to keep things interesting from the first level to the last. A good bunch of abilities and three quite different playable characters help in that regard.It was never game of the year material but it scores points for being a mostly well done product into which a lot of care has gone, despite its shortcomings and limitations. Very decent gameplay, beautiful environments, high quality music, interesting story moments. I recommend it. It deserves the follow-up that it will unfortunately never get.			"

Graphics on maximum are awful, there are not many resolution settings, and what's funny, to enter option you have to first click Settings and then a menu shows... with only 1 option which is ""OPTIONS"", why?

Do you really want it? 1) Yes, start the game 2) No"" Human character looks like actor from a cheap movie, fortunately you can change that.Dialogues are written very poorly, like game target was 10 yo children.Controlling game with mouse is irritating - Y axis is less sensitive than X.There are crates every-freaking-where, that you can destroy to get loot. It's like collecting beans in HARRY POTTER.When you run out of HP, your character starts crouching and enemies ignore you, even when you follow them.There are tons of invisible walls - 1 step of stairs, but approached from wrong way?

												The game feels as if they're just using the IP of Middle-earth for the sake of it (much like Shadow of Mordor). It's as generic as it comes for a game. It might as well have been a Dragon Age game and nobody would notice a difference.The gameplay itself gets fairly repetitive. You take control of one of three characters and do the same thing over and over until the level is finished. You level up as you progress and get better gear (though it feels like they've taken a generic RPG element and just thrown it in). But the other two characters you don't play as also level up alongside you. So eventually they're completely outmatched by the enemies and you need to gear them up. This requires you to actually log out and log back in as the new character... you can't just switch between them or gear them from one character.There is also a part where the game just decides to ramp up the difficulty for no reason. It's a random spike of difficulty out of nowhere. You have to protect a gate from two trolls, who can take it out in about 15 - 20 seconds. Problem is, they just ignore you and run right past you, even when you're stabbing at them. I had to wait until the game glitched and the trolls froze on the spot before I could beat it, because the DPS you'd need to take them out before they reach the door only a few feet away is way beyond what you'd be expected to have by that point.There is no way to save manually, so sometimes you'll waste a lot of time fighting a load of enemies, want to save but you can't until the end of that section, which could be anywhere, you don't know. And if the game crashes (more on that further down), you've wasted all of your time.AI is pretty stupid. If you get taken out, you get a chance for your teammates to help you back up. But half of the enemies interrupt them before they can get you up fully, so you have to wait. Instead of them killing the enemy then trying again, they just keep going in a loop of try to help, get interrupted, try to help, get interrupted, and then eventually die. Sometimes they'll just run into the enemies that killed you, get trapped in them and just keep trying to run at you with no success.But the reason it gets a solid 'no' recommendation is just because of all of the graphical problems. Some levels (like the Barrow-downs) are so glitchy that the game will crash all the time. My own PC is high-end and takes punishment from any other game without issue, it just puts out some heat. But even on the lowest settings, this game creates graphical glitches (weird glowing and static-looking graphical elements) or just crashes to desktop. It's not the sort of thing you expect from a game.Overall, a buggy game that feels like it's just been given a LotR coat of paint and brings nothing to the table that other games of the same type don't do already. A cash-grab that relies on Middle-earth fans (who, ironically, will cringe at the lore-breaking elements, like American accents, a dragon, and constant use of eagles).Edit: I recently just found this in my ""Unfinished"" section. After loading it up, I remember why. I'm currently stuck in a part called ""Carn Dum"". It's basically a load of blood-filled sewers. However, the game is not coded well enough to run properly. It crashes every single time you try to just walk through the game. That's all. Just walking will crash it. It can even crash your entire PC, not just the graphics driver, so watch out when playing this game. It's a damn liberty.Steer clear of this mess.			"

												***** ATI USERS BEWARE, AS OTHERS ALREADY MENTIONED, THIS GAME ISN'T OPTIMIZED FOR YOUR CARDS AND IT WILL RANDOMLY CRASH. NEAR THE END OF THE GAME IT WILL CONSTANTLY CRASH. *****^ I didn't know that before i start this game, so it dissapointed me.The game itself is a casual RPG game, a nice way to spend an evening or two. Nothing special.It's somewhat repetitive with the battles but nothing tragic. It's fun and simple.Not recommended for ATI users as well. Near the end it was literally unplayable because it was crashing constantly at Carn Dûm, stuttering and it was full of artifacts. I tried many guides with the hope it can be fixed, but nothing helped significantly. And some guides suggested to update bios or install older drivers. Of course i wouldn't go so far and put my self into such trouble for this game. I managed to complete it, by giving my save files to a friend of mine with nvidia so he could pass the point where my game was unplayable.Anyway, despite the terrible optimization, the game is okay, has okay graphics, it's a bit slow with the dialogs. Wouldn't spend money on it though, maybe when it is -85% off. If you have money and nvidia, take it. "

												THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE WITH AMD GRAPHICS CARD DRIVERS!!! Crashes in Chapter 2+ completely impeding progress! if you're not using an AMD GPU you may be fine? I am not able to test this. Buy at your own risk!---My actual Review---This game is fun. I have enjoyed the 6 or so hours I've played of this game tremendously. Running around, looking forevery secret is right up my alley.Combat is a little strange because there's almost no indication of you taking damage other than your healthbar decreasing sometimes. Other than that one quirk, this is a solid game, and I'd rate it a 4/5.The driver conflictions with newer AMD drivers than old 2012 drivers, however, make this game completely unplayable. I have crashed once in the boss room in chapter 1 and 5 times in the Barrow-Downs in the beginning of Chapter 2. It's completely unplayable.If you're using an AMD GPU Don't even bother buying the game. It simply isn't worth the hassle of downgrading and upgrading every time you wanna play the game.Unfortunately, due to this critical flaw, the game is a 0/5 for me as it's unplayable. Such a shame.

Quizás es el primer juego que no es que no lo recomiendo, sino que advierto, no os lo compreis, perdereis el dinero.Hago una review ya que decidi intentar pasarme el juego de nuevo esta vez en solitario, y es más de lo mismo, el juego para tarjetas  ATI no es funcionable, da igual que tengas un pepino de pc, no te molestes, se te bloqueará, llegué hasta el último capitulo, y alli ni jugando a 800 x 600.Existe un manera de arreglarlo, y es downgradear la tarjeta a la version 12.6 de drivers de ATI, que son cuando salió el juego. Como comprendereis, no me da la gana hacer eso, y por supuesto, sigo sin recomendar el juego y le planto el primer 0. Un juego mal hecho.0/10			"

												A big ""boo"" to Snowblind for absolute lack of support. This game is full of bugs and i haven't been able to finish it without at least 10 crashes and occasional gameplay bugs in each playthrough. Finished the game four times, just for the info. Crashes should be less frequent with nVidia GPUs but they're still nonetheless. I mysef have experienced somewhat horrible experience on different AMD GPUs, especially in the last level, the Carn Dum fortress.The game itself is a fine coop rpg, and hadn't it been for all the crashing, i would have had recommended it. Had some fun playing with a friend, until it started crashing for him (with nVidia GPU) in the Barrow Downs. Shame on you, Snowblind.			"

												Do not buy this game. It crashes constantly for a lot of people including myself. Once you get to the second chapter you start to see odd glitchy visuals then crashes. It happens every single time, right on time after Chapter 1. It crases randomly as well. The only real fix so far, is to go back to an older driver on your gpu. Like who wants to do that crap? Which means you can only play that one game until you're finished. Then you can upgrade back to normal. What a crock man. Awesome game that was poorly optimised and never patched. Yeah great Dev support there. Why does everything suck? Since I am past the idiotic 2-hour mark, I am stuck with this piece of trash. Sigh.			"

												If your are playing this as a single player it might work, however if you are interested in playing this with a friend or two, abandon ♥♥♥♥. Theres plenty of working co-op games out there and this is not one of them.Here is some of the problems you will face if you try to play this game in co-op:The game features its own voice chat function which works so poorly that you will not be able to understand a single word because of the bad sound quality. THERE IS ALSO NO WAY TO DISABLE IT. I had to download a virtual adio cable program just so I could actually chat with a friend using another program while playing.If you were lucky enough to get into another players game, buckle up for strange crashes, disconnects when visiting windows and a good spike in your blood pressure every time you try to give an item to your friend. It will most likely vanish into thin air. Getting used to the menus will take longer than I ever put into this game since they are made for a controller. There is mouse support but much of it is just nonsense.I will have to say that the game supports alt + f4 so escaping its horrors is quick and easy.			"

												This game uses steam's built in voice chat system to create a poor quality call between you and the people you are attempting to play co-op with. This wouldn't be that big of a deal if you had any way to disable or mute this call and use higher quality software, but no were is this possible. The only way me and my friends found to diable the in game voice chat was to install an external program and trick steam into using it as a recording device. This resulted in several in game glitches such as one were a voice would repeatedly say the phrase ""Trial"" every 10 to 15 seconds. We propably spent an hour trying to get this game set up to play co-op and because of that it cannot receive a recomendation. I also feel as if more people need to be aware of this issue before they go to purchase the game.			"

												While this game eyes great, it does have a lot of potential. However, various things deny that potential. 5 second knockdowns, your companions blocking your way, no flinching upon being hit resulting in just dropping dead, litte logic within the story line and to much a linear way to play.Also, having to choose a single class and the game forcing you to play that class till the end of the game, since all the fancy equipment you gave to your AI companions will be gone when you select them. Making sure that once you change, you've got no way to match the equipment to that level, unless you buy yourself the equipment, which is only possible after  you've reached Rivendell. All in all, if the devs payed some more time upon developing the game, it would've been recommendable and enjoyable. Now it's just a frustrating experience I must add. So, if you're looking for a decent Lord of the Rings slasher, I'd suggest playing the games made 10 years ago, or the somewhat newer Middle Earth: Shadows of Mordor.			"

												The ever-expanding Lord of the Rings franchise is one that I constantly find to be treading the treacherous line between gratuitousness and sincere narrative expansion. It remains my fantasy world of choice, and offers an incredibly rich setting in which to stage new adventures and exploits of novel characters. Developer Snowblind (known for RPGs Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance and Champions of Norrath: Realms of EverQuest, among others) brought us War in the North, following a previously unseen band of heroes concurrent with the events of the Fellowship, much in the same vein as EA’s The Third Age back in 2004.Tolkien's vision was of such wide scope that I have absolutely zero problem with this premise, and could happily see it repeated time and time again. In my opinion the source material allows for a massive degree of expansion, which some games have captured extremely well. War in the North, however, is not one of them.It’s a hack-and-slash action-RPG wherein you control your choice of an Elf mage, a heavy-handed dwarf with an axe, or the quintessentially rugged Ranger. You are tasked with dealing with Sauron’s forces in the North of Middle Earth, preventing his self-proclaimed right-hand man Agandaur from gaining influence while the Fellowship proceeds south. You’ll bump into familiar faces along the way, gaining experience from fallen enemies to acquire new combat skills and purchasing more powerful gear, which can also be found in chests scattered around levels.Progression is simple through the segmented areas, and NPCs offer sidequests should you speak to them in each hub area, usually with the promise of a small reward.As I said, there’s more than enough imagination to go around, but I hate to see the wonder I had instilled in me through reading about Middle Earth abused to shoehorn subpar titles into the marketplace, it really gets to me on a personal level. All the licensed characters are here, Frodo, Gandalf, everyone you’d want to see, but the Lord of the Rings experience feels entirely lacking. The great strength of that mythos is the magnificence of the world; Tolkien's description was so vivid in his attempts to express the beauty and wild danger of the land.Unfortunately very little of this feeling is captured in War in the North - textures and colours are dull and flat even at maxed settings. Furthermore, the lack of detail was apparent to the point where I was having difficulty distinguishing 1080p from 720p resolution, something that is usually night and day in other titles. There was little variation models and level design is utterly uninspired, even over the range of environments that are present. Getting through the game simply consists of ‘kill a load of things, collect loot, kill a load more things, collect loot’, with little in the way of variety in enemy design or challenge.Furthermore, there is very little use of licensed music which was always one of the strengths of Peter Jackson’s cinematic imagining. Instead the score is bland and repetitive, not distinctly bad by any means but certainly unremarkable. On the note of sound, many elements of the game’s story are told through cutscenes; while they are rendered in-game using your character’s specific gear sets which is something I actively like to see, the voice acting is just embarrassing on the whole, with the main cast sounding bored and uninterested. It’s a shame too because the eagle that comes to accompany you on your adventure was cast exceptionally well, being portrayed by the talented John Patrick Lowrie, whom you may have heard as The Sniper in Team Fortress 2, among other roles. Unfortunately the supporting characters generally do not share this fate - Elrond, Bilbo, Gandalf, all of them sound dull, sadly.All that being said, there are a few features that salvage War in the North from the maw of worthlessness. For all the combat was highly repetitive, it was extremely fluid for the most part, and I enjoyed the fast pacing awarded by ‘Heroic Mode’. Essentially chaining blows without receiving damage increases your capability to deal it, which acts a preventative measure for simply mashing buttons, instead encouraging dodging and well-timed interrupts.I also liked the item system - drops from enemies and chests are entirely random, meaning that coming across a rare piece of loot gives a feeling of genuine excitement. Themed armour sets can be collected, and suitable gear elements can be adorned with elfstones to provide additional stat bonuses should you need them. Herbs and other flora can be collected around the game world and combined through a limited crafting system to produce potions and items to aid you in battle, often providing powerful abilities such as enhanced strength for a short period of time.Unfortunately trying to produce an appealing Lord of the Rings game at this point is playing with fire, and I think Snowblind got singed. I do believe War in the North to be arguably adequate as an RPG in its own right, but it falls short of the admittedly very high standard that we have come to expect given the size of the fandom. Pick it up if you want a fast-paced RPG to have fun with, but be aware that no new ground is being broken, and for a Tolkein-esque narrative you’ll definitely want to look elsewhere. "

												There don't seem to be many detailed reviews, so I will try to write one for everyone. Though I feel it is going to get thumbs downed a lot because I am not a die-hard LOTR fan and I don't kiss the franchises ♥♥♥.The ReviewIts a good game, but I thought there would be a lot more to it. The ending and the entire story really feels irrelavent to the actual story.I was also expecting the story to be much much longer, seeing as how it would play in the timeline of the 3 movies, but instead the game didn't take long to beat at all, or at least not as long as I had expected.This game took me 11 hours to beat, and about 8 hours of that is gameplay, while the other 3 hours is storyline.Seeing as how you meet the fellowship before they depart, I thought you would be a group that played a part in the movie, but were more in the background, sort of like you had a part in the story that the books and the movie didn't show. The in-game map shows all of the locations of the LOTR, Helms Deep, Mordor, The Shire, etc.I thought we'd take part in the battle at Helms Deep, that maybe we would fight some Orcs/Goblins that had followed Frodo and Sam, without their knowledge, as they were about to destroy the ring. I thought we would be able to explore places like the Shire and some of the other major places in LOTR. But instead, you go everywhere EXCEPT those places.By the end, I feel like the War in the North and all of what is done in this game is irrelavent. Like it played no part in the main story, like it added nothing important to it. You have this ""right hand"" of Saruan, Leader, but I'd think that if he was that important, powerful, and in charge, he would've been mentioned in the movies or books, so adding this enemy seemed pointless.Overall Cons- The gameplay is quite annoying, feeling clunky and based on button mashing.- You can tell the game was built on the purpose of co-op. seeing as how everytime you switch characters, your previous characters gear is changed to a default kind of gear, so you cant set other characters gear unless you are playing as them.You also cannot switch characters as you please, you can only switch between chapters, so you may as well stick to 1 character throughout your entire solo playthrough.- The Orcs all feel the same, like a bunch of brutes, and all take 7-10 hits to kill, EACH. Which makes it frusterating and boring when you're fighting large groups of orcs.- There is no build with any of the characters or their friendship. They are simply 3 travelers who decide to fight the war in the north. There is no character build, no relationship built by the 3, and all of their personalities are the SAME.* Remember how Legolas and Gimili had that funny relationship where they would have a contest of who would kill more orcs in a battle?* Remember how Legolas and Arigorn had a brotherly kind of relationship?* Remember how Arigorn and Gimili had that semi funny moment where Gimili asked Arigorn to toss him over to the bridge at Helms Deep, then said ""Don't tell the elf!""?* Remember when Gimili tried to jump across a bridge, that he thought he could make, while a demon was chasing them and when he jumped he almost fell, and Legolas grabbed him to save him and Gimili yelled ""not the beard!""?The point is, there was relationships built within the fellowship. Here, there is NONE! No relationship, no friendship build at all! You will end the game not caring at all about ANY of the charaters, except maybe the birds.I was looking for the dwarf to have that battle-thristy personality, the elf to have the wise personality, and the human to have the smart and careful personality. But instead, they all have the same, bland, boring, personality.- Your AI teammates can be quite annoying when they are struggling to revive you or your companion, or when the elf wont heal you when you're 1 hit away from death, or sometimes they will not follow because of 1 single enemy so when you run into another group you'll be left struggling while they sit back with their thumbs up their ♥♥♥ trying to kill this 1 single orc archer that they cant hit or kill and once you are down they will take forever to actually reach you since they are now the prime targets of the group of orcs that just murdered you dead.Pros- Its semi-fun to play. I played it solo, so its probably better with co-op.- Its cool getting to meet most of the fellowship before they leave onto their quest.- The leveling up system is pretty nice, like any other RPG game.- Has NG+ so when you start a new playthrough, you don't lose all your gear or your level(s).OverallMaybe my expectations were too high, maybe my standards were too high, but I am very bummed out about how this game turned out and how it ended and the time it took for me to beat it.I recommend to get this game while it is on sale. Maybe its because i'm not a die hard fan of LOTR and I am not an ♥♥♥-kisser to the franchise, but to me, this game is a MAJOR disappointment, and not worth $20. I bought it on sale, and I think its a good game if its worth $5 - $10. But this game is NOT all that it is made out to be. Its good, and I reccomend buying it when its on sale. At full price? No.Rating: 4/10 "

												Finally I found out what ended the battle for Middle-earth. General with the movie/book is small, but the principles are the same. We play for the 3 characters: archer, dwarf and mage. Not very convenient that you can not switch between them during the game, but a year the game makes itself felt.Very glad to meet some of the characters from the book, who did not even change the name.The game looks like a normal RPG world. Do not expect that it will surprise you greatly and will show you the amazing mechanics...If you like the world of Lord of the Rings or just like to run around with a sword and chop enemies, then this game is for you. I look forward to any official reissues with the current mechanics and graphics.			"

Less of a game experience and just a interactive pass time.It also stopped loading for me for some odd reason :/If your not super into LOTR then give this game a miss and purchase something else.+ Kills feel pretty satisfying+ Adds to LOTR universe- Buggy- Uninspired- Bad design choices4/10			"

												This game is a complete technical mess. For one it forces Steams' VOIP with no option to turn it off, and exaggeratingly adds enviromental audio for caves and caverns and such, which makes everything sound jagged and awful. It also crashes alot, and the save system for co-op is awful to the point where we couldn't continue our playthrough in chapter 3. The technical side aside, the combat system is basic but somewhat fun, the inventory system is really bad and screams console game. The voice overs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful and cringy. I can't see myself playing this singleplayer and only when really drunk would consider co-op fun.In short, this game does NOT deserve a ""very positive"" overall rating. Avoid even at heavy discounts.			"

												You can consider yourself lucky if your game hasn't crashed while in-game without a recent save.The game(play) itself is good, the combat is enjoyable and satisfying. But with the bugs and crashes, this game is a dislike from me.The crashes happen at random times, and it's annoying if you haven't recently saved the game, as you'll have to repeat again to the spot where you was when it crashed. When you go down, both AI try and help you, therefor drawing the attention of enemies to the reviver, and getting knocked down while being revived. Terrible AI, they cannot navigate very well.I'm on a low-end video card (Radeon R7 240 2GB) and I can run this on Max settings, including Motion Blur, etc at 1600x1200 with decent fps. The mouse movement is terrible, it's jaggy and I can't spin/turn fast without getting confused.It can get repetitive, but at times you forget it's getting repetitive and continue.Gameplay 7.2/10Stability (Bugs & Crashes) 3/10AI 4/10			"

												Right off the bat, I will admit that I didn't play this game. Because of that, I can't give you a good review. However, the reason that I was unable to play the game was because I was doing so with my friend, while talking over skype. However, the game decided that the best matter of course for this game was to force you to use steam voice chat, because it was certain that steam voice chat was better. There was no setting, nothing that you could change to alter this, so we were forced to use steam voice chat. That was fine, however the game also decided that, because it would ""increase immersion"" or whatever it thought, that it would change the properties of the microphone depending on the scenery. For example, the microphone would be normal in a tavern, EXTREMELY quiet in the rain, and EXTREMELY echoey(?) in a cave. GG, Snowblind. GG.			"

Combat is surprisingly satisfying, and although this game gives me literal cancer, I had a good time playing it with my buddy. If you pay 10 bucks or less for it, I'd say you got your monies worth.Otherwise... well you might be a bit upset.			"

												Do not buy this game, until Steam gives us the option to turn off their crappy voice chat.  You can not use Curse/Vent/TS/etc while playing this game and will get insane echoing as Steam forces its godawful voice chat into the mix.  This game seems so great, but sadly if you want to play with friends, it just completely destroys the game.  I am soooo ♥♥♥♥♥♥ right now.This is not just me, google search and you will find so many others with the same issue.			"

												You can consider yourself lucky if your game hasn't crashed while in-game without a recent save.The game(play) itself is good, the combat is enjoyable and satisfying. But with the bugs and crashes, this game is a dislike from me.The crashes happen at random times, and it's annoying if you haven't recently saved the game, as you'll have to repeat again to the spot where you was when it crashed. When you go down, both AI try and help you, therefor drawing the attention of enemies to the reviver, and getting knocked down while being revived. Terrible AI, they cannot navigate very well.I'm on a low-end video card (Radeon R7 240 2GB) and I can run this on Max settings, including Motion Blur, etc at 1600x1200 with decent fps. The mouse movement is terrible, it's jaggy and I can't spin/turn fast without getting confused.It can get repetitive, but at times you forget it's getting repetitive and continue.Gameplay 7.2/10Stability (Bugs & Crashes) 3/10AI 4/10			"

												Epically disappointing. The multi player just froze and if you play single player, it DOES NOT allow you to switch your three characters in play, or save any skills points. So you have one character who is strong and the others are weak, which ends up putting you no position to kill the first orc....ahhhh facepalm. If I was the designer of this game, I would hide under a rock, what a rip off.			"

												This game isn't the greatest, the story is Ok i guess and the gameplay is kinda fun. The problem with the game is that it is SO buggy. On some of the last levels i ran with around 3 FPS compared to my 40 FPS in the rest of the game. Some boss fights can bug out and it is very game breaking.Overall i would say if you really like these type of hack'n'slash games enjoy but don't expect a master piece.			"

												Absolute dreck. Repetitive, average hack-n-slash gameplay, unfair checkpoints, bad-barebones dialogue; on top of that, the game suffers from MAJOR technical issues: this game keeps crashing to desktop and features poor graphics, it's basically UNPLAYABLE if you don't downgrade your video card controllers, but I refuse to go that far, because this is such a boring, unremarkable/unimportant game; a complete mess and one of the biggest disappoinments I've ever experienced: I was looking for a good LOTR game but instead I threw away some good money FOR NOTHING. I'd give it a 2,5/5 stars if the game was actually playable; as it stands it's an insulting 0/0, in other words a BIG NOTHING.			"

												Starts off nice and hack and slash, doesn't give you much variation in attack styles. Whichever character you pick you're still left either at the mercy of your cohorts to revive you or trying to revive them which during battle soon gets old. I've only had this on the drive for a couple of hours and already contemplating removing it. The difficulty is far too steep and there is no incentive to keep trying once you've started to shout expletives at the game. Shame because the graphics aren't bad who doesn't like the LOTR characters and world, if only they'd belended this one with Shadow of Mordor (which in my opinion lacked a variation in enemies despite being fun to play).

												When I bought the game Lord of the rings: war in the north I thought it would be a more background story about what happened in the north mention by Gandalf in the film. If the armies in the north were not stopped, there would be no victory. Unfortunately, I will never find out what happened by playing the game because every time after a save my game crashes. It can happen that a game crashes but after every save is too much for me. I want to play but the game does not allow me. So I dont recommend it. "

This causes so many problems and there is no quick easy fix for this. All I wanted to do is play this game coop with a friend and chat on skype like we do with dozens of other games.

												Me and my friend bought the game and started co-op a couple of days ago.There weren't any problems, we have played it around 3 hours, it was really good fun.Then, the next day, my friend tried to launch the game, BUT HE COULDN'T.Because he has Win8 on his pc and this causes several different problems, according to the forums, etc.I have some questions in my mind now.First, if this game isn't compatible with Win8, how come we played the game for 3 hours without any problems?Second, we always try to buy the original copies of the games on Steam instead of cracked ones from the Internet, and still we have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ technical issues with the games. Can't you just prepare a single update for all these problems?It seems, no. "

												This was a very enjoyable game to play with my friend, until the last level, at which point the walls flashed colors and I got disconnected and had to progress in single player, still fighting bugs and glitches. I beat the boss with him, and we started the next difficulty. A side quest glitched and we couldn't complete it, but mainly it went the same as before, with me struggling to checkpoint my way through to the final boss. On the third an final difficulty, however, I got more bugs than ever before, all ending in a whopping save glitch that returned me to halfway through the first playthrough. My friend is on the doorstep of the final boss on the highest difficulty, and while I should be there with him, I'm all the way back, more than half his level, unable to join him unless I wade through a see of bugs again. This game is so full of unfixed bugs it's ridiculous. It's a fun game, but not fun enough to play through again without my friend.2/10, would not buy again.			"

												I first bought this at Gamestop for my 360 to check it out and see if it was any good. I played previous SnowBlind games, but I'm not a Lord of the Rings fan at all. But what I played of the used copy convinced me to pay it forward so to speak. I went back to Gamestop and changed it in for a real copy and paid the exta money. I very much enjoyed the game when I played it on the 360. I thought the combat was fun as well as the archery. I don't play the mage class so I can't say anything about that. I enjoy open world games the best. Like The Elder Scrolls and Grand Theft Auto. Fallout and what not. This game gives a slight feeling of open world but it does give you direction. And people will like that also. Not knowing what to do in a game is not fun.The difficulty seems fair. I'm not that great at video games, and found normal a fun, fair challenge.I will soon find out if the xbox 360 controller works for this game. The controller worked fine! Nice.So this is the 2nd time buying this game. Even though I played it twice on the 360. Warrior and Rouge class. Very fun.I played co op with my cousin on Xbox Live. I think we played through the whole game. But I can't remember for sure. Very fun game to play with a friend.It's fun co op or single player! I would give this game a try, It is not a masterpiece. The story pulled me in, even though I'm not a fan, and with the combination of great gameplay equals a great adventure!			"

												Very fun and  well written game that unfortunately suffers from horrid engine programming. Even with the best CPU and/or graphics card in your system, there are parts of this game that will slowly gobble up your system resources like your fat uncle on Thanksgiving! CPU usage will max out in graphics-intense areas while GPU won't be utilized properly, you'll suffer from crashes, and nearly unplayable spots. It's really a shame the engine doesn't perform better, because the gameplay and writing are great.			"

												WotN is a basic action-rpg, with simple mechanics. My friends and I got this game for the coop (which is basically the only reason why this game is played).The game has lots of flaws: combat is repetitive (but somehow fun), skilltrees lack coherence, graphics are pretty bad, levels are poorly designed and full of invisible walls, and dialogues are a pain to hear.However, War in the North isn't a bad game: coop really is fun, and I could recommend it for coop games with friends, but let me tell why I won't: this game is the buggiest I've ever seen, really.First, enemy animations are broken in multiplayer. It's not a big deal during combat but it can break immersion. Random disconnects often occur; when they happen, the only thing you can do is rehosting the game, hoping your progression since the last checkpoints has been saved. Because, yes, this game has no manual save and you have to rely on autosave, which sometimes make you lose your experience and items, for whatever reason.Optimization is pretty bad. Graphics are ugly, but I still had unstable framerate, visual glitchs (like the white blinking screen which, as a bonus, gives headaches), and random freezes/stuttering. I don't have an AMD card, but I also read on the internet that some areas are unplayable for AMD users. Some players also reported that some visual glitches corrupted their drivers and they had to reinstall them.Also, if you communicate with Skype during gaming, the game may cause heavy lag on Skype. I don't know how, why, but it happens.My friends and I struggled with all those bugs and others for hours. Then the game caused a blue screen on the host's computer; it was the last straw, and we decided to quit playing this game.I wish this game was better, or at least, free of game-breaking bugs. I'm a huge Tolkien fan, and I'd like to say I loved this game and I recommend it, but this game is a scam, really. Don't buy it, you'll regret it.			"

												I've played this game together with a friend. It took us around 15 hours to finish the missions. The game was incredibly enjoyable for as long as it lasted, but 15 minutes of gameplay is not worth the price. The dialogues are a bit stale, as are the faces of the characters. At a certain moment, two brothers come and help you, whose sprites are litterally the same. They're like clones O_o. The hack and slash element of the game and the challenges of defeating strong foes are VERY enjoyable, however. It'd be great if there was a seperate 'open world' part of this game, so that the content would last more than 15 hours. (we were offered to do exactly the same missions on a harder game mode, but that's just meh). If you are looking for a fantasy game that you can play together with 1 or 2 mates, I'd recommend it. Otherwise, it's not worth the cash.			"

												Bite Size Review - Lord of the Rings: War in the NorthThe Good:+ The dialoge and lore that characters have and speak to you about+ You can play as one of three unique classes + Story is interesting+ Graphics are on the old side, but still look ok+ Lots of loot+ You get to meet several characters from the film and they actually have a good amount to say and it is interesting+ Gameplay is simple but can still hold upThe Bad:- This is kind of a dealbreaker, I have a modern PC (runs New Doom 2016 on Highest settings etc) and this game slows down and crashes more times than is acceptableThe Verdict:So I just finished playing this game, and I have to say it was fun. You get to see some new places and some familar ones from the movies. You also get to meet and actually have meaningful conversations with characters from the movies and they actually talk a decent amount, it was really interesting to talk to them and learn more about the LotR universe. So I would classify this game as an average action role playing game, with great lore. All good stuff.Unfortunatly this is where I must tell you that this game crashed on me probably every 30 - 40 minutes and slowdowns in certain areas for no reason I could figure out. I just got a new computer recently, it runs the new doom at max settings 60 fps - now granted, I did switch to an AMD graphics card this time around (not Nvidia) so this may have something to do with it, or it may be windows 10, I am not sure. I tried to fix the usual ways I tend to fix these issues with other older games like using compatability modes etc. this but was unsucessful, forcing me to restart the game and just try to force my way through the crashy bits. But yeah, with the technical problems I ran into... even with the fun I had with the game, I can not recommend it. If it did not have these technical issues I could definitely recommend the game though for the lore, I really enjoyed that part of this game a lot. But with it's tachnical issues I will say ""buyer beware"" and leave it at that.			"

												8/10 - Great game, which I sadly cant compare to any LotR games, because this was my first. The storyline is interesting on its own and even more when you think about what is hapenning in the rest of the world (LotR trilogy storyline). The gameplay is fun and unlocked skill can make it even little variable. Combat wont change much since the start, but that isnt for bad. The only things which really *** experience are bugs. Can't speak for the singleplayer, but some parts of campaign in multiplayer can with constant disconnecting discourage players from finishing the rest of the game.			"

												Don't buy it, it's really bad game. With only few types of enemies, each one similar to nother, with bad pace, poorly hit points systems (you must hit an enemy like 5 times before you are able to do  critical hit, but he hits you and if you dodge - you loose streak, if you parry - you lose streak, if you get hit - you know). Most enemies knock you prone - like 5 seconds out of game waiting to get up. A single troll (there are fights with three of them at once) can defeat a party simply by knocking them and never letting them get up. That's not fair.There are two things good bout this game: the setting (North of Middle Earth) and Rangers of the North (I like them, they are nice:) ).			"

												The game itself is really fun, especially in co-op, but... The fact that getting through chapter 8 is an IMPOSSIBILITY, because the game (in a best-case-scenario) crashes, or (worst case) locks up ypur computer and crashes windows.A possible workaround (for AMD cards using 12.6 drivers) is possible, but any semi-recent card won´t support this driver fully, and it will most definately make all your other daily work/play suffer. I´ve also read that playing in windowed mode could help, but made no difference for me.Rollig back your VGA drivers for one game to work is not a solution.With that in mind this game gets an 0/10, a horrible example. Shame on you Snowblind studios.Don´t touch this game, even with a 10"" pole. And if you do, make sure this game gets the poopiest end of said stick.(edited out profanity)			"

												Para todo el que esperaba un remake o continuación de los beat'em up de LOTR para PS2 de este juego, lamento decirles que lo único que va a hacer es decepcionarlos. Lo digo con certeza por que yo era uno de ellos ... Basicamente le agregarón mas features de un RPG, como loot, inventario, etc. O sea es mas como un Diablo en tercera persona, ambientado en tierra media, que un beat'em up viejo y querido digamos. Eso estaría genial si hubiera estado bien hecho, pero la verdad por mas que el juego en si es solido, no agrega nada al genero y la historia es generica en el mejor de los casos. Aparte, como no el juego no se decide por un genero, ninguna de las 2 partes esta bien hecha digamos. Como sera que por mas fanatico de LOTR que soy, no lo pude terminar del embole ...			"

												   This is one of the CRASHIEST games I have ever played. The gameplay is not incredibly outstanding but its fun, until it CRASHES. The story is almost compleately unrelated to the movies or books (which I consider a good thing since most people have seen the movies or read the books) and is therefore mostly original yet still feels like lord of the rings, so its entertaining despite being brokeden up by regular CRASHES. The levels look like they might be fun to explore, at least once with each character, if I wasn't in a hurry to make it to the next save point before the inevitable CRASH. Its fun to walk around framiliar locations and talk to characters from the original story (books/movies) aften learning new things I didn't know before (that may or may not be canon), that is until... you guesed it: a CRASH.    Overall I am not dissapointed with my perchase, but I got it on sale for $4.99 or something and can not recomend it unless it is on sale (or they fix the crash issue).			"

												I started playing this game with very low expectations. It didn’t seem all that impressive from the trailers so I just said to myself: “Yet another one of EA’s attempts to milk the Lord of the Rings cash cow.”A couple of hours of hacking orcs with a friend changed my view of the game drastically. The first and most important thing you should know about the game is this: Do NOT expect a fun solo experience. This game is meant to be played with a friend or if at all possible, two.It is at its best when you are communicating with your friends in order to take down tough enemy groups and help each other survive difficult encounters.A lot of people are complaining about the simplicity of its design, but honestly, that’s what makes it work so well. The combat is straightforward and impactful (I suggest a gamepad but mouse and keyboard controls work well also) and the looting is surprisingly fun.War in the North won’t make you care too much about its story though. It isn’t very memorable or interesting in any way for that matter. This could have been improved upon by having the player actually make meaningful decisions. Unfortunately, the dialogue options seem to be there just to give you a little more information if you really want it.From a graphical point of view, the game is quite ok. You won’t be amazed by it, but occasionally, you might find yourself nodding to a slow motion decapitation or some other small detail (like how the snow sticks you your armor after you roll through it).This is indeed the grittiest Lord of the Rings game released and it feels great. If you wanted a more mature and accurate video game based on Tolkien’s books, this might be your thing.The sound is so and so. The music is great as always but the voice acting really put me to sleep. The greatest thing about it is the built in voice chant. It actually takes into account things like the distance between characters and the environment. For example, if a friend is in a cave and talks to me, his voice will have an echo. (I don’t think I’ve ever encountered a game with a similar feature)Is it a good game? Hell yeah! If you are a fan of co-op games, it will be hard to be disappointed with War in the North.I'd say an 8 out of 10 would be the grade. Not that it matters.  "

												A surprisingly good game for Middle Earth fan. The story is correct, its what you expect from that universe.The combat is quite simple but still satisfying after you master the crit and roll system.Even alone i have enjoyed a lot, but it is certainly a great co-op game.For me its a 7/10.Its above average but not a master piece for sure.Having played many game on Middle Earth + the Third age mod on medieval 2 and seen the lord of the ring, i was able to situate myself in the map and know what they were talking about.

												Honestly... The game could of been harder, people are saying it needs co-op... Honestly... That's what this game lacks. This was a big let down for me as I have played other LOTR games that were much better than this... It seems they whipped up the story line as fast as they could, the acting was horribly done and the story was far too breif. The action combat style of the game was the only thing good about it. However, the AI was dumber than previous LOTR games. I would of loved to give this game a great review, but it didn't quite reach my expectations as a LOTR game.Sure you take a good amount of damage if you're hit, which is why people probably find this game moderatly hard, but honestly, that's all it was. They hit you hard, and harder on higher difficulties. The AI did not get smarter, just simply, your health pool took more damage. So if you know how to strike and move, this game is beyond easy...So mainly what I'm disliking the game for is...1. Dumb AI2. Very breif storyline3. Extremely easy4. (Just throwing this out there) I expected more mobs. There wasn't that many to fight, and they came in small waves that were easily controlled.What's good about the game?1. Combat Style			"

												[STORY]✮✮✮✰✰ [GAMEPLAY]✮✮✮✰✰[REPLAYABILITY]✮✮✰✰✰[GAMEPLAY HOURS]6+ (Potentially 10+ to complete the entire story)""Lord of the Rings: War in the North is an action RPG that takes place alongside the story of the LOTR Trilogy. You can choose from three distinct characters to play as: Farin, the dwarf champion, Eradan, the human ranger, or Andriel, the elf mage. Each of these characters has their own unique fighting style and can attack both in melee and ranged. The game features a stat and skill system not unlike the Mass Effect series where you can upgrade certain abilities to your own preferred style of combat. The story puts you in pursuit of Agandaur, dark lord servant of Sauron, whose efforts may hinder the quest of the Fellowship of the Ring. In the game, you travel from notable locales from the books such as Bree, Sam Ford, and even the troll infested Etternmoors.The combat in this game feels very clunky and tiresome as combat abilities are restricted by both power cost and a cooldown timer. You certainly look heroic and cinematic as the animations of each sword swing and spell resemble that of the films, but the praise stops there. Alternating between 2-3 buttons, the combat feels repetitive and dull after the first few hours. Gameplay primarily consists of traveling from one zone to the next, defeating waves of enemies within a mostly linear path from objective to objective.War in the North features multiplayer, which may make the overall experience more enjoyable to some players. However, from a solo player standpoint, this game feels very grindy and ultimately not worth the frustration/boredom to continue playing simply to progress the plot.""			"

												Performance of the game:This game is a buggy mess.  I powered through a very bad bug in chapter 2 of the game that would have it randomly crash, took about 3 hours to pass a single section that should of took about 20 minutes, twice crashing seconds before triggering the saving in the game.  Most of the times it crashes it doesn't crash to desktop it blue screens my computer most of the time not giving a reason just something failed and the memory address of all “0”s and an x or 5 thrown in.  I have made it through chapter 7 with it crashing about every half hour and now in chapter 8 of the game I found another section that will crash every few minutes similar to chapter 2 of the game.  Now I have to quit.  The actual review of the game (based on when it is not crashing)one of the first things you get is a bird friend and you hit the 4 button to call for his aid.  Well the Elf character has a power that has you block and hit 4 (holding CTRL then hit 4).  even though the 4 icon has changed from the bird logo to a different logo, BOTH powers are used; the bird and area heal.  I wasted a lot of bird power trying to keep the other 2 friends alive.  Defense missions are the worst part, it goes fine until the enemy brings in the giant troll and he walk past you not caring that you are attacking him and then kills the thing you are protecting in 15 seconds.  I personally am more of a dodger power and like to dodge and not much blocking, I would of liked a double dodge (I only played the elf so I do not know if the other characters have a double dodge).  After facing a double sword enemy who is stabbing you so much that you can not dodge, I have learned to block against them just be for they attack and then attack them back.  Dialog was interesting even had a few points that you could try to tell some one that we are just passing through this very remote area to get to grandma's house (not exactly G ma’s house, but you are lieing about what you are doing so I thought it appropriate) and the NPC has non of that, but a very interesting choice to tell them.  Also there is a lot of repeat dialog choices that are represented as new choices.  Example: someone tells you of a castle; new option of the castle in dialog choices, npc just repeats the thing that brought up the new choice.  Combat was fun and interesting, slowly adding in new enemies over the 6 chapter's I played.  I would of loved to see how the ending turned out and if they kept adding new enemies through the end, but sadly the bugs and crashing my computer is enough to make me stop.			"

Lots of problems with freezing and crashing... many said it was due to the AMD drivers (the game publisher said also), but guess what... there are numerous others, with NVIDIA or other GPU and said the same thing.When I got to the end of the game, in the castle, the game completely crashed.So I decided to give my Intel GPU a run... with all the settings low, same thing... the game did not crash, but regular freezing was evident. This game is not optimised at all. Looking at the CPU cores, it only mastered one core...A big disappointment that I had to finish the game on my Intel GPU because the developers couldn't get it right... "

												I got hold of this game in the one of the recent humblebundles. The game wasn't so bad in the beginning. Co-op is realy fun if you grab two friends and discover the world together. The item and skill/spell system is similar to many other RPGs nothing special  here.The quests are shallow and very easily completed (bring me A, find and rescue B, talk to C and tell her that i love her... bleh)Levels are tube-like and will not even alter in the slightest ways if you replay them.On easy/norm your two companions will almost everytime revive you from the ""dead"" if you fall,  making  it impossible to die ere. On heroic/legendary they will almost always die themselves, i'd recommend you to  play  with friends  here.Stil, the game seems technically unfinished for some reasons- You can't turn off the ingame voice manually, so when you're used  to play  with teamspeak, vent or skype you have to turn this  off instead of the ingame voice which btw has a  horrible delay- About half of the PC users experience heavy  graphic problems. Minor ones in level 2 and to a point unplayable ones in level 8. Either your game will shut down or sometimes you end up in blue screen. I only got past this level by drawing my bow, zooming in and look on the ground. This prevented me from seeing the graphic bugs all over  and  my game from shutting down every 15 seconds - this issue has been out there from the release of this game. It has not gotten  any updates so far and i doubt it will ever. That's a cruel statement of the developers. They don't even care.All in all i had a couple of great hours, but i was glad when i finally got my 46th achievement, closed the game, clicked on ""delete local content"" and will never play this  game again.

												Gameplay itself is actually quite fun in co-op and the story is interesting (if not a little cliched), especially if you're a Tolkien fan. That said, there's several annoying bugs to be wary of. The game forces you to use Steam Voice in co-op, which is counter-intuitive in the likely scenario that you're already using a better form of voice communication. The game crashes frequently in graphically intensive situations, and this is a commonly reported issue for AMD card owners with post-HD5k era GPUs. The aggregate score of 66 seems fitting, as those looking for this type of game should enjoy it if they're willing to tolerate its issues. Get it when it's on sale.			"

												Don't buy it, it's really bad game. With only few types of enemies, each one similar to nother, with bad pace, poorly hit points systems (you must hit an enemy like 5 times before you are able to do  critical hit, but he hits you and if you dodge - you loose streak, if you parry - you lose streak, if you get hit - you know). Most enemies knock you prone - like 5 seconds out of game waiting to get up. A single troll (there are fights with three of them at once) can defeat a party simply by knocking them and never letting them get up. That's not fair.There are two things good bout this game: the setting (North of Middle Earth) and Rangers of the North (I like them, they are nice:) ).			"

												The game itself is really fun, especially in co-op, but... The fact that getting through chapter 8 is an IMPOSSIBILITY, because the game (in a best-case-scenario) crashes, or (worst case) locks up ypur computer and crashes windows.A possible workaround (for AMD cards using 12.6 drivers) is possible, but any semi-recent card won´t support this driver fully, and it will most definately make all your other daily work/play suffer. I´ve also read that playing in windowed mode could help, but made no difference for me.Rollig back your VGA drivers for one game to work is not a solution.With that in mind this game gets an 0/10, a horrible example. Shame on you Snowblind studios.Don´t touch this game, even with a 10"" pole. And if you do, make sure this game gets the poopiest end of said stick.(edited out profanity)			"

I recommend to better play ""Dark Souls"" or ""The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King"" or ""Shadow of Mordor"" if you want simmilar games.			"

It can`t hold up, mostly due to the fact all the characters, even your own party, are cardboard cutouts with absoulutly nothing interesting to say. Then you have the lack of side quests, or rather decent ones. Lastly there is the main story, which is okay but nothing execptional.

												Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a hack-and-slash game. That's... it.You control one of three characters with no personality or character development trying to chain as many finishers as possible, until you unlock Farin's Explosive Arrow and trivialize the game. Even the only vaguely challenging sections, which are the optional horde challenge maps. Along the way you will meet other fan-favorite characters such as the Fellowship, but then you will discover they have about as much relevance to you as this game does to Tolkein's legendarium. Sorry, Lord of the Rings fans.Your mission is to go kill the leader of Sauron's forces in the North, Agandaur. He is pathetically easy, but it's worth it (?) to see the CGI animation that probably ate up 70% of the budget for this game.The only way this game becomes decent is if you somehow game one, preferably two, friends into playing it with you. The time commitment shouldn't be that bad because the game is both easy and short. Playing with friends helps disguise some of the game's more egregious single-player faults, such as an incredibly limited inventory system, no ability to switch between characters on the fly (this requires you to completely reload the game), and the fact that some parts of the game are straight-up inaccessible without two or more players.Fortunately the game isn't super glitchy (there are some glitches but reloading usually fixes it) or unplayable, and you'll probably unlock 95% of the achievements without even trying.Sadly, War in the North failed to live up to any of its promise. It's not a HORRIBLE game by any means, but there are way better uses of your time.			"

												This game was very appealing at first, although it is rather disapointing. Let's start with the good things. It has amazing graphics and kill 'mini cutscenes', and does have rather good combat. But, the voice acting is horrible! If you have scene the LOTR movies, the voice acting for Elrond is laughable. They even had the audacity to put really bad american voice actors in the game. LOTR is mainly british (based on the movies and the books) and yet they chose average sounding american voice actors for some roles. Also, the story is very bad, and isn't original at all, because you are directly connected to the fellowship. At least have a seperate storyline, but no, they have to come up with a completely unoriginal, boring storyline. Also, there is abosultely no character development, and I think that if it wasn't for the good gameplay, I would have quit this game. Don't waste your money buying this game. It ISN'T WORTH IT!			"

												Everything about this game screams mediocre.  I'll break each aspect of the game down below:Graphics - stuttering and muddy.  Everything is in dark earth tones for the most party and tends to becomes a black/brown blur.  Sound/music - For the most part this is the best part of the game, or at least the part that sucks the leastUI/Mechanics - The UI is horrible.  There's just no way to say it more clearly.  It is easily one of the worst parts of this game.  The levelling and talent trees are lackluster, the HUD during gameplay is incomprehensible, and the combat is sloppy.  Story - Yes, it's set in Middle-Earth, and they have gotten a lot of the names of people/places directly from the lore, but that doesn't make the story actually interesting.  Essentially, you are a small band of adventurers (a man, an elf and a dwarf, super original) that need to distract Sauron's forces from the ringbearer during the time of the LOTR trilogy.  Really, it's just a hack and slash-fest that is completely uninspired and boring.			"

												I wanted so bad to like this. The story is interesting and the combat isn't bad. It was fun while it lasted, however multiplayer with friends is far more fun than single-player. Best I can say is...if it's on a sale, go ahead and get it. It's fun while it lasts.Now...here's where things get messed up with multiplayer. The multiplayer is broken and absolute trash. It'll work when you're connected and work fine. My first major complaint...the voice-chat is on...permanantly. If you have a built-in mic for your laptop, everyone will hear everything. You cannot turn it off. Just have to turn the mics off and/or disconnect them. It's a severe pain in the ♥♥♥ and the developers don't give a crap. There is no save state for multiplayer for those who join your game. That's right...nothing.During a game of 4 hours, someone disconnected and rejoined...however. They were reset and lost all of their gear. It was just gone. The multiplayer state was just in a broken status. I really wanted to love this game, it drew me in a lot...but...just had issue after issue that I could not tolerate.			"

												The co-op element of this game cannot be emphasized enough:  this is inherently a co-op game.  I played single-player and so my comments are reflective of that experience.The game includes three characters:  a dwarven tank, and human ranger who can choose between melee and ranged DPS, and a support/ranged DPS mage.  The three characters have decidedly different roles in combat and the fundamentals of the combat system are good, but other design flaws quickly mask those positives.Gameplay is episodic, with small, linear maps broken up with portals back to town.  Each character has a small number of actions, making combat somewhat repetitive.  Town is a dull place with a few vendors, the interface for which is clumsy and inefficient.  Managing and building your character and gear is more tedious than rewarding.The main flaw in the game is that you are tighlty tied to a single character.  Rather than giving the player the power to smoothly transfer control between characters on-the-fly (which I would think would be a very easy, obvious feature they should have included), you must play as a specific character for the entirety of a level while the other two are controlled by AI.  You cannot even equip gear on a character other than the one you are currently controlling.I admit I did not spend a lot of time in this game, maybe it would have gotten better as the game progressed, but to be fair I quit playing the game because I did not enjoy it.

												I really liked this game and i really wanted to play this game. But I can't play it anymore because it crashes constantly. It's not that my laptop is bad, because otherwise i couldn't have played this for 28 hours. However, I finished the game. It was really fun, the gameplay isn't everytime the same. I wish the developers release an update that fixes this awful bug!For now I don't recommend this game, because it won't be able to start.I read some other reviews about this game that it doesn't work on AMD cards. Now, it doesn't even work on Intel cards, because I have an Intel HD graphics card.I will change it to recommended if they fix this bug, because this a really great game!			"

												This game was very appealing at first, although it is rather disapointing. Let's start with the good things. It has amazing graphics and kill 'mini cutscenes', and does have rather good combat. But, the voice acting is horrible! If you have scene the LOTR movies, the voice acting for Elrond is laughable. They even had the audacity to put really bad american voice actors in the game. LOTR is mainly british (based on the movies and the books) and yet they chose average sounding american voice actors for some roles. Also, the story is very bad, and isn't original at all, because you are directly connected to the fellowship. At least have a seperate storyline, but no, they have to come up with a completely unoriginal, boring storyline. Also, there is abosultely no character development, and I think that if it wasn't for the good gameplay, I would have quit this game. Don't waste your money buying this game. It ISN'T WORTH IT!			"

												Everything about this game screams mediocre.  I'll break each aspect of the game down below:Graphics - stuttering and muddy.  Everything is in dark earth tones for the most party and tends to becomes a black/brown blur.  Sound/music - For the most part this is the best part of the game, or at least the part that sucks the leastUI/Mechanics - The UI is horrible.  There's just no way to say it more clearly.  It is easily one of the worst parts of this game.  The levelling and talent trees are lackluster, the HUD during gameplay is incomprehensible, and the combat is sloppy.  Story - Yes, it's set in Middle-Earth, and they have gotten a lot of the names of people/places directly from the lore, but that doesn't make the story actually interesting.  Essentially, you are a small band of adventurers (a man, an elf and a dwarf, super original) that need to distract Sauron's forces from the ringbearer during the time of the LOTR trilogy.  Really, it's just a hack and slash-fest that is completely uninspired and boring.			"

												It starts off very fun. It has decent combat and equipment systems and you will be able to do the first four or five hours without any bordom. But that is where it ends. It can`t hold up, mostly due to the fact all the characters, even your own party, are cardboard cutouts with absoulutly nothing interesting to say. Then you have the lack of side quests, or rather decent ones. Lastly there is the main story, which is okay but nothing execptional. I would say if your a lord of the rings fan, get this game when its on sale and see if you like it.			"

												This game is a lot of fun with lots of action and bucket loads of challenges, the weapon mechanics are a little basic but they do improve as you apply more skill points, but since I am stuck at chapter 8 part 2 with game freeze issues and CTD my skills can not be improved. Have been looking for co-op players to get through, very few people still. It would be even better if there was support from WB regarding the constant crashing issue in single player.			"

												Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a hack-and-slash game. That's... it.You control one of three characters with no personality or character development trying to chain as many finishers as possible, until you unlock Farin's Explosive Arrow and trivialize the game. Even the only vaguely challenging sections, which are the optional horde challenge maps. Along the way you will meet other fan-favorite characters such as the Fellowship, but then you will discover they have about as much relevance to you as this game does to Tolkein's legendarium. Sorry, Lord of the Rings fans.Your mission is to go kill the leader of Sauron's forces in the North, Agandaur. He is pathetically easy, but it's worth it (?) to see the CGI animation that probably ate up 70% of the budget for this game.The only way this game becomes decent is if you somehow game one, preferably two, friends into playing it with you. The time commitment shouldn't be that bad because the game is both easy and short. Playing with friends helps disguise some of the game's more egregious single-player faults, such as an incredibly limited inventory system, no ability to switch between characters on the fly (this requires you to completely reload the game), and the fact that some parts of the game are straight-up inaccessible without two or more players.Fortunately the game isn't super glitchy (there are some glitches but reloading usually fixes it) or unplayable, and you'll probably unlock 95% of the achievements without even trying.Sadly, War in the North failed to live up to any of its promise. It's not a HORRIBLE game by any means, but there are way better uses of your time.			"

												I first bought this at Gamestop for my 360 to check it out and see if it was any good. I played previous SnowBlind games, but I'm not a Lord of the Rings fan at all. But what I played of the used copy convinced me to pay it forward so to speak. I went back to Gamestop and changed it in for a real copy and paid the exta money. I very much enjoyed the game when I played it on the 360. I thought the combat was fun as well as the archery. I don't play the mage class so I can't say anything about that. I enjoy open world games the best. Like The Elder Scrolls and Grand Theft Auto. Fallout and what not. This game gives a slight feeling of open world but it does give you direction. And people will like that also. Not knowing what to do in a game is not fun.The difficulty seems fair. I'm not that great at video games, and found normal a fun, fair challenge.I will soon find out if the xbox 360 controller works for this game. The controller worked fine! Nice.So this is the 2nd time buying this game. Even though I played it twice on the 360. Warrior and Rouge class. Very fun.I played co op with my cousin on Xbox Live. I think we played through the whole game. But I can't remember for sure. Very fun game to play with a friend.It's fun co op or single player! I would give this game a try, It is not a masterpiece. The story pulled me in, even though I'm not a fan, and with the combination of great gameplay equals a great adventure!			"

												This game has quite a few primordial building blocks of a great game, but it loses it on the details. First, the game looks fairly decent. Graphics could be tuned up a bit (mainly with some textures), but overall, they aren't bad. Gameplay is a mixed bag. The characters move well enough, but there are some annoying collisions that will hang up your heroes, including places that ""heroes"" should be able to travel through (like stepping up a set of stone stairs from the side instead of moving around to the first step and stepping up that way - or trying to step down off a rock ledge a mere two feet off the ground below). Music is reminiscent of the movie and the sounds and mannerisms of the creatures in the game ring true. The game would be a fun 3-person co-op game, but I only played solo.. which is where some of the problems (and big ones), began to rear their heads.Your character gains XP in the game which allows them to level. This allows you to spend some points in typical RPG stats as well as putting points in skill trees, which allow you access to better killing moves. This is all fine and dandy except for the fact that if you ever switch out to one of the other characters, it resets your skills to default, meaning that you can't play a guy, switch over to another character for the next chapter and expect all of your choices to remain constant. On that point, the same goes for loot. You can share loot with the NPC allies, which they'll use on the mission you're on, but they will strangely have lost some or all of it when you switch over to them. If you opt to not give them anything, they are stuck ""helping"" you with starter weapons.And enemies and NPC A.I. isn't all that bright. I cursed so many times seeing my healer (whom I didn't want to play), rush into battle swinging her staff at a cave troll and getting two-shotted (of course). Then she cried out, ""I am dying!"" Yeah, no ♥♥♥♥. Don't get me started on the weirdly placed save spots either. Some are just so far apart that if you wipe, you have to repeat long and tedious chunks of the game.. which is a total buzzkill.I read up online that this game is huge too though, which is sad. Because the combat is pretty fun. There's enough hidden elements and fun gameplay that it kept me entertained. I just wish it was mechanically superior than what it is. I say no to this game. Perhaps a later incarnation will have these odd game mechanics worked out.			"

												I cannot really endorse this game. It has fantastic cutscenes and some fights are quite spectacular, but in its essence it is just the another ""beat them up, grab treasure, move to the next area - repeat"" game. And in the co-op mode, an inability to listen to other party members' conversations with NPCs is just jarring.			"

												Not my cup of tea. Very very slow and repetative game play, items seem irrelavent to the game early on and takes far too long to get into			"

												Pros:-It's LotR...and there's like talking eagles an ♥♥♥♥-""May fortune favor you all May fortune favor you all May fortune favor you all May fortune favor you all"" -British Eagle-Loot system isn't bad -Had potential...is-is that a pro? I'm kinda reachinCons:-Oh. You wanted to play with friends? Well enjoy Steams ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laggy party chat, cause this game not only forces you to use it, it dynamically modifies the voices so that when you're in a large room your voice sounds like you're shouting at the top of your lungs while in the sistine chapel. Not that it matters, you'll only catch every 7th syllable anyway.-What even is this storyline...-Should be called ""Lord of the Rings: Chug those ♥♥♥♥ing health potions"" (ie. blocking and combos don't work so prepare to be Wombo Combo-ed by 17 goblins right off the bat<Edit Note: I have played this on both difficulties on the 360>			"

												Button masher. It would be bearable if you could save during missions...but you can't. Thank god it came with the HIB or I would be incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about paying for it.			"

												The title sounds cool. I had to stop playing this game. It just gave a bad vibe of a project that must have once started out as ambition but soon transition into a slow day to day work just so the developer could have something to show in the end.			"

												Don't think about this game if your are AMD user. I have HD7850 and I can't finish this game. It's crashing, it's freezing and I have about 15 fps in some moments of the game. Some people say that changing drivers help... Gameplay is nice, coop is good but its almost unplayable on AMD, so I dont recommend it			"

												This game should be given no rating at all. There are a large number of bugs especially graphical. My luck in this regard was especially bad since I had a ATI 7950. If you have an ATI card simply skip this game. Its unplayable. There are Item glitches as well. Lost 20k gold trading stuff until I found about the bug. Its been 2 years + since its release and there is no update or fixes to the bug. Most likely the developer dumped it as a churn and burn money maker.Unless you get it for 0-5$ dont buy this game.  Just google for the amount of issues this game has. "

												Story is re-tarded, dialogue is painful, nine tenths of the conversation is absolutely useless and wouldn't be in a game in any other setting.This is a game for passing fans of the Lord of the Rings movies who have no idea that there are books out there. If you've sene the movies more than once, nothing in this game will make any sense. If you've read the books more than once, you'll be shouting at Aragorn, Gandalf, Elrond, etc every every time they're on-screen because they make absolutely no attempt to make them anything like the characters in the book or the movie.This is a mediocre hack-and-slash that has the great fortune of being named ""Lord of the Rings."" Otherwise, it wouldn't have sold many copies.The fight mechanics are boring, the archery is clumsy, and the equipment treadmill is just tiring. Srsly? I'm going to go to Rivendell, and the elf at the smithy is going to charge me for repairs?Most of the loot you'll get in this game is arrows or money, both of which the game would have been much better off without. There is so much ammunition hidden in jars that it's just stupid to make me keep track of it at all. In the first three missions (probably four or five hours of game time), I've run out of arrows once.But really, there's not much point to ever firing an arrow. There's apparently a headshot mechanic, but in order to score a headshot, you still have to shoot a big orc in the head four or five times to reduce his HP.This game is a solid D. If it wasn't a Lord of the Rings game, it would be a D+. But it is, so it's absolutely bursting with references to lore and history that play absolutely no part in the story whatsoever. But you can't be certain what's going to be important or might trigger something later on, so you click through every single dialogue.What a piece of ♥♥♥♥. Do not bother.			"

												As a casual Lord of the Rings fan, I found this game to be rather on the nose.  I'm going to list the good and the bad that I've encountered so far in a list of bullet points and then expand on them later so that it doesn't get too TL;DR.GOOD:*  Fun action gameplay*  Interestingly well done facial models based off the actors from the movies - (though not mocapped or anything)*  Decent amount of gameplay hoursBAD:*  Terrible console port*  No way to differentiate LAN from internet multiplayer (it does work with LAN, just doesn't give any network information)*  Painful 'story' attempting to garner interest from the fanboys*  Ugly, ugly graphics*  Unimmersive sound*  No way to toggle off voice chatThis game hurts to play.  It's an unpolished and lazy attempt to cash in on the success of the movie releases.  You play one of a party of 3 characters that spend the entire game one or two steps away from the ringbearers. One of the first areas is Bree, where you meet up with Aragorn who's waiting on Gandalf and Frodo.  After you finish the quest, they've made their way through the town.  We all know how the storyline of the novels runs and the constant ""Oh, you just missed the really cool characters but you helped them on their journey... I promise"" gets boring quickly.It is a poor console port.  The engine has not aged well, and it shows.  Despite the beautiful lands in LotR, the brown filter that is more commonly seen in FPSs makes the graphics look even worse than they actually are.  I am not someone that expects Crysis-like graphics in every video game, but this is painfully dated.  There is no way to change any networking settings (not that I expected them to be there) and this is a pain in the ♥♥♥ on a PC release.  You can't specify whether to use LAN or WAN though it does appear to function on both.  There is no way to turn off the voice chat, and it is SO laggy.  Playing with my partner over LAN in the next room had a good 3000~ms latency on the VoiP.I love RPGs, I love hack n slashers, and I quite enjoy the LotR story.  I can put up with bad writing if the gameplay is fun, and vice versa.  I've got countless hours wasted in these sorts of games.  Unfortunately, there isn't much substance to hold any interest in this game whatsoever, and completely unimmersive.TL;DR.  Crap LotR action RPG that I'm glad I got in a Humble Bundle instead of paying full price.  Not even whacky co-op shenanigans could make this fun.			"
