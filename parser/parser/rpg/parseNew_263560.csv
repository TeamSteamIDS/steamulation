YouTube™ Video: Paper Sorcerer Review 

			Views: 2,861		

			I review the game Paper Sorcerer by Ultra Runaway. Check out their site: http://www.ultrarunaway.com/ Get it on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/263560/		

The battles in Paper Sorcerer are fun and the dungeon crawling can get addictive if you enjoy these types of turn based RPGs.  The skills for each character feel unique and the enemies are diverse.  The difficulty ranges from super easy to nearly impossible “80s” style.  The main downside is that all of the dungeons look very similar and can get repetitive.  The optional catacombs can be explored to break things up but I would have enjoyed more diversity of level design.  The music is definitely not winning any awards but I felt like it fit in with the style the developers were going for.  I really had fun with it and if you enjoy turn based RPGs then at $5, it’s worth a buy, but if you are on the fence and you feel like the graphics/style might not be for you, then skip it.  You’re probably right.			"

												This game is quite the challenge, and it's fun trying to figure out the right setup/attacks in order to beat some difficult enemies. There are numerous ""secrets"" throughout the game, though they are pretty easy as the game almost always tells you when there is something to be found nearby. But the dungeon crawling/looting/fighting part is...well, fun. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the game at this time. There are some serious bugs, such as a door not opening even if you have the right key (and it has to do with the hardest ""secret"" in the game - so it's extremely frustrating doing all the work towards that for nothing). There are also some achievements that have been broken since release nearly two years ago, and as the developer has quit coming around months ago after the promise of an update that never occurred, it seems that this game has been abandoned.

												Scratches both my dungeon crawler and classic turn-based RPG itch with an interesting visual aesthetic. I got it in a humble bundle and felt like going through it again on steam with a differnent party composition. That's one of the great things about it, your party can be completey catered to your play style. Like highly offensive teams? Get a troll and minotaur and tear up some asses. Worried you might not have enough weapons for your party? Choose a werewolf and rip the enemy to shreds with his unnarmed claw attacks. Or just be overpowered and choose a party of offensive/defensive healers and never die, the choice is yours. Though, keep in mind, once you choose a party member you can't go back on them, or can you? Either way, it makes multiple playthroughs fun.			"

												Yes, the visual style is great. Yes, it's nice to see an old-school turn-based dungeon crawler being made. Yes, it's really impressive that it's pretty much all the work of one guy. Mad props to him.But none of that changes the fact that Paper Sorcerer is a glitchy mess with serious balance issues. That these glitches and balance issues remain after the game has been out for so long is surprising. There are many game-crashing bugs - seriously, if you ignore this review, save often - especially before you try to leave your room in the game's town area, as there's a glitch there that will randomly crash the game. And the first three bosses will kill you, while the rest will meekly let you by - one of them will literally refuse to fight you.What really killed the game for me, though, and what prompted me to write this review, is that there's this neat minigame within the game where you're solving puzzles and opening secret doors throughout the dungeon, in anticipation of a big payoff near the end of the game. That payoff, the thing you put in the extra hours for, the thing you put your characters at risk for, is glitched, such that when you finally get to the end, you can't get it. When you get to the final set of doors that the big reward lies beyond, the game forgets you have the key to those doors. You get nothing - no in-game reward, no achievement, nothing. From perusing the forums, this is a huge bug that has been around for a long time, and which the developer has refused to fix.Glitchy, unbalanced, plays all of its neat tricks right up front, wears out its welcome. I'm disappointed.			"

YouTube™ Video: Paper Sorcerer - Indie Turn Based RPG - Gameplay Review 

			Views: 1,371		

			Brbteabreak takes a look at the recently released Paper Sorcerer, a indie turn based RPG much in the style of Wizardry. Is being stylish with the use of black space enough to make it worth your time?		

With the new generation of consoles finally upon us people are always looking for the next-gen features in their games, which for the most part are just dumb gimmicks to trick consumers into an experience they've had a hundred times before. Whatever happened to simplicity? Simplicity is bliss and we should enjoy simpler elements without them being saturated in heavy cutscenes or hand holding. Well my friends, welcome to Paper Sorcery.At its core it's a strategy, dungeon crawler RPG, examples of this would be the Wizardry series and to some extent Final Fantasy. You traverse dungeons, slay monsters, get loot. Simple right? It would be if there wasn't a strong skill system, character choices and loot options, yes there isn't always a X>Y when it comes to loot. While the combat may seem bare bones to the average incomprehensible fool, it's actually quite deep and for the most part well thought out for a game of this size. There is a huge variety of skills and character combinations, making every group unique and gives them a different playstyle from one another.Now to acknowledge the elephant in the room, the art style. The game's sprites are hand-drawn, and might I say very high-res. Now while the monsters look very generic when it comes to a fantasy setting there's such a large variety of monsters it can be glanced over as you never really see the same types of monsters outside their respective blocks. Less could be said for the UI and the animations of combat which leave much to be desired as they're very simple and seem nearly uninspired when compared to all the other art assets. My favourite sections would have to be the open areas before each boss, huge rooms which boast no boundaries, allowing for some unique backdropsSo is this game perfect? No, but for $5 you're not going to get much better. The game suffers from no options menu outside resolution, which are chosen before you load the game. At least audio sliders are needed, as much as I enjoy some of the music they're very overpowering and sometimes I just like to listen to the combat sounds. Keyboard functionality is their, but it is very very lacking, clicking through menus seems sluggish and keys such as 'esc' do nothing for the most part. There are also some graphical glitches, though very minor and in no way affect the gaming experience.For $5 this is a steal, tonnes of content and replay value. It boasts a unique artstyle using blank space which only adds to the amazingly solid RPG experience. Also, did I mention a single man made this? GGWP			"

												If you love old school first person dungeon crawlers like Shining in the Darkness or, as someone mentioned, Wizardry IV you should grab it! Game is not holding your hand. And play it at 1980's difficulty to get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you or at least at Hard.One downside could be the music which simply could be not for one's taste.For that price it's a steal.			"

												This is one game i picked up on a whim as i had enough in my wallet to buy it and thought ""OH THIS LOOKS DIFFERENT I WILL GIVE IT A GO"",and boy i am glad i did.The graphics really do,do the game justice and the way they suit the name of the game ""PAPER SORCERER"" is uncanny.When you are walking round the different floors of the prison you have been incarcerated in the game looks really good and flows really smoothly.It does look at times (when in fights and stationary in the sanctuary) that the art work has been drawn on paper and then transferred into the game,with the artwork reminding me of the artwork found in the old D&D books i used to read and play through with my friends when we played D&D when i was a kid.This works really well and the music in game adds to the feeling that you are actually playing a D&D board game but in actual game form,the graphics effects for spells are all ok and each one looks different.The characters you amass on your journey all look different and all have different play styles from the heavy classes which include the ""MINOTAUR"" who is good at heavy attacks and powerfull special attacks to the defense classes which include the ""SHADOW"" who has great defense magic and also spells that prevent status effects.The music in game (what is there) does a good job like i have said of putting you in that world of sword and sorcerey and never does outstay its welcome (could have done with some more sound effects in game though).The story is both entertaining and a joy to watch as it unfolds the further you progress through the tower and it is both a mysterious and wonderous journey to take as you progress from level to level.The further you get the more the enemies change and the more you have to look at your play style and change up the tactics you have been using as what worked on the floor below might not (and usually doesnt) work on the floor your on,this forces you to look at your team and make changes accordingly as you get further into the game.This brings me to the difficulty level which at first can seem quite punishing,but believe me it isnt,the more you play the game the better you get (YEAH OF COURSE DUH) and the more you learn the little intricacies the game can throw at you.Many a time i have got to the gaurdian who stops your progress to the next level just to be beaten (sometimes by my own lack of in game time to be honest) and therefore have to load up again,but then when you do you learn what he/she does and when he/she does it and what they are vulnerable to and also when they summon companions to fight you and also when they are going to use spells (some of them use certain other spells to prepare for the spell that they usually crush you with ""WHY YOU PAIN IN THE A..."") and with this you learn and evetually you will ""CRUSH THEM AND TAKE THEIR SOULS"".There are a few in game quests to do that you dont have to do to finish the game and my favorite is finding the ""LOST SOULS"",when you do find these you hand them in to the creepy old man who lives in the abandoned house (all by himself so run away kids if you know whats good for you) and he then opens up a level of the ""REAPERS DUNGEON"",these are worth doing and handing in as you get the oppertunity to explore a level of the reapers dungeon and this means you can find some really cool gear and other items that just cant be found in the main game.Will you like this game,well yes if you like a good sword and sorcery romp and have the patience to play through what can be at some times quite a tough and challenging game then by all means ""STEP FORWARD ADVENTURER"" if that doesnt sound like your cup of tea then look elswhere as this wont be the game for you.

												For every horrible game that Kickstarter is responsible for, their’s always one that breaks the mold and stands out. I remember supporting Paper Sorcerer from the beginning stages when it was still in Kickstarter, waiting patiently for the day that I would finally be able to play this masterpiece. Its hard for a game to be so simple and complex at the same time, yet Paper Sorcerer seems to do just that. What you might think is a plain and boring video game ends up coming to life and involving you deep into the plot.My first thoughts and impressions had me thinking that this game was obviously going to be totally awesome. I knew I had to have it after watching only the KS trailer, and once it made its way to Steam I was all over it. Within the first 5 minutes I was reminded of Dungeons & Dragons, playing with friends and calling out tactical moves. The turn based fighting system is well thought out and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Over are the days of the 3 minute bash sessions of games like Pokemon or Final Fantasy; Paper Sorcerer delivers tactical, powerful and serious battle sequences lasting longer than your average role player. The story line is action filled, as well as giving you the ability at points to choose what direction the scenes will go.“A powerful sorcerer is on the cusp of dominating the land. A group of heroes bands together and seals him away inside a magical tome. Now as the sorcerer you must escape from this ancient prison and find a way to regain your magical powers using your wits and an array of summonable creatures to aid you. There may be more powerful forces at work as you navigate the dungeons and fight the heroes sent to subdue you… Paper Sorcerer is a stylish turn based RPG focused on strategy, party-building, and environmental puzzles. Fight with the skills and spells you have learned in a battle system that emphasizes strategy over grinding. Assemble a party of monsters and dark creatures to fight alongside you. Explore and solve environmental puzzles to unlock secret paths and find extra loot.” – Paper SorcererGraphically this game must have been more challenging to animate than it would seem. With basically only 2 monochrome colors to work with, Paper Sorcerer is a artistic masterpiece and plays out more like a graphic novel than a video game. Although you have full navigation as the game is in the first person, on my 32 inch its like playing a giant fairy tale book that’s come to life. The subtle use of color throughout the game is genius and fits perfectly, from the effects of spells to the health and energy bar every detail has been covered. Each battle is reminiscent of the older Final Fantasy, where instead of the hero moving and performing each command, its represented by a small graphic, color or sound. As I’ve said in the past, its the simplicity that can make a game as good as it is, and that is certainly the case with Paper Sorcerer. The imagery in this game is absolutely amazing, and the use of essentially 2 colors is almost intoxicating.Paper Sorcerer is as fun as it is challenging. I like games like these because the battles later in game are hard, but you’ve been prepared by several battles before it so you have an idea what you’re in for. I really enjoyed the turn based fighting system because each member of your party has a role that is greatly needed during battle. Party formation is one of the toughest parts of early game, and essential to continued play in later levels. You will need a tank, healer, and a ranged hero to make it anywhere (you already have magic covered, as you are a sorcerer), and Paper Sorcerer certainly gives you that option with a choice of several different heroes to choose from. Items are pivotal to game play, equipping each of your heroes with the proper weapons, shields and runes are key to completing each floor. Fighting is very important, because this game doesn’t focus solely on damage to end battles, you need to play more tactfully and use skills to buff strength and agility while making sure you keep your defense up.Its the little things that count sometimes in a game that make or break it. One of these things is the difficulty setting when you first begin your game; you’re given the options Easy, Medium, Hard & 1980’s. The first time around, i chose 1980’s for the hell of it… lets just say that your first battle which is almost a guaranteed win, is a guaranteed loss. This was obviously a setting for the more experienced players of Paper Sorcerer. About the only thing I really didn’t like about the game other than the fact you cant use a controller, is the music. I have no idea who is responsible for it, but it needs a major overhaul and update. It just doesn’t fit well with the game whatsoever.When it comes down to it, Paper Sorcerer is a great game, and highly suggested. So many different elements hold this game together making it a solid play through. Loaded with secrets and strong attention to detail, each item counts, and every room needs inspecting. Retro like an old D&D MSDos game and as modern as a new age RPG, everything about Paper Sorcerer is entertaining.Graphics: 7/10Playability: 7/10Story: 7/10Challenge: 7/10Replay Value: 7/10			"

												One of my favorite games on Steam right now. It's simple, but has depth. It's unique, but also has a nostalgic feel to it. The overworld is 3D and interesting to look at, while the combat is 2D and turnbased. The overworld is explored freely in levels called floors which feature mostly static combat encounters, set loot spawns but with random contents, and the usual secret or two to find. The combat is a throwback to turnbased RPGs of yesteryear and can very often be quite challenging or even impossible to beat without proper leveling and party/skill usage.Overall, pleasing to look at, fun to play, and can be a challenging experience.

												Kickstarter success! What a steal, only $5. This is a great FP dungeon crawler RPG, heavily influenced by some of the best old school games such as the Wizardry titles. Very unique looking art design, and most importantly: no hand holding at all! The enemies offer fun challenges, it's not just generic trash mobs, with each level having its own unique elements and combat will require some use of tactics. There are different companions you can choose from, with many different viable party set-ups. Each main level has optional puzzles and hidden secrets; exploration is very enjoyable. The only downside is perhaps the music, which I thought didn't really fit the game. It would have been a much more atmospheric experience had the music been darker, more suspenseful. I chose to mute it and play to the Fallout 1 soundtrack ^^			"

												Really nice little pick up this. It's a dungeon crawler with an interesting art style and a fairly decent storyline. You are a powerful being that has been trapped inside a magical book. Very happy with the purchase and would like to see more games of this quality at such low asking prices. (it was practically a give away in the winter sale but my review is based on its full price). I'm not a fan of the 8 bit chip music but thankfully that changes as the game progresses. High level of tactical choice for your party and equipment can radically add to the high level of customisation. Plenty of secrets and varied boss fights. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't like it.*edit* It does crash now and then due to transitions not completing as they should so save often just to be safe because it can be very frustrating when this happens after you found some rare gear.

Teal DeerDevelopers: Jesse Gallagher Publishers: Ultra Runaway GamesInitial release: Nov 2013Genre: RPG, Pen & Paper, Dungeon Crawler #Worth/NotWorth: #DefinitelyWorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationI think Darkest Dungeon and Legend of Grimrock had a babyPaper Sorcerer is for lack of a better term a very pen and paper sort of dungeon crawler with a very unique two tone art style. As implied in the name you are a sorcerer and you have the ability to summon other party members to fight with you. The basis of the game is you fight your way out of the dungeon you find yourself locked in upon start. As you progress through your “power” is unlocked. As stated, it's pretty pen and paper so building a party with proper healer, tank and DPS characters is a must. Addressing some points in other reviews the game does have some hiccups in that because the environment is 3D and the rest of the game is basically a menu insofar that in battles you're fighting what are essentially .jpegs; Some areas the character will stop moving and spoiler warning. I feel like this needs to be said as it's easily misconstrued. There is an area early on, block 2 I believe, that 2 doors just will not open. However you can clip right through them which definitely seems like a glitch. However you'll find a large treasure chest and a lost soul (one of the game collectibles) and unlock an achievement. Needless to say, that's no glitch.Now, the enemies don't actually appear in the environment aside from the appearance of a vapor cloud. So that you may prepare for the fight. However there are indeed some enemies that are invisible and will sneak up on you. Additionally, the game can get be a bit grindy (this can be grating to many people for obvious reasons) and you do have the ability to return to sanctuary to rest and stock up on items at any time but the enemies do not respawn so that is a luxury you may want to take into consideration. In the off chance you did not read the spoiler, there is a collectible in the game that will unlock additional parts of the dungeon wherein these areas all enemies are invisible and do indeed respawn.THE GISTThe fact that this game was made by one person and has such a low entry cost is akin to the very small amount of bugginess and scope of the game being extremely forgivable. This is buried gem in a sea of.. well, other games that aren't as good.Follow my curation for more "

												I'm a big fan of old-school dungeon crawlers, but Paper Sorcerer ultimately attempts to crib a lot from 2009's The Dark Spire, and instead delivers a buggy and underdeveloped slog. The trailer, screenshots, and overall aesthetic are impressive to be sure, but they belie a cumbersome user interface (for a genre that is 90% menus, why are the menus so annoying to use?), a sluggish battle system, and overall very dull mechanics that offer little in the way of exciting character molding or customization. A dungeon crawler must dangle the excitement of pushing forward and advancing your characters bit by bit, but Paper Sorcerer's skill system has no appeal and the battles are a chore of poorly-telegraphed information and so, so much waiting.I want to like this game, and I truly do appreciate the efforts to bring more dungeon crawlers to the market, but Paper Sorcerer is a meandering and unfocused product in serious need of more thought-out game design and revised UI design.As a $5 game, it is admittedly worth a try, even with the simplistic gameplay & numerous bugs (none of them game-breaking so far, at least) -- but if you value your time even moreso, my suggestion is to try out Legend of Grimrock on Steam or The Dark Spire on DS, two games in the same style that deliver a much more captivating experience.In short: be wary. The paper aesthetic is so fresh and appealing that it's easy to assume the rest of the game is just as polished, but unfortunately the core gameplay is miles behind what I would expect from a 2014 Wizardry-like. Will you find it fun? It's hard to predict -- but if you keep up with the scant few post-2000 dungeon crawlers like I have, the answer will probably be No, because Paper Sorcerer decidedly does not want to do anything unique with the core genre.

												This surprisingly turned out to be one of my favorite RPGs. Gameplay, story, art, and music are all equally dark, minimalist, stylish, and competent, so they all fit together perfectly. The only real complaint I have about it is that keys are apparently the most fragile things in the known universe, which hardly seems necessary. The game sometimes doesn't even tell you when keys disappear, which can result in much swearing and that frustration dance you probably haven't done since you were a little kid.			"

												It has a lot going for it, unfortunately for every point I enjoyed with the game I encountered glitch or other issue that removed me from the game. Long story short; it's good but glitchy, get it later.The battle mechanics make you think about every move you are making and the longer fights go the more dangerous they get.  This was definitely my favourite thing with the game. The battles are difficult and getting your butt kicked doesn't mean grinding, you just have to change your strategy.The story was alright, it is paced well and has a bit of humor and charm. I like the graphics too, I've always ahd a soft-spot for stylized graphics. The sound is alright, some of the boss songs stand out and are pretty cool.I WOULD recommend the game but just not now, there are too many issues that need ot be corrected. The menu interface is garbage, it is quite awkward having to scroll through the menus for skills or items. I only went through my equipment after leaving a cell block because it is too much of a hassle. During battle the text often overlaps and selecting attacks often got a bit tiring. I often encountered sound or graphical glitches which were not too big of a deal, just made it feel unpolished. I even encountered a few problems with controls after using the Gem of Recall that made me have to reset the game entirely. The kicker came when I was in cell block 7-1, I had found everything I found the switch to open the last secret on the floor but when I when to the wall that should have moved it was still closed (I had saved after the switch, also). I could no longer interact with ANYTHING on the floor including the chest or the switch. I tried reloading but the glitch persisted and that bothered me enough to write a review.			"

												One of the finest dungeon crawler RPG games i have played. Notable features:- Hard early game. late game is a big smorgås bord of awesome party builds and skill-fest based mayhem.  - Party builds are a big part of the game. What's your killer combo party layout? Not surprising that the longest thread on the forum is about party builds. - Don't forget the special puppet you find along the way - Have you managed to get proper components to build him up to a killer puppet?  Build a tank, mage, flame thrower or artery slicing doll. You decide as you gather doll parts. - Skills galore. Later as you build up your skills every move is mostly a grand strategy of what skills to choose and when during combat. Game is generous as it allows a pretty wide range of summon creaturea that can be swapped in/out between fights as you wish. Each with their own specialities. - The 'paper' in the title does not affect mechanics in any bizarre way so don't be distracted by it too much.. it is more related to the plot and graphics style. - Good range of difficulty settings. This game can be really punishing or casual, just the way you want it. Hard it seems is the recommended setting for people who want punishment as the normal setting is such that early game is hard but later on you rarely break a sweat. 1984 mode for the truly hardcore. - Good looking graphics and artwork with a hand-drawn look. Game is silly cheap and discounted often too. a true gem that is easily worth full price. 10/10			"

												I was interested in this game for a while, though I didn't pick it up right away because though the artwork was beautiful, I'm also a sucker for colorful games, and I wasn't sure I'd get along well with Paper Sorcerer's mostly black and white atmosphere. I finally picked up the game in a bundle, and when I felt like some dungeoning, I started playing this.First of all, without even getting into gameplay, the music is awesome. This is easily a game I could see myself opening up just to listen to the music when I felt like hearing something upbeat, somewhat retro, and just...unique. From the battle music to simple background music, this game has some serious tunes, and that is not to be underestimated. The music keeps you pumped up through hours of playtime, easily.The artwork never actually felt colorless to me. As you progress through the game, the hues do change, and some levels have a reddish hue, others have green hues, etc. The art is absolutely spectacular, and the battle action effects add color, movement, and even more flair. This is a fun game just to watch, even for others. There were plenty of times I caught my husband watching my battles from over my shoulder. :)Gameplay-wise, this is a dungeon crawler at its best. You play as a sorcerer (believe it or not), and you get to summon creatures to help you, gaining more over the first half of the game. The numbers of unique skills these creatures have is unbelievable. Even after surpassing levels 30 and beyond, you'll still not only be unlocking higher levels of your skills, but more new skills. For anyone who loves unlocking awesome things while leveling up (and doing it often), this game is THE game to buy.Replayability is through the roof here. This game will take around 20 hours for a single playthrough, give or take depending on difficulty (easy through 1980s), player skill and strategy, and whether or not you stop to find all of the secrets in the game. Even though you can summon multiple creatures, you can never summon all of them (there are quite a few). There are enough summons to span across two playthroughs, and that's assuming you don't mix them up at all.The ONLY negative I have to put out there about this game is a small one. There are quite a few spelling and grammar mistakes in the dialogue. The game could have benefited from having an editor go over the text, but in saying that, it in no way takes away from the enjoyment of the game, and not once did I get confused because of these small mistakes. It will serve as no more than a pet peeve for those of us who notice these types of transgressions.Overall, I would give this game a 5/5, or a 9.5/10, take your pick. It's a great value for the price, it has high replay value, and it's worth it just to experience the atmosphere, and without even considering gameplay (which as stated, is superb). The easier difficulties would also serve well as an introduction of a dungeon crawler to someone who is interested in the genre but perhaps not quite as experienced, as it is easy to learn, but hard to pull away from. ;)			"

												Paper Sorcerer is different in the graphics aspect, there is no doubt about that. Pleasant to look at both because it is different and nice. But otherwise, I found the gameplay very repetative. The first levels are fun, but then I realized as I progressed, that the only differences were a slight change in the surroundings, enemies and music. Combat is always the same, and most fights end up being repeating one or two different combinations of skills from your four characters. What I found most fun about this game was the secret hunting. Not very difficult, but it was more or less the only thing that varied across the levels.The story was presented in text, but I didn't experience any depth in it. The whole idea of it is different and entertaining, but it is presented casually, and after a short while I couldn't get rid of the feeling that it is just a context to put the game in without any farther meaning.I haven't finished the game, but I keep trying to progress to see if it may have anything else to offer, as it seems pretty long. But repeating the same combat sequences for 9 hours of gameplay appears demotivating. I can still recommend to try this game just for the visual style and some old school atmospherics, but I don't thik it is worth spending more than a few hours on.			"

												A good light rpg, mostly focused on combat and little puzzles or exploration. Entertaining, but not without flaws though :- The UI is frankly terrible- The graphics style, which seems refreshing at first, quickly becomes tiring- Music ranges from rather good to annoying- Unless I missed something, you can't get any information on your opponents, which is a hassle to prepare a good strategy when in combat- Small bugs, mainly due to the fact that after a reload, all doors (including those you opened with a key that then disappeared) are closed again- Some achievements are bugged (looks like I got rather lucky with them), and if you're after a perfect game, I think you'll have to play once at each difficulty (not sure, and 1 run was enough for me, I'm not gonna try again).Anyway, for the price, and despite these flaws, recommended if you like dungeon crawlers.

												It's not good!And I wanted it to be good. I really did. I want to support indie games, and the premise that this is based on - an homage to the choose-your-own-adventure books spawned of the 80's - is one very near and dear to my heart. At first, it even looked good, with the charming reproduction of pen-and-paper outsider art baked into everything you look at. But that charm quickly wears away, and what you're left with is grinding, bugs, and a seething, unfortunate sort of RPG genericness.The battle system is quickly understood, and whatever quirkiness and customization the party-summon mechanic brings is quickly locked away behind a gruesome wall of grinding. The battles get very old, very fast, with little strategy beyond ""kill the guys with the annoying abilities first"". Even the outsider-art graphics get old, as you see so damn much of the same damn thing. I could write the story out on a bar napkin. By spitting on it. And then there are the rampant bugs, that make a dull experience into an infuriating one - doors that don't work, crashes when you return to town.This game came from a good place, and had a good start, but it's awful. Don't do it. Not even on sale.			"

												This is a good RPG for those who want an interesting game to play that doesn't really take a ton of brain power. The game play is easy to understand, but there is strategy involved with which Skills to use when. a mouse is not really required, so it is a great game to play on your laptop in bed (which is partly why i got it). Very fun, and the different summoning options make for interesting party builds, and I enjoy the different stereotypical RPG rolls given to the monsters (such as Barbarian to the Minotar).			"

And since it was released in 2013, I don't think they're going to be fixed. Well, too bad -- another potentially great game, ruined by lazy devs.			"

												Well there are games that just appeals to you, this one has nostalgia, heavy rpg elements (it is an rpg), decent balance and an interesting soundtrack and art style. For 5$ its a steal, any rpg fan must try at this price even. Imagine playing a party based dragon warrior with some animations. It is a game i did not expect to put on top of my must play list, well played game.. well played. You also get a lot of customisation options in which minions to use during gameplay. Simple and effective, you dont need Crysis level graphics to make a game good, this is a prime example.Further Edit:Hmm i should also add that the game is a first person dungeon crawling rpg. You explore various dungeons not in a way unlike the old school game 'Moraff's Revenge'.The main appeals of the game are its atmosphere, its rpg setting, its choices of playable characters/minions and acessibility. By this i mean, it is cheap, nearly anyone with 5$ laying around can try it, and can you honestly name me a game where every ability of your character are a decent choice? I have used every ability of every character I've played with so far, at least once. May it be for CC, cheaper cost, conserve energy, or exploit an enemy vulnerability. All i can think off is how i just spam the same ability in almost every other rpg, i try not to, but often only a few choices are ressonable given the circumstances.Have a nice day!			"

												I have played about 5 hours of the game, fought with the first three bosses. I'd most probably continue playing the game, but I just could not withstand the user interface any more. It is so bad that it's hard to describe, it has be to experienced (and I suggest you do not). It is the worst user interface I've seen in games, ever.The game itself is good enough, it has party variety, it has quite interesting enemies, and it has a few new concepts such as lowering defense during combat. I really like the fact that no matter how good your armor is, with enough effort you will cut through it eventually. Unfortunately this mechanic is not well explained and it lacks some polish and (especially) detailed explanation how it really works. But overall, the gameplay is solid. The environment is lacking, but it's still borderline good enough.What kills this game is UI. I think the developer would be in fact able to design better interfaces (just by copying what you see in ever other game you get a 100x more usable UI), but he's just not technically skilled to create it. This is his first game and he has no real programming skills. The official website even confirms it ""Ultra Runaway Games was created when  one man with no industry experience or programming training decided to make a PC RPG."". And when you read his comments on forums that music volume cannot be adjusted because he doesn't know how to implement a slider, it's just... sad. Don't take me wrong, he has a courage and a passion, and if he really knew nothing about programming in the beginning, this is a very good result. But still, that doesn't make this game playable, unfortunately.The UI is simply horrible and you spend more time fighting with the UI than fighting with enemies. Even basic tasks like looking at the inventory is extremely cumbersome and slow. Battles are excruciatingly slow because of the way how you give commands. And the list goes on.There are even some bugs, but often it's just horrible UI or design decision in action. For example, you pick up a plate armor, then you look into inventory, and it's not there. WTF? You load and try it again, same result. A bug? No, a design decision to not show you any item in inventory that you cannot use at that moment. (Or at least that's what I assume it is, it is not explained anywhere). But it ""appears"" once you want to sell it. So much time wasted figuring this out...There are other technical issues that will slightly drive you mad, but I think most of them boil down to simply insufficient programming skills of the developer.It's unfortunate, because this is very close to the ""my kind of game"", but I can't recommend this at its present state. If there are some patches in the future that will completely overhaul the user interface, then sure, this can become an entertaining game. At present not worth it, though.			"

												Let me preface this by saying I've been playing video games since 1980 roughly, so I've seen a lot of genres, systems, styles, etc. come and go. The traditional FPS dungeon crawl with turn based combat has been around a long time. Some of the greats (Dungeon Hack, Ultima series, Might & Magic, Eye of the Beholder) are perfect and definitely fundamental considering how long the style and some of the series lasted.Paper Sorceror is a proud addition to this long line of games. The art is incredible. The available party members are fantastic and the story is pretty damn great as well. If you played Grimrock or the new Might & Magic and liked it I'd highly recommend this game. Its fast playing, original, and very enjoyable.			"

												This could have been a good game.  It has neat artwork, a decent story, and a host of interesting classes.  However, the programming team was either inexperienced or rushed in finishing this game.  The programming on this game is horrible.  While other areas, like artwork, look fairly well polished, there is a critical lack of basic polish on the code.  I've seen flash games with better polish.Let's start off with text prompts.  You see that screenshot showcasing the spell list, with the funky alignment issues?  That's a small taste of what I'm talking about.  Text is screwed up everywhere!  Much of the interfaces look like they paid some 16-year-old who barely speaks English to design it.  There are misspellings, case issues, text alignment issues, design flaws, and yes, bugs and glitches, which are well covered in other reviews.Trying to play this on a controller is fruitless.  Even when you map the keys, you'll find that the main button for doors and items is permanently bound to the left mouse button.  And sometimes it will crash in the middle of the binding menu.  Also, why are there two binding menus?  Seriously... there's one on the pre-start screen, and one in game.Equipment management can be a pain.  You can't revert to a previous character during the fight menu.  You can't see any stats from any of the enemies.  Enemies before a fight are just blobs on the screen, which is a bit of a cop out.  The hardest difficulty level is basically impossible without cheating.Yes, there's a good game struggling to come out, but the weight of the flaws wear you thin after a while.			"

												Nice little gem that brought back a lot of memories of old RPGs.Pros- Good and interesting music- Excellent premise/starting storyline- Decent leveling up system- Pretty wide selection of enemies, characters, and party builds- Some replay value - picking a new party and/or different character branch for main- Decent loot system- Skill TrainerCons- Some display issues- Handful of bugs - town menu sometimes didn't display, chests that are closed but unable to be interacted with- Skills are a little all over the place - some are super powerful and some so weak that you will never use them- Maxed Parry from the Skill Trainer - wish successful blocks would say block or parry.  All I saw was miss and evade - difficult to tell if those skills are working or not.- Need better explanation of skills/status effects - sometimes it is a guess to decide with an ally hit with a Sleep spell is under a phyiscal or magical condition so you can remove it.- Some groups of enemies were much harder than the boss fights at the end.  Really required luck and a fully rested party instead of skill.- Character status needs to show magic defenses.  Magic defenses are on gear and available through skill trainer, but not viewable.- Intro story concept was pretty neat.  Becomes weaker as you go along.- The skeleton really could use an energy builder even if it was defensive in natureOverall, a great little game that I'm happy I picked up for a few bucks.

												So addicting!  At first, the game feels a little monotonous, especially the fighting.  But once you get past Block 2, your party and the enemies begin to develop new and more interesting skills that may take a little strategy to handle.  I love how your summons gain experience and level even if they're not in your ""active"" party, that way you can switch party members to suit your needs, or if you're having trouble completing an area.  SAVE OFTEN!  As far as I can tell, there is no auto-save.  Which is fine, it just takes a little getting used to after playing every game that has an auto-save function.  So far I love the story and the humor, such a great trip to the past to what games in the late 80's used to be like.  No crazy graphics (my crappy computer thanks you) and animations, while minimal, get the point across.  From what I have seen or read about this game online, I judge to be about halfway through the game, and all I can think about is finishing it!  If I had to pick one thing I like most about Paper Sorcerer, it would be the replay value.  I'm already planning my next summons for after I complete this playthrough!And for everyone complaining about the visuals:  This game is supposed to be a sendback to the RPG games of the 1980's, the era that this genre came to life through computers and consoles.  Before games like this one were made in the 80's, you had to read a book to experience the Fantasy genre.  The fact that this game, and the creators from Ultra Runaway Games, decided to pay homage to that industry-changing decade, makes me love it even more!  Plus, it's called PAPER Sorcerer.  Not just because it includes aspects from a paper-based RPG game... It looks like crinckled paper!Sorry if that's offensive to you people who don't like the way it looks. Anyways, highly recommended!			"

												Paper Sorcerer tries to be a modern homage to retro dungeon-crawling RPGs. It tries very, very hard. But it fails and ends up falling flat on its face. Grinding can become a necessity in this game, especially on higher difficulties. Unfortuantely, enemies in the main dungeons do not respawn. To grind, you need to go to the game's secondary dungeon, of which the lower levels are unlocked by finding semi-hidden spirits in the game's main tower. Normally this would not be an issue, but the secondary dungeon seems to have a random spawn rate. I competed the first floor with no encounters at all, while the second floor flung me into combat every few seconds. In addition to the grinding, treasure chests are completely random, and not in a good way. You could find one of the most common swords in the game, or you could find some overpowered god-slaying weapon of mass destruction. And if you don't like the loot, you can load your save and try again; this wouldn't be a bad thing if it wasn't for the fact that it could possibly require hours of resets to get the best items from each chest. The music also varies from fitting to incredibly annoying. After hearing the town, dungeon, and battle theme for the thousandth time, you will start to lose any motivation to finish this game. Some boss battles have nice music, but overall it's annoying music loops. Last but not least, the bugs in this game are everywhere and the developer has made no mention of them for over a year. He has abandoned this project and cashed out; if I hadn't gotten this game from a bundle for a decent discount, I'd be furious.			"

												I bought this game primarily for the aesthetics but found there was a pretty decent amount of actual gameplay there, too.  Fans of games like Ultima Underworld and Legend of Grimrock will probably feel right at home, though combat is strictly turn-based and takes place on a separate screen.  In that sense, fans of turn-based RPG combat may also enjoy it.While the game lasted a surprising 13 or so hours for me, I'll freely admit the last half or so of that was just fairly mindless repetition.  I think the game would be greatly improved if they'd just condensed the experience into four or five blocks of four floors each, rather than nine blocks plus an additional nine optional areas.  Past a certain point, I wasn't even exploring anymore - just trying to beeline for the stairs to the next floor, avoiding combat whenever possible.The game also has some pretty substantial balance issues - bosses are almost never a challenge (the first couple bosses are challenging because of how limited your arsenal is, but by time you reach the third or fourth boss, they cease to be a serious threat), and some monsters and groups of monsters are hilariously overpowered.  Some of your characters can become equally overpowered, and it's really just based on getting to a certain level with them.  Skill advancement is predetermined and automatic, and it feels like it could've used a little more attention there, too - especially late in the game, characters will have something insane like 20 or more skills you have to scroll through to use the four or five that are actually worth using while the rest are just mindless clutter.I'd also say the game isn't as ""tactical"" as the blurbs claim it is.  I never once had to change out my party members for others (despite the fact that you can do so freely and even make use of the skills of party members not currently active, like having a healer patch everyone up between fights), nor did I ever really have to vary my tactics in battle.  The tank tanked, the berserker hit their entire party for a billion damage, the healer healed, and the sorcerer hit their entire party for only a million damage but applied ridiculously strong damage over time effects.  Sometimes I'd use the healer to put someone to sleep or blind them, but that's about it.The only time I actually hit a roadblock was a particular unavoidable fight in the last block of floors, and it was harder than literally every single boss fight in the game, including the fights at the very end where you have to fight sets of former bosses together (unfortunately these bosses are no stronger than when you originally fought them, so you're so much stronger than them at that point it's a little embarrassing how quickly they die.)  The problem was that the difficulty of this one battle hinged ENTIRELY on random chance.  Two of the four enemies in it possess EXTREMELY powerful attacks that hit your entire party - if they use them, you lose.  If they don't use them, you win.  It took me something like 11 tries before the RNG played things my way, and I didn't feel like I won through skill so much as luck.  Putting one to sleep still allows the other one to effectively one-shot your entire party, and the sleep skill itself has a chance to fail and has a cooldown before you can try again.But all this is kind of picking at nits.  For $5 it's a hell of a deal, and in all honesty - don't feel like you NEED to beat the game.  The ending gives you some cute, amusing little epilogues about your party members and wraps up a sub-plot that you may or may not have even been aware of, depending on how aggressively you search every nook and cranny to read random things.

												I got to about 1/3 of the way through Paper Sorcerer playing on hard, and I won't be finishing it. The regular battles have become a rather repetitive rotation of building up energy for abilities, tank taunting, healing, and damage. I don't vary my strategies much because there's not much of a need. After the first floor of the dungeon, you can full heal any living party members at any time by going back to town. It sort of takes away the need to optimize. You see, the resource management for multiple battles just isn't there in this game. There's not really much interesting individual character customization. Despite these flaws, I'm still going to recommend Paper Sorcerer.Why?The visuals are unique and a cool blend of retro/modern style. The music is fantastic. The classes are interesting and there are a bunch of viable party compositions. It's $5 for 10 hours of solid, if not spectactular dungeon crawling. For someone who has played a lot of strategy games and RPGs, hard difficulty felt perfect. I never felt the need to grind, but bosses always felt like the perfect challenge.  Ohh...the bosses in this game. They are tough and definitely reward strategy. If I could play just the boss fights then yeah, I would've finished the game. Not only are they diverse encounters, but they challenge you to radically change your tactics.So, Paper Sorcerer has got plenty enough positivies going for it that despite my being done with it early, it's a thumbs up from. Anyone intersted for a first person dungeon crawler will get at least multiple hours of enjoyment out of it.			"

												A throwback to those old first person dungeon crawling computer games. But much like those old computer games the interface and movement feels a bit slow and bogged down. Combat can feel a bit drawn out because of these uninteresting menus and lack of animation.But despite those set backs (Which most of the time feels like a design choice) playing paper sorcerer I unravaled an interesting little gem that keeps combat fun and strangely compels me to play more. Though the art might not be the most spectacular thing in the world the personality of each area through secrets and random events only makes you want to explore more. Each enemy is interesting enough and the bosses set after each area are filled with such personality that you can't help but want to push on to meet your next big foe.All in all paper sorcerer is quite a steal at $5 if you're hankering for those dungeon crawling times of days past or just played legends of grimrock and can't fill that tactical void.

												Paper Sorcerer is a tale of two vastly different experiences. One part being the popular genre of dungeon crawling turn based role playing games. The other part in the exploration of a sleek monochrome three-dimensional environment where areas are set apart more by their flourishing shadows than light sources. Each different stage you fight your way through and clear leads to widely varying stages both in combat to look of the three-dimensional environments. Your player character, a sorcerer stuck in a magical book, summons a party of your choosing and sets off to escape. The game features difficult turn-based combat which serves as blarney for the grognards and a hit off the nostalgia bong for the rest of us. These two experiences juxtaposed to each other are quite disjointed, but in the end it’s a game criminally under-priced. You should really give this game a try.			"

												For (currently) two and a half bucks on sale or even its full price of five this game is a steal, it's some of the most fun I've had with a dungeon-crawling RPG. There are a couple of rough edges but for a one-man indie game made in Unity I'm extremely impressed at what it's capable of. You should probably stay away from it if you don't like its stylized graphics or if old-school dungeon crawlers make you feel scared, but if you played games like the Bard's Tale (not the newer action-RPG remake, I mean the original), or the Wizardry series on the NES, you'd feel at home with this game. I think I played through it twice and may do so thrice.			"

												This may sound weird but I want to congraulate the developer of Paper Sorcerer.  From what I've read the game was pretty much developed by one person.  Running a kickstarter, developing a game and then getting it published to Steam is a real accomplishment.I wanted to like this game.Due to technicial issues though I cannot recommend Paper Sorcerer.  The game freezes and I've had to replay levels due to the game locking - this is the primary reason I can't recommend it.Sometimes it doesn't size the screen correctly to display menus or images.You cannot adjust game volume that I've found other than manually via headset or windows volume.Paper Sorcerer does have good traits:The sketch style art was enjoyable and well placed with the conceit of the gameIt's fun to play the bad guy and summon monstersThe RPG mechanisms were good although somewhat opaqueSadly in the condition it's in I personally cannot recommend it.  Others have had better experiences with it and if you choose to buy I hope you do as well.			"

												An old-school style RPG.  Fun, but pretty hard.  1980's mode is freakin impossible!  But despite the fun, its got alot of flaws that made me kinda quit half way through.Essentailly, its a good game, but it needed alot of play testing that it obviously never got.  Not because its glitchy, but because the balancing is all off.  Some skills are basically useless (which happens in alot of rpgs), so your often limited to two or three viable skills per class.  Too many skills either are WAY underpowered, or simply don't give you the status effect they say they will.  (or the chance to miss is so freakin high that why bother.)All in all, not to bad for a one-man shop, and I DO RECOMMEND IT, but it really is in desperate need of some skill balancing.  I got past the 2nd boss, but am gonna put it away for a while and hope they patch it.			"

												Paper Sorceror is a turn based corridor RPG that has it's own unique style of art and music. You permanently summon/choose from some monsters to travel with you and then go kill those wannabe protaganists! The story is light which is all that is necessary to make the world tangible. Any fan of the Wizardry series or Etrian Odyssey that just wants a new take on this old classic style of game needs to look no further.			"

												Paper Sorcerer reminds me of so many games (and memories) from my childhood.  The music takes me back. The turn based combat takes me all the way back to Bards Tale III - Thief of Fate and Wasteland (1) back on my Commodore 64 in the late 80's.  The graphics are striking and actually quite beautiful in their simplicity (I really like the shadow effects and the feeling of looking down over the edge into the blackness with just a few lines of white going down is amazing).

			Welcome to Paper Sorcerer by Ultra Runaway Games! Paper Sorcerer is available through http://www.ultrarunaway.com/ and also now on Steam! As always thanks for watching ...		

The combat is both interesting and involved ... and whenever you seem to feel that you are overpowered and don't have to worry this game seems to throw something at you that reminds you to pay attention.  The wide variety of summons/minions that you get to pick from (limit of 3 at a time) gives you a huge range of different party types.  Don't worry about out levelling old minions though as they actually level up with you regardless which means you can swap minions in and out at will (outside combat) and try out new combinations for particular situations (for example the Abomination is perfect for dealing with spellcasters but only does light healing compared to the Witch) ... Don't be fooled into thinking this game isn't trying to trick you!  The secrets go from being simple and obvious to being down right fiendish (and you can stuff up and permanently be unable to find some of them!!!) This game is fantastic ... it is potentially the most fun game I have played in a very long time and the developer has done an amazing job bringing the Kickstarter to its full potential!The game is $5.00 ... if you don't try it you are missing out on one of the best games for a long time ...Sloshworks			"

I highly recommend it.A few minor nitpicks:* Would love to be able to order abilities to keep the ones you use often at the top.* The mouse interface in the store is a little wonky. Selecting something at the bottom of the list will highlight, but scroll back to the top where I can't see it anymore* A few times where the inventory screen glitched out, and the back button wouldn't do anything. Had to restart the game.* The Soul Shield doesn't seem to work at all. "

												I am extremely impressed with this old-school dungeon RPG that it's been taxing on sleep as its ""one more level"" kind of game. While its old-school turn based combat would seem boring its unique Skill & Energy system changes everything, so you no longer mash Attack and instead encourages you to find combinations of debuffs, buffs, effects, and damage type that is very satisfying. Love the minion collection and random loot with some great Skills & Spells, as well as the set monster placement with only random encounters in a ""special optional (but recommended) dungeon levels"".The art style blends well into the creative narrative of being trapped in a book, while the music is quite fun and as soon as it becomes repetitive new music enters at the right time. The puzzles are not overly difficult and the writing is simple but never becomes a bore to read.My only want is more information on my enemies & the effects I put on them.If I knew how good it was it would be worth the normal $5 for a couple weeks of play, but I scored it in a Humble Bundle and it is easily my favorite in the pack.Would be willing to get trapped in magic book again: 10/10			"

												A fun little game that would appeal to the old-school RPG players who don't have the time to grind for hours. No frills with a solid core mechanic and a quirky art style. Level puzzles are simple enough to solve, once you figure out the gimmick without feeling contrived or forced. The catacomb sections may seem like cheap padding at first, but is a well thought-out, integral part of the game. Choosing your own party is interesting and can bare a few playthroughs to find your groove - then again in 1980s mode!TL;DR It's cheap and fun. Buy it!			"

												Story of the game is pretty simple. You are an evil sorcerer that some good king sent some heroes to trap inside a prison, this groovy magic book that you (and many other evils) have been trapped inside of. You go through the levels to try and escape. You get to pick from a variety of possible team mates as you go like a Witch, Vampire, Werewolf, Minotaur, Ghost, Troll, Imp etc. You pick what you want and build a classic 4-person party. You actually get (I think) 6 slots total. Pros:- As advertised, basically a love letter to the early wizardry games but you don't have to grind like 10 hours to get off floor 1, so, that's good.- The graphic look rules. Basically the whole world looks like black and white ink drawings, but the dungeon is a 3-D world. It's cool, if minimalist.- Honestly, the first old fashioned RPG I've actually played and been enjoying in a while- Seems to be lots of different approaches with your party. Each character offers something different. I can see playing this more than once just to test out different combinations- Has multiple difficulty levels, something a lot of RPG's don't offer- Offers a windowed mode and control remaping, both of which I roll my eyes at any PC game I encounter without them. Cons:- This was done by (AFAIK) a one man programming team and I have hit a glitch in town twice that causes no menu options to pop up. Save often.- Speaking of saves, when you reload them all doors on a level are shut as if you just arrived. Minor annoyance.- One of the one-man-team oddities, the game has no volume controls at all. It is what it is. Some people have been (here's a shocker) very rude on the Steam forums about wanting to turn off the music. I really don't see the fuss.- The heroic knights in the opening cutscene have weird helmets that kind of make them look like Klan members. Overall: definite thumbs up if you enjoy old school RPG's. It's not really the most complex game, but it's also not a pricey one and it will definitely kill some time. I'm definitely enjoying it. There's nothing here that will redefine a genre or do anything you haven't seen before, but it does what it does well.			"

												A really enjoyable turn based RPG with first person exploration. You can make many different party combinations and change it anytime you want, since all the members get the same exp, even if they don't fight or they are dead, which in my opinion is great and something that every RPG should do, because with that you can make different strategies for every fight, instead of using always the same character because they are the only ones with decent level.It's not very grindy, I had to grind a bit (on Hard level). Not much, but yes something. Maybe I was able to beat some bosses without grinding, but I couldn't.The art is nice, the music is nice, and there are many secret rooms to find. Totally recommended if you like turn based RPGs.			"

												If you ever wanted to feel like a ♥♥♥♥ing god, beating this game on Hard or 1980's difficulty may well do it for you.This game very quickly peaked my interest as a potential favorite-to be when I first started playing it and it has solidified as one of my favorite games I've ever played now that I've finished my first run.A simple, brilliant and elegant turn-based RPG, this game will provide an immense challenge.  Don't be fooled by the minimalistic art-style, which I actually find to be refreshing.  It's nice to play a game where the challenge is one of my mental acuity and not visual acuity!  Letting my eyes take a break while I do epic battle is nice.Story is simple, but consistent.  You won't necessarily fall in love with it in the way you do some Epic poem like the Illiad or a game like Baldur's Gate or something, but it has a neat premise that fits well with the format of the game.  You'll find nice tidbits of humor laced throughout the game as well.You will most likely have to become a better player to meet the challenge of this game.  It is a worthy adversary and one that I will treasure for all time.  Definitely one of the best turn-based RPGs ever.  Developers, please give me a sequel! "

												A game which is very strongly inspired by classic western RPG's, Paper Sorcerer is one i was iffy about getting. Fortunatly I decided to buy it & after playing all the way through I can say i enjoyed it a lot.Some bugs remain, like an acheivment not unlocking & some door-opening issues which can be sorted out with the recall stone in a pinch. These issues asside the writing was clever & fun, the gamplay was enjoyable in a nice retro way & the characters were all different enough ability wise that i'd play through again with a second team.If you are a fan of old dungeon crawlers with a turnbased system & a 3d First person environment to shuffle through then check it out. [Due to some of the stll remaining bugs, i'd advise anyone playing to work with a minium of three rotating save-games, to avoid loosing progress or loosing a whole playthrough due to glitch.]			"

												A unique and interesting fantasy experience. It's got a few bugbears I'd prefer weren't in the game, but is otherwise a decent experience. Though annoyingly the only real side-quest in the game is horribly glitched and doesn't work as intended, despite the amount of time the game has been out. Also I would avoid the hardest difficulty setting like the plague. It's literially just a huge number boost for the enemies and isn't fun to play as they easily one-shot you (sometimes without you even being able to act). With the problems in mind I can still recommend, though only just. It would be nice if they did something more with the higher difficulties other than ""better numbers lol"" and ironed out the bugs.			"

												Paper Sorcerer is a game that i didn't know about until i watched a little bit of it, and then i immediatly started to like alot of what it was offering. An interesting premise and very catchy music that even now as i'm typing our this review i'm remembering fondly. With an interesting party system that can make for some really unique group compositions. The combat is a classic turn base style where you choose everyone's actions then the round plays out giving the player the tools to plan out each round cautiously cause even the slightest mistake can make all the difference in the outcome.leveling is one of my few gripes with this game because if you actually do intend to grind levels, I believe the only way to do that was to find some special maps that had random encounters, because the journey through the story based dungeons had a specific set number of battles per floor pending on however many black figures you can find. Its good for those that just want a story and perhaps a little more difficulty on the side. I very much enjoyed this game still i would recomend it.			"

												Considering the price, it's hard to not recommend this game to pretty much anyone.  The turn-based Final-Fantasy-esque encounters make for a fun nostalgia trip, and the art style is really captivating.  You're an evil wizard imprisoned in a book, and you can summon thralls to fill out your party (make sure your first pick is a healer -- I recommend the Vampire.)  You explore, fight and loot through some fairly witty writing and engaging presentation.  It has a note of self-deprecating irreverance, kind of like the Zeboyd titles (Cthulu Saves the World, Breath of Death VII) and is straightforward enough to be accessible for someone who's new to RPGs.  Thumbs up for Paper Sorcerer.			"

http://bossdungeon.com/review-paper-sorcerer/ - Full review.If you're in the market for something that's a little Wizardry and a little Shin Megami Tensei, may have a thing or two for you. The first-person dungeon crawling is pretty much everything you've come to expect from these kinds of games, but the combat demands strategic use of all your party members' abilities and strengths. In fact, combat is really the best part of Paper Sorcerer. It may take the same amount of time to clear some normal packs of trash mobs in this game as it would to take on a boss from any other RPG, but the battles themselves are worth it and are infrequent and varied enough to keep from becoming too repetitive. Unfortunately, my recommendation of this game comes with some SEVERE hesitation. The entire user interface is an uncategorized, unformatted, and at times non-functioning mess. Thankfully the menu bugginess is mostly limited to non-combat situations, but it's still a major pain to work with such an aggressively bad UI. There are also a number of bugs that can occur while exploring the dungeon that may require a restart of the game, which will also re-close any doors you've opened making it harder to re-orient yourself afterward. There's either some slight inexperience going on here or the game needed to get booted out the door to satisfy Kickstarter backers. If you want some engaging as hell combat and party customization and don't mind wading through some annoying bugs and terrible menus, by all means have a go at Paper Sorcerer.			"

												I really can't gush enough about this game and I normally hate everything. It looks like a sort of old school Might & Magic from the videos but it has so much more... ambiance? You start playing and think, ""Ok, this is sort of neat"" but it really starts to open up more and more as you go along. The begining and videos are deceptive. They do NOT do it justice. It really does have a sort of pen & paper D&D feel. Not just in that it's a fantasy RPG. It really does sort of capture the feel. The art style, the options, the enemies (more so as you progress), the story.  "

												Possibly the most refreshing RPG in a while I have played. It doesnt take it self to seriously, et has enough hidden secrets, hidden stats but uses arch types from most common rpg's to make you feel like there is alot more strategy involved. I loved my first built team with little to no minmaxing. Thanks for a great RPG without all the whiny asian characthers			"

												Paper Sorcerer is a turn-based RPG and dungeon crawler with a stylistic flair. First off, there's a somewhat monochromatic theme throughout the game, alongside heavy contrast thanks to fairly common shadows. Thus when colors do appear, they're much more striking. While the sprites and animation themselves aren't the best, the total effect of the game was a minimalistic experience which I found rather refreshing. The developers are still sorting out a few kinks with the game, such as being able to adjust game volume and the like. That wasn't a problem for me, as I found the soundtrack helped set the mood of the game and all told was a fan of it.As for the gameplay, you are a sorcerer bound in a magic tome, with the objective of fighting your way out. Your party consists of minions whom you summon with your arcane powers. Some of this game's stylistic charm comes from the fact that instead of the cut-and-dry mage/fighter/thief, your minions are themselves monsters: minotaurs, vampires, ghosts, imps, and the like. This comes off across a lot less as anti-heroes as you'd think it would, but it was another thing I found quite refreshing about this game.The combat itself is quite fun and has depth, while managing to keep things simple enough. One of my qualms with the normal difficulty setting was that after a point, the combat was a bit too easy, though there are harder difficulties to fix that problem. A good deal of the gameplay comes from exploring dungeons and finding secrets. These can range from easy to very puzzling, with the harder ones being more rewarding to complete. This aspect of the gameplay fits in very well with the rest, the result being an excellent dungeon delving experience.So I can't tell you this game is perfect, but I don't really think it tries to be. When I first saw this game, I got ""art game"" vibes from it, but actually playing it, Paper Sorcerer comes off much less pretenious than that. The final product here is a laid-back (if somewhat minimalistic) dungeon crawl. It has breadth without being overly complicated, and most importantly it was refreshing. For five dollars, this is definitely worth picking up: if you're a fan of turn-based RPGs, Paper Sorcerer is a solid game that you can sink both your teeth and your time into.			"

												Reminds me of old school RPGs.  Fairly simple, sometimes unfair, sometimes not challenging enough, but fun.  If you played RPGs in the 80s like shining force or Ultima Underground, this is a fun game for the price.  I recommend it if you sometimes find too much bling and not enough substance in the newer titles out there.  This game stays true to what it is, a dungeon crawler.  And I mean that in a positive way.			"

												First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/paper-sorcerer-first-impressions/Paper Sorcerer is one of those games that people generally miss out on. The game has a fantastic, unique art style and fun, classic turn-based battlesWhat really sold the game for me though, was the interesting style used. Never played a game with a style such as this, and Paper Sorcerer pulled it off well. The game has you going about a black and white world that you, the sorcerer, has been trapped in. You'll end up building up a party of mythological creatures and monsters to fight alongside you in turn-based combat against various foes. There are plenty of puzzles scattered throughout the game, usually leading to some pretty cool loot.I'm not usually one to enjoy turn-based RPG's in this style, but this was a fantastic experience. It was just so much fun. Also, the game is only $5? What's not to lose here?

												It's the premise of Wizardy IV (a villain and her minions escape imprisonment and take revenge on the heroes), in a package sane people can complete. Which still leaves room for it to be really, really hard, by the way.Great game. It's hard to believe one guy can come up with this many fun encounters. I'd say one of the big developers should hire him but if the games people make when quitting devs like Bioware are any indication (NEO Scavenger), great minds are already being ignored at places like that.Hopefully the next one isn't too far off.

												This game is sexy; Old school sexy. This is a first person dungeon crawler with turn based combat. It is remeniscent of the dungeon crawlers of yore. Now here's the twist:  instead of playing a band of heroes out to vanquish evil, you're playing the role of an evil socerer with a band of monsters, undead, and other evil minions out on a mission to break out of an extra-dimensional prison that exists in a book. If you played rpgs like Dragon Warrior, the combat should be very familiar. You tell your poke'monsters who to attack and what spells/abilities to use. The prison guards will do the same to you. So you beat on each other back and forth until either of you dies. Hopefully not you. I don't know what the rest of these fools are smoking but the music is fakkin sexy. Like if Daft Punk and M83 had a one-night stand and out popped this delish little track 9 months later. Oh yeah, and somewhere in the middle you end up working for the Reaper, returning his lost souls in exchange for a access to The Catacombs, where tasty loot and random combat encounters lie. A nice place to grind for levels and gems (gold). The graphics are stylish monochromatic cel-shaded sexiness with just a dash of color thrown in (think MadWorld* meets Mike Mignolia's Hellboy). In short... just buy the damn game already. You could do a lot worse for $5. A *lot* worse... a lot.*not the slit-your-wrists-and-cry-like-a-baby song by Gary Jules featured in Donnie Darko, but the awesome ultra-violent severely underrated Wii game from Sega.			"

												Good game for its $5 price!No autosave feature, so be careful. (had to replay about 2 hours of gameplay because I forgot to save)Simple but good design for its characters, story, and level. The graphic on lower blocks seems rather badly designed, but it gets much better later.The battle system using energy and defense points are some interesting points in the game. Especially early game where your health depletes so fast without defense. From the description, it emphasize on tactics over grinding, this is true at least on the first block. But for the next blocks actually I still need to grind, especially when I play harder difficulties. What gets on my nerve is that the game feels so slow. Grinding takes very much of my time. Not because I need to kill that many enemies, but killing one enemy takes very long time.After grinding, even bosses are very easy to kill. too easy perhaps. Only struggled on the first block boss because of no grinding area, but a good choice of thralls would really help.			"

												I found this gem through YouTube when some was doing a let's play of Paper Sorcerer. The videos got me interested in the gam and seeing how this game was less than $5, figured I might as well buy it. I never expected to end up playing this for hours non-stop. This game is just amazing. I love the old-school feel with the emphasis on turn-based party strategy and tactics. The artwork of the game is just astounding.  The story-line is great as well. You are able to customize your party members, each member has their own skill sets and the enemies are equally diverse. The music might not suit everyone's taste but for me, I found it especially enjoyable to listen. Each level of the dungeons have their own sound-track.If you love first person dungeon-crawler games with RPG elements, with the emphasis on strategy and tactics then Paper Sorcerer will give you many hours of fun. With the low price, the game is a real steal. Just remember to save often though.			"

												Final Verdict: 8/10, Very GoodFull Review:Paper Sorcerer is a great game if you are looking for a good, old-school RPG to sink your teeth into for about 20 hours. With a great art style, solid gameplay, and interesting story it is definitely worth checking out if you are a fan of the genre.The art in this game  is based on the fact that you are trapped in a book. The world looks as though it has been drawn around you . Essentially, Paper Sorcerer’s art style does what any good art style should do; it helps the game stand out, is pleasing to the eye, and further conveys the tone and story of the game. The sound also helps create a retro feel, with some 8-bit beeps and boops to take you back.The gameplay can be rather repetitive, although, I never found myself bored by it. Battles are essentially clicking moves and watching the turns play out, which could likely be boring for many people but if you are a fan of old-school, turn-based combat, can be rather fun. Outside of combat there is a good amount to do with secrets and non-story areas to be found, explored, and conquered.The story is rather interesting but could have been better told. I found it interesting, I just wish more attention was given to it.  Essentially, you are an evil sorcerer who is trapped in a magic book by four heroes and now need to fight your way out. If you are looking for an old-school, turn-based RPG with a unique art style, interesting story, and solid gameplay then this is certainly worth the $4.99. Even if you are only possibly interested, I would recommend this as you will likely get more than your money’s worth with this game.			"

http://bossdungeon.com/review-paper-sorcerer/ - Full review.If you're in the market for something that's a little Wizardry and a little Shin Megami Tensei, may have a thing or two for you. The first-person dungeon crawling is pretty much everything you've come to expect from these kinds of games, but the combat demands strategic use of all your party members' abilities and strengths. In fact, combat is really the best part of Paper Sorcerer. It may take the same amount of time to clear some normal packs of trash mobs in this game as it would to take on a boss from any other RPG, but the battles themselves are worth it and are infrequent and varied enough to keep from becoming too repetitive. Unfortunately, my recommendation of this game comes with some SEVERE hesitation. The entire user interface is an uncategorized, unformatted, and at times non-functioning mess. Thankfully the menu bugginess is mostly limited to non-combat situations, but it's still a major pain to work with such an aggressively bad UI. There are also a number of bugs that can occur while exploring the dungeon that may require a restart of the game, which will also re-close any doors you've opened making it harder to re-orient yourself afterward. There's either some slight inexperience going on here or the game needed to get booted out the door to satisfy Kickstarter backers. If you want some engaging as hell combat and party customization and don't mind wading through some annoying bugs and terrible menus, by all means have a go at Paper Sorcerer.			"

And the art style and flow / combat mechanics are different enough to be novel and good, but familiar enough to not be altogether alienating or bizarre to the older fanbase for the genre. So yeah. Play it, friendly. Especially given the price point.			"

												After 25 hours of play, I have to say that this game had me hooked.  I think at some point I'll feel like playing an old school dungeon crawler again and come back to it for another play through.  There is definatley replay value here with the variety of team comps that you could have.  If you like the old school might and magic/wizardry dungeon crawlers or you enjoyed Legend of Grimrock you'll probably like this too.  It does have a little JRPG feel mixed in there as well so even though it borrows almost all of it's ideas from some classic games to play on nostalgia it's still an interesting enough mixture to be it's own distinct product.  The story, while very simple, still manages to be pretty interesting and throws a couple twists in there that you may or may not see coming depending on how close you're paying attention to the books/journals you find and the character dialogue.  At $5.00 it's worth it, on sale it's even better.  This game delivered for me.  I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys the old school turn based dungeon crawlers.			"

												I'll just talk about the user interface.  TL/DR: messy and slow UI gets in the way.Aesthetics: Tables aligned with spaces instead of using an actual grid layout, producing weird floppy margins.  Fill bars that don't fit in their containers.  Hard to read font.Annoyance: between each line of dialog, the dialog window disappears and reappears.  That's useless, slow, and since the game is black and white it creates a disturbing flash.  Imagine someone flickering the light after each sentence.Usability: start the game in 1600x900 and look how the ""Controls"" button is covered by the others.  Admire how the mouse cursor lags behind...  the other mouse cursor? (yes, there are two).  You cannot use the keyboard to navigate menus because there is an artificial delay of half a second after each keypress so you have to press, wait, press, wait, press, wait, validate in order to select the third item from a list.  Speaking of validation: space, enter, numpad enter, click, doube-click, it's a mess.  The ""Back"" button acts sometimes as ""OK"", sometimes as ""Cancel"".  Fitts's law was totally ignored during the design, forcing you to swing your mouse all over in order to navigate the windows and menus.Making UIs is hard, I know, there are entire books and university degrees about it, but when a game relies so heavily on it, one would expect basic errors to be avoided. If I cannot navigate menus at the speed of thought (which is totally possible, may games do it right), I feel like I'm fighting the game rather than playing it.			"

												If you're a fan of turn-based RPGs at all, you owe it to yourself to give this game a try.The most obivous difference between this game and most others is the quite unusual art style.  The team making this game is obviously on a budget, and you can see some oddball errors (like inky shadows that are actually 2d planes you can see behind if you jump into the corner) but they decided to use their limited resources to make the most visually striking game they could, regardless.  The same can be said of combat, which is the real meat of the game.  The game uses pre-generated character archetypes that you add to your party in a team of your choosing.  The array of choices are unfortunately not overwhelming, and you don't get a very clear sense of who can do what until after you get them in your party, but if you save before the choice, and experiment a little, you can figure things out.  Combat revolves around energy (which is used only 1-6 points at a time, and where you recover 1 per turn) and cooldowns on skills, as well as an unusual defense system.  Defense drops after physical attacks, and applies to both physical and magic attacks.  Since very high defense nullifies direct magic damage, you need to pound a target's armor down to make them vulnerable to magic.  Meanwhile, magic skills that debuff resistance to physical damage or can incapacitate a target are available, but only within the limits of energy and cooldowns.  It's a game that has unusual depth to how much you have to think to get through even regular battles. (Especially on the brutal ""1980s"" difficulty.)Unfortunately, the game also behaves oddly in many circumstances.  Ability cooldowns don't take as long as they say they do in the menu, and sometimes last into the next combat you engage in.  If you move the mouse while the 2d image of the town is loading, you actually make the perspective on the town move, as it's just a 2d cutout in front of the game's camera.  There's an achievement that you can't unlock because it was accidentally made inaccesible. There's also some balance issues, especially with overpowered skills like sleep, where enemies  only wake up from normal attacks, while a skeleton that's using physical skills to kill the opponent never wakes the target.  This tends to make status effect and damage-over-time characters extremely powerful, while the characters that rely upon direct magic damage are extremely weak because of the way defense works against them.

												Very unusual (and very nice) graphic style.Check out the screenshots to see what I mean. A very fun game. The ambience of the game reminds me of one of my all-time favourites, Ico.Basic idea of the game, as with many others, you start as a low level character, and have an end goal to complete, with smaller things to acheive along the way. Wander around dungeons exploring and completing them. Plus it lets you go back later to a level in case you think you missed something. (The acheivements are a clue to this!)Pick up team members and let them level up with you. Party members can be switched in and out, depending on how you like them. Combat is nice, similiar in style I think to some Japanese RPGs. Turn based, decide who you want to hit/zap/heal/whatever and who you want to do it to, then wait for the round to play out.For the price they are asking, you definitely get your moneys worth.			"

A charming but slightly janky turn-based RPG---Based on ~4 hours of play---The distinctive minimalistic art-style and humour make this fun to play but save often and beware of glitches! This game has not been updated for over 6 months but still has outstanding issues (not to mention a lot of spelling mistakes)...You explore dungeons in realtime while combat is turn-based with reasonable strategy (e.g. spell/skill choices, buffs and debuffs) and with a growing party of your summoned monsters. You can have up to three accompanying you at one time but those not accompanying you level with the party so you can try them if you struggle with certain enemies.I played on the hard difficulty and found the first part of the game very challenging as my party was low on magic and healing. The first boss took multiple attempts but after that hurdle you get optional dungeons that you can explore for gold (=gems), experience and magical items.The game has buggy menus (e.g. they disappear and you need to reload an earlier save - has happened once but consistently on one save for me!), some of the sounds are repetitive and some of the levels have clipping oddities but nothing game breaking so far for me.

GREAT GAME but  ABSURDLY BUGGYIt took me a long time to decide whether to recommend this or not, simply because the good things are awesome and the bad ones are just awful.PROs:  GRAPHICS: minimalistic, original and pretty. CONCEPT: It mixes the principles of the old pixelated RPG's, but, instead of the usual top-down view, it is in first person, adding a point-and-click'ish mood to the game. It feels good. CHARACTERS: besides the main character (the sorcerer), you are able to summon other creatures, and there's a fairly wide variety of species to choose from, with very distinct powers.CONs:  MENUS BEHAVE VERY AWKWARDLY: sometimes they overlap each other and your keyboard keeps controlling the bottom one and your mouse the top one.  HUD: I may be missing something, but I've played a few sessions already and never been able to see my opponents status. That's crazy! Oo INTERACTIONS: After the first time you interact with an object, it just ignores your later interactions, it reacts as if you were clicking on an empty space. Very annoying. And the list could go on and on....Super-honest (maybe harsh wrong) impressions about the team:Good artist + Bad programmer + So-so designer   = A game that has potential but needs better polish.

 Positive + The graphical style (similar to MadWorld but less stylised), with all of the hand-drawn art, gives the game a fairly unique and stylish look+ Both ambient and catchy music perfectly accompanies travelling through the dungeons, and the sound effects used in fights do their job well-enough+ The game does a good job of emulating the old-school dungeon-crawler RPG, with turn-based combat and secrets laid out in the (somewhat small) levels making exploring enjoyable. Negative - There are many minor negative aspects to the gameplay which add up unfortunately, including:At roughly 11 hours of gameplay (on Medium difficulty), it’s a good length for an RPG. Sadly, the campaign length is heavily padded out by the long and drawn-out fights. Being unable to speed up fights, restart already-lost ones, or load during one without quitting the game beforehand makes the fighting extremely tedious the further you get into the game (considering the difficulty jumps up noticeably on the last few floors)Some specific aspects of the combat system are unrefined. For example, if you queue up a heal spell on a party member, and they die before the spell is cast, you will essentially waste an action, as the game will still cast the spell on said dead party member, rather than using it on the next available/active party member (who may need it if the enemy has used an AOE skill or spell); small things like this really make fights harder than they should beThe random loot system makes it so the shop system is mostly pointless for other than selling items, as the equipment found in the field (even in the earlier levels) completely overshadows the ones sold in the shop. Finding unusable items (since you can find items for party members that you didn’t choose in the beginning, making them pointless to obtain for other than selling) is also pretty irritating- The games interface, while serviceable, is fairly slow to navigate and not streamlined enough- One of the few games where I barely paid any attention to the story beyond the beginning and ending; the gameplay is the only thing that will make an attempt to keep your attention until the end. Verdict “While I may have harped on a little about the minor gripes I have with Paper Sorcerer and its gameplay, those aspects of the game didn't drag the game down excessively; it was still an enjoyable experience (for the most part). If you are a fan of old-school dungeon-crawlers, and highly enjoy turn-based combat, this game does those aspects well enough to warrant experiencing. Considering how cheap the game is, even if you’re hesitant to pick it up, it won’t leave your wallet much lighter than before.” 6.5/10 TJBs  "

The Fights are going like classic RPG roundbased Style. i tried this Game out and in my Mind, its Unique. It looks cool, like everything is wroten like a Comic, the Music is Chill and smooth.

												Thoroughly enjoyable, especially for the price.Paper Sorcerer plays like an old school RPG. A cross between Shadowgate, Pokemon and Final Fantasy is how I described it to friends.The art style is fantastic and really helps set the game apart from the mountains of voxel games flooding Steam currently. Music is non-intrusive, and lends itself well to the atmosphere, especially during battle.The newest update helps the game, especially with sorting the inventory.I think having more explanations about the status effects (and how to remove them, I remember wasting so many potions trying to remove different things to no avail), and a way of displaying enemy health/def bars would improve the game even further.Definitely recommended.

												Paper Sorcerer is a Turn based RPG similar to older games like Wizardry 1-3.  Combat is fast paced, the stats are simple to understand and loot is randomized.Gameplay is repetative but still very enjoyable from a tactical standpoint. Party selection is locked in once made and you can not use every available option. This gives limited replay value but still for 5$ it was worth every penny.Music is hit or miss I liked it but not everyone will. The game designer responded quickly to bug reports and has said he is looking into some sound options.			"

												What a fun game and a hidden gem. I picked Paper Sorcerer up on a whim and enjoyed my entire 20+ hour playthrough on normal. Probably will pick up again when the developer makes a few updates. You play as an inprisoned (inside a magical book) sorcerer able to summon 3 party memebers (thralls) to help you on your quest to escape. The combat speed can be a little slow but I didn't mind. The variability of the thralls you choose to aid you is what I feel makes this game great. 3 healers, 2 (main) tanks, and several dps and buff/debuff characters to round it out keeps replayability high. I had a good romp with my team: Vampire (dps/heals), Skeleton (tank), Ghost (buff/debuff), on my playthough. I feel this game is about taking out or incapacitating your enemies before they take out you VS. a give and take of damage with a balanced party with a tank and healer. My opinion could change on a higher difficulty playthrough or if the developer changes the balance of the game.Combat remained fresh, really satisfied that RPG itch I didn't know I was craving. You constantly feel your team growing stronger through levels and new loot which is great.I also appreciated the visual style and music - different and maybe repetitive but I was sold on what the developer was conveying the moment I started the game.Like I said, a little game updating is necessary (some translations, which would make the ending more understandable / maaaybe a combat speed modifier / savable video and control layouts) but the developer seems to be on top of the community requests. Recommendation: Definitely Play - best 5 bucks I've spent in a long time.			"

												This game is easy to get into and very engaging, such that you continually want to do a bit more... yes, one of those.  The art may be black and white and somewhat functional, but it is nonetheless stylish and helps you find your way around, which is really all you need.  The music problem (there is no ingame sound control) will be fixed soon, which is probably the only major gripe about this game. For me, though, it is the storytelling and the quirky sense of humour that shames other games that are ten times its asking price.  And that does not subtract at all from replays - maybe the normal setting is a bit easier than expected, but there are harder setting available, which are well worth the effort.  You will not get a better dungeon crawler for this sort of money.  Brilliant.  Can't wait to see what comes next.			"

												Classic turn based dungeon crawler. That's just the game's description.What it truly is, is a game stripped down to the very essence of gameplay that defines that description. Everything else from zone traversing to merchant is streamlined into a menu selection.The gem in this title has definitely got to be the 1980's difficulty mode. It's the time machine that sits older gamers back in time playing RPGs that are unlike the slew of mindless successors that their characters can overpower through.Buy this, ignore everything but 1980's mode. In it, you'll be pressed to form your party with companions that complement each other and fight strategically rather than having the strongest. You'll clock 10x more play time saving before every fight, but you'll relish every minute of it.			"

That means that when you want to change your playstyle you cn do it an the fly. The story is nothing special but it is cohesive and brings the world to life.

												Easily one of the most entertaining $5 titles I've ever purchased.Everything about this game works toward a grim fantasy atmosphere that exudes character. The simple yet varied gameplay allows for many different styles of turn-based combat, and the simple character graphics perpetuate the theme of a dark novel being told to the player. The ambient sounds and music add so much to the game's dungeon crawling experience, while the battle themes quickly get you ready for action.Paper Sorcerer tells you a story, and allows you to play the sinister main role.

												Very enjoyable, once the keyboard layout is configured it's just as if Original Doom and Wizardry had a colorblind baby. Mildy irritating config bugs were irrelevant, just check after you load a game if they're correct. 5/5 stars... I'm sure the bugs will get ironed out. So far, I am only using the in-game config, but there is one when you start the game that I haven't touched... partially because the command descriptions don't mesh and I'm happy with the ingame one so far. (The inital one helps config controllers, so I give credit for that... just haven't tried it out yet)Games don't need next-gen graphics to be engaging, and this is proof of that. Well worth the money.Pros: Dungeon Crawling Fix, easy on the eyesCons: Config could use work, no volume controls for effects & music.			"

												Pros:- Only $5.00.- Fun RPG/Dungeon Crawl- Unique and cool storylineCons:- Though fun in the beginning, after a cpl/few hrs of play it drags on for the remaining 8+ hours of play (very repetitive).- Combating regular mobs is drawn out, and usually more difficult than bosses. - Many bugs... Save very often, as occasionally equipment and item screens glitch and force you to reload the game.- The biggest con I found with this game, is that the mini-battles (mob fights) are simply drawn out way longer than they should be. Conclusion:If you're a fan of dungeon crawls, and haven't played one in a while - get this game. Otherwise, there are more enjoyable games out there for the money.			"

												Pretty good game, if you like old style turn based rpgs, you'll enjoy this one. :)My team in the end was Sorcerer (Mage path), Goblin, Puppet (Guillotine + Divine Arm, great damage and combo) and Vampire. And I had Cultist idle mostly used to heal my vampire and ressurect dead allies out of battle.General tacticI used: Puppet would end up doing up to 750 AoE damage, Goblin would stun the enemies, Sorcerer would do frost AoE giving a Frostbite DoT to everyone, and Vampire would focus on single target high damage. Mostly only healed with Vampire outside of combat, since he did so much damage with the greatsword.			"

												This game is a first person, turn based combat game. You play an evil sorcerer who gets trapped inside a book (hence the black and white look of the game). You have to travel from cell block to cell block defeating enemies and undoing the bindings from each area to ultimately escape. Helping you along the way are three creatures that you are given the choice of summoning, each with their own combat advantages and disadvantages.What holds this game back from being good are the bugs. Quest items and keys will vanish from your inventory upon reloading your game. Certain achievements are impossible to do as a result and consequently the whole game has a certain unfinished feel to it. There is no sound menu as of yet and the music in certain levels gets rather loud. All of this could be mostly due to the fact that it's just a one man dev team. Yup. One man. This is an impressive outing for one person to do. Honestly though, dev teams, even indie dev teams, need to be a tad larger to handle not only releasing, but updating a product to keep it bug free. That's where this game falters.I can't recommend this one right now. If the bugs get fixed then I might change my vote. Right now though, gotta thumbs down it.			"

												This game is a pretty nice semi-traditional RPG with a good amount of thought put into it, whose only major flaw seemed to be a a few difficulty spikes / balance problems and a few bugs that actually just got fixed in a recent patch.  If you played the Shin Megami Tensei games, you may find some of the mechanics here very familiar and enjoyable.The story of the game is strong enough that the premise and personality of the characters feels interesting.   Even if it doesn't get all that deep, it doesn't feel trivial or just there to hold the game together.  The black and white + paper aesthetic ties into this (you are trapped in a magical prison inside a book), but ultimately is just a nice aesthetic choice rather than being relevant to the gameplay at all.  The music is sort of an interesting mix of retro and electronic (but not chiptune) and seems to be disliked by quite a few others, but personally I enjoyed it.  The game performs and controls well at all points, although some menus become annoying to interact with if their contents become too long of a list.The mechanics of the game are actually pretty interesting in how they both stick to and vary from normal RPG conventions.  MP recharges every turn and skills have independent cooldowns, thus letting you not feel like you have to conserve special attacks but also making it strategic to choose how to use it.  Status effects are applicable to almost all enemies and are actually useful to use in most encounters, as are stat-de/buff spells.  The game lets you build a party as you play the game and choose from a variety of tanks, healers, and both physical and magic dealing types, as well as specialize the main character partway through the game.  These characters can interact very well, with some setting up attacks for the other, drawing aggro, or blocking attacks along with the traditional buffing and healing.  Gear is fairly straightforward stat upgrades for the most part, and any excess money has a sink in useful stat upgrades.  Item drops are random and you can sometimes generate out-of-depth gear that carries you for several floors.  All enemy encounters are set except when specifically noted as random in a few specific areas.If there are any complaints of the game, it is probably that there are strong difficulty spikes at the early part of the game (second or third boss IIRC) and the end of the game (Lv40 tier Assassin x2 + Sorcerer + Warrior mage encounter), and then later on seem surprisingly non-challenging.  I was able to pass these encounters without too much trouble even still.  There also aren't too many puzzles in the game, mostly a few perception based or riddle based puzzles.  A small complaint here is that a certain game-length chess key puzzle has the unfortunate quality of having your key break when used in the wrong lock.  All that really costs you is a reload and since you can have up to 10 saves it can mean a trivial amount of time lost, so I wonder why they didn't just say that the key doesn't work instead.  Also, said keys are removed from your inventory when successfully used, and all doors close and re-lock if locked upon reload.  Thus it is possible to accidentally shut yourself out of a chain of completed-puzzle-loot if you quit the game at a few awkward points, but you can't get yourself stuck as all such rooms can be opened by a level from the inside.Overall a really fun game, about 20 hours worth with a modest amount of replayability from trying the other party members you didn't play with or playing on a higher difficulty.  It gets a pretty solid recommendation from me!			"

												This game starts out pretty good, with an interesting artstyle and a fairly engaging combat system. But it's not as good as it seems.You play as a sorcerer trapped in a magic prison in the form of a book (hence the artstyle). You goal is to make it through all 10 floors of the dungeon (each floor has 3 levels plus a boss). The first few levels look like generic dungeons, brick walled corridors and sparesely furnished side rooms. There is nothing particularly interesting, some bits of story, some buttons to press, some simple puzzles, some loot to pick up, and of course enemies to fight. You'd think they would change it up eventually but no, this is what every level looks like. There is zero variety, and it really feels like a slog after a while. Very far away from games with excellent dungeon design like Legend of Grimrock. Fortunately each level is small so it's pretty fast to get through, but what will take up most of your time is the battles.The game uses a battle system that seems inspired by older JRPGs. It's a menu-based system where your group and one or more enemies take turns choosing attacks/actions. In the early stages of the game you get to pick from a list of characters to summon as permanent party members of your group. They all have different skills so there is a lot of customization there based on who you pick. You'll be able to get 5 in total but only 3 can be used at once (together with yourself) for a total of 4 party members. As you level up you unlock more skills/spells to use in combat, but you do not get to pick which ones, there is no skill tree or anything like that. Between levels there is a town area where you can visit a skill trainer which will let you upgrade your characters' various stats in exchange for money. It's all pretty standard.At the start of a combat turn you pick all of your characters' actions, then both you and the enemies act, one after another in order of highest agility score. The order isn't made clear, and active status effects on you and enemies isn't obvious either, so it's often hard to plan ahead and really feel like you can properly use strategy. The result is that a lot of the time combat feels too random. There's no telling if an enemy will start with a powerful group attack that instantly almost kills your entire team (yes this happens), or if you'll be able to get off the correct buffs and attacks first.The menu UI is slow and cumbersome to use, especially out of combat when you equip your party members and manage your items, and skills often come with only a vague description of what they do. I had one fairly high level spell with the description ""deal damage based on the difference between current and maximum HP"" and while using it somtimes it did some minor damage to the enemy, and other tiems it healed them! So I just ended up never using it.Then there's the loot system. It is very random. There are loads of items that only specific characters can use, characters that might not even be in your party, so there's no telling if you'll get unusable items, bad items, very good items or just gold or a potion. The result is that you can be very underequipped if you're unlucky, and equipment make a pretty big difference in this game. This might make you tempted to exploit the game, because if you save before opening a chest and you get an item you don't want, you can simply reload the game and try again for another random item.In general the game gives you an unpolished and unfinished feel. There's plenty of bugs and glitches, spelling errors, unbalanced enemies and skills, a few unsolvable puzzles, and even several achievements that just won't unlock (including the ones you get for completing the game). The music feels out of place, it's not awful, but there's this weird constant crackle and you'll hear the same tunes throughout the entire game so in the end I just muted all sound and put on my own music.In the end the game is mediocre at best. Decent artstyle but with no variety, forgettable story, boring dungeon design, unbalanced combat and loot system, and buggy. Only get this (at a 75% off sale) if you're a fan of this type of combat system.			"

All that really costs you is a reload and since you can have up to 10 saves it can mean a trivial amount of time lost, so I wonder why they didn't just say that the key doesn't work instead.  Also, said keys are removed from your inventory when successfully used, and all doors close and re-lock if locked upon reload.  Thus it is possible to accidentally shut yourself out of a chain of completed-puzzle-loot if you quit the game at a few awkward points, but you can't get yourself stuck as all such rooms can be opened by a level from the inside.Overall a really fun game, about 20 hours worth with a modest amount of replayability from trying the other party members you didn't play with or playing on a higher difficulty.  It gets a pretty solid recommendation from me!			"

Everything is slow, laggy, and generally painful to do. Considering it's an old style RPG   this is kind of an important thing. Not that the underlying gameplay is really that great either... it feels like an RPGmaker game with a 3D environment and starts to feel real repetitive real quick. Don't be fooled by the neat looking art style! What's underneath is pretty underwhelming.			"

												While looking at the screenshots I got a warm feeling inside of me. The looks are what drew me in, but unique as they might be, the rest of the game is too uninspired for my taste.I'm not a huge fan of round-based combat to begin with (only the SRPG kind), but some games make it work and fun (Paper Mario for example). Here it is too conventional. Sure, if you like your games this way, then PaPer Sorcerer will probably be to your liking too.But a couple of other things put me off as well. The music is terribly unfitting for a game in this setting, there is no map, the UI is very clunky and some easy to fix problems haven't been addressed yet (why?). The button to invert the mouse is not visible in full screen mode and even if you activate it, it isn't saved. Things like that just tick me off, seriously.			"

												I want to love this game, I really do. But I can't, I'm sorry, but the one thing you messed up happened to be the most important. Let me tell you about balancing, if you go up against a boss, the ideal situation is: He kills you once, then you know what you're up against and have a challenging and climactic fight. Games like dark souls, for instance, don't have to worry about that, since they're built to stop the player from progressing, rather than ease them on. But that justification doesnt apply to turn based rpgs. The balancing in this game is, and I'm sorry to say this, pitiful, while you'll likely go through an area without dying at all (albeit fighting some enemys with ridiculous health pools), you will not, I repeat WILL.NOT. be prepared for any of the bosses, excluding the first one. The four (presumably four, i haven't completed the game) bosses in this game aren't so much difficulty spikes as difficulty brick walls that can only be broken through by infinite revive items. I applaud it for expecting some level of rpg knowledge, you don't have a hope in hell for getting through the second area without a healer, for instance, but considering that, healer's dont help too much when faced with a giant with a massive f**k off sword that can bring down your entire group to half health in one move, then K.O one of them in another. What I'm saying is, the difficulty spikes in this game are pure industrially refined bull sh*t. *SPOILERS FOR THIRD BOSS* And that's not even mentioning the third boss, the customary ""Uses stat alterations and minions"" boss, but do you know why that kind of boss is customary? Because the minions in question usually don't do a wopping 70-100 damage in one hit, my tank minion had around 150 at that point, then there's taking into question that with one spell the boss can basically make every single move you use miss, and you sure as f**k aren't getting those debuffs down in time before the minions sweep you up like the underlevelled stain you resemble.And I say underlevelled, but as the trailer made a song and dance about, you cannot grind in this game. Now, rpg developers, I need you to listen to me for a minute, okay? Yeah, get real close, yeah just there, OK...GRINDING IS NECCESARY TO THE GAME. In most RPGs seeing bosses like this would immediately tell me that ""Okay, im underlevelled, time to farm"" and then I would probably quit and uninstall the game, but avid rpg players would go and farm that sh*t. What if I spent all my gems on revive items for the boss, then discovered my guys got killed too quickly to use them? What if i saved after buying them? I won't have the money to start training (which I assumed was just for people who didn't want to play the game like the manly man I am) and I also won't have anywhere to get more gems from because I've already cleared out all the levels. Basically, this game is a story of one f**k up and it's over, start again. Which is something I can admire from say, a roguelike, but not from a turn based rpg. On the same note, the paper-drawn art style was interesting to start with, and I'm fairly certain took a lot more effort than it would have taken to just use unity assets, but god does it make the environments boring after a while.Basically, paper sorcerer's balancing is sh*t on toast, and I couldn't care less if everything else was gleaming gold, if it isn't balanced, you're gonna have a bad time, it's got good ideas and an interesting concept, but the execution is pretty poor. I give this game a 5/10, just clinching the non-recommendation "

												I went into this game not sure what to expect. As it began, I wasn't impressed, but after the first couple of fights, things started getting interesting. Eventually, I was having quite a bit of fun. The music is quite good, the ""paper"" appearance is pretty spiffy, and the fights were fairly strategic. Granted, I suck, so when I discovered that I could grind, I did for about half an hour before taking on the second big area. I felt guilty, like I had cheated a bit when I got to the second boss fight and I was taking hits to my entire party which dealt 50% or more damage to their HP. Despite having two healing characters, one of my healers was dead the next round, and my mage and warrior were dead within two more rounds. My final healer died swiftly after that. I had hoped to play a western RPG so that I wouldn't have to grind, because I want to experience progress moving through a game; not fighting the same crap for hours on end to get to see the next area, effectively making it easy for a developer to make less content but make it take longer to reach to conceal the fact that there is less content than in other titles, as with a Final Fantasy game or a free to play RPG. Perhaps a glorious strategist could do well in this game without grinding, but for me to succeed, I would have to grind for a very, very long time, and that's not entertainment; that's a job. I play games to have fun when I'm not working, and grinding is not fun. If you're quite good at turn-based strategy games or you love having to grind, this game is for you. Otherwise, I would recommend avoiding. I said it before, but great music and visual aesthetic, though...			"

												This is a warning/heads up to anyone else who uses a Wacom tablet mouse: This game is completely unplayable. It refuses to recognize the tablet mouse as a mouse once the game starts (funny how it works fine for all of the option menus...) and you will not even be able to get out of the first room since it's completely unresponsive. It is very rare that I encounter this in a game, as 99% of games automatically realize that a Wacom mouse is just a mouse, but this is one of the few ones that doesn't. Wish I'd known I can't even play it before I bought it, but hopefully this will be a good warning to anybody else who uses a tablet mouse.			"

												I can't decide if I love this game or hate it.  It is a classic turn-based rpg, with more skills and class options than games of old.  That said, it has a 1980's difficulty setting which is pretty amazing, but at the same time you aren't given any opportunities to grind for gold or exp, which detracts from what I loved about the difficulty of old games.  I always loved high difficulty in rpgs, but I also loved the ability to grind for the absolute best gear and higher levels.  You can still make your way through the game on 1980's, but you'll always feel very weak.  Or you can turn the difficulty down, but then you'll feel strong for no reason.  Strength just doesn't feel earned to me in this one.			"

												Great little game in an old-school RPG style. The game play is simple yet with a depth of strategy, with a unique story basis that made it an interesting play right off the bat. I like the graphic representation of the game and the controls were easy to figure out as well. The music during some of the boss fights was great, but would have liked a little more variety during standard game play.On the bad side, the game is still a little buggy and the dialogue, especially during the end of the game, is very poorly written. I'm not sure if it was done by someone with English as a second language, but it ruined the final scene of the game for me.For $5, you really can't go wrong here if you're into the old school RPG scene.

												You may very well buy this game because it's cheap, reviews are quite good and it has some style. And you can even enjoy yourself if you are actually a casual lover of dungeon crawler. Sur you'll notice how little production value there is in it (we're roughly below the two months/men of graphic+coding+music+writing) but really it's not an issue because priorities seem set right at first. The receip work: you enjoy yourself.That is, once you realise that all of this very cheap art content hasn't been made in favour of strong gameplay. By this I mean gameplay is as cheap as the art. You can loot totally overbalanced object pretty easily. Some character are ridiculously cheesy. Enough battles quickly establish that the design of those is severly lacking in many ways.There is a basis for something really neat here but it's clear that there is also the need for intensive work for 2-3 guys for at least 6 months, easily a full year.Don't buy it yet. Even it it's cheap on the money it isn't on time and you want to enjoy it in good condition, when it's not broken. Read updated reviews.			"

												There are a large number of deal breaking bugs and issues. - Audio cracks and glitches with no option to turn it off.       * On Windows, this can be mitigated with the volume mixer allowing the management of individual applications' sound sources, but the user shouldn't have to resort to this to cover up a developer's oversights.- The floating combat text is difficult to read and may or may not actually be descriptive of what actually happens.      * e.g. Defender and Mage Armor combat text says it increases both def and max def while only max def is increased.- Graphics options don't save correctly.- Status effects expire or persist in unexpected ways.- Not all menu options (like the Skill Trainer's menu) respect keybindings and require mouse input for selection.- Launcher's keybinding options do not match in-game keybinding options.- Writing/dialogue has the occasional typo, but contain many inconsistencies, e.g. defense and defence are both used along with armory and armoury.- Damage over time effects trigger seemingly randomly.- Certain achievement triggers are ignored making them impossible to obtain.A quick search returns many more that I haven't personally experienced and shows that many of these issues have been persistent for well over a year. This is a game that may be worthwhile on sale, but even then its many issues may keep you from truly enjoying this game and demotivate you from playing.			"

And the interface is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful, I don't think nostalgia is any excuse for that.Playing on hard, the difficulty is.. well, everything is incredibly easy, then you meet a boss who two shots the party. There's no strategy to it, just grind more xp/gems, or savescum till you get lucky and the boss forgets to use his nastier attacks.The fights are pretty much RNG on top of more RNG, hoping the enemies don't attack your weaker characters, and that you roll high damage (the damage range is HUGE) and your enemies low. Bad luck? Oh well, one or two characters dead, battle lost. Regardless of any challenge, bait or whatever taunt-style abilities you use. They don't actually seem to do anything. And if you do seem to be losing a fight? Well, alt+f4, since there's no way to actually surrender or flee. You just either spam space and watch the slooooooow animations go by as you wait for the defeat screen, or just close the game.Oh yeah, and the game's settings are in the launcher, which is probably a default of whatever toolkit/library the game was made with. Which is shoddy but ok.. except it doesn't even save the damn settings.			"

At least I don't have any.- The game somewhat systematically forget my resolution so I always have to re-set it every time I start session.- There are no enemies in this games, you're surrounded by a static environment and an annoying pop-up text is telling you what's going on to hide the fact that.. nothing is going on.- To say the menus are cumbersome would be a big understatement. You need to click three times where other games would make it a one-click thingy. The gameplay while in battle is a total nightmare for that very reason.- The game does not seem balanced at all. You get to choose some very powerful allies right from the starts which destroy any challenge early on. You're supposed to be in jail but it feels more like a walk in the park so far.- The story is over-simplistic and doesn't feel engaging.- The game doesn't feel finished as it greatly lack of polishing.I ♥♥♥♥ing hate this game.

The game certainly has a striking look to it, but... well, frankly, you'd be much better off playing the true Wizardry-like for DS, The Dark Spire, which has a similarly stark aesthetic — in fact I can't help but assume this was inspired by that one.

												You cannot turn of the music or even turn the volume down . Personally i think the music is awful and does not fit with the game at all. Everyone has different tastes in music but having incredibly loud repetitive music you can't turn off is ridiculous.Also the dev said he would add the feature to turn the music off , god knows how many months ago that was , it's not happening. So i wasted my money and the dev never bothered.			"

												Paper Sorcerer is an old-school inspired dungeon-crawler RPG (In the same vein as Legend of Grimrock, although they're both very different games). As you can see from the screenshots, it has a very unique art-style that draws you in, and while it has a couple of good ideas and its head on its shoulders, it's falls very short of expectations once you go deeper into it.You're an evil sorcerer that was imprisioned in a book by the king. Once you're there, you'll gather allies and try to destroy the bindings of the book to free yourself. In essence, the game is mostly about combat. You go through several floors on a dungeon (there are 10 in total, each with a Boss in the end)  to free yourself. You can ""explore"" each floor, but exploration is very limited, and mostly just there to break the monotony of combat. There are also another 10 floors called the Catacombs, that serve more as a grinding place, and a SideQuest.Let's start with presentation.While the graphics' style is certain very unique, and I really liked it at the beginning, it barely every changes. Maybe a slighly different color scheme (between black/white and sepia), perhaps a different wall texture, but all in all, every floor looks very much alike, and it gets very repetitive later on, specially in a game that runs for about 15-20 hours.While in combat, you see the enemies' figure, but there's no animation in them. All you have is either particle effects for spells, or a simple swipe/throw animation for physical attacks. Personally, I don't mind the simplicity of it, but one big issue I had with it is that, despite being very simple, it took a long time.There's also a constant filter on the screen. To give it some texture. But it has no reason at all to be there. During the whole time, there's a translucid texture on your vision that makes no sense at all, and there's no option to disable it (unless it about turning the graphics down as a whole... only has Unity presets).Tangentially, the interface was sluggish as well. Everything took more clicks than it should, and the text boxes jumped to different places for no reason, leading to more time looking for the right place with the mouse.For example, with attacks in-combat: even if there only one enemy, is still has you selected the enemy you want to hit after choosing an attack. Unnecessary. If your character is either paralyzed or asleep, you only have one possible move. The game also has you have to select it anyway. Again, unnecessary.These are mere examples, but it happens a lot in this game. Its interface is certainly not good, and that really detracts from the experience in a game like this that's almost exclusively about inventory/party/skills management. Everything takes way too long to do, really disliked it.How's the music? Well, again, it missed its target. Sometimes the music felt like softer disco music. Some other times it felt more oldschool, other times more piano driven... very inconsistent. And for the most part, it didn't fit the game at all. And when the music is misplaced in a game, one tends to turn it off, right? Well, no sound options at all, so no deal. That's right. Either you mute the game, or you'll have to deal with it all. Not good at all...The sound effects weren't all that great, but they do the job, I don't mind those at all.It gets repetitive.The story was told through books you found by exploring the floors. But each ""book"" gives you a very small passage of the story, and they're spread apart pretty far. Meaning that you'll not really keep the story in mind, unless you want to read all of the books in succession from your inventory. I don't think it was a very good way to conveying it, but hey, you can ignore it easily without affecting the experience.Well, let's get on with what really matters in this game: the combat. Despite all the sweet coating, this game is all about combat and party management/equipping.First off, and this is common practice, you pick your difficulty out of 4 (Easy, Normal, Hard and 1980s) before starting the game and I believe it's permanent. You'll also pick your team mates as you go, but also very early on (in the first 2 or 3 floors, basically). They make you make all these choices without letting you know how each one plays out. It's a shot in the dark. There's no adaptation period, no ""extended"" tutorial to let you try out the different classes... It's a shot in the dark. And I don't agree with it at all. With the companions, they half overcome this problems. While you'll choose most of the members at the start, you'll have the ability of summoning others a few floors later, in the Catacombs. So, if you're not at all content with your party, you may be able to save the situation. But you may not. Each class has a short description, but it's not useful at all if you're not familiar with the mechanics, rendering it kinda pointless.You can have 3 parterns at once (plus yourself, the Sorcerer), and have others as a backup plan, and maybe switch them up if needed (outside of combat). I had absolutely no need to switch them, but the option is there.I played on Hard Mode. While it was actually really hard for the first 3 floors (and required grinding in the Catacombs), it then became far easier after I rearranged my team, and found a viable strategy. Unfortunately, it takes a few hours for you to do so.After the third Boss, while it's still fairly challenging, that difficulty almost came to a halt, as the same strategy worked for literally every battle. The game became far too monotonous. The enemies became mostly upgrades of the previous ones, which meant that I didn't need to change my party or tactics to succeed, unfortunately. The combat is typical RPG turn based. You have a basic attack, and you have skills. These skills can go from direct damage, damage over time, healing, improving X element of magic, increasing defense, control (like sleep, slow, paralyze) etc. It has lots of options, but it didn't seem to use them all very much.As I said, the combat is very slow. And to aggravate this problem, late in the game, you'll fight several enemies at once, and they all have tons of HP. You'll be constantly fighting the same enemies over and over again, and each fights takes a long time, even if you're out of danger.And I mean a LONG time. It got infuriating in the late game. At the half-way mark, about 10 hours in, I was enjoying it. I overcame my difficulties, and was solidifying my strategy. After that, it was just the same over and over and over again. Same enemies, same strategy.The mana system (Energy) in this game was quite cool. It was simplified, as you had far more limited amounts, but it would restore at a good rate, and you have to constantly managed how much a spell costs, or gives you, and try to keep constantly fighting. It really enjoyed this aspect!Let's talk about  encounters. Inconsistent, at best. It tries not to have random encounters, which is good! They place the enemies at certain points that you NEED to fight, but can prepare yourself. Great! Then, the catacombs have random encounters, and I saw it as a way to grind, if necessary. Even better! You only go there if you actually need to, so it's a good thing. But then, some of the main floors, seemingly at random, also have random encounters... It makes no sense to abandon previous design decisions for no reason! And it's infuriating to have random encounters appear out of nowhere! It destroys previously great design choices.The puzzles followed the same inconsistency. First, they were all self contained in each floor. Great! Then, they start spreading through several floors with no previous indication...Paper Sorcerer could have been pretty good. But it's not consistent with its design, and gets too repetitive. Huge miss, sorry to say... "

												Full of ridiculous bugs that could easily be fixed but haven't for some reason. Unity launcher has tons of superfluous control options that aren't actually used in the game... Menus aren't positioned correctly for higher resolutions, so elements clip into each other... Menu buttons get clicked invisibly through the options menu, so while I was assigning controls, the intro cinematic started with the menu still hovering over it... Strange use of both mouse click and ""accept"" key makes things awkward, especially if trying to use a controller... Minions list doesn't let you use keys to navigate it for some reason, have to use mouse... Can't change mouse sensitivity... Just lots of unprofessional stuff. I can't be bothered with this game until it feels less flimsy.			"

												NOTE: I put about five hours into a non-Steam version of this game.I was hoping to find a good dungeon crawl with a modern twist that combines the best of Western and Eastern Role-Playing Games. What I got was a game that has a bull♥♥♥♥♥♥armor class system (albeit unique), boring battles, very bad UI and poorly looped chiptune music (and not very good chiptune music either). I will give it credit for its unique take on villians, its interesting setting and awesome art style that is reminiscint of PnP RPG books and Atlus's ""The Dark Spire"", but that's about it. Oh, and at least it's not $20.00.			"

												I really really want to recommend this game. I really do. But it's just too bare bones. It's too simple and nothing. I adore the art style and I like a lot of the music a lot. (I'm going to actually even add some to my music collection.) but it's just a little too cheaply made. For a game so simple, you'd expect it to be less buggy. But its not. It's got quite a few annoying glitches and bugs that I had to look up on how to fix. Most of the dungeons look exactly the same. completely empty hallways with doors that lead to more hallways or just the bed and shelf. The rpg aspect isn't bad, but it can also be lame. The first 4 party members you choose you can be stuck with for the whole game if you don't find secrets. I quickly found out that if I didn't find secrets, I was being MASSIVELY gimped to the point of enemies two shotting me. (yes I was playing on hard my first time, but once I found the secrets I breezed through and got new party members.) All in all if you got the game for a dollar? I'd say try it out and give it a go for an hour or two at least. But I don't think I could tell anyone specifically to buy this game if they didn't already.			"

												Review written: 22/01/14**NoteThe amount of butthurt coming from this negative review is insane. If you have a problem with what has been written, make a comment about it. **I find it absolutally hilarious that someone was so upset about this they downvoted all my other reviews. That's pathetic. This is a subjective review of a project. God forbid someone have their own opinion on the internet.Paper Sorcerer is a game in which we take on the role of a sorcerer who has been imprisoned in a book.The soundtrack in Paper Sorcerer is made up of repeating the same short music blip over and over. There is an incredible lack of SFX and other gameplay audio. No Voice Acting, and repeating combat sounds really hold this game down. Audio- 2/5This game features a beautifully unique art style, one that makes the world look very pleasing. This game contains well done textures and models- though in some aspects it seems as though the developers took the easy way out; such as blackness in place of shadows, or floating balls in place of enemy sprites. Nonetheless, the game is still very aestitically pleasing. 4/5The story seems rather boring and underdeveloped. Nothing new or interesting. Standard ""Escape the dungeon"" story we have seen countless times before and no character choice or decisions to be made. Very bland. 1/5Mechanically, this game suffers. The gameplay is simplistic, with little ""customization"" outside of changing a character's gear, or selecting new party members. We have no choice in our character's  traits or class. There is very little environment interaction aside from opening doors and enemies are painfully easy to evade as they are do not seem to move. It is possible to complete entire levels with no combat at all. Combat is quite frusterating; The energy/attack system is limiting, and the inability to gauge the status of enemies makes combat confusing. 3/5Major issues that impacted the score- Stationary enemies, lack of character customization, generic story, frusterating combat system.Final score- 10/20 or 50%   Buy at own risk			"

												A fantastic little journey!  The game was great and had some amazing little touches to it in the design of things.  The only thing I can say negative about it is that you cannot turn off the music (which gets old after some time because it is midi). The combat can be tricky and gathering your party to your design is fun and a challenge in itself.  <IMPORTANT!> There is an early part in the game where you must choose whether to use a soul to summon one of your past minions OR use it for something ""physical"".  You only get this chance 1 time... so think about it before choosing.  There are nice puzzles and some very well implemented design to the them.  Not too tough but not frustrating or required to complete them to advance.Party variety is very unique but you cannot use all minions on a single play through. Reason to play again on a harder difficulty with different characters then  :)I definitely would LOVE a sequel to this which I hope would be much deeper on all aspects (and the ability to toggle of music )Maybe the next title will be ""Paper Sorcerer: the Grimoire Temptress""  :)Regardless, if you like party based first person dungeon crawler games, this one is unique and well worth the inexpensive cost!

												Retro dungeon crawler with a unique twist! Love the stylized paper look, the whole premise of being trapped in a book, and the spread of characters to choose from. So many different combinations of party! Not just your typical Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, Wizard dungeon-spelunking team.My first playthrough has the Sorcerer with a Vampire, Troll and Skeleton. It's an interesting challenge playing without a dedicated healer (Vampire can heal, but it's not his primary function), and I still haven't figured out the Troll's full potential (he's rogue-ish but still falls far behind damage-wise compared to my other characters. I have a feeling crits will be more critty as I go on.) The Skeleton, though, is a tank powerhouse, so I've been using his abilities to build / regain defense to stay alive. It's worked... So far.Dungeon crawlers are supposed to be hard, and this is definitely a challenging game, but less so than playing, say, Etrian Odyssey or Ancient Domains of Mystery. I actually feel like I have a chance of beating this game the first time through without getting bored from all the grinding halfway through. Of course, I've not even gotten past the second level yet, so my evaluation can change, but so far? Just difficult enough.The only negatives I'd like to point out are some UI glitches (nothing game breaking though) and the fact that when you save, the save window doesn't update with your new save info. So it's hard to know sometimes if I've saved or not! But none of it detracts from the fun I'm having, and will continue to have with Paper Sorcerer. Good job!			"

The 1st-person dungeon exploration is great, with some puzzle-solving skills, and aspects that remind me of point-'n-click adventure games.  But the amount of loot, equipment, and endless character-building possibilities firmly place this as a RPG -- even if the turn-based combat didn't give it away.  All of this game's ""modes"" are firmly excellent, and stylistically stunning.			"

A lot of custom team members2. Creative fighting/spells3. Good dungeons cool and unique loot and hidden rooms4. Easy to learn 5. Not easy to run through quickly did it on easy in 12 hours6. Good game for 5$REASONS I DON'T APPROVEHonestly..... only 1 reason which is the glitches but most games have those and you can't get through them till they patch it so if your looking to get all achievements like I was at first then just wait till they patch it because it is impossible to get all of them, I have all possible achievments and 7 of them are broken or unobtainable other then that this game is great overall and a good pick up even not on sale :) really enjoyed my time playing this unique creative game			"

Apart from the atmospheric black and white environments and the nice music, this game offers a solid RPG experience that can be challenging at times.Make no mistake, early choices on character and party members will affect you through the whole game, so choose wisely ^_^.I only have 2 complaints , if you can call them that, is that the items in chests are too random which might push people to the old load and open routine which is tedious at best and the inventory ystem can be a drag sometimes.If you like RPG's or atmospheric games, give this one a try. Well worth the money.			"

												Review: 4/10 (Because of the bugs)Minimalistic yet fun dungeon crawler. The game is old school like the old Might & Magic games whereby you create a party and kill enemies in dungeons, searching for loot at every corner. The visuals/graphics are montonous and the game doesn't rely upon too many assets so don't expect much variety from it - Especially if you look at the low price point. The gameplay however is addictive and if you're a fan of the genre, you won't regret your purchase. Beware of bugs though, the game freezes at random points so save often to not lose progress (The game doesn't autosave).			"

												Soaked with atmosphere, a modern melancholical black-and-white trip with oldschool dungeon-crawl mechanics. The music and art makes for a brilliant mashup conveying something that's hard to put into words. More games should try to convey, to ""get to"" people. Paper Sorcerer makes for a very peculiar mesh of moods that makes for a emotionally believable experience. Of escaping. A struggle. In a desperate setting. Yet at the same, beautifully mundane.The game is really something else. A game with soul.			"

The interface is definitely for old-school rpg fans, but the game doesn't feel old at all. Lots of different tactics to use to beatthe game and enough difficulty settings to please everyone. This is a great choice if you don't shy away from Attack/Skill/Item/Defend type turn-based RPGs.			"

												It's pretty good for a old school, dungeon crawl style RPG, like Wizardry.  If you buy it, I'd wait for a sale though.  While it's good, it's also got several bugs and ZERO audio controls.  Chances are, you're going to hate the music in the game after a while and the only thing you can do about it is mute the sounds in your windows mixer.			"

												I was into this game almost immediately. I'm absolutely in love with the atmosphere and the style. I wish the cell blocks were a bit larger as I feel like there are only a couple of battles per block. The only thing about it that I really dont care for is the sound effects and music. If you dont like midi sounds then you're going to have a bad time. I'd recommend this to just about anyone that enjoys unique small scale RPGs.			"

												This game slakes my thirst for nostalgia, it conjures up the joy of playing old school D&D with pen and paper back in my youth. The art style is exactly what it needs to be: simple, yet engaging. The combat is simplified but is reminiscent of just about all turn-based RPGs with a nice assortment of skills that doesn't get overwhelming. The music is appropriate for its setting and after a few turns of combat, I barely notice that it's there because it becomes ambient-I like that. It fills a void that other games just don't satisfy for me.It can feel grindy to some, the combat can get particularly repetitive especially if turn-based combat isn't your thing. This is  what I would definitely consider a ""casual"" game, you're not going to find a lot of flashy environments, that said, however; at least it doesn't tax lower-end computers like mine. I can play it on the ""fantastic"" setting for graphics and there's no issue. There is really no options menu to speak of, you get a choice of three resolutions, the option of being in windowed or non-windowed mode, and the option to change the level of graphics. You can rebind controls as you will, and the game does offer information on it's in-game menu if you need some help deciding on which thralls to summon.It doesn't exert any tactical thought, but that's part of its charm to me. It's a game I can just load up, sink an hour or two into, feel nostalgic, and then be satisfied. It never feels like ""work"" to me, but as mentioned, it can become grindy to anyone unfamiliar with the basic repetition of turn-based random encounters. All in all, a pleasant experience.			"

												An excellent play on a classic genre, Paper Sorcerer presents a refreshing take on the turn based RPG. With the ability to pick and choose from a wide range of party members, there are many different avenues of play styles one could experiment with. The visuals are presented in monochrome, giving the world a stark contrast to many modern games but one I feel it pulls off rather admirably. The soundtrack is very well done and never seems to get old. With a solid storyline and good level design, Paper Sorcerer is the full package.			"

Then you'll like this, while normal mode is perfectly doable and doesn't require too much pain the real gems are the hard and 1980's modes. These will force you to take every battle strategically and often leave you surviving by the skin of your teeth.Also I reccomend the skeleton, skeleton bro for lyfe.			"

												Why are you not playing this game yet? It has such a simple design in the 2D graphics with the simple concept you've got of dealing with your 4 energy to dish out attacks, heal, raise stats, and lower your opponents. It is turn-based in the simplier style of those old RPGs we all used to play.The 2D style goes so well since you're a sorcerer, male or female, whom wound up being trapped in a book. The paper black/white or rather black/aged paper is such a unique concept that just adds to the atmosphere.There are no sudden random battles, but you will find your foes as these floating and blinking ink blotches.And the humor hidden within is just cackle worthy.Beware the 1980 difficulty. They call it that for a reason. If you're old enough to know why, then you'll understand. If not, well, we will weep for you upon your death.			"

												An incredibly fun dungeon romp with a heart and soul of its own. The mechanics, while simple, never become tiresome. The combat, while straightforward, is never as easy as you might expect. It challenges you at every turn and has a touching story buried in its middle and end. One of the most clever endings and epilogues that I recall in recent years. The fact that this is the brainchild of a single developer/coder (with a little help) is all the more impressive. There are some mistakes in grammar and a few dialogues feel incomplete (portions missing) but in a strange way that only adds to the charm. Definitely a terrific example showing what the quiet, hard-working and creative indie crowd is capable of producing.			"

												A fantastic little journey!  The game was great and had some amazing little touches to it in the design of things.  The only thing I can say negative about it is that you cannot turn off the music (which gets old after some time because it is midi). The combat can be tricky and gathering your party to your design is fun and a challenge in itself.  <IMPORTANT!> There is an early part in the game where you must choose whether to use a soul to summon one of your past minions OR use it for something ""physical"".  You only get this chance 1 time... so think about it before choosing.  There are nice puzzles and some very well implemented design to the them.  Not too tough but not frustrating or required to complete them to advance.Party variety is very unique but you cannot use all minions on a single play through. Reason to play again on a harder difficulty with different characters then  :)I definitely would LOVE a sequel to this which I hope would be much deeper on all aspects (and the ability to toggle of music )Maybe the next title will be ""Paper Sorcerer: the Grimoire Temptress""  :)Regardless, if you like party based first person dungeon crawler games, this one is unique and well worth the inexpensive cost!

Over all this is a solid game with a solid price, and with different party configuerations  I could see getting a bit of replay value out of the title as welll.			"

												Retro dungeon crawler with a unique twist! Love the stylized paper look, the whole premise of being trapped in a book, and the spread of characters to choose from. So many different combinations of party! Not just your typical Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, Wizard dungeon-spelunking team.My first playthrough has the Sorcerer with a Vampire, Troll and Skeleton. It's an interesting challenge playing without a dedicated healer (Vampire can heal, but it's not his primary function), and I still haven't figured out the Troll's full potential (he's rogue-ish but still falls far behind damage-wise compared to my other characters. I have a feeling crits will be more critty as I go on.) The Skeleton, though, is a tank powerhouse, so I've been using his abilities to build / regain defense to stay alive. It's worked... So far.Dungeon crawlers are supposed to be hard, and this is definitely a challenging game, but less so than playing, say, Etrian Odyssey or Ancient Domains of Mystery. I actually feel like I have a chance of beating this game the first time through without getting bored from all the grinding halfway through. Of course, I've not even gotten past the second level yet, so my evaluation can change, but so far? Just difficult enough.The only negatives I'd like to point out are some UI glitches (nothing game breaking though) and the fact that when you save, the save window doesn't update with your new save info. So it's hard to know sometimes if I've saved or not! But none of it detracts from the fun I'm having, and will continue to have with Paper Sorcerer. Good job!			"

												This is an awesome piece of old-school RPG dungeon crawling game.You are trapped in a book and must find a way to get out only to be beset by enemies preventing you from getting out, while searching for secrets to help yourself gain the advantage and delve deeper into the stories behind the book itself.Combat is turn-based and its not just hack'n'slash, it uses energy for skills and each turn that energy will replenish slowly and this makes the combat even more interesting as stated in the description this involves strategy over grinding.The dungeon itself is real-time and can go anywhere after that dungeon level has been beaten, explore to heart's content and find secrets opening up stories laid behind by previous owner and find out more what really happened.I find myself engaged throughout the game fighting enemies and finding secrets for almost 15 hours, probably more if I spent more time in reaper's catacombs.Although in all story and fighting, the UI and mouse interface is a bit clunky and could be improved even further, keyboard is the way to go for moving around and only use the mouse for opening doors and pulling levers and interact items.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes fighting in a dungeon just to escape from being imprisoned forever. This game is a gem for those who likes to find things on your own as there aren't much clues to be found.Oh and don't try 1980's difficulty.			"

												A truly fantastic title, the gameplay possesses varying levels of complexity that accomodate both new and experienced players of the genre. For the majority of the game the environments are the same, however this seemed to be much more of a design choice rather than a lack of innovation. The story is cleverly told with some elements humour that is both witty and well placed.The most stark flaw of this title is a bug on one of the final floors that blocks entry into a secret that had a considerable amount of multi-floor puzzle solving build up, that is yet to be patched. The party system does have a considerable amount of customizability, allowing the player to choose their followers, ranging from cultists to axe wielding minotaurs. There is enough loot in this game to sate the desire of any kleptomaniac as well as a shop with an unending supply of gems to your hoards to. The skill trainer introduces a degree of customizability in terms of combat traits to your followers outside of weaponry and armour but aside from this the role that each member will fill is predetermined. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Paper Sorcerer, on normal it is a good 13-15 hour experience, perhaps more on higher difficulties, however the bug on the higher levels (while not progression blocking in the story, blocks access to loot) certainly tarnishes its appeal; despite this the gameplay is fantastic and the story is well crafted possessing interesting plot points. Would certainly recommend this game.			"

												Fun little combination of a JRPG and a western dungeon-crawler RPG.  Battles are turn-based menu-style, like Final Fantasy, but the rest of the gameplay is first-person realtime exploration with plenty of looting, puzzles and dungeon crawling, like Skyrim.  The graphics and music are a charming combination of retro and modern, with a realtime 3d environment rendered in only 2 colors to give a ""inside a book"" feel, and some really great chiptune music.  As a plus, the story is a refreshing break from the traditional ""heroes saving the world"" cliche, and instead puts you in the role of an evil sorceror trying to escape his enchanted prison.  Really fun little game, definitely recommended.			"

												A game you can easily get in depth with. However, some of the music doesnt fit the aspect of an RPG, the music in sanctuary sounding like a warioware game rather than an intense RPG. It is a great game however harnessing standard mechanics and a very interesting artstyle!			"

												From the pictures I had seen, I thought this game would basically be an oldschool style dungeon crawler, like Legends of Grimrock, but with this ""paper"" style artwork, which I might add, I was totally fine with.  But it has outdone my expectations.  To any who havent watched videos, it is not a locked screen like Legends of Grimrock.  You are able to look around.  Although the creatures are seen as a black smoke until you enter battle.  The battles take place on a different screen.  There is more I'd like to say but ill keep the spoilers out.  Bottom line is, if you arent sure about this game, I'd suggest checking it out... Its been more than worth my money.			"

												One of the most immediately addicting RPG's I've ever played.  And, though it's a very small detail, I've never liked the ""you can only see the enemies"" type of combat in games, and weirdly enough, the simple addition of a few frames of your allies attacking made all the difference.

												A very stylish dungeon crawling RPG. You are the bad guy, a sorcerer trapped in a creative prison by do-gooders. You assemble your party of miscreatents like a werewolf, skeleton, witch, etc. and attempt to break out of the prison, gathering loot and leveling up as you go. There are some puzzles along the way. The art style and music are very original and snazzy.			"

												An incredibly fun dungeon romp with a heart and soul of its own. The mechanics, while simple, never become tiresome. The combat, while straightforward, is never as easy as you might expect. It challenges you at every turn and has a touching story buried in its middle and end. One of the most clever endings and epilogues that I recall in recent years. The fact that this is the brainchild of a single developer/coder (with a little help) is all the more impressive. There are some mistakes in grammar and a few dialogues feel incomplete (portions missing) but in a strange way that only adds to the charm. Definitely a terrific example showing what the quiet, hard-working and creative indie crowd is capable of producing.			"

												Fun little throwback to classic RPGs, but mixed with some 1st person dungeon crawling. Lots of loot and gear to hoard, but little opportunity to grind. A good amount of customization with replayability. Not bad for $5 or less. It isn't without some glaring gaps/bugs though:1) Video and mouse options (invert) don't seem to save when you exit, so you need to select them every time.2) No sound/volume controls whatsoever (currently)3) Grinding for levels/currency is tedious as mobs do not respawn on the main tower levels, so you have to go to the catacombs where you have to wait for like a minute in between each fight...Even still, the game is quite fun to play and the art style is neat and unobtrusive. I like the idea of being the evil sorcerer who summons monsters to do his bidding, like an evil-er Pokemon with more than four abilities per monster.			"

												A fantastic little journey!  The game was great and had some amazing little touches to it in the design of things.  The only thing I can say negative about it is that you cannot turn off the music (which gets old after some time because it is midi). The combat can be tricky and gathering your party to your design is fun and a challenge in itself.  <IMPORTANT!> There is an early part in the game where you must choose whether to use a soul to summon one of your past minions OR use it for something ""physical"".  You only get this chance 1 time... so think about it before choosing.  There are nice puzzles and some very well implemented design to the them.  Not too tough but not frustrating or required to complete them to advance.Party variety is very unique but you cannot use all minions on a single play through. Reason to play again on a harder difficulty with different characters then  :)I definitely would LOVE a sequel to this which I hope would be much deeper on all aspects (and the ability to toggle of music )Maybe the next title will be ""Paper Sorcerer: the Grimoire Temptress""  :)Regardless, if you like party based first person dungeon crawler games, this one is unique and well worth the inexpensive cost!

												A truly fantastic title, the gameplay possesses varying levels of complexity that accomodate both new and experienced players of the genre. For the majority of the game the environments are the same, however this seemed to be much more of a design choice rather than a lack of innovation. The story is cleverly told with some elements humour that is both witty and well placed.The most stark flaw of this title is a bug on one of the final floors that blocks entry into a secret that had a considerable amount of multi-floor puzzle solving build up, that is yet to be patched. The party system does have a considerable amount of customizability, allowing the player to choose their followers, ranging from cultists to axe wielding minotaurs. There is enough loot in this game to sate the desire of any kleptomaniac as well as a shop with an unending supply of gems to your hoards to. The skill trainer introduces a degree of customizability in terms of combat traits to your followers outside of weaponry and armour but aside from this the role that each member will fill is predetermined. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Paper Sorcerer, on normal it is a good 13-15 hour experience, perhaps more on higher difficulties, however the bug on the higher levels (while not progression blocking in the story, blocks access to loot) certainly tarnishes its appeal; despite this the gameplay is fantastic and the story is well crafted possessing interesting plot points. Would certainly recommend this game.			"

												Why are you not playing this game yet? It has such a simple design in the 2D graphics with the simple concept you've got of dealing with your 4 energy to dish out attacks, heal, raise stats, and lower your opponents. It is turn-based in the simplier style of those old RPGs we all used to play.The 2D style goes so well since you're a sorcerer, male or female, whom wound up being trapped in a book. The paper black/white or rather black/aged paper is such a unique concept that just adds to the atmosphere.There are no sudden random battles, but you will find your foes as these floating and blinking ink blotches.And the humor hidden within is just cackle worthy.Beware the 1980 difficulty. They call it that for a reason. If you're old enough to know why, then you'll understand. If not, well, we will weep for you upon your death.			"

Also it has good narratives, and brilliant athmosphere. Just look at those walls and shadows.Very good choice for all RPG fans.Oh, one more thing... you need to SAVE often.

												It's a rather basic turn based rpg. The dungeons you walk through are 3d, the battles 2d. The visuals are abstract/interesting, but not necessarily good. There's plenty of weapons and items and characters. It's a decent to good game. Not available on Linux, unfortunately. I liked playing it for a bit, but will likely not return to it.			"

												I grew up playing oldschool rpgs like Might and Magic 1-2, Ultima, etc. Before we all fell in love with Final Fantasy and all JRPGS, those games were the gods of story telling and play.This game is somewhat of a mix of the old might and magic series and Dungeon Hack. Your party you 'summon' to defend you is pretty customizable, and you can really explore quite a few options. The difficulty seems pretty simple at 'normal', but if you want a challenge play on hard/1980's.Some of the fights are slow, the loot is randomized (one playthrough gave me piles of epic rogue gear for my goblin, next time (game does need an autosave... but alas the game is meant to feel like 1989) I got a ton of warrior gear for my skelly.You will find that the bosses are quite a bit harder than the other monsters on the same levels, but otherwise the game is pretty straight forward. Secrets aren't too hard to find, so you don't have to spend weeks or months trying to figure out that crap. No puzzles like the old Eye of the Beholders series really, as far as I've found thus far. Gameplay is a blast though, but some battles as stated already do take forever due to a mix of status effects or healers on the AI's side.So bring a good drink or two, some food, and settle in for a very strong game set in the glory days of western RPGs.

												Holy Crackers!Okay, this game maybe be slow going, but the fun and strategy really ramps up as it goes along. Pretty simple dungeon crawler with fantastic music, and customization. Took awhile for me to get into, but once I did it was easy to finish. Recommended for any RPG connoisseur, or someone looking for a nice easy to play mobile RPG on their tablet or phone.Gripes? Not all classes are created equal, meaning you better pick up one of the bruisers or damage output can become painful, and as we all know, DPS> all other strategies. Also that part where I had to click all over the screen trying to find the loose bricks was irritating. Also as usual physical>>magical in terms of damage, though actually damage over time spells kinda make up for it.			"

												Paper Sorcerer is at the end of the day a rather straightforward romp through several dungeon floors eventually to find an end. However the story while lihgtly touched out through out is a bit different than the usual reason of being thrown in a dungeon as well as how you form your party to fight your way out.As someone who favors turn based combat for rpg titles this was certainly up my alley. However at times the controls for moving around the menues can make sorting out items and shuffling to stronger things troublesome at times. Yet this doesn't take away the enjoyment of lurking around every inch of floor just to find one last bit of treasure if not a whole secret room.Saving is your friend however try to keep some notes around as it doesn't really help you out understanding what you last did if you decide to take a long break from the game.

												Decent little party-based, turn-base, first-person (dungeon?) RPG with a pleasant ending. One of the most satisfying endings I've seen in quite a while, in fact! Took about a week to beat(easy difficulty), so there was a good bit of substance, although very repetitive..I liked the game decently enough that I might give it another swing at a higher difficulty later on, if/when I have more free time. It's a well-balanced(the highlight of the game, IMO) title, and not overly complex, but it needs a LOT of work to catch up to the likes of Dragon Warrior and/or Legend of Grimrock. :)PROS:- A simple, fun, balanced little RPG to jump into if you're short on time.- Unique graphic/art style.- Not overly complex!CONS:- It's a bit buggy... Save often. You may run into some seriously buggy bugs. Fairly poor build quaility.- The level/world design is simplistic, and very repetitive.- I was not very impressed by the music, but sound FX were decent.- Unless you memorize all the spell effect icons, it's difficult to keep up with all the spells in effect during battles. I wish there was an information box available to tell... - No solo mode :(FINAL SCORE: 6-6.5/10			"

												I bought this game on after reading a review of it online (can't for the life of me remember where) and thinking that it sounded like a lot of fun.  The game itself is only $5.49CDN and it almost feels like I'm underpaying for it, and while the game does suffer from a bit of grinding I personally feel that the aesthetics, music and concept of the game make up for having to do a bit of extra grinding now and again.Graphically the game isn't a powerhouse but the creator supposedly based a lot of the visuals off of sketches he'd done with a ballpoint pen, and translating that into the game gives it a very stark atmosphere that lends itself well to the rest of the game.The music in the game is repetitive and a little off-putting, but again it works with the rest of the game to add to the overall feeling of dread that the game delivers in it's execution.  Also the sound effects are minimal, but not overpowering or obnoxious.The gameplay is reminiscient of dungeon crawlers from the 90's, or more recently a bit faster paced version of Legend of Grimrock and contains a fair number of secrets to find on each dungeon floor.You can also collect parts to make an evil puppet to go along with your party of Ghosts, Vampires, Werewolves, Frankenstein Monsters, Goblins, Witches, and Evil Sorcerors.All in all if you're a fan of older RPGs then I would easily recommend this at the current price.
