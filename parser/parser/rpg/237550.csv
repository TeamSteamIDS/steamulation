												So, right to the point.Yes, I do recommend Realms of Arkania, but with a number of caveats.Realms of Arkania is definitely ""budget,"" definitely indie, and most definitely rough around the edges in places. RoA still has a couple of UI glitches, and isn't always pretty to look at. The English voice acting is atrocious.However, the game-stopping bugs present at launch have been fixed. The visuals are adequate; not great, but not terrible. The voice acting, luckily, can be disabled.As for gameplay, RoA is almost more of a management sim than a typical RPG. I actually appreciate that. The preparation you have to put into traveling during the winter months is possibly more important than how well-equipped your party is for combat. You just don't see certain kinds of brutal gameplay concepts (exposure, thirst & starvation, exhaustion, sickness & disease) in these kinds of games anymore. Unless you play smart, your adventure can easily end during the first winter, with your frostbitten party starving to death on a mountain trail.How many fantasy RPGs have you played lately in which a winter coat is more important to your survival than a +3 sword? Now, I didn't buy RoA at release. In fact, I didn't begin playing it until after the final major patch was out. So I didn't experience how badly broken it was at release. My only experience of RoA is with the game in its current state.So, how is it currently? As far as I can tell, RoA is feature-complete compared to the original Realms of Arkania game from the '90s. Every quest present and working in the original is present and working in this remake. In fact, the devs have added new bits of content to the game (quests, encounters, etc), so the game now has MORE content than the original.Again, RoA isn't the prettiest game to look at. But the gameplay itself is just what I was looking for when I bought it - unforgiving, difficult, oldschool, and based in the Dark Eye universe.At over 100 hours ingame, and having finished the main questline and nearly all side quests, I can honestly say that I got my money's worth out of Realms of Arkania. Your mileage may vary, however, depending on how tolerant you are of outdated graphics, general lack of polish, and brutally unforgiving gameplay straight out of 1992.			"

												I'm not gonna talk too much about Realms of Arkania as a game. People who don't know the original ROA should read about it somewhere. I'm just gonna say this: its a WRPG where you have to THINK. Its a REAL RPG, where your skills are as much important inside battles AND outside.I'm here to talk about this reboot only, assuming everyone here knows ROA.First of all, this game was released in a very incomplete state when it came to STEAM. Almost unplayable, actually. The guys patched it intensivelly after that, but at that point, the game got some of the worst reviews ever (as bad as Big Rigs!!). The thing is: after all the patching, the game became QUITE playable... and very fun to play. But people didn't gave it a chance.Just like the original ROA, your party has TONS of skills that are used in battles and on the field. This is what I always liked about ROA, and its all here. Just like in the original ROA, you have to take real good care of your chars. They will get sick if you are in a cold place without clothes for winter, for example. And just like in the original ROA, this is the most fun part of this game: surviving while exploring the world.The battles in here are the weakest part though. Then again, they were not much different in the original ROA... Keep in mind that this game is NOT forgiving in the beginning. You will die. A LOT. You will miss most attacks, you will be frustrated. It was like this in ROA, and its exactly the same in ROA HD. After a while, you'll get better, and will be able to DESTROY your enemies. This version has some bad looking character models though. It seems they are just placeholders, but never replaced with real models. Your characters look awful, your enemies look awful too... The backgrounds are ok. The originals had horrible looking battle backgrounds, and they are also bad here. But are at least more detailed, and since they are in 3D, you can rotate the camera at will.Outside battles the game look quite good; impressive for a low budget game, actually. Even though this is an indie game, the backgrounds are VERY detailed, and beautiful to look at. Specially the dungeons: they are very good looking, and varied. And since the game is in 3D, you won't move in a grid based system, like in ROA 1 and 2. You can move freely, rotate the camera at will, look up and down. Kinda like ROA3, but with a WAY more beautiful world.At the end of the day, this is still a VERY rough release. It has some bugs and some bad looking models. But its FUN. One of the most fun RPGs I've ever played. You need patience though. This isn't a game for newbie's. If you didn't like the original ROA, you will NOT like this one. ROA HD is just ROA, but with 3D graphics.Even if this game has issues, I recommend it for fans of the original ROA. Give this game a chance. Exploring the game world is fun now. You won't see that basic tile-based cities that all look the same anymore. You'll see a world in 3D, with detailed residences, rivers and real people walking around (the 3 ROA games didn't even had NPCs visible in the game world!!). You will learn to care for that characters, because if you don't they WILL die on you. And you will be able to do optional quests to get money and experience, or can just run around the world aimlesly for as much as you want (if you can survive, that is).This is a great game. With more polish, it would be perfect. It's fun the way it is though, and this is what's most important in a game.			"

												NOTE: For 1.34(More Then A Remake) a short addition appended below this review. 1.33 review(To Cross the Borders) appended below this review. (Delaying the Ork Invasion is 1.32 review)*****Delaying the Ork Invasion*****Why I chose this title? Because at the release of this game, we all were leaning towards the thoughts that the game was doomed and orks would conquer the Northlands without our intervention. The game was a mess of bugs and a graphical parody to a degree where NPCs and surroundings would make you feel like in a zombie apocalypse version of Northlands. And furthermore the game used to lack many spells, mechanics and had several other gamebreakers which is probably the reason turned off many people. But...there is always a ""but""...and this time it is a good ""but"".The game evolved...while I am telling you its evolved it is in the level of a pokemon evolution where you would barely recognize what it was before. Crafty Studios perhaps hired a faery who touched the game with her magical wand exorcising a nasty demon who made the game look bad and broken. Or briefly, they worked their asses off during these months releasing several patches to reach this state. But before going into detail...some screenshots from my game:http://postimg.org/gallery/1zsvh03w/c4dcb1c8/If you have the game, you will notice the major differences...if you don't have the game well you should get it while it is still on Christmas Sales, because the great leap forward which has started with 1.32 patch which is named as ""Revised"" will not stop till ""Gold"" version of the game. I presume you already looked at the screenshots. Here I will not go over change by change but mention the crucial changes which made me rather happy.The Journey Map is in English and place names are in accordance with the original Blade of Destiny. Of course still there are no descriptions for Hjaldor Mountains and such, that is just a matter of adding a few place holders.NPCs look good and NPCs with striped pants you can feel like you are really traversing Thorwalian towns. Also market days, opening/closing times of the shops as well as if you get caught cheating at a tavern you get punished by no entrance features integrated to the game over this time. The new UI which provides more information to the people in a coherent way, as well as they are more versatile then the old UI which was closing a part of the main screen. Now you have a broader area of view where you can enjoy the good sights of the game. Except Demon Summoning spells(which are not added) and a few more, most of the spells are fully functioning and ready to assist you in a dungeon as utility or perhaps to decimate your foes as fast as possible. After all, we could wait a little while longer to see a few stray/unimplemented spells. I'm not even mentioning several optical improvements done to the environment letting screenshots talk for themselves. Though, one thing worth mentioning is the improved interiors of the buildings...especially my favourite is the inn which gave me a dark feeling and I could say I was definitely in backwater, gloomy Northlands of Aventuria.There are also a good deal of fine tunings, bugfixes and balancings...but I'll cut to the chase. This game evolved truly and deserves a second chance. You will not regret it, especially when you buy it now at a bargain price.Edit: Price advice was during Christmas Sale, but rest of the review is still valid since it features 1.32 patch. I will update the review, after every noticeable change.*****To Cross the Borders*****The anticipated 1.33 patch hit the Steam and I should say while there are still shortcomings here and there, it has been a solid improvement.Though sadly we still have to be exposed to unpolished Battle Avatars and Sounds. This can be a major deterrent to some players. But for me it is a moment of ""Eh..."" since I have been more interested in content of the battles rather then nice looks. But I must point out, now spells are associated with different animations, that can be a good indication for the future polishing(One can keep hoping).Now, one major striking point is that every temple has a different interior as well as the temple distribution on Hjaldings is accurate to the world description. So you'll find a good deal of Swafnir and Travia temples while there are no Praios or Boron temples.About battle, there are now Battle Stances! Yes, they have finally found their way into the game. Aggressive, Balanced and Defensive. Depending on your tactical situation, now you can make use of those stances. For example, if you flanked somebody, this especially alleviates the issue where hitting is a problem. Going aggressive will increase your hit chance while reducing your parry chance, providing you more success. On the other hand, a hard pressed character can switch to defensive to hold off the enemy. Another plus is that now Necrophobia is important in battles. It'll make your characters skip a turn if undead is in the vicinity. (Necrophobia roll) Also weapon/monster re-balancing seems like it will make things quite different then before. One example is some animals are hitting twice. Also two spells Nekropathia and Abvenenum added to the game. The more, the merrier.Heavy bugfixing as usual made the game stabler and Main Game+DLCs present a good deal of content. ""For the Gods"" add a number of challenging unique battles across 2 detailed dungeons and one town while ""Ogredeath"" adds several side quests spread through the world and one extra dungeon at Groenvelden. Now, I should stress it again. If Battle Characters, Animations and Sounds can get an overhaul via a major patch, this game has the potential to be a true success. The game has already crossed the border of remake and now it should move forward with full force.*****More Then A Remake*****I wasn't expecting to update my review but surprisingly 1.34 patch hit Steam containing several additional encounters, bugfixes and fine-tunings to mechanics. Additionally some of the good mods (such as herb pouch) created by the dedicated community members of the game made formal appearance with this patch. The game still has the mediocre character models, but aside that in my eyes it has become more then a remake already.			"

												Back in the good old 90’s I wasn’t that much into RPGs but I really liked “Startrail” and “Shadows over Riva”. Yes, I’m leaving out Blade of Destiny. Though I played it for quite some time, I never could get really into it. It wasn’t the complex gameplay that turned me off, it was navigating the cities which frustrated me the most. Nearly every building looked the same, be it taverns or homes of important NPCs. I spent a lot of my time running into every building just to see if there was some hint left to be discovered,…which in 99% of every visit wasn’t the case.  So after quite some time I lost interest but tried to get back into the game several times.Before you judge me, I was 10 years old back then, so maybe my attention span was shorter than today. If you ask me, “Startrail” did everything better. When I learned about the remake of “Blade of Destiny” I was quite enthusiastic. When it was finally released, the reviews were so devastating, it was hard to believe. I read many reviews, watched many videos, and I was shocked. Everything looked so unfinished. Then I learned about the many patches and finally bought the game after the release of the “revised” patch. I started it up and it looked…okay. Yes, that’s not high praise. I checked the forums and realized that the developers were still very involved in fixing the game with the help of the very active community. I decided to wait a little longer, and with the arrival of version 1.35 I finally decided to play the game. That was three days ago. Three days of which I spent 27 hours playing “Blade of Destiny HD” and simply put: I had a blast! Of course there are many things one could criticize: The story is kind of generic (and obviously always was), the graphics are not great, the combat is clunky and the cities seem a little lifeless. Were this a completely “new” game these things would mean a lot more to me, but as a remake I think this is finally a great product. It made me feel like I felt back then, but without the constant complaining about the city navigation. And I still love the original soundtrack from the 90s version, which is included in the remake. So, should YOU play “Blade of Destiny HD”? If you liked the original, there’s not much left that should stop you from playing this game. If you want your RPGs to be a little more accessible and modern, you should probably stay clear. But if you were remotely into complex RPGs back in the 90s or enjoy pen & paper RPGs, give it a shot. You won't regret it! "

												I've never before seen a developer work so hard into making a poor product shine. That alone makes this title worthy of picking up.I have been playing pen and paper RPGs for over 30 years and computer RPGs since the late 80s, so I suppose I am more forgiving on graphics quality than some.  What I fiend for in games are interesting combat systems and diverse skills. So far, this title doesn't disappoint. I feel that watching my fledgling characters grow as the adventure progresses will be quite gratifying in this title. I can't wait to get into some serious questing.One thing I still can't stand in this  game is the English language voice acting.  They need some serious help in the voiceover depatment. Monotonous doesn't even begin to describe the voice work, though it may be an ESL issue.Regardless, this is a small quibble about a product that has been considerably improved over the last few weeks. I am excited to see what other new features and improvements are introduced in the weeks and months to come.-T			"

												Unfortunately I could only recommend the game to the most diehard fans of the originals. The game has several cool features, but it ends up losing a lot of fun factor to poor UI and some highly tedious elements.+Graphics and environments are well done, dungeons are interesting and adventure/GM text is fun+Good variety of classes, skills, and spells+Ability to customize your own party of up to 6 characters+Management of party health on several levels including HP, starvation, thirst, warmth for the winter, etc.+Tactical battles, ability to automate/accelerate battles-World outside feels dead; can't talk to people, look inside boxes/barrels, or interact with much of anything, no visible enemies. You will sadly miss almost nothing just by walking around in map mode and ignoring the 3D environments.-Travel between towns can be very painstaking; sometimes going through 20 or more camp/resting screens with little or no activity. Worse, most towns have little/nothing to offer and you cannot fast travel or even queue travel past 1 town.-Poor descriptions on items and equipment; likely to have unlisted class restrictions-Failure chances for attacks and spells are so high most battles, especially early, every action taken feels like punishment-Most game time will be spent walking or sleeping. It is as exciting as it sounds. "

												After having finished the game I can now say that I really enjoyed it but I would not recommend it to anyone who is not a fan of the original. There are too many problems with the game and things such as difficult controls and poor user interface will frustrate anyone who doesn't have the nostalgia of the original to force them to overlook the problems.The user interface and controls are shockingly bad. The developers really need to fix it but I can't see that happening. Other games in this genre such as the elder scrolls have very easy controls. The game also has bugs such as the wrong text on dialogs and random bugs that get you stuck in a situation where nothing is happening. The most frustrating for me was that you can't cancel the level up process and start again.The game is very true to the original however and I think they succeeded improving on the original in quite a few ways. The combat simulator is much better than before. The graphics are of course much better as well as the artwork. Some small annoyances have been taken care of.			"

												1/8/14 -Please note: The review below was based on impressions on release and subsequent patches in the two months that followed and is not based on the current version of the game. I intend to add updated impressions when am I able to find the time to give this game another go. I am leaving the initial impressions up because I believe it's important to note that the game was intentionally released and sold as a finished product, and not marked as Early Access, when it was in actuality in horribly unfinished and unplayable condition. I believe this speaks to the character of both the developer and the publisher and is worth noting.-----Run. Run far away. Now.I hesitate to even write this because it's categorized as a recommendation and this is the farthest thing from that. (*edit: Valve changed this as of 11/25/13 recommendations are now ""reviews"" and you can thumbs up or down)In all my years of gaming and all the games I've played I can say that this is the absolute worst launch of a game I've ever experienced. An abysmal festering trainwreck that grants more entertainment value from reading angry posts in the forum than it does from the actual game.It looks like crap, plays like ♥♥♥ and has more bugs than a Louisiana swamp. To call it a beta would be dishonest, that it's being sold as a finished product is really fraud. I'd say pre-alpha is the most accurate way to describe the state of this game.If all of that doesn't scare you off then please at very least go browse the community forums first before you go to buy this game and see what the general consensus is about the state of the game by owners. I won't even say players because hardly anyone can even play it for any significant length of time. They are issuing patches literally on a daily basis currently but it still has a long way to go and I don't have the most faith in these developers to ultimately end up with a good product at some point down the road.This game is a textbook example of why none of us should be pre-ordering or buying released games without first checking to see what the general community consensus is. It's extremely obvious that no one at Valve even booted up the game to play for 10 seconds and the developers admit it was released unfinished. Yet here it still sits in the store being sold as a finished product.The old Roman concept of Caveat Emptor holds very true here.			"

												This game is very hard to get into. Yet - now that i did - i can only recommend it. It has depth and offers a interesting and enigmatic world. The story is deep - as you would wish for in a good Role Playing Game.I can only recommend to give this game a try - and maybe watch some Youtube videos or read a guide before playing. I was very frustrated after a few tries of playing without any help (maybe because this game is originally from 1992)  and now that i consulted help, i got  into the game really well and am very happy that this game did not become one more never-really-played game-corpse in my steam library.

												It has has now been almost a year after release, and I uninstalled it for the second time... Got the game again for 10 bucks on steam, which is a WAY more fair price than the ridiculous 30 Euros for that release disaster I returned in anger...However, I have to strongly disagree with the decent-to-good ratings that have started to come in. I agree, version 1.32 was a quantum leap when compared to the fraudulent, apocalyptic trainwreck they released. But that just means it has improved to be a below-average game as compared to horrible, unfinished and dysfunctional theft. As of version 1.33 there are few to no game breaking bugs left, but all the glitches still annoy.The game today is *still* a clunky, uninspired and cheap remake, full of little bugs and glitches, with an incredibly clunky interface and very low on fun. There are still not all functions of the 20 year-old original implemented or working as supposed to, in combat enemies still occassionaly bug out, balance and AI is terrible, you can't close some interface screens and I have to click 3 times after saving a game to close *every* open interface window.Graphics are improved but still very mediocre, NPCs now look ""halfway OK"" instead of ""ridiculously awful"" (combat avatars of your party are still 100% godawful bug-ugly, though) and performance has improved from terrible to unimpressive...Extrapolating from 1.00, the game might start to be fun and enjoyable around version 1.50. But as all updates sem to have stopped, I've given up the wait. Avoid.			"

												Although I cannot recommend this game in its current state, the devs have stated that they will release a ""Gold"" edition, that is what this game should have been. If you are a fan of oldschool RPGs with lots of flavor text, skills, quests, items, spells, and plot buy that when it comes out. As it is though, it was released a few months ago as completed when it actually appeared to be an early access alpha, couldnt even be called beta. I bought it on release, and it was so buggy I literally couldnt get past the character creation screen, or even into it for that matter. Had the devs released it as early access they would have had a horde of loyal followers. But what they released as a complete game looked worse than some small game-builds Ive seen people make for quarter-long class projects. This, obviously, torked off a lot of people, myself included. The translation leaves a bit to be desired as well. For instance when you light a torch/lantern, the game asks you ""What do you want to inflame?"" For those of you that are not native English speakers, inflame has two meanings, neither of which has to do with lighting an actual fire. The most common use means ""To cause strong emotions in, esp anger or lust."" The other means ""an infected or red and swollen wound/part of the body injured due to sickness or damage."". Needless to say the sentence cracks me up every time I try to set something on fire. As in ""What would you like to make really lustful?"" or ""What wounds would you like to infect?""So why am I recommending it? In short, when it works right, its *awesome*. That and the head dev is very active on the forums, has apologized for the game repeatedly, and has made great strides in making it functional. You can play it now. There are still bugs, but they are relatively minor although annoying. It has ok graphics, that are slowly getting better, and a decent automap. I tried to play the original from the 90s while waiting for this one to be playable. It didnt have an automap. I dont have the time to map anymore, like I did as a teenager, so thats a great improvement. The music is perfect for the setting, and really puts you in the appropriate mood. Town music is cheerful, and puts you in the mind of wandering through a small green village with exposed-woood and thatch roofs. Dungeon music is nicely dark and spooky, with weird ambient effects. Only really bad thing about non-combat sound is the ♥♥♥♥ing *awful* narrarator. He narrates *everything*. And its *terrible*. Fortunately, it can be turned off. The sound effects in battle are typical grunts, ""Oof""s, ""EEeee""s, slashes, spell zaps and so on. Nothing special. The combat is action-point turn based (Fallout 1/2 style), but there is decent room for strategy with the large selection of spells, movement, combat options and so forth.As far as content, theres a lot. You can camp, hunt, look for herbs, set watches and get attacked. In town you can talk to shopkeepers, drink, gamble, pick pocets (Although you can do nothing with the wandering NPCs - I think they are just there for flavor)Random events and side quests abound, and really make the setting come alive. I cant wait for it to be finished and fullly functional, with all content added (There are still some missing side quests).So I future-recommend it for any oldschool RPG fan, with the caveat ""Even though its not listed as Early Access, it is. Don't get it now, wait for the completed gold edition. If you don't, there will be bugs. *Most*are not game breaking *knocks on wood*, but they are there.I also have to recommend it just because of how open and honest the devs have been, unlike so many who drop broken as hell games on Steam and then disappear while laughing all the way to the bank.

												Not a bad game in its current state.  It fills a nitch of the badly needed ""turn based tactical RPG, with lots of options and customizable characters"", games.  A couple of pluses are the wide range of weapons that are availible, as well as character classes.  The game uses the dark eye ruleset as far as i can tell, so i can compare the fights to a sort of turn based drakensang.  Be prepared for wolves parrying greatswords, etc.  Normally i possition my characters then go auto combat.  It is also a remake of a classic, so its attempt to stay faithful might put off some.  Surviving in the world means paying attention to things like cold and moisture resistance on clothing and what the weather is like when traveling.  Heavy armor and shields means less movment points, etc.			"

												I'm a fair way in to this game and totally loving it.  I love the old School feel, I love the story, I love that its got so much lore to it. The opening city is truly huge, with shops and tavens.  Ive made a name for myself playing the flute!  I like the voice discriptions, it feels like a real Pen and Paper experience, reminds me of the Dungeons and Dragons Online in that it is narrated.  Ive been looking for a game like that for a long time!  At times it reminds me of Eye of the beholder (in the dungeon crawling) and other times like heroes of might and magic (in the combat).  I tried the orginal from GOG, and enjoyed it but have found this, with its updated graphics and narrated discriptions better.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes deep roleplaying.  Give it a few hours and let it grow on you.  I'm really glad i took a punt!Probably ought to note there is no tutorial, and its pretty hard core and plays best on my rig in windowed mode.			"

												IntroductionHardcore fantasy turn based strategy game. This is a modern version of the original and if any of you have played that than you know how brutal this can be. Disease, hunger, dehydration all can kill you as well as enemies.Graphics split into two sections      World  Beautiful for the most part and then just average in some areas (npc's especially females)Combat       Its full motion turn based combat and a different engine was used (appearently) and it is ugly. They dropped the ball imo here as this is what many players complain about. The mechanics work well, but the rendered models are less than stellar. If only they had really had more time on this it could have been awesome but I guess animation full motion is probably extremely complicated. Also weapons are not diplayed correctly, for example a character with a sling is shown using a crossbow. Beleive me they took a hit on yhat one with modern gamers.Music      Top of the line...seriuosly up there with Jeremy Soule and Two Steps from Hell    Combat and other sounds       Good to just o.k.Interaction with world       Like in the original 99% of the NPC's serve no purpose. So whem you enter a city you'll see people in the streets etc. that you cannot talk to. Merchants and tavern keepers  say the same old things over and over. You'll find your selves quickly pushing dialouge(sp) buttons as quickly as you can.Progression of characters      Slow and grindy. However this game is about living in a fantasy world and at level 1 all your characters are really weak (as it should be) and will fail much more often than they succeed. EVENTUALLY your heroes will start to improve but you are going to spen ALOT of time in combat. Did I mention progression is slow?Other stuff:      Although you have healing magic, it is not gonna be enough to restore everyone to pristine condition so you are going to have to find Inns to rest in. Now you can campout overnight and heal BUT wounds can get infected. As I said this a simulation fantasy experience and it ain't gonna hold your hand. There are various diseases that can set in but they are all treatable with herbs you can search for (good ones very rare as expected) or buy. Herbs and potions are VERY VERY VERY expensive. Magic items are extremely rare but you can buy some enchanted weapons in some rare places but after seeing the prices you will probably decide ""Nah I will loot some magic off foes"". This is simply a pipe dream it is so rare.There are smiths  Because your weapons get worn and can break (you better have a backup weapon for combat)The stores, smiths, herb shops, healers, Inns etc. all have varied equipment and different prices. There is definetly some economy management to your party. You will find yourselves going from shop to shop looking for the best prices because as I may have mentioned, things are very expensive. If you are lazy and just buy from the first store that has the item you are looking for, then you may later learn you spent twice the amount of extremely important gold that could have been used elsewhere.there is also a weak haggling system. You can try for up to a 50% dicount but be warned if you anger the shop keepers they may kick you out and refuse to deal with you until you leave town for awhile.World size and quest  The world is vast but quest are limited. You will spend all your time on the main quest as it sends you all over the place. There are side missions too and I would reccomend doing them, but it wont be long and you will be on the main quest again. No spoilers here so that is all I will say regarding quest.Is it linear?  Nope, you can go wherever you want, and do side quest in any order for the most part.Bug?  Yep. got some. Most are minor like the wrong label on items are events that don't really seem to do anyrthing. I personaly have not come upon any game-breakers though.So who will like this game?    Older D&D players who appreciate using your imgination and really want the ""feel"" of a true wolrd. Grognards who keep diligent notes and love a challenge. Hardcore gamers.Who will not like this game?     Console gamers that push ""a"" and everything dies type gamers. Gamers that like being spoon fed. Tales of MaJael (which I also own and love) and rouge-like gamers. Probably. Its kinda the opposite of those type games. Rush players who want to quickly become powerful and complete the game.Overall   I simply love this game. It can be tedious at times but I find myself losing hours in this world. Don't let played hours fool you as I play offline alot because my bandwidth is also split between my two sons watching movies and playing online console/computer games.If you are a hardcore simulation type that can get past a few hiccups and use your imagination I whole-heartedly reccomend this experience. Fast players give this a pass/Final note...The devs had some legal issues and had to stop development and updates for awhile but are now back currently working on a patch anb free DLC (Ithink) and most importantly making the game open to modders.

												1. Bad user interface.2. Poor presentation (graphics, aesthetics).3. Very bare-bones user manual.4. There are still some bugs.----1. The user interface has a number of issues:a) Some items are crammed into the corners where they are hard to reach.b) Most menus have a tiny little X to close them in the upper right corner. A big simple OK or Cancel button would have been better.c) Not all buttons have tooltips explaining what they do.d) Tooltips do not tell you what the keyboard shortcut for an action is.e) In combat, you cannot move the camera from side-to-side using the mouse. You have to use the keyboard.f) In combat, the current active character is not highlighted in the bottom character panel. So you have to pay close attention to whose turn it is.g) When leveling up, you cannot go back or undo skill advancement choices.2. Graphics and presentation is way off-base too.a) The character models are very ugly.b) The building/town models are very ugly.c) There are few spell or action animations in the FPS view portions of the game. Casting a spell to cast a light is instantaneous. Knocking over statues in a certain level is instantaneous.d) The sound effects are really bad.e) Not all weapons have appropriate animations. You swing a rapier for instance. The quarterstaff uses the same 3D model as the rapier.f) Everything is brown and boring.g) In general this remake has less charm than the original game for MS-DOS.3. The ingame documentation says the PDF manual is supposed to be the place to go for detailed information, but the PDF manual is shorter adn more bare-boned than the ingame docs.4. I have run into a few issues, but nothing super serious so far.			"

												This game isnt what it seems to be. Its not a professional, modern remake of an old school classic. Its an amatuer, buggy, sleepfest game that looks like it should have come out in 2002. The interface is clunky an annoying, combat is boring, and towns are all identical messes. I had a hard time staying awake for the little I actually played. The narrator sounds like some random person they hired that has no voice acting experience at all. And thats when the game isnt ""getting stuck"" on you. It doesnt crash, it just reaches points in the game where you cant do anything. This game is just soooo bad.  I will be trying to get a refund even though it got it for only 5 bucks. There are professional AAA games, there are indie games, there are cheap games, and then there are strange high school programming projects like this that shouldnt ever make it to market.			"

												NOTE: This review is very old! (July 2013) I will revisit the game when I find the time, I will then update this review.Please do not buy this game! It is clearly unfinished. I had 2 complete gamecrashs in only 15 Minutes of gameplay. Even on my system the framerate drops below 30 fps when outside. Another great reboot-idea horribly executed. I will give them another chance and check back in a few weeks. Until then they have time to fix things. Clearly not a finished game, feels rather like a steam early access game and should be marked as such.			"

												If you've ever wanted to play a game that makes you feel like you're sitting across the table from a bona fide dungeon master complete with ""read-from-the-module"" narration and gritty roleplaying challenges that defenestrate mercy in exactly that way pro dms do, then this is the game for you. There's plenty to explore and learn about the Dark Eye's roleplaying system which they appear to have transplanted into the game as directly as they could manage down to very specific details. Here is a lovingly crafted work obviously created a very diehard Dark Eye following. Pick your team of champions and explore town to stock up on essentials before heading out for some serious dungeon-crawling. Are you sick of the ease with which you typically overcome early adversaries in other games? Well buckle-up, because getting through your very first battles on the higher difficulty settings will take a bit of swag, even for the most seasoned oldschool rpg vet. Deal with feeding, watering and keeping your party warm and healthy in ways that bring a whole new level of realism to roleplaying, presenting you with challenges even long before you arrive at your destination. Deal with the fickle nature of magic in a world where it is obviously more difficult to master. This is a game with a serious learning curve, but with equal share the promise of rpgasmic goodness at every turn.			"

												I am LOVING this game, so far.  For the first time, in a long time, I actually look forward to getting off work and rushing home to play a computer game.  This game makes you think.  There is no hand-holding.  If you and your party attempt to travel in the wilderness during witner months without the proper equipment, you'll pay a heavy price.  Make sure to keep an eye on your water and rations, 'cause you're going to need them.  Going into a dungeon?  Make sure you have torches or some other light source.  I've only barely scratched the surface of this game, but I can tell I'll be playing it for a long time.   I'll update this review as I play more, but for now just know that it's a true gem of old-school RPG goodness.			"

												Well. I tried to like this game. I really did. Having played the original back in the 90s on a C-64 I expected to have something comparable to that. Perhaps it's being seen through rose colored glasses, perhaps not.What we ended up with here is a shadow of the game's former self. The cities are generic, the buildings all look the same, the NPCs (if you could call the that) have no life to them. Inns, taverns, shops, smithies, you can't tell one from the other at all except for the names.The voice acting should have been left out entirely. It's awful. It's obvious as hell that whoever was doing it isn't a native English speaker and was dry reading from a script. Yes, it's almost 2014, but not every game is well suited to lots of voice acted stuff. This one certainly isn't.The combat system is a major deal breaker though. I know I can't possibly be doing things SO WRONG that I screwed up two different attempts to roll up and equip a party. Every fight I've been in (which has always been the party's first) ends in defeat with us missing, fumbling, being parried, or whatever. Rarely hit a damn thing even with high stats and all the equipment our meager funding could manage. Turning things over to the auto-AI is an extremely disappointing and very LONG wait for the same result - our deaths.I hate to say it, but this is starting to become a trend with these Indie RPGs and it's now going to make me think long and hard about parting with the money I'm spending on this stuff. I took a chance on this one and got burned - it won't happen again.(Note to Valve: This is why refunds exist in the real world! Learn something here! I'd surely love to get one at this point!)			"

												On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate this game a 5/10, and only that high because of the mods and DLCs that make the 2015 implementation of the game somewhat tolerable.  I shudder to think of what playing the original re-release of BoD must have been like.Pros:-Planning your party's make-up and levelling up strategy matters (somewhat)-A somewhat nostalgic old-school RPG flavor with emphasis on being true to the underlying game world, and story-telling/quests-Apparently there is a second installment in the RoA series being worked on, so hopefully the party you build and grow in BoD can carry over to the Star Trail re-make (assuming the developers improve on playability in the next installment)Cons:-Combat is glacially slow, riddled with incessant misses, and overall just a chore.  If my characters weren't missing all the time, they would be dropping their weapons, or the weapons would break.  (Hi I'm a warrior, trained in all kinds of combat techniques and... Whoopsie I just dropped my sword on the ground and now I'm dead....) Luckily I ran across a forum post recommending to switch to computer-controlled combat.  I did that, running at a 100x time multiplier and basically just brute-forced combat encounters until I won.  (You can configure the time speed-up to use in the settings for the game.)-A still largely opaque and broken skill system.  As an example, I'm running around with 15 in Treat Disease, and yet >50% of my Treat Disease attempts fail.  For the life of me I still don't understand why my characters miss combat hits, mis-cast spells, etc... The game sorely needs a way in-game to explain what success/failure percentages are, and how changes in base skills and talents will effect those percentages.-Related to disease, it seems that staring at the sky (metaphorically speaking) in this game leads to your character contracting a disease.  While I did choose to play the game with the realism setting turned on, the way disease works in this game is beyond ridiculous.  I swear in at least one case a party member went from ""ouch I didn't sleep well because of a pebble"" to ""I'm dead"" in a matter of days because of the inane disease mechanic in the game.-As noted earlier, weapons break in combat.  As in ...all... ...the... ...time...  I never did figure out how to prevent this from happening.  You can buy whetstones in shops, and repair weapons after each combat occurrence which helps to some extent.  But unless you are lucky enough to find a magical weapon, resign yourself to weapons constantly breaking in combat and your party being reduced to making like Chuck Norris (unarmed combat: go punch mummies in the face!)-Travel becomes laborious after a while.  At first I enjoyed travelling around parts of the map, wondering what I would run into.  But once I got farther into the game, and the much larger distances that needed to be traversed, travel was an exercise in boredom and frustration.  Travel is also a great opportunity to contract disease - despite running around with cloaks, sleeping bags, campfires, etc...  I swear there is a bug somewhere in this game that is just hell-bent on making characters contract disease.-Inventory management is, well,  unmanageable, because of the strict encumbrance system.  Luckily I could use a number of mods (listed below) to make inventory management tolerable.*Review based on playing Blade of Destiny v1.36 with all three DLCs installed.  It is important to play with at least the latest free DLC (With Blade and Brilliance) since it includes numerous bugfixes.  *Additionally I installed a number of mods to make levelling and inventory substantially less onerous:  Packesel (pack horse), Mit Sack und Pack (storage chests for potions, books, jewellry and poisons), and erfolgreicheSteigerung (replaces random level up rolls with fixed increases and 100% skill up success).  Very important:  don't put any of the storage add-ins inside of another storage add-in.  For example if you drag and drop your pack-horse, onto the pack-horse by mistake - all of the inventory stored by the pack-horse disappears!*Mods can be downloaded from a mod database[forum.schicksalsklinge.com].  Hint:  use Chrome for its handy translate feature if you don't speak German!*Highly recommended to read both of the following community guides for this game so you can plan a reasonable party and know how to invest in and focus on growing your party's skills:""The old Memories Blade of Destiny Starter Guide""   and    ""A camping Guide through Arkania""			"

												This is an extremely difficult game to rate acurately. The downside is that it looks quite dated, even the simplest of quests take what seem like an age to complete, and combat seems like a stage in a marathon. The upside is that it's absolutely huge, completely non-linear, full of secret side quests, and, perhaps absurdly, the length of time it takes to complete even the earliest of quests actually adds to the sense of achievement when you eventually make it through one adding to that ""epic"" feel. I strongly suggest you try normal mode before going anywhere near the ""pro"" setting. If slow burning games with plenty of depth that take FOREVER to play are your bag then this is for you. But if you are one of those people who like eye candy, or anything remotely ""high octane"" then you should probably give this a miss. If you DO chance it then don't be put off by the terrible voiceovers - there's more to this game than meet either eye or ear. It feels like exactly what it is - a graphical interpretation of a slow and complex pen and paper game. This is either a good or a bad thing depending on your perspective. 75%			"

												Really enjoying this game. This is not a casual RPG game, really looks to be designed for more experienced, hard core RPG gamers. The combat system is really different it goes into a mode like what we used to have when I played PnP games like AD&D with the use of minatures that takes into account, line of sight, terrain and combantant obsticles. It's different than any other RPG game I have played and well done in my opinion. Lots of quests and a large world to explore. If your tired of dumbed down RPGs and want something that injects realism like finding and hunting for food, getting proper equipment to survive harsh weather, quests that require paying attention and not relying on a huge ""!"" over NPC's head I can recommend this game without reservation.Running an AMD Phenom II 955 Quad Core CPU, Nividia GeForce GT 630 2 GB Video card and 4 GB RAM, have not had any problems running the game in ""pretty"" mode, which is middle of the graphic options, no crashes and no bugs so far.

												I am sorry to have to say this, but this game is a fail. Even thought one can indeed feel that 'some' effort has been put into the game, the outcome is just a pale shadow of the original.Truth be told, the original Blade of Destiny from 1993 had lousy graphics and even the MIDI music was very rudimentary; but everything else was excellent: the story, the user interface, the 'randomness factor' - you name it, you have it. You wish to have fights automaticaly calculated - no problem. You wish to speed things up or slow down a bit? No problem. User inventory and skills? Very simple and comprehensive. I can recommend this game heartily to any fan of a good story!And the HD version of the same? Its a complete opposite. Graphics are better (which is not hard, considering the first version to be almost 23 years old) and the music is remastered, story is the same... But the user interface is messed up. Controls are very unintuitive, inventory as well, movement through cities and dungeons is very sluggish and tiresome, as is any other aspect of the game - starting with character generation. If you end up entering someone's house - you need to wait for the narrator to finish his line before being able to somehow get out of there. ESC doesnt work, there is no cancel key, nothing. Only the right mouse button, only after the narrator finished reading the same boring line. That is absolutely unacceptable for anyone who plays RPGs and explores every door that can be opened.And then... the battles. They cannot be accelerated, nor speed-automated as in the original version. If your high level party gets attacked by a couple of rats, you still have to wait 15 min for the battle to be decided. Ridiculous. The *only* improvement that I have seen in the HD version over the 1993 version is the comprehensive explanation of skills and required traits for them. And I did not know that a crystal ball can be enchanted like wands. ^_^Its a shame really... I love the realms of arkania trilogy; it is one of my favorite games of all times, but the HD version is unplayable :(To make things even worse, the support forum is bugged. Registration at forum.schicksalsklinge.com is neigh impossible, nor is possible contact support (always the 'wrong captcha').A shame indeed.			"

												Before i go into why i disliked this game i want to note that i haven't played original (1993) because of which i bear no nostalgia towards this game.Combat was horrible, instead of being interesting and trying to put any effort into strategies all my character miss all hits almost every time, this is exactly how combat was to me, miss x4, hit, and again miss, such combat is boring, repetitive and it isn't absorbing as it should have been in Turn based system.Locations ... most of the locations bear no useful purpose besides stores with pretty much same things you can buy in every other city, most have no quests, interesting events or anything of the sorts, they just feel empty.On the other hand i think that dungeons and caves were amazing it may be just because pretty much rest of the game is so boring that dungeons were a good change and resulted in being quite fun.Graphics for indie game i guess are good, but i as person who doesn't care about graphics of any game i can't say whether they are good or bad.Besides dungeons one other thing that i thought was good were some details this game has, for example: to capture map where you have been you need light source ( torch or magic spell), this is just one example of many like if you have ropes you can get through some hole etc.I did also like DLCs as they had relatively long quests compared to others this game has or at least the ones i found in pointless locations.New interesting locations and items to find, was improvement over base game.You may like this game if you played original, you may give it a try if you already own it, but i personally can't recommend you to buy it.

												Ok I tried the game again after 2 years or so. I am full of great respect how far the developers brought the game. Still. It remains an anachronistic idea in itself.Look, I am an Arkania veteran. I began to play this game system 30 years ago and like it. But as computer game, sticking so slavishly to the Pen and Paper rules is totally BORING and horrible. Second fight, 8 Robbers. Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss. Parry. Miss. -3 Health. Miss. Miss. MissIt drags on and on and on. And watching it simply is not fun. Even with the top graphics of 2016 it would just be totally unfun to watch a turn based fun where 80% of the swings are misses. Yes. I know, that is exactly the DSA ruleset. It is nice when you play this with a group of people in your mind, as a Pen and Paper game. But as Single Player RPG it is a nightmare.I congratulate the developers for bringing this game so far from the humble beginnings. Really. But I can not in good faith recommend this game. Back when the ""Blade of Destiny"" was new, it was the first DSA (Arkania) game ever. So of course they wanted to make it 100% true. But even then it was a Dinosaur. Computer games just dont work with total PnP ruleset conversions. A pity. But even with my really patient senses it remains unplayable for me.			"

												For me it's one of the best games I played. Yes, it is difficult. But it has something really unique - the atmosphere. Of course, you need imagination. This is not a movie. Many adventures (like meeting gryphons) are text only with a static picture or even not.  Currently gameplay is flawless. No more irritating bugs. There are some exploits, which i omit because they are just spoilers for me. Anyway, it is an RPG - it depends on you if you want to cheat or not. Before starting you really have to carefully read all available tutorials and walkthroughs. There is not too much in english, so many things you have to find yourself. It is essential to understand mechanics of DSA and to create a good party. Currently after about of 100 hours of gameplay I'm really near finish, I have seen Hyggelik's sword :). Some additional advices for newbies: 1. buy wintercoats and sleeping bags at the beginning, later on you may not afford them. It is possible to live without them, but difficult.2. Get familiar with prices, sleeping bag can cost 6-20D for example.Good luck!			"

												There are too many bad design choices and bugs to make this game be enjoyable. Just to name a few examples: The interface is clunky, the engine is poorly optimized, the voice acting is some of the worst I have ever heard, and all the voice acting is done by a very small cast of what seems to be two people, there are typo's, mistranslations, and poor grammar in nearly every piece of text, even with min-maxed characters, your mage has about the same chance to hit as your specialized fighters, very vague descriptions of skills and stats, about a third of the ingame help menu is blank and missing text, healing is needlessly complicated, and the whole system really expects you to know exactly how the pen and paper RPG system which it is based off of works.TLDR: Avoid, even if you got this in a bundle save your time and play something else.

												Previous review: I really wanted to like it, especially after all the patches... But, combat is still boring, voice acting is terrible and if you take a closer look, you'll notice that 3d models in battle mode have gigantic heads, even their limbs seem strangely shaped. Sorry, but this game feels cheap and rushed.Don't buy it, maybe Star Trail is going to be a better installment --and at least more faithful to the original.Edited: Well, I was really scheptical about this game, and as you can see in my previous review, I didn't like it at the time. Now, having played more than 25 hours I can say that the game is really good. But, why did I change my mind? Because I actually played it more, and found out that some things (like character models, etc.) are not that bad, especially if you compare them to the old ones (the original 1992 game). The cities are beautiful, by the way.I found myself playing more and more, up until now when I decided to change my review and recommend it, because I'm enjoying it as much as the first time I played Shadows Over Riva. I mean, it's a true CRPG, and that's something very hard to find these days.Also, I found some mods and tweaks that helped me get rid of things I didn't like, i.e. the narrator:- Just rename the folder ""VOICEOVER"" TO ""VOICEOVER-"" or something like this. The game won't find the sound files and hence, you won't hear the narrator.Mods:- ClassicMod: Restores the old spell chants from RoA 2 and RoA 3 (you have to own them). Also, it adds the original intro and some other goodies.- Bildschoenes-Aventurien-1.0: Restores vignettes for some dialogs, i.e. when the party picks up the trail of a wild animal, etc.- Magic_Weapon_Pictures: You can now see whether a weapon or item is magical or not.If you find more like these, please let me know :)Cheers!

												This game apparently had a really bumpy launch, which accounts for the many negative reviews you'll find all over the web. But by now it truly deserves the label ""revised,"" and while there's still some bugs and bugginess here and there, it's in good shape. As the screenshots will undoubtedly tell you, this isn't ""Elder Scrolls Online"" or ""Diablo III,"" although there is some very nice scenery to be had. The main draw—or turn-off, depending on who you are—is the gameplay, which is utterly old school and unforgiving. Your party hit the road in winter and forgot to pack thick coats and sleeping bags? What were you thinking!? In a word, if you yearn for the level of realism that doesn't even know what an ""auto-attack"" is, RoA is your game. If you felt that having to repair your gear in WoW was too much micro-management, it will drive you nuts. If you're undecided, wait for another sale and give it a whirl, you might love the atmosphere and good ol' story-telling.			"

												Unfinished with many missing features.  Let's put it this way, you cannot adjust mouse sensitivity or even look at keybord commands, let alone change them to your preference.  You can look with the mouse, but ""A"" & ""D"" are mapped for turning, so you can't strafe using those keys which most people I know use them in that manner.  So I cannot play because the mouse sensitivity is way too fast! Really lame options dev's!!!All towns people look like they are hypnotized and have the same blank stare on them.

												Despite what Steam's release date says, this was actually released in 1992 (according to wikipedia). I was willing to look the other way on the outdated graphics (after all I've enjoyed plenty of other retro games such as Betrayal at Krondor and several other old Sierra/LucasArts titles) but I jsut wasn't able to get into this game. For me part of it was the tons of menus, which made things such as trying to play a lute in a tavern or even character creation, very very cumbersome. The combat also felt clunky to me. I was able to figure it out and had I realized initially that  this was older than Morrowind by a full decade, then I would have probably spent time looking for and reading the manual first.To be fair, I only managed one fight.... and killed half the party before I realized I could run away. But there wasn't anything that grabbed me here. Besides the old graphics, clunky combat, and menus I would say the one other thing that put me off was the voice ""acting"".			"

												Schicksalsklinge hat bei mir einen  Nostalgiebonus. Ich habe seinerzeit das P&P-Originl gespielt, dann Schatten über Riva und war sofort vertraut mit den Regeln. Ich hatte immmer wieder viel über Schicksalsklinge und Sternenschweif gelesen, es aber wegen der Grafik immer nur kurz angespielt. Bis ich dann das Remake im Laden sah und die Chance nutzen wollte, diesen Klassiker durchzuspielen. Es war damals die DVD-Version 1.2x. Diese habe ich schon ohne größere Bugs durchspielen können und habe da schon das Engagement des Teams mitbekommen, doch noch ein sehr gutes Produkt machen zu wollen. Ganz großes Lob dafür!Jetzt las ich, dass das Remake von Sternenschweif in der Mache ist und ich habe mir Schicksalsklinge nochmal auf Steam geholt um einen Spielstnd für Sternenschweif zu haben :)Was soll ich zu den anderen teils umfangreichen Reviews hinzufügen? Ich finde die Kampf-Avatare nicht soooo schlimm. Im Gegensatz zum Original finde ich die Kämpfe sogar wesentlich angenehmer mit zoomen und drehen. Die Story ist solala, wird aber durch die Umsetzung und Aufmachung wieder wettgemacht: das Rumreisen und Entdecken, die Ereignisse, die teilweise sehr zum Schmunzeln einladen, das Gruppenmanagement, der spitzenmäßige Sprecher usw. Bugs hatte ich keine mehr mit 1.36 und durch die Mods/DLC kommt noch mal viel Content und viele Features hinzu. Man sollte sich aber im Klaren sein, dass es wegen der Größe des Studios kein AAA-Titel (Grafik zB - nett und funktional aber halt nich weltspitze) ist. Auch ist die Lernkurve sehr steil und man sollte als Neuling bereit sein, viel zu lesen und zu lernen (Komplettlösung per ModManager, Regelwerke usw.). Dafür wird man aber mit  einem einzigartigen Spielerlebnis belohnt. In welchem anderen RPG überlegt man sonst noch, ob man es noch vor dem Winter schafft, den Bergpass zu passieren und ob man  genug Schlafsäcke hat :)? Mir hat Schiksalsklinge HD sehr viel  Spass gemacht. Für mich sind es 8 von 10 Punkten. Sternenschweif EA ist bestellt und sieht schon sehr gut aus mit sinnvollen Ergänzungen und Verbesserungen - ich freue mich drauf :)			"

												This game is a mess all around. First it doesnt like avast at all had to change a .exe program just to get it to run. You can not move around inside buildings. Its just a static shot of a tavern owner and a few others. The graphics look fine. However the main issue I have with this game is it doesnt hold your hand its slaps it and starts to feel mean spirited. I would think this being the year 2014 that once you have taken a quest your given a marker on your map. You know to find out where to go. Well that was my mistake I suppose I get 2 quest. One about an orge army and I leave the place thinking I am going to get some directions or least some directions as to where to go. Nope. Also leaving a building you think it would the movement key. Nope its a right click and boots. Ugh. This might have been a hoot in the 90's but now it looks old and sad. Compared to skyrim, morrowind and a ton of others that have done this. Never winter nights did it a lot better then this game attempts to. Also the guy doing the voice is awful. Awful. He brings the entire game down. He sounds bored and tired.

												This game has potential but it it's system is very dated.  Turn based combat was a limitation of old processors so keeping it in this revision brought the limitations of old games into modern gaming.  Additionally, the combat graphics and sky graphics are really bad and look like something you would have seen back in 2002.  I also recommend turning off the voice volume since the narration can get annoying quickly.It does have a few good qualities.  The story and music are excellent.  The map travel and random encounters are well implemented.  You can also start the game over with an advanced party and keep your experience and gear - I did this since the game is very unforgiving to level 1 characters.  The fighters couldn't hit anything, the mages' spells kept failing, and the thief couldn't pick any locks which made the beginning of the game very frustrating.  After slugging it to level 2, I started over with the same group and the game is much more playable so far.			"

The cpu is below specs but the R5 graphics are enough for it to run. It's occasionally choppy but runs fine otherwise. I have a lot of hours from testing the various graphics settings and occasionally restarting from earlier points. I like it and would recommend it only at Steam's recommended specs or above. I'm going for a better video card for my desktop so I can get better enjoyment from playing. The manual I downloaded hardly explains anything and the in game help sucks. For the Twelve!			"

												Realms of Arkania is one of the best crash simulators I've ever experienced. Not only do you have to manually tinker with game files to even start the game in English, one must also (re)select your desired resolution and the option to not run in windowed mode everytime you start the game up. If you want to change settings in-game, then you will crash. This is one of many crashes you will experience. How about starting a new game? After selecting new game and then your difficulty, you will crash again. I will not list all of the crashes, because I don't want to ruin this awesome simulator for you guys.Graphics - 10/10:Seriously the menu looks amazing. So does my desktop after an error-less crash.Gameplay - 10/10:All crashes are instant and uncorrectable due to the lack of a way of diagnosing the crashes. This makes it much different from other games, where instead of Googling how to fix the crash, you first have to figure out how it happened in the first place. Nice to see a simulator with a puzzle element to it.Sound - 9/10:The sound is the only lacking feature, and it's amazing. The sound you get when you crash is so good, you won't even believe that you heard it.Overall - 10/10:This is seriously the best crash simulator I've ever played.			"

												Well... I can't recommend game that ain't working. Like at all.Starting new game always crash whole game, always - no matter what configuration I use. And yeah - I've googled it, found that exact bug and aplied fix on my own (something with my antivirus). And it didn't worked. Then I googled some more. And more. Aaaaand more...I'm glad I got that in a bundle and I really cared about original games, but still - stay away. I wasted 3 days trying to make this crap work. I give up.Game that doesn't work is not worthy even a 1$!			"

												This may well be the worst game I have ever played to date!  I see no redeeming value in this at all.  I tried...  I really did.  If you want to play this game.  Nab yourself a copy of the ACTUAL Realms of Arkania!  I believe the trilogy is on GOG for dirt cheap.  This remake is garbage!  Its clearly not a finished product.  Even basic things like character creation are buggy and incomplete.  This is obviously not a ""finished"" product.  I'd say it was an alpha at best likely shoved out the door when the money ran out.  A good indicator of the quality to expect... look at the steam achievements.  It lists it as having 1 achievement.  Now take a closer look at that achievement.  Its a random glitchy screenshot of turn based combat labeled ""Testing Achievement"".  When you try to view this achievement it gives you an error.  Obviously the developer threw that together quickly to test how achievements work and dispaly... and never got rid of it.  Good show.  Now just think to yourself... if they butchered their store page display that bad... what is the game going to be like!?  Incase you really love to torture yourself and decide to buy this game anyway... have fun trying to understand a damn thing.  All the dialogue, writing, and descriptions read as if they were translated into english by ""Borat from Khazakstan"", that is of course whenever the text is even in a place thats readable or there at all. Almost all of the entries in the help section in the game had a majority of the text running out of the help window itself.  Very helpful.  Creating a character was a tumor inducing affair as well... I've played enough RPG's to guess what a Warrior, Hunter, or Rogue is like skill and ability wise. But you aren't even going to give me a hint about classes like dwarf, thalworian woman, leaf elf, ice elf, etc?  Not to mention there is no information about what any of the attiributes do in-game.  If somehow you haven't already quit and uninstalled ... you'll get into the game itself and can leave the temple you start in.  Now you're in a 3D city with not a damn clue what you should be doing.  Even on the lowest settings moving around the city ran horrible and using shift to run causes nausea inducing motion blur effects.  Through some heroic act of endurance against this horror of a game I managed to play long enough to get into a battle.  It was a buggy and unpleasant affair.  I played several turns of combat and then quit to uninstall.  Do not buy this game.  Its not even a game its a scam to play on peoples nostalgia.  I used to love the original of this game... I know my memory isn't quite what it used to be but I know the game wasn't anything close to this abortion of code.  Honestly I've never asked for a refund on a Steam purchase before not even on games that don't run... but this one.  I think I'm asking for a refund for.			"

												I own and still have the original cd-rom for the orgininal game. I have to say in comparison this is a much better product to the one I played in 1995. There are a few items I would like to see worked one as possilbe upgrades or version releases. 1. When in dialog with an NPC all of the NPC's have the same arm movements. I found this a little distracting. It was really distracting with a few of NPC's where the lay of the clothing, the logic of the arm movement, and the arm all created a sort of hellicoptor effect.2. The fixed camera angle works most of the time but when going up or down an incline this presents a problem. 3. The inabillity to move items from one party member to another easily made game play a downer. Be careful how much and what objects you give to party members.Good stuff:The narration voice was good. Not harsh, not rushed, and very practiced. It is a voice with a even pitch and tone. The random party I was presented at the beginning of the game was well rounded.The idea of the beginner quest in the local school dungons was good. It may be that I just never found that one when I played the old version. Overall: This version was just as engaging for me as the original. The tactics and strategy behind a party of 6 in battle with turn based fighting--ah fun times.			"

												I have been a long term fan of the series and had been really looking forward to its release of the remake in the summer. As can be seen on the Amazon and Steam Reviews this release was totally botched and bugged. What however really impressed me was how the developers continued to work night and day for the better part of half a year to make good on their mistake. The outcome is now a game that is actually really fun to play and captures the spirit of the old game exactly how I had hoped for for the release. So now it is a 4.5 out 5 !			"

												I really tried to like this game. Really, really tried. I loved (and played) the old RoA games a lot, but this re-imagining is quite terrible. Interface is clunky, fights are annoying because your characters can't hit a damn and the graphics is bad. I only pained after the good old drawn artworks, this rendered garbage looks ... bad.I regret getting this game.			"

												The game was unfinished. It doesn't even allow for fights to happen without bugs. the voiceover story telling requires mute because its that horrendous.

												This feels like the old Might and Magic series. It's based in the world of Satinav, something which I am familiar with. However, the gameplay for this game is horrendous. You move around with the WASD keys and interact with objects by clicking on them. You can sprint with the SHIFT key and use your party to cast environmental spells like Light in Darkness.However, there are too many negatives to make me want to play this game.PROS1. VoiceoversNot bad. It's like a Dungeon Master is reciting the script.CONS1. No starting TutorialYou start in a Temple. Then what? 2. Tolkien WorldHumans? Dwarves? Elves? Orcs? It's pretty cliche now.3. GraphicsVery drab and dull. There are no highlights to show what you are interacting with. You basically read off the words that are at the tip of the mouse pointer.			"

												I loved the Nordland Trilogy when it originally came out and was hoping to relive the experience with this HD edition. So far I've still been unable to even get started properly.While my play count says 34 hours, I've spent maybe 15 actual minutes with the game. The game kept crashing even after the 1.34 patch. One of these crashes led to the process becoming unkillable which I didn't realize until more than a day later. Having left the computer running the entire time, the play count wracked up until I rebooted.After this I finally tried compatibility mode and was able to progress past the start screen. Created a character, started in the temple, left, and......motion sickness in the first outside area. I'll have to find out if there's a way to change the FOV because otherwise I won't be able to stomach the game at all.Disappointing so far. Hopefully I can revise this review eventually. I have fond memories of the original.			"

												Steaming pile of crap.  Released unfinished, never finished and the developer Chris just verbally berates anyone who asks him when he'll be done.  Then they start releasing cash-grab DLC before even finishing the base game.  If Chris spent half the time working on the game instead of berating people on the forums for complaining about his unfinished produce, it would be finished.  Do yourself a favor and skip this version entirely.  Go to GOG and buy the original series for a fraction of the cost.  The graphics, gameplay and voiceacting are like a combination of everything bad in the early 90s, without a single speck of the charm.  I tried to like this game.  Kept firing it up and kept trying every time they said it was ""updated"".  You remember that one dufus kind in middle school who never read his book, bought the cliff notes and never read those, then when the teacher called on him to do his report, he stalled and stalled until finally he got up there and mumbled incoherent garbage until the bell rang, then looked up victorious as smirked ""Well I guess that's all the time we have today!""  Chris was that kid.  And he never learned anything. SLACKER!			"

												There is one reason I don't recommend this game. It doesn't grab your attention. Games aren't like books, where you need to give it a chapter or two to set the scene. The visuals do that for you for the most part. They need to grab your attention to start, then after that give you space and freedom if they want it to be open world. Something has to interest you. This? Nothing does. You make a character, and the world is just there. Nothing to draw you in. Which means I stopped playing in about 30 minutes. Can't tell you how good or bad the rest of the game is, but the beginning is always key. Every game company knows this. The best work is generally in the beginning to get you sucked in. So if your beginning sucks, then the rest is generally as bad or worse.			"
