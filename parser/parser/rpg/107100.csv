												Kid writes a review, and isn't too sure what to say. Ten outa ten, best game of the year, or a fine work of art, words of praise that's hollow with no real meaning. You could say this kid wants to write about the solid gameplay, engaging story, beautiful world, amazing soundtrack, and a fine narration. But the kid knows better... The game left him feeling satisfied in the end, no one can say he had a bad time. But all phrases and words just don't cut it for the kid, so he'll leave it like this, Bastion made him happy like a Scumbag with a full stomach.			"

Bastion: where gaming meets geniusWhen Supergiant Games released Bastion in August 2011, probably they themselves probably won't have dreamt of the enormous critical acclaim their debut title would get. Seldom has an independent developer hit the gaming scene with such an original and beautiful game as in this case.When I started Bastion for the first time, I immediately got the feeling I was in for a special treat. Few games begins as arrestingly as this one, with the whiskey- and smoke-weathered voice of the ""narrator"" immediately setting the scene. This narrative aspect proved crucial in the way Bastion drawed me into its world. It seemed like every step I made or every action I tried, could be met with some commentary. This feeling that the story develops ""on the spot"" is further enhanced by the fact that the world literally materialised under my feet as I ventured further out. This world is painted in bright and gorgeous colours with a teint all of their own: Bastion would be immediately recognizable just by looking at the colour-pallette.The story by itself proved interesting enough to keep me playing, wanting to discover step-by-step how things would develop with the Bastion and the protagonists. Gameplay-wise, Bastion is not as innovative as in its storytelling or visuals, but it takes a well-tried formula into perfection. At its core, it is an action-rpg (light), preferably to be played with an xbox 360 controller (as are so many games the past years!). Controls are perfectly laid out and very intuitive: after a couple of hours I played it as if I had done so for several years. As the game progresses, more weapons and special abilities are unlocked, all with their distinctive characteristics. Weapons can be upgraded in five stages each, and liquids add some punch to the main-characters possibilities. Several other elements complement this core gameplay so that there is always enough variety to keep things interested. I even signed up immediately for the ""new game plus"" mode after completing the game a first time, looking forward to more unlocks of different sorts.Another department where Bastion truly shines, is its soudtrack. Seldom has ingame-music helped me so much in getting ""into"" the game, as it captures the mood of every level to perfection. Combined with the unique grain of the narrator's voice, this develops into a great listening experience. The developers also did a wonderful jobs in the myriad of smaller sounds present in the game: every weapon for example has a unique ""ring"" to it, from the zippy sound of the Breaker's Bow to the rusty clack of the Musket. There really is no weak link in this game. Everything is extremely well thought-off, and even better implemented. It's a must-play for everyone who loves pc gaming.Gameplay: 27/30Graphics: 18/20Sound: 10/10 (maybe the best of all elements in this game)Longelivety: 8/10 (I played it for over 25 hours, exploring it to the full)Technical: 10/10 (no issues whatsoever)Steam-integration: 8/10 (trading cards, leaderbords and achievements included, the latter good but not special)Personal appreciation: 9/10Overall: 90/100I completely love Bastion and recommend it emphatically. Since I started writing reviews of the games I play on Steam almost a year ago, this is the first game that gets a score in the 90's - I don't want to ruin my scoring-system with giving too many high-scores. But this one deserves it to the full.			"

""Kid just rages for a while"" ~The StrangerBastion should be counted among those few games that not only meet, buy even exceed all the promises we get in their early description. Being one of the most beautiful and climatic games of 2011 this action RPG shines brightly even now, still as fresh and original as during its release.The game itself is not so complicated. You take up role of a Kid, waking up, all alone, surrounded by beautiful yet crumbling world falling apart into thousand pieces. What You need to do is get to the Bastion – safe heaven set up to shelter those who’d survive any crisis threatening Your homeland – city of Caelondia.To Your aid, in a quest to find, and rebuild Bastion, You’ll get a vast arsenal of even the weirdest weapons, each coming with different mechanics and “special skills” which further enhance Your possible combat strategies. Further modifications to Your play-style can be achieved through quite original system of upgradable structures built inside the Bastion, which allow Kid to chose worshiped “gods” in a shrine, or special drinks in a distillery each differently affecting game environment, providing new opportunities or threats.Despite game mechanics being pretty simple it’s not easy to get bored with ‘Bastion’ even after a few long hours, but what really makes this game stand out is its unique way of telling the story. Most of our actions are commented actively by omniscient narrator, who not only slowly reveals some details behind tragic events that left the whole world in ruins, but also perfectly portraits the Kid and his few friends, allowing us to immerse into the games plot on a level rarely seen in video games.The last thing worth mentioning about ‘Bastion’ is it’s astonishing soundtrack. Composed by Darren Korb this game’s music fits its dreamy, hand-drawn canvas perfectly, strongly enhancing the impact of the narrative.Overall, I consider this game to be one of the most amazing feats of storytelling in video games, and definitely one of my favorites. And don’t get scared that the game relying so heavy on its story will get boring after just one completion. NG+ and Score Attack modes, matched which some arena-styled levels will allow You to spend long hours in “Bastion's” captivating world !Pros:- One of the most beautiful soundtracks out there.- Light, yet interesting story with uniqe responsive narration.- Vast amount of weapons, special skills and other modifications.- High replayability with NG+ and Score Attack.Cons:- To some, controls may feel a little unresponsive (I base on some friends opinions)			"

												Bastion is an amazing game, filled with colorful art and a sexy narration that tells the story as you play as oppose to ripping the camera and controls from you so you can watch a 5 minute cut scene. I would love to play another game with this guy as a lead voice. Music for the game is also very good and fitting for this kind of game, somewhat somber at times.The game play is pretty fast pace and excellent, though has it's short falls. One of them is that you are given too many weapons, Unless you plan on experimenting with the weapon load-out, You will usually stick with what works for you. Same with secret skills, which I hardly ever used while playing. Overall, an amazing game that opens up for you the more you play.			"

												Imagine a function that everyone's invited to. It's all over social media and touted as the biggest event of the year.  You plan on going because all your friends and colleagues intend to, but days pass and you forget to RSVP. Your calendar stops functioning and you lose sight of all your big appointments. You press on regardless, making sure everything's ready prior to the big day as you frantically search for your invitation. Time goes by and you get distracted, forgetting about your plans and your schedule. You finally locate your invitation and head to the venue, only to find a fish and chip shop where a reception should be, and that the big event was held three years ago. That's how late I am to this party. Released in 2011, Bastion is a game that belies its indie origins, combining great gameplay with colourful art and an amazing soundtrack composed by Darren Korb, making for a complete package that puts some bug-ridden AAA games to shame. The haunting song that plays during the closing credits, Setting Sail, Coming Home, will likely remain in your head for days, along with the urge to keep playing. Bastion is a lot of fun and I can't recommend it enough. If, like me, the game has been languishing in your ""to-play"" list for a while, waste no more time. Play it now. You won't regret it.			"

												I waited to write this review until I had beaten the game and got all of the achievements. I didn't really expect much from this game. I'm not really into these action, kiddy looking, RPGs. I kind of just picked it at random from where it had been collecting dust in my library, but it won my heart. The voice acting is amazing and clever. Arguably, there is a deep philosophical lesson to this game. I won't give it away though. The music? Wow. I have never wanted to buy a game soundtrack, but I do now! At some point in the game, you get a radio, with which you can put whatever song you like on from the soundtrack.  The game has different endings. You beat the game once, and have the option to play the game again with all of your weapons, upgrades, and level intact. This is helpful to get a different ending and/or for achievements. There is also a attack score mode, where you restart from the beginning, without your upgrades and from level one. In this mode, you can accumulate points and compete on the leaderboards. There are some really tough achievements, but once you get them you have this huge feeling of accomplishment. They really test your skills as a player. Buy this game. If you are on the fence, put it on your wishlist, and buy it when it goes on sale. I seriously doubt that you will be disappointed.			"

												Rarely does artistic excellence and mechanical brilliance come together in as amazing an experience as Supergiant's Bastion. Its vision is remarkably strong and merciless in its attempts to astound your expectations, never content to settle for anything less than wholly inspired. It stands apart as a shiny example of independent ingenuity, a bar to which others should aspire to hit, but more than that it manages to feel as fresh and fully developed as anything coming out of much larger studios. It's the sort of experience that sticks with you after you finish it, hollowing out a place in your mind where the most excellent games of our time take up residence, sure to be talked about for years to come.A proper story's supposed to start at the beginning, but Bastion's not that simple. It spins its narrative in a nonlinear spiral, urged on by the smooth voice of the narrator, who describes your character's every action with a cool and calculated tone that gives the impression he knows more than he's letting on and has seen this all before. More than just a original storytelling device, it gives Bastion a personality all its own from the second the game begins. It keeps you engrossed despite an almost complete lack of character dialog, falling back largely to third person descriptions that on their own may seem meaningless, but when weaved in perfect context to the action on screen create something of a living story; one which feels as much a product of your own actions as the author's. The plot is never neglected however, as slowly but surely it all winds back together, taking control over the fascinating amounts of lore you are told throughout your journey and turning them into a full featured narrative that never falters or shows any sign of hesitation. Its deliberate planning can be traced back to the very first line uttered in the game, and when you finally see it all fleshed out, it's rather incredible that it works anywhere near as well as it does.Bastion operates under a clear design to offer the player as much freedom as possible to choose their own playstyle. Almost entirely focused on hack'n'slash combat, it presents new weapons and means to dispose of your enemies on a near constant basis. Mixing and matching these weapons and abilities is what allows you to tailor the game to your own playstyle, from melee and ranged weapons, to a near endless variety of passive upgrades and power ups. Whatever you choose you're never locked into any one upgrade path, which lets you freely experiment to find what works best for you. The combat itself is extremely simple, but meticulously balanced and refined to feel satisfying and as challenging as you want to make it. It excels at creating a constant feeling of progression, even past the point of finishing the game as you can then playthrough it again in new game plus mode to catch any upgrades you missed, or take on even bigger challenges.This almost doesn't matter though, in the face of Bastion's astonishing presentation. The flow of tiles building the path in front of you venture through the world, the gorgeous art design that overflows with vibrancy and creativity, and the unbelievable soundtrack that blends an astonishing amount of styles into a sound that's unlike anything I've ever heard. It's truly an artistic feat that puts the bland and predicable visual and sound designs of other games to shame, and should serve as a reminder to developers that conforming to a common mold is detrimental not only to your games identity, but the industry as a whole. I can scarcely recall playing a game with as much aesthetic originality and finesse as Bastion, and it's a triumph to its creators that they were able to create something that is as impressive to look and listen to as it is to play.Even before I played it, Bastion always stood as something of a posterchild to me for indie games. Its relentless ambition and startling success at achieving it are a showcase of how much can be accomplished by a small team with a clear set of ideas for the game they want to make. It's stunning and memorable in the way few games could ever hope for, and is as mechanically solid as it is breathtakingly presented. It succeeds in every aspect, and is one of the most well rounded games I have likely ever played.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Bastion Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: RPG; Action; Atmospheric; Isometric  My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-11 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEWBastion is a very soulful game. That’s probably its most defining feature.  It's in the style of an isometric hack-and-slash, drawing from arcade roots and presented with a poignant atmosphere.  It is definitely a very easy game to enjoy; and it should appeal to wide variety of gamers.  And since it is medium length and has a wide range of difficulty options, it is a good game for anyone who may want to take a step out of their comfort zone and try something different.Probably the first thing that jumps out about Bastion is the gorgeous, hand-painted artwork. But that only scratches the surface.  The whole atmosphere of this game is incredible.  The world literally unfolds around you as you make your way through the environments. The soundscape is spot on and the music is great. It is a very aesthetic experience.The gameplay is strongly narrative-based.  In fact, there is an actual narrator that guides you through the game.  This nature of the game does lead it to be semi-linear, although you do have a fair amount of branching options to work with in some aspects of the game. The gameplay is pretty simple and intuitive, but also offers a surprising amount of depth.  There is a decent variety to your arsenal and to the enemies you face.  And the baseline difficulty is very easy, which is the proper way to design games so that everyone can enjoy them.  Nevertheless, the innovative difficulty system in the game allows you to tweak various specific options (enemy health, enemy damage, player movement, etc.) to meet your preference and tackle the most extreme challenges/achievements.Now the game isn’t really that long if you were to only do a single playthrough of the campaign. However, there are the aforementioned challenges and achievements to tackle, a NewGame+ Mode, and also an Score Attack Mode where you get a running score throughout your playthrough and can compete on leaderboards, if that is your thing.  So you should be able to get a good amount of playtime.So, in summary, I would say that the synergy of the soulful presentation, the intuitive gameplay, and the unique narration makes this game more charming than a Disney prince.  Bastion is a great gaming experience, and a modern classic.  Unless you are adamantly not interested in this genre, I recommend you at least consider giving it a shot.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Bastion might not be something to get a ton of hours out of or regularly play, but its one of the most original RPGs. It really didn't feel bland at all. The game's simple, but very fun to play. Its good to get into if you don't want to learn a complex system or devote a bunch of time into going through an RPG. Its not a long game, but that doesn't make it lesser. There's some replayability to it with different modes too.Bastion's strongest point is the story. Oh my God its so good! A bit depressing, but so strong. It had a great impact on me and is easily a game that will never be forgotten.I won't speak much on it. You have to play through it for yourself.Also, the story is narrated. Its pretty neat and really sets the mood of the game. I couldn't imagine playing the game without the narration!The art is gooorgeous. It has a very artsy look and is quite colourful. Its pleasing to look at. I liked it a lot.The music is also excellent. Has an OST worth playing outside of the game. The style of music was pretty unique. Some really great tracks and its something I still listen to here and there.There's a few different ways to play the game when it comes to controls. It all runs very well. No issues.Bastion is just a total masterpiece. If you haven't played it you need to. Its one of those must-play indie titles that people will still be talking about years from now. Kind of the FF7 of indie games :)			"

The game has all those feelings, just better.-------------------------------------------------------------------If there was ever any doubt that games were not true art  then I just think of this masterpiece and laugh at all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tters who say otherwise.I sat here for minutes writing this review and I tried to think of things to put in the negative section and I damn couldn't find any flaws in this immaculate jar of gaming Nutella.-------------------------------------------------------------------What's in this bag of candy? The creamiest and most delicious candy of the Supergiant Game brand. These guys hit each nail on the head.8/10 Game mechanics. You have an entire array of tools at your disposal to spice the gameplay experience of any human on this planet that knows how to use a computer. - You have weapons. As varied as you can get, all with different playstyles, strengths and weaknesses. And you can carry two of them at once. UPGRADING THEM IS DAMN GUD. You can even go TWO paths for each weapon and specialise in whatever hell you want to unleash- You have skills. Some tied to weapons and only function with a specific one, others work whenever. Can't spam the skills, since you need a Black Tonic per use and they will more likely than not save your ♥♥♥♥ in every situation you need your ♥♥♥♥ saved.- You have things like Tonics. You don't need to be an alcoholic to enjoy the game, because in the process you'll end up drunk with it.  Depending on your char level, you can have a certain number of Tonics active at a given time that offer bonuses and some drawbacks. Mix them however you want to cover your weaknesses or boost your strengths.- For the hardcore master race you have things like Idols, which you can activate to make the game harder and increase your XP gain. Idols like ♥♥♥♥ING Micia which grants +10% xp but the damn monsters regenerate. GOOD LUCK FIGHTING THAT FRONT-ARMORED ELITE JUMPING ♥♥♥♥ER- You have those scroll thingies, which if you complete you gain in-game currency 'n' ♥♥♥♥. It's like achievements that are not achievements but actually matter.- IT HAS A NEW GAME PLUS that I have yet to complete8/10 Platforming.- Fighting is visceral and satisfying. Want to spam clicks? LOL GOOD LUCK WITH THAT- You have damn right interesting monsters that become deadly in certain combinationssince they all have weaknesses and strengths. - Level design is just sublime. ♥♥♥♥ING FLOATING ISLANDS GUYS IT'S LIKE IN MY NON-SEXUAL DREAMS- various mechanics spice the combat a lot, like defending, counter-attacking, throwing, power-shooting, pelvis thrusting. You can do all kinds of ♥♥♥♥ and you'll feel proud when it works.10/OUTTA10 Soundtrack / Voice acting- I'm totally homo for that narrator- I felt bad for downloading the soundtrack to my phone without paying, but let me tell you how smooth the 5-hour car trip from today was: LIKE A BRICK OF BUTTER SLIDING ON ICE- that damn game atmosphere makes your head spin it's so goodJUST LISTEN TO THIS

												Full of cryptic one-liners and bluesy-folk music, Bastion almost seems more like an art house project than a game at first glance. Rest assured though, with it’s stylish isometric graphics and stunning presentation, Supergiant Games has created something that not only brings a certain amount of legitimacy to indie titles, but in my honest opinion pushes the established medium of video games forward as whole. I would argue that Bastion is one of the biggest arguments for games as an art form to date.But how does one review or explain art? Everyone has their own interpretation. It is pretty easy to notice Bastion’s graphics, any screenshot is a testament to how gorgeous the game looks. But Bastion is not just a pretty picture; this is one game where you can not ignore the audio. There is a reactive narrator the explains everything as if he is watching you play. Fall off a cliff and he tells you to watch your step, get a new weapon and he is sure to have a little quip about it. Both the narrator and the game’s haunting music added greatly to the atmosphere and storytelling.Not content to rest on style alone, Bastion is also a solid action RPG. You assume the role of The Kid, who is never named. You awake to empty space, an existence that has been destroyed by an event known as the Calamity. As you take your first steps into this brave new world, life springs up under your feet and upon arriving to a safe haven dubbed the Bastion, you learn that it is your destiny to rebuild. Cores brought from the Wilds beyond the safety of the walls allow you to construct buildings: a forge for upgrading weapons, a shrine for paying patronage to the gods, or even a distillery for mixing your own drinks.Without giving too much away, the Kid comes to find out what caused the Calamity; the story is not entirely complex but rather poetic and touching. There are multiple different endings and a score attack mode to keep you playing long after the credits roll. And since the new game plus allows you to keep levels and weapons, I found it worth it to play through a few times in order to see everything. In short, I would say Bastion is pretty much perfection.			"

												Visually flawless, poetic, philosophical and striking on many points: the musics, the songs (both bitter and nostalgic, and that haunt you for a long time...), the storyline,... A lovely RPG that reminded me of the good old Terranigma. Only cons I could find out, which is also something I loved is the narration. Don't misunderstand; it's gorgeous, and the way it's describing your moves with a bit of irony is very enjoyable. The problem is for non-native english speaker, like me, who might have troubles to concentrate on the subtitles while playing. That's the only negative point I could find while playing. Otherwise, don't hesitate! This game is a gem.-------------------------------------------------------------------Visuellement sans fautes, poétique, philosophique et surprenant sur de nombreux points: les musiques, les chansons (à la fois douces amères et nostalgiques, et qui vous hanteront pour longtemps...), l'histoire,... Voilà un sympathique petit RPG qui m'a à plusieurs reprises rappelé le bon vieux Terranigma. Seul défaut que j'ai pu lui trouver, qui m'a pourtant charmée, est la narration. Ne vous méprenez pas; cette narration est géniale, et la façon dont chacunes de vos actions est décrite avec une touche d'ironie est très appréciable. Le problème est qu'étant en vost, les joueurs dont l'anglais n'est pas la langue maternelle, même malgré un bon niveau, auront certainement du mal à se concentrer sur les sous-titres tout en jouant. Voilà donc le seul défaut que j'ai pu relever en jouant. Cela mis de côté, n'hésitez pas un instant! Ce jeu est une petite perle.			"

												Most of you must have played it already. I will try to keep it short.Anyways,Bastion is a wonderful game. In the first few minutes, it pulls you in like quicksand with its watercolored art and ""what the hell happened here"" curiosity and its hard to quit playing after that. I guarantee that you will only quit playing either a) Your eyes start hurting real bad, b) You need to get out of that chair and do something.(^Its mostly gonna be 'a'^).Lets break it Down:++Fantastic Storytelling: Logan Cunningham does a fantastic job in narrating and guiding the player through the world of Bastion and at the same time, keep it alive. The Dyanmic commentry presented here is something i wish all games had. It just makes the game feel more Alive. It has lore, but only essential to the game.Yes he's also in Transistor. +++++The GAMEPLAY : OH YEAH, Fluid combat system and varied enemies keeps things interesting throughout the whole game. The melee and ranged weapons are well balanced and its upto to the player to figure out the what weapon loadout(2 melee or 2 ranged or melee-ranged) to take that bests suits one's playstyle. This i liked very much. Made me spend time experimenting with the different weapons, secret skills, passive boosts(spirits) and finding that right loadout for me. I also loved that we'd fall off the edges,keeps you more aware and cautious rather than just running around crazy. The level loading was also something eye-catching as it loads as you move or progress in-game,land just literally falling from the sky.++++The Amazing Art : The game was quite colorful with the watercolor backdrops and vistas, NPC designs were nice,and art was overall very appealing for 2.5D game.If you notice closely, you can see the different animation details for a lot of combat moves.++++The Sound: The sound sometimes really set the mood for whats happening in-game. Its amazing, maybe you wont feel its amazing just by listening to the tracks alone, but when in-game, they really bloom emotions. Yes, same sound team in Transistor..++ Overall: 10/10. Coz its one of those few games that made be Start NG+ difficulty. If you have it in your library and have'nt played it yet, I recommend YOU GO PLAY IT.One of the more powerful games emotionally for me. Its not ""Just"" another Indie Game.A brilliant marriage of story and mechanics. Waaay more Depth than Transistor.Spoiler Alert:The whole sequence of carrying Zulf just tugged on my heartstrings. "

												Bastion 2012	When Bastion came out it was at the beginning of the Indie craze. People were first starting to realize that amazingly fun games could come from tiny studios with no budget. Well now in 2017 the term Indie game has all but lost its meaning both financially, and terms of team size. But at the time, a game with such deep combat, definitive flavor, and overall polish was a treat.	Bastion does a good job of grabbing you with the colorful paint-style world that appears beneath your feet as you move forward. Every action you do is narrated by a grandfatherly voice that explains the story and smaller moments. There was a time early in the game when I walked off the edge of the platforms and the narrator said “And that’s the end of the Kid’s story….I’m just kidding.” And I respawn and he says “The kid goes back for another round.” It was a charming break of the 3rd wall.	In addition to the narrator bringing the game to life, the music does a great job at capturing the alternate cartoon universe. A mix of western and oriental guitar give everything a nostalgic feel. One song was catchy enough that I was humming it even without thinking of the game. Usually music with lyrics and guitar seem out of place in games, but these just add to the feeling of the world. 	The funny part is that this isn’t even the good part of the game. Even the story, which is surprisingly deep and touches on serious themes such as racism, genocide, and war, is merely window dressing. No, the real meat of the game is in the amazing combat. It is fluid and intuitive, and each enemy that has a unique way it needs to be defeated. There are a dozen or so weapons that are upgradeable and each has it’s own strengths and weaknesses against certain monsters. Defending and dodge-rolling are a must and it keeps combat fast even on the defensive. Tuck and roll, tuck and roll. 	To really get the most out of this combat there is a mode where you take on waves of enemies for cash. This puts you in one square area against different types of enemies from through the story. On top of this add the difficulty modifiers. There are 10 Gods that can be invoked, each adding 10% gold 10% exp and some added challenge, ranging from increased enemy speed, to regenerating health. You can mix and match which hard modes you want to do, and you learn to adapt to them over time.	My first play though I mashed my way though the story without any hard modes and while it was fun it was closer an experience to diablo, every enemy was cannon fodder, I never had to defend, and every weapon felt overly powerful in my hands. It was fun and I was creating the base ground in which I would really enjoy the game. Once I turned on about half the added difficulties the game came into full form. The feeling of dodging each enemy, memorizing the enemy types and being able t keep track of all the enemies on screen at a time. It tapped into that zone where your not thinking you are just acting and it is beautiful and massively fun. It never feels cheap because you know the enemy types well enough that it is your fault for not blocking.	Over all it is a fun game that presents itself excellently and I can see why this game was so important in defining what an “indie game” during the time when that was starting to mean real quality games from unknown studios. For someone who plays the game for a short period it feels complete, and for someone who sticks around longer it has more under it surface. In that way it feels like a proof of concept for indie games; Presented well, deep combat, unique art style, and some attempt at story. But unfortunately it proves what can be done and then leaves it at that. Give it a whirl, it only has so much to give, but what it gives is memorable. "

The only downside to that is you can't really focus on the story when you're busy dealing with enemies.But whatever, you can just go and play it again. Totally worth it.			"

												Bastion is an isometric action RPG with hand painted art.You're ""the Kid"", a survivor of the Calamity. After you wake up, you do as supposed after a disaster and head to the Bastion, there, you find out the Bastion needs cores to work as intended and you are sent to explore what remains of the world in search of these. During your joruney, you'll face countless enemies, explore land no one has set foot on before, you'll also know more about the Calamity and when the time comes... Nevermindt,that'd ruin the surprise.Long story short, this game has beautiful graphics, gorgeous music, a fancy narrator and flawless gameplay, I'll just go ahead and say it, this ladies and gentleman is perfection.★★★★★ | Loved it "

Kid sits down. He writes a review for Bastion, one of many. Maybe someone that survived can read it. Someone sharper than a brusher's pike.... Or maybe someone as curious as a squirt.Bastion is an amazing singleplayer experience that provides an exceptional story and impressive artistic design, with simple, but effective combat mechanics, amplified by it's interesting soundtrack. It was released in 2012.Bastion is recieved high praise for it's story, which is told through a narrator. This form of storytelling was a new form of interactive media. In Bastion, a man narrates the actions of the protagonist, while also engaging the players in the lore of the world. This dialogue is vast, and there is a lot of narration throughout the game, which reveals the world to the players in an interesting and unique way. The interactivity can be seen when players simply play the game, which makes the game stand out. For example, if you flawlessly continue through a level, or if you defeat an enemy with a new weapon you found, or if you fell off a new level, you would get a unique piece of dialogue, adding to the theme of the game. There are hundreds of these conditional dialogue pieces, and even players that make mistakes can hear some unique dialogue as well, intensifying the bond between gameplay and narrative. Through this kind of narrative, players can learn about the world just by playing the game. Another example is the shrine. When you activate a god's shrine, it gives a short, but enticing, bit of dialogue that reveals a little bit more of the god to you. There's even a lot of text to go through, and lots of interesting descriptions to read about items that you find or use, and you are guaranteed to hear many different things by the time the game is complete. Another example of this narrative interactivity is even seen when picking weapons, as the narrator will make comments about the choice of weapons you have. Like if you pick a mortar and pike, or a mortar and carbine. Even the soundtrack is part of the story, as some music within the game actually is relevent to the game. On top of that, the soundtrack is quite good. The player also gets a little bit of choice through the story, as they can choose any weapon they have unlocked, activate any god to increase the difficulty, and there is an interesting moment where the player decides something. It's a post-apocalyptic world that feels like an adventure, yet there are moments where the player may learn about the sadder things in the world, as the game firmly grasps emotion, something that many games fail to do.Bastion isn't a complex game. It has relatively simple controls, however, this doesn't mean the game is boring, by any stretch, as there are a good selection of different weapons, and players get the option to make the game more difficult. Players can also use 'drinks', which are passive effects that the player can choose to make them even stronger. Weapons are handed to the player as the game progresses, widening the level of choice players get as they move towards the end of the game, and players can also select upgrades for their weapons, and can choose which upgrades they want. For example, a player may opt for damage, or they may opt for more range. The combat itself is relatively enjoyable. Players can roll, use a shield to block and counterattack, use range or melee attacks, and pick from a variety of special abilities, and, as mentioned before, the game's difficulty can be increased for more fun, possibly making the game faster paced. The game is very easy to get into, which makes it a great choice for casual players, or people who don't have much time to begin with, as they won't have to deal with an unforgiving learning curve.Bastion also has a very unique artistic style. It's a 2.5D game with great looking style throughout the entire game. There isn't a moment in the game that feels like it doesn't carry the theme of the rest of the game, and visually, it's easy to see that as players stroll through the menus, look at the loading screen, and explore the levels. Instead of the standard 3D world that you just walk around, Bastion's world is floating. Though there isn't really any platforming, it's a unique way to define current nature of the world, as it does become part of the game and the story. The top notch artwork complements the graphical style of the game, and at the same time, the game is not at all intensive to run. There aren't any super hardcore textures, and there aren't any hardcore lighting effects, as the game's graphic style makes it for it by being unique. This means that even 'non-gaming' PCs ( or Macs ) and Linux based systems can run this easily.Personally, I believe Bastion to be a very solid title. It's not a triple A title, it's actually an indie game, and yet it's still recognized internationally to be a great title, despite being as small as it is. It's the kind of game that you have to try, even if you don't think you'll like it, and for good reason. Bastion is a great experience, and though you won't be getting hundreds of hours out of this title, every hour will be worth it, and worth a little bit more.			"

												Bastion is pretty cool, I suppose. You play as the kid, a silent guy with white hair who likes to hit stuff with hammers and other weapons that aren't as good as the hammer. Some time before the events of the game, someone decided to pour pepsi and coke into the same glass and caused the calamity to happen, which killed a bunch of people and tore the world into cool narrative tool. Bastion plays from an isometric perspective and, much like whenever I decide to leave my dumpster, is narrated by a strange old man wearing an apron. He has a very pleasant voice though. Outside of a few grunts and shouts, he's basically the only voice you hear through the entire game, narrating the things you do, the things you see, what people are saying, whats on the lunch menu, how much time we have until break, etc. You fight with a two weapon load out with a few options for both buttons, things like hammers, spears, machetes, and flamethrowers go hand in hand with crossbows, bows, twin revolvers, a rifle...A-...A grenade launcher. Although the game lets you pick whatever weapon for whatever button, it usually pays off to have one melee and one ranged weapons on your adventure. Though quality in weapons changes dramatically, while some can smash your enemies to pieces, others you may as well be just write a sternly worded letter to them and mailing it via Canada Post.The joke is the mail is never going to reach them. Outside of your attacks, you also have two kinds of defence, a shield block and a dodge. The shield can negate most damage outside of obvious explosions or gas, if you time it right you can also get a counter where the enemy deals damage to themselves by attacking you like the stupid idiots they are. The dodge is actually pretty nifty and will work as long as you actually roll out of the attack instead of into it like you would in other games. If I had to twist my nipples at anything bad about this game I would say that your movement speed is so slow that you may as well be walking on the ground with those stupid bucket suction cup foot things you played with in kindergarten. And the game is so short it probably has trouble getting on any of the fun rides at Disney World. But should you play Bastion? You probably already have, considering how popular this game was back in the day. If you haven't I would give it at least one go, it's pretty fun, but I don't know how long that fun will last past one playthrough. if you can get it for the price of...I don't know, premium instant noodles? Then I would say go for it.Gas station gets 7 smooth narrator voices out of a possible 10. It is illegal to climb trees in Oshawa, a town in Ontario, Canada.The curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation "

~ The Kid just rages for a while. ~Great at first, but gets old very quickly. For every pro, there's a con. Let's start with the good stuff. The colourful, fresh art style and the fast-paced combat are Bastion's biggest pro's. It plays well, it looks great, the cold and unfamiliar atmosphere is well supported by the good soundtrack. Also, being able to change the difficulty in-game by using Idols is a great way to manually spice up the game if you're finding it too easy. Bastion is a quite easy game, so being able to experiment with that was a good touch. On the other hand, it's very vital that they did. Because the gameplay (despite fun in the beginning) tends to get old quickly. Sure, you unlock more weapons as you progress, but it doesn't take long before you familiarise yourself with a certain set and feel comfortable with it, so you don't have any incentive to use the other weapons. The underwhelming story and mediocre level design don't really incentive you to adapt to environmental dangers either. It all looks so much alike, you progress is the same fashion as the first hour, the narrative pacing is very sub-par. Most of the time it's a straight path with very little dead ends where you can find extra items and upgrade materials.+ Visual design is colourful and looks good.+ At first, gameplay was fun and being able to change the combat was a great touch.+ You can experiment with the difficulty yourself (with the Idols).+ Nice soundtrack.+ The narrator gave the game its own unique identity at first, but...- Later the narrator just becomes boring, adds nothing new, and even gets a little annoying.- Gameplay gets old rather quickly, despite being able to spice up the combat. If it wasn't for that, it would have even gotten old a lot sooner.- Uninteresting story with even less interesting characters.- Mediocre, unmemorable and extremely linear level design that doesn't do the good art style justice.- ""Action RPG""? Don't make me laugh. This is absolutely the bar minimum. I don't recommend it. I got it for free, and even then I feel disappointed. So to me it's not a matter of price, but a matter of spending your time with Bastion. To be very honest, in hindsight I think I would have rather spend my 11 hours on something else. It had great potential, but unfortunately it just gets old so, so quick.			"

												Bastion's narrator is probably what most people know about this game. It's a pretty good work of design, writing and voice acting. The game also looks and sounds amazing, with vibrant visuals and soundtrack that ties incredebly well with its story. But, most of all, what is amazing about the game is its gameplay. When it launched Bastion raised the bar from what we could expect from indie games. Not only are the controls tight and responsive, whether you're using a controller or mouse & keyboard, it's just amazing how well designed the weapons are, how unique and game changing they feel as you acquire them. Consider this a universal recommendation: no matter what kinds of games you usually play, you should buy and play Bastion.			"

												Intro:Bastion is an isometric action-adventure game with an absolutely incredible visual style, fun and engaging combat, an engrossing narrative told by survivors of worlds that collided.  One of the core elements of Bastion is exploration and discovering the truth of the new world. You can uncover more through mementos, ash remains of old friends and folks long past, and the narration of a stranger.  The narration is remarkably well done and manages to convey so much without too much repetition.  They have tons of variations for even the small things like visiting a challenge area multiple times.  Gameplay:Combat is very customizable and can suit pretty much any combat style if you invest enough shards of the old world into your weapons.  Each weapon has different strengths and benefits, as well as varying timings to excel with; this makes the combat extremely reactive and very skill oriented.  The only complaint I have regarding combat is the order with which you unlock certain weapons.  I think it could have had the player decide at least a few times what weapon to make/unlock and help them find their preferred play style more quickly. I tried pretty much every weapon and upgraded them all at least once, but I definitely found a few that I preferred over others.  I did have a little trouble distinguishing the actual level from the background at times due to perspective; some partially destroyed walls looked to be traversable and I would roll off into the oblivion as a result.Story:I won't go into much detail regarding the story as I think all players should experience it for themselves.  In my opinion, there are a few minor faults to the story, but they don't matter much and are just slightly inconsistent with the setting/world more than anything seriously problematic.  Thematically, Bastion's narrative has very clear and strong writing that the player can influence with how they approach the challenges set before them.  Some examples follow: If you choose to remove all the pests from an area, the narrator will remark on it; just keep running and ignore the enemies if you want, etc.Audio:Without a doubt, Supergiant Games created one of the very best sound designs and soundtrack I've ever heard for any artistic medium.  It blends so many different styles and musical instruments that it just feels completely different and fresh when you discover a new track.  I spent quite a lot of time just enjoying the music when I unlocked the gramophone, which lets you listen to any of the game's soundtracks. Value & Time:I spent around 10 hours to do most of the content available in the first playthrough, while unlocking 11 of the 24 achievements.  My plans are to play through some of New Game Plus to see the new content that is only playable in that mode, but I don’t think I’ll play through the whole game again right now.Overall:Bastion gets a Highly Recommended and is an extremely polished title that pretty much anyone will enjoy.  This is an incredible, memorable adventure that more people need to play through.			"

												Narration, graphics and soundtrack. These are the main terms used when people talk about this game. What will strike your mind when you first start this game is the harmonic voice of the narrator. Better get used to it because he will bombard you with endless commentary about the schizophrenic postapocalyptic surroundings, lore and travails of our silent protagonist. The narration is rugged, dramatic and quite serious. I mean, just look at the place, it is torn asunder. The game itself provides mainly action-filled gameplay with a bit of RPG-ing with collecting weapons, resources and lore items. You can use the resources to upgrade your weapons in endless variations. The playthrough is not very difficult and you can finish the game with your favourite weapons, but the difficulty raises significantly in the Proving Grounds and in the free DLC challenge mode where most builds don't work very well. What I liked most about this game has to be the soundtrack. When the narrator gets a bit annoying near the end (mainly because the story doesn't stand up much to the other factors of the game), the soundtrack never ceases to surprise you. It combines many styles and some tracks became one of my all-time favourites.7.5/10			"

												Bastion is one of those games that will always hold a special place in my heart. This game strikes so many notes in all the right places that one would be hard-pressed to point out its flaws. In terms of storytelling, Bastion offers up a tale that will keep you engaged until the oh so sweet end. The gameplay is superb thanks in part to fluid combat and numerous customization options. The gorgeous hand-painted visuals make this game look like a painting that has come to life. Then there's the soundtrack. Ohhh the soundtrack. Be prepared to get lost in audio bliss. Perhaps the most unique and welcome touch is the ever-present narrator who guides you through your adventure. It's one thing for a game to have great aspects to it, but it means nothing if they don't meld. Bastion is a game with a number of wonderful elements, the sum of which, equals a cohesive whole that you absolutely must experience. Grab a drink and pull up a seat. It's time to play some Bastion.			"

												It's rare for me to play games of this type but I am extraordinarily glad that I took a chance with this one. From the beginning the beautiful visuals immerse you in a world that is both unique and wholly familiar; many games of this type exist but Bastion truly stands above the rest due to the unique concept of the platforming system and the art style. The narration provided by the gravelly-voiced Logan Cunningham made me press on even when I grew bored or disinterested.He's a serious talent in this arena.Gameplay was not overly challenging, although I admittedly did not complete all parts of the game, such as some of the Challenge Zones and the dream sequences. My goal was to see the main story through because it interested me, even if the twists and turns weren't all that surprising, it was compelling. Much has been said of the soundtrack but I'm still going to talk about how gorgeous Ashley Barret's vocals are, and how perfect Darren Kolb's guitar work and compositions were. Get this game, play it, and if you don't like it, please tell me why.			"

												Kid writes a review, and isn't too sure what to say. Ten outa ten, best game of the year, or a fine work of art, words of praise that's hollow with no real meaning. You could say this kid wants to write about the solid gameplay, engaging story, beautiful world, amazing soundtrack, and a fine narration. But the kid knows better... The game left him feeling satisfied in the end, no one can say he had a bad time. But all phrases and words just don't cut it for the Kid, so he'll leave it like this, Bastion made him happy like a Scumbag with a full stomach.			"

												When I first loaded the game, I was stunned - the game's art is just too captivating. I love how they made it look so gorgeous although the claim it's hand painted. The world is beautifully painted, the characters designs are cute and aptly made for the game, the animations are incredible. You owe your eyes to look at this game.Bastion is a story driven game with great art and legendary Narrator. Yes I said it - legendary. I really like how the Narrator performs, he actually narrates most if not all Kid's (our protagonist whom we control) actions. His deep voice brings a new gaming element for real. The story itself is one kind of common topic - to restore the 'world' that's been destroyed by the Calamity. The combinations between the narrator, game's art, narrator and OSTs, though, make it feel different.The OSTs themselves are ear-catching. Most platformer games I play I usually don't care about the OSTs, some even were so irritating I turned them off. In Bastion? I love every second the OST is played. Gameplay is a mix between RPG and platformer. You can actually assign weapons/shields/power ups, have potions and the pure hack and slash aspect. You can't hack and slash your way, though, since it requires more than that. Evasion and blocking skills are also essentials, some enemies you can't just pew pew. That said, playing with controller is recommended.For people who love challenge, Bastion has plentiful for you. Starting from Hard difficulty, to New Game+, to Idols. Idols is a feature in game that actually tamper the situations of your choosing. If you want more exp but harder enemies, there's one feature for you.Overall, the game's a bit short. Only 10 hours or so for normal to hard difficulty. For completionist it will take more hours. I'd love to get Bastion 2 to compensate this, but Bastion simply is a game that should end just there. You'll understand when you finish the game.For 80% off, this is a steal. Shame the OST isn't on sale also.			"

There is no way you wouldn't love it.Bastion is a beautiful game in which each element fits properly. The hack and slash gameplay is fun and amplified by leveling up your character, improving your weapons, and making the game harder through idols. There's so much to discover. The story is traditional stuff, but I was wrapped up in the experience from the main menu to the credits thanks to leaderboards, easy to navigate menus, and more.Just a beautiful world. The characters are detailed, the colors are rich, and the world forming underneath the kid's feet is a nice touch.The sound effects, the score, and the narrator (Cunningham's sensational debut role) are all excellent.The game after the first time tells you that there are still many things to do before you eventually turn it off.Try it for yourself and fall in love.

												Bastion is a truly fantastic game. This one had been on my radar for a while, and I was lucky enough to grab it at a discount. I have to say, though, that after playing it, it's worth every penny at full price. There's truly something for everyone here. It's got RPG elements, beautiful world design, post-apocalyptic storyline, hack and slash ""everything dies"" free-for-alls, weapon mechanics, challenging achievements, and an intriguing story with heavy moral choices along the way. The full controller support couldn't function any perfectly, and the graphics are astounding. The soundtrack is also excellent and seems to enhance the experience even more. Characters are multi-dimensional, and combat is dynamic. There's definite replayability here, as well as many challanging yet fun achievements.The Stranger is beyond a doubt my favorite character, and it seems that a lot of thought went into character development and world-building. It's a fantastical combination of old West and ethereal  fantasy realm. This looks like a game that was designed by gamers who just happen to know how to create video games. It's got so many wonderful elements strung together that it's very likely that the developers sat down to design and code a game that they themselves would enjoy playing. I have to say, they hit the ball way out of the park with Bastion.Without spoiling anything, I'll just add that a cerebral gamer will find other hidden gems in the storyline. I found myself speculating about time paradoxes, time travel, self-fulfilling prophecies, and the identity of The Stranger. I'm so fascinated with this game that I'm beginning my second playthrough now. I highly recommend it.			"

												Like, pretty much the best isometric, 2D game you are ever going to play in your life.I like it so much I cannot recommend this enough. If there was, like, a rating system, maybe one to one hundred, this game would be a solid 100/100. I'd boot Bastion up and play it every day all day if I could.This game is just incredibly good for an indie game. Most games you see with, like, a soundtrack, you might go ""ohh some guy thinks his music is good, ha ha"" no, this guy, Darren Korb, did something ridiculously cool with Bastion. The soundtrack is just so good. Every step of the way you'll be like oh my god I am so digging this music, even while platforms fall from the sky, or fall from under you.As indie games go, I don't usually say they are ever worth anything over $10. Bastion is the exception that proves me wrong. The, what, seven or so people who worked on Bastion have more than earned their chips (or whatever).It's better than Diablo III.It's so good.Get it, today.			"

												This is a must-play.Bastion is proof that you can have a fantastic plot without interfering with gameplay through such evils as cutscenes and noninteractive animation sequences. Brilliant voice acting, great music, and silky smooth gameplay which never gets interrupted to tell its gripping story. Not much replay value, but the time you spend in this world will be memorable.The game is an action RPG, where much of the combat focuses on dodging and target selection. Cooldowns are very short which makes combat feel more like a shooter since there is no need to memorize a rotation.Story is told via narration during gameplay.Subscribe to my curator page hereView my other reviews here "

Summary/ Overview     Bastion was published by Warner Brothers Interactive entertainment, a subdivision of Warner Brothers, Inc. developed by Supergiant Games, the studio also behind Transistor. Bastion is an action role-playing game with a ubiquitous narrator. You play as the Kid in Bastion who is given no specific name at all while you uncover what has happened to the Bastion after the calamity. The Bastion is the center marketplace you could say in the game that regenerates the life of the whole community. Through going back to the Bastion you can upgrade your weapons, skills; buy more idols through the lost-and-found, pay respects to the memorial of fallen people that have passed away through completing different tasks, switch out weapons in the arsenal and one of my favorite places to go, being the distillery where you can buy potions that give you statistic bonuses and added health, carrying capacity. Gameplay (Features, controls, graphics & mechanics)FeaturesLocations     There are many locations within the game and I want to touch briefly on a few. The few worth mentioning are The Wharf District, Trappers Shingle and the Hanging Gardens. These are among the first few districts you will visit when trying to collect cores. The cores are used in the Bastion, at the central monument in order to build add-ons to the Bastion since it got destroyed after the calamity. The Wharf district    You obtain your first main weapon, the breaker's bow, your first memento which are collectible items that either tell you some history about the culture or rather are commodities, fragments of materials that you need in order to craft weapon upgrades. You will learn your first special move and the basics in this area. The first special move is a whirlwind which you use with your basic weapon you start out with called the crael hammer. You are thrown immediately into the action as the story starts wherein the main character, Kid, has no idea how he got here through the Bastion, the safe haven and shelter of the town. The rippling walls remains transversed as you walk. Once you start walking forward down a certain particular path, the path expands as you walk. You learn that the calamity has happened and currently search to see if anyone else except you survived the calamity. If you are the only one that survived the calamity, then why did all the other cultures and races of people get wiped out? Trappers Shingle    Trappers Shingle is a very dangerous place in the game but the most unique. You have to run from the start to the finish of the whole area while watching platforms crumbling below your very feet. You need to hit targets on the sides before you proceed since everything has basically been tripwired in order to make you fall to your inevitable death. Good luck! You do receive a prize for your efforts based on how quickly you make it to the end. This is all dependent upon the time it takes you as well as any penalties in case you fall off the map. The Hanging Gardens     The Hanging Gardens is a place that honors the dearly departed, those that have died in the calamity. You meet a strange man named Zulf while everyone else is frozen in time, so frozen you can actually hit them and they disintegrate. Zulf is quite the character that later destroys the Bastion once again making your life hard after the calamity. Why is everyone frozen, does Zulf have special powers or rather has this dystopian alternate universe been created because of the after effects of the calamity putting a curse on the towns and all the people in it? You will have to play along to find out the final answer as the story progresses.Fully Destructible Environment    Everything in the game from pillars, pieces of walls, crates, barrels and enemies can be destroyed. You only get experience points for destroying enemies and boxes.Unique, Dismal, Comical Narration    I will be honest with you on this one, I am not a fan of the narration throughout the whole game. The narrator's tone and voice distracts too much away from the nice music and enemy encounters, lush environments.Water-colored, Hand-Painted, Crafted Environments    All in all, the art style is unique and does a good job attesting to the fact that video games are inspired art made for a manifest and also a latent function.Experience Points/ Skill Based System    It has an experience point system which you get by destroying objects and enemiesControls    Controls are very well done. I recommend using a controller since it feels most comfortable Pros & ConsPros•Nice artwork within the game's environment with solid graphics all around•Polished enemy variety with unique moves and abilities•Engaging story and premise of a world fallen and cursed through a time period known as the calamity•Fully destructible environments that oscillate location to location•Fun and relaxing to play•Great boss battlesCons•Narration is ok in my personal opinion, but it personally is just not my styleOverall- 8     Highly rated and recommended because it really is an amazing game that is worth all of your time and effort. Warner Brothers Interactive make some of the best games that I like to date.

												Bastion isn't a game. Bastion is an experience. The gritty overtone of a man who sounds like he dragged his last from one too many cigarettes, tossed in with jaw droping visuals straight from a trip, combined with solid gameplay. You found a hammer? You get to hit things with it. Found a bow? Draw it back and let lose, kiddo.Bastion is a game where simplicity matters. The simple yet engaging and often challenging combat will leave you wanting more, the few drips of story keeping you interested while the narration and art style buy you in farther. I'll say it again:Bastion isn't a game. Bastion is an experience.			"

												The game is one of a kind. I would say however, to make sure you have a gamepad if you plan on playing, it works really well and I'd imagine it just wouldn't be the same with keyboard; pretty sure it was designed to be used with a gamepad.The game is definitely high quality, so whether it's worth it really comes down to price while considering the length of the game. I'd say if you can get it for under $5, it's a must have. If you only have the option to buy at the full price of $15, it's harder for me to recommend, but only because the game is quite short. Consider the game will probably last you 6-7 hours for a main story playthrough.Keep an eye out because the game goes on sale every now and then and it has also been on humble bundle before.			"

												Bastion is a 2D, WASD controlled with mouse aim game, where you play as a ""Kid"". The story gameplay (without going for achievements, and side-stuff of the game like challenges) it takes about 6 hours to play the game. Even though it seems like there are only 2 diffuculties, throughout the game, you can add some spice by some choices inside the game, even though it's not compulsory. Level design is well crafted, it can be a fun challange for hard players, yet can also be and easy journey for casuals. PROS:- Easy to adapt gameplay - Tutorials are just in place, you don't really go wondering, ""Oh what's this?""- Story is amazing. - COLOURS <3- For someone who doesn't really care if about the OST's (of games) this will be the first time that I'm going to listen over and over and over probably. Sounds, Narration, OST's are just tearjerkes.CONS: - Not really to be honest. Maybe narration thing is not for everyone, but for me, it really is a different and a nice touch for the game overall. You must really have some specific taste in games to not like this game.Overall, Bastion is a beautifully crafted, cute but deep, a lovely game, that you can actually be challanged to do some stuff. I actually feel like standing up and applauding the developers.			"

												Bastion is an action RPG game played in an isometric view were you play this character named Kid.The world you play in is in ruins after the so caled Calamity. Its your job to put the world together. To do this you have to explore and gather pieces named Cores. Along the way you will find new characters, weapons, scenarios and a lot more.The world of Bastion is amazing. It looks like an alive oil painting with fluid movements in it.If you are like me and care about the soundtrack of a game, prepare to be amazed. The sound track of this game is quality in person and very well paced. You have your ""sad songs"" and ""happy songs"" in the right time, at the right place.Another amazing aspect is the narration. It follows your actions along your journey, if you for example fall down a hole you can be sure that the narrator will tell a little joke about it. The use of a gun, an item, the path you take, all have a narration. The voice acting is suberb and the tone of the voice beautiful. All of this makes your experience and imersion even better.Bastion is one of those games that shouts: hey you don't need fancy graphics, complex storylines or explosive soundtracks to create an engaging and fun game. And they are right.Positive- Amazing artwork and graphics- Original and engaging narrative- Beautiful soundtrackNegative- Too short (about 8 hours)- Low replay value			"

												Bastion is a polarizing game. Basically, I feel confident in saying you will either love this game to bits and find yourself writing essays about how brilliant and deep and awesome this game really is, or find it one of the most obscenely, dangerously overrated, yet pretty good-looking and fine-sounding, piece of pretentious indie [you know that word] you'll ever play.Luckily for you, Oh Revered Prospective Buyer, you don't need to rely on the confusing cacophony of opinions of other people to figure out which camp you'll find yourself in in. Like, don't like, and wait... why? For, you see, O Might One, this game is endowed with the Mystical Power of The Demo.Demos are strange beasts and too often misleading ones as well, willfully tricking the Player. But this will not be the case for Bastion: you will either think this game has the most boring minute-to-minute gameplay experience of the isometric action RPGs you ever had the terrible misfortune to play, or that it'll be to you about as good an invention as The Revered Sliced Bread, maybe even a slice better.It doesn't matter which button I'm going to press when I am done writing, because obviously the majority thinks I'm the minority and thus this one single vote is simply a drop in the ocean and won't matter one single bit. That is fine and dandy as it gives me a chance to be completely honest without incurring in any unwarranted backlash, isn't that true Almighty Community?You won't downvote this <cough>review, because while I almost dread every single hour I spent on it (, I'm still encouraging people to be open minded instead of trusting my judgment blindly, as it were The Word, and try the demo for themselves. Which you should really do: you have very little to lose and much to gain.			"

Visually stunning, deeply engaging narrative, bowstring tight controls, and one of the most poignant soundtracks I have ever heard in a game.

												Bastion is one of my all-time favourite games. You play as The Kid, a survivor of a terrible conflict, who has the sole responsibility of trying to piece his world back together, amongst the debris of those who are no longer with him.It's difficult to know where to start, as so many aspects of this game blew me away. First of all, the narrator, Logan Cunningham, makes a groundbreaking debut as the voice of ""the Narrator"", perfectly capturing the ambience and style of the game, improving it ten fold.Next, the soundtrack. It is actually amazing. It won both Best Original Score and Best Song in a Game (Build That Wall) at the Spike VGAs, which should highlight just how good it is.The gameplay is fun and complex, and after I completed the story (roughly 15 hours I think), I found the extra levels huge fun, taking my full-played time with all 10-idol dreams completed to 26 hours.Buy this game. If you own it, play it. You will not be disappointed. Highly, highly recommended.-Nilesy			"

												First of all, I think ""The Bastion"" sounds better than ""Bastion"" , with that being said, lets get into the review.The game begins with the protagonist ""The Kid"" waking up from his sleep on his floating bed/home place while ""The Calamity"" has wreaked havoc in ""Caelondia"". The game doesnt use dialogue instead it relies on narration so there's that.And the game plays from a top-down perspective, so if you dont like that, i guess this one's not for you.Graphics : I like the art-style of the game, but I think its subjective and depends on your taste. I also like how all the land-pieces pop-up like some fog-of-war mechanic from strategy games. I guess it adds a certain kind of surprise value to the levels.Gameplay : The gameplay is this game's best aspect. The weapon variety is brilliant and all of the weapons actually feel unique (Breaker Bow FTW). The upgrading system is pretty standard and nothing significant. I also really liked the proving ground challenges (they are these levels where your proficiency with a particular weapon is tested). Another thing I'd like to add here is that, the upgrade points in this game, i.e, Fragments, are actually pieces of the Bastion before The Calamity, so this means that when you destroy like pots and stuff, it actually makes sense that they give Fragments. I mean, its not anything great, but just a simple observation. Rest of the stuff is pretty standard and that's that.Story : The story is actually good, but I feel like they still didn't explain it well enough (It might just be me because I'm kinda slow at picking this stuff up, but still I stand by my view). The ending (or rather endings) were ♥♥♥♥ing awesometacular (its an RPG, so expect multiple endings), they were well thought-out and it feels like there is no right choice, both of them end up in the morally grey area, like how Mark Of The Ninja's ending was and that IMO is fantastic. The narration aspect works really well in the majority of the game, but sometimes it feels like dialogue would've been better. There's enough backstory to provide good character depth and to understand each of the character's motivations. (Sorry if there were any spoilers)Soundtrack : The soundtrack is very good but at times it feels a bit under-used. For the most part of the game, there's only ambient music in the background which although is good, gets boring after a while. There is some really good music in this game, but it only ""appears"" at a few places throughout the entire course of the game, which I think is diappointing, but still the soundtack is a pro first and con later.Voice Acting : There is only one voice actor to judge in this game, i.e, The Narrator/Rucks and he is awesome. That more than sums up his work.All in all, this game is not a must-get, but most definitely worth-it. And its often on sale, so pick it up then.Rating : I'd rate this one 8 Squirts out of a possible 10Final Word : Scumbags. Them damn Scumbags.(I used way too many quotes, didnt I? )			"

Lots of levels for a smaller budget game, many cool unique weapons you can use, upgreades you can buy and runes that will make the game more challanging, but at the same time it will reward you. High replay value, due to the upgreade system... What can I say more? + Loot, upgreade and runes that modify the gameplay.- A little bit too linear.Yep buy it if you into Indie games, and with a discount it is even more worth it!!			"

												Bastion is a narrative-driven beat-em-up that will have you giggling in awe like a front-row Justin Bieber-fangirl quenching on his saliva-shower.The mechanics are easy to learn, the weapons provide a lot of variety as you unlock them througout the campaign. There is a lot to discover on the worldmap, though the linear story encourages blazing through the game The graphic style is easy to interpret but the fixed isometric view makes for some awkward camera angles in some maps.The soundtrack accurately switches the mood from 'solitary sorrow' to 'button-mash till literally everything is destroyed'There are really two reasons to buy Bastion, both of which are extremely valid. One: The narrator sounds like Morgan Freeman Radio FM!Two: You feel the urge to purge hunderds of weird-♥♥♥ monster hordes.			"

												So, for some reason, this game sat in my backlog for a long while, which was basically a terrible thing considering how much awesome this game had to offer. Anyway, I played through it today, and I can confirm what a lot of people have already said repeatedly....THIS GAME WAS AMAZING!Seriously, the gameplay was flawless, the upgrade system worked beautifully, the artwork was incredible, the idea of the road crafting just ahead of you with on the spot narration from the equally amazing Logan Cunningham, the amazing soundtrack....pretty much everything about this game was superior to 99% of the other games out there. An absolute must own and must play.The ending had a surprisingly difficult choice to make. Which brings to light just how effective the story and storytelling was leading up to that point. You actually care about the world and dont want to make the wrong choice. That said, I'll probably play NG+ and go with the other ending so I can play to both conclusions.10 out of 10			"

												For those pondering - this is like Zelda for PC, though its original and enjoyable even for mature audience.Probably one of the few RPG one might care to play twice or thrice (not only on Steam).If you don't have it, get it!  - Eye pleasing colors and art- Fantastic soundtrack- entertaining gameplay- Awesomestory - Replay value - on of the best A-RPG for PC ** (that will leave you with fond memories much like the well known Zelda-Series) "

												Bastion is a really cool action game with some amazing environments, an excellent soundtrack, and a mysterious, but ever-so-intriguing narrator. You play as a boy simply known as ""The Kid."" who lives in the world of Bastion, which had suddenly suffered a catastrophic event only known as ""The Calamity."" Not much is known about The Kid, at first, but later on in the game, you'll be able to access an area where your backstory can be heard and explained.In the world of Bastion, during The Calamity, the world started drifting apart, and islands started breaking up.Suddenly, monsters started to attack these various islands, and every single person in the game's world has been turned to stone... or is everyone? In Bastion, the ground comes up under The Kid's steps, or at least, the land that remains. You must visit these broken-up islands, eliminate the enemies that attack you, and collect shards of power, so that you can provide power to a large structure called ""The Bastion,"" which becomes your player's home base. It also becomes the only safe haven, and the player's space for new buildings that can be built, which allow many different bonuses, utilities, and can provide different challenges.The game's currency, fragments, can be used to purchase upgrades, make buildings, and improve weapons. Gaining experience also boosts the player's stats and gives them more health. Throughout the game, there are various weapons that you can collect, although you can only have two equipped at a time. You can also equip a special attack, and there are quite a few different types in the game. Enemies drop potions, that, when drunk, can restore some health or give you the special items needed in order for you to use your special attack moves. In order to change your weapons, you must use an arsenal at The Bastion.The environments in Bastion are very nicely made and quite unique. Each one has a different look and feel to it, as well as different enemies. You'll often find structures and ruins, and places where life suddenly stopped; when The Calamity hit. You will come across many fun and challenging areas, as well as challenges that reward you with EXP and with other items.Bastion's soundtrack, written by Darren Korb, is stellar. It's very fitting to the game, and very immersive. It's got its own unique style, and it's energetic, Western, and they've got some really catchy beats along with those awesome acoustic and folk-type songs, some of them with a vintage but breakbeat theme.In the game, you will meet some new characters as well, but I will not spoil anything about them in this review. Their personalities are quite varied, just as the landscapes in Bastion.I would recommend Bastion to anyone who loves action games with fun combat and with a really cool story! ^.^			"

												Maaaan, how come It took me over 5 years to find this piece of art in Steam Store? Oh well, alright, I'm getting to the review:Story:I do want to avoid spoiling anything, so I'll just leave a little bit of that here.You play as a character that is being refered to as ""The Kid"", setting off on a journey to redo some things the calamity that hit your world has taken away. The whole story is being told throughout the game as you advance further.Gameplay:You move with the Kid throughout the levels as in the any other game, WASD keys, the levels are platforms set up in middle of nowhere, just high up in the sky most of the time. The platforms automatically build themselves infront of you when you get close. The combat system is what is really shining in this game, most of the weapons are equally powerful, there is not one being largely stronger than another, and you can wield 2 weapons at once. One weapon's attacks done by mouse 1, and the other's by mouse 2. Apart from that you can also use your special abilities, such as being able to go invisible, to throw a grenade, to shield yourself and deflect the damage...Bastion is a 3rd person RPG that comes in with fighting some monsters, the monsters have various kinds of abilities and weaknesses, so a different weapon might come in handy against each of them.There are 3 modes you can play at the beginning of the game, easy, normal, and no-sweat mode. Easy is easy, normal is normal, no-sweat makes you unable to die in the game, being infinitely able to stand back on your feet when you're defeated, I guess that's something for those that just want to play for the story.There is a leveling system, allowing you to reach up to level 10. Each level unlocks you a new distillery slots, you can fill those slots with various brews that will give you buffs in the fights such as mitigating the damage you take by 15%, being able to carry 2 extra healing potions, guaranteed critical hits when your HP is less than 33% and so on.You can also upgrade your weapons if you gain enough crystals that are gained from completing various quests, defeating enemies, or just breaking stuff around the map. You also need special forge materials that you can find across maps, buy for crystals in lost and found building, or gain in training grounds where you're supposed to see how good you are using that specific weapon you'd want to upgrade.You can also activate some blessings of the in-game's gods in a place called shrine... You thought blessings would make you stronger? Wrong! Although you get extra crystal drop rates from every blessing (there are 10 blessings that you can have all active at once), your enemies also become stronger. They can get buffs like health regeneration base on the blessings you activate. The shrine is not there to help you, as the game without the blessings is quite easy. It is there to make the game more challenging/fun for you.Game's art:The graphics are well-made and fitting the game, there's nothing much to say about it. Visually, the game is doing right what it is supposed to do. And yet, even a rusty graphics card like mine can run the game without issues.Bastion's music is a music that no other recent game has, although some of the tunes reminded me of Rayman 2 and similar older games a little, it still is different. I know many games like Bastion have great soundtracks, but this one is really compared to those other games.But there's something else, that is abnormally good, and I've never experienced something this good at any kind of game before. The narration. The voice was really appealing to me.Summary:Pros-Great, addictive story. Makes you want to finish the game on one playthrough.-Perfect combat system-Great graphics, yet even an old GPU can run the game with no trouble-Idea of how the game's terrain is presented is amazing-Best narrations I've ever seen in a game-Amazing music-Has a difficulty allowing you to play the game just for the story-On the normal difficulty, with all the shrine idols involved, trying to complete everything in the game (achievements included), I can certify you'll have over 10 hours of fun.Cons-Literally nothing, unable to think of anyMy final words:I've bought the game for 2.99€ when it was on discount, and although I wanted to spend them on something else, I do not regret I did not do that. I'm pretty sure I've already expressed how much I love the game above in the review, so I don't think continuing to compliment it is neccessary. If you're fan of this kind of games, I don't think there's any need to hesitate about buying Bastion, especially if the game is on discount.			"

												I hope that many years from now Bastion is remembered as the quintessential retro game of the downloadable era. Too many game developers have settled to plagiarizing outdated game mechanics, putting the end product through a pixelated filter and justify a frustrating experience by calling it ""Nintendo hard"" to gain that somehow glorified honor of being called ""retro"". Well I'm old enough to have lived throughout that period and wise enough not to glorify it through rose-tinted glasses. I also remember the sense of discovery that came from trying out new weapons and destroying everything, so I'm glad to say Supergiant Games has well understood that concept while making Bastion!The setting behind the story could best be described as ""Frontier Fantasy"" with your analogs to pioneers, marshals, mines full of mystic crystal cores and dispossessed natives undercutting your mission to rebuild the Bastion, aka humanity's last refuge. You'll read a lot about this game's very own narrator whose grizzled voice is there to give your actions a certain gravitas. It works, but having him be the sole source of exposition makes it near impossible to connect with anything else! You barely interact with anyone and if you do talk to other characters, the narrator tells you what they say! A whole universe experienced through the pinhole of one old man's words, that's what Bastion is!The world itself could best be described as an isometric sky platform badly in need of handrails. Forget pixels, this is all hand-drawn art with individual sprites and the result is a full and vibrant environment with a diverse menagerie of monsters, each with their own characteristics, some even with their own backstory! In an age of heavily processed animations, still having hand drawn graphics is the most retro thing there is!The actual fun in the gameplay comes from trying to find the right combination of two weapons with which to face the dangers ahead. You build quite the arsenal throughout your journey and each weapon has its own skill tree in which thankfully, you can change your decisions if you're unhappy or just feeling experimental. This is important because you'll soon come across a variety of binary needs, most of which aren't readily evident. I mean, you can understand quick & short-ranged vs slow & long-ranged but soon comes factors such as spread damage, weapon stun, poison vs direct damage, the issue of armor penetration and so forth. Needless to say, every weapon is unique and it's the combination thereof that makes the gameplay so engaging.Much appreciated are the training camps for each and every weapon along with the dream sequences which just has the Kid fight wave after wave of enemies. They're supplemental, optional and a great way to acclimate yourself with the new toy you just discovered in that one stage. I also liked the timed shield reflect mechanic which might be overpowered since it also reverses melee attacks. You also have access to about thirty Secret Skills, super moves for all of your weapons; however since they are all activated by collectable Black Tonics these all turn into so many different ways to press an emergency ""SAVE ME"" button.There's A LOT of exposition dump concentrated early on but I'd say that the game really picks up after finding your third or fourth Bastion shard and opening the Forge which allows you to start customizing weapons. There's a self-awareness in that the game realizes all that it wants to accomplish but still attempts to be as accessible as possible; heck, even the difficulty system works on an individual monster upgrade system, though one that is non-essential towards the story. Bastion is this most ambitious of undertakings but still provides gameplay relatable to a child. A rare gem that should truly be enjoyed by all.			"

												Bastion is a very unique game. The story line is extremely captivating, and it's easily one of the aspects I love most in this game.  The biggest thing that kept me playing this game was wanting to find out what happened next (I'm a huge story fan - A game with a good story is a game that I finished with love). The gameplay in this game is also something I haven't experienced before. The combat is very interesting, and there are a lot of small details in this game that I took for granted when I started playing this game (the automatic targeting system helps a lot more than I thought :p). The Bastion area in the game is also new to me. Various buildings, all with unique purposes that all work together to make the gameplay more fun and interesting, and are all beneficial in their own special way. My favourite one easily being the Distillery, because I like being able to customize the bonuses I get for each level at any time, and always being able to unlock more and become even more powerful.I really enjoyed being able to upgrade my weapons, and then choose from a pair of upgrades that you can go with. Differently from most games, you don't have to pick your way through an entire skill tree to get to cool abilities, and you also have the option of easily changing what you picked at any time. Though the normal skill tree is fun, and can easily change how you play a game, I always found it difficult to decide which tree to go with and worried about picking the one that I wouldn't like. What if I don't like freezing enemies, and I would rather burn them? What I like about this game is that you can easily switch between the weapon upgrade that you want to use. It may not affect gameplay as much, but I still found this to be more enjoyable.Something I think this game lacks is replayability. When I first completed the game, I figured I would start again and continue trying to improve my character. I did it for a little while, and restarted the story, but it just didn't have the same effect. It wasn't quite the same after the first playthrough. It didn't have anything new, even in the new gametypes you unlock that allow you to continue with all your old gear. Another issue is that at that point, the game is pretty easy. You have all the best weapons, all with really good bonuses, and the difficulty is barely increased. It's possible that it gets more difficult farther in, because I didn't get far before I stopped the replay of the game.*WARNING* WEAPON SPOILERS IN FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHAnother aspect I don't like about this game is that certain weapons are far better than others. I always found the fang repeater and the duel wielded guns (that I don't remember the name of) to be completely useless, having never used them outside of the practice zone for those weapons. For long range weapons, I used the bow until I got the Galleon cannon thing (that I also don't remember the proper name of) and then I used the calamity cannon once I got that. I never really had the need for anything else.I also never used the skill associated with Q. It could be just me, but I was never particularly aware of it's existence and the only time I really used it was the occasional fight where that's what you were supposed to do. There's no particular emphasis to remind you to use it other than the constant finding of new abilities (which also never gives you the chance to use the old ones if you're like me), and there is no need to use it as I got through the game without too much trouble not using the Q skill.I think the usage of Shrine Idols rather than an actual automatic difficulty increase is interesting, but I also never wanted to do it. I prefer a simple switch from Normal to Hard, rather than having to activate shrine idols and worry about which ones seem harder than others. This is probably just a personal thing, but the Shrine is always a building I avoided.Overall, I don't think the game is worth $15. I wouldn't want to pay more than $7 for a game that I'm going to play less than 10 hours of, but when this game goes on sale (it seems to have some pretty big sales when it goes on sale too), I hope it gets into your Steam Library because you won't regret playing through this epic adventure.

The gameplay is pretty good - you just gotta find the right tools for you.I personally prefer to use a controller, as with games like these it just feels the most natural to me. But PC controls are actually, after further testing *cough*, surprisingly strong standing on their own.The story - narration is top notch, but may not be for all.The soundtrack is amazing, and is some of the best I've heard since Undertale.It definitely surprised me, and I can't wait for more games from these developers.

												This is not a bad game. But I've owned it for over 2 years and have tried picking it up on several different occasions only to never completely get into it. I don't feel very attached to the characters and story. It's all extremely vague, which can make some games fun because you get curious and want to explore more and play more. But if it wasn't for the narrator talking into my ear there would be no story. His voice is everything... and I kind of don't like that.The gameplay felt really tight. The weapons can be somewhat interesting when you combine them with different power ups. I probably should have set my game on a harder difficulty because I found no challenge to it, but that's my own fault. I used the keyboard. The artwork is swell. I never fell in love with the music, although it is ever-present and perfectly fitting. The enemies are cool but kind of repetitive. I think that's about it. There's really nothing that stands out wrong with the game in my opinion, except for the story resting so highly on one overdramatic voice, even though that's the part everyone raves about. And to me, if you have a problem with the story then you have a problem with the game because the story is one of the biggest reasons why I'd ever even play a single-player game.I believe that I now realize what my other main issue is. I said ""there's really nothing wrong with the game"", but there's also nothing that special about it either. You strip away the artwork and the [annoying] narrator and it's just some run-of-the-mill barebones top down ""twin-stick shooter"", as someone in my comments had said. Twin-stick shooter. That genre might still be fresh enough for many people but for someone like me gaming into their late 20's who has already played quite a bit of those it doesn't do enough for me. Bastion is just not for me I suppose.			"

Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingOverall GameBastion is a wonderful game.  The art is beautiful and the storyline is just enough for an indie game to bring you back.  For the game itself, I give it a 9/10 - I fell in love with it and, although it's short, it is an experience not often found in games these days.GameplayAs far as gameplay, major events do not seem to require sound.  Almost everything happens on screen and has a screen shaking effect for important events, whether on or off screen.For gameplay accessibility, I give it 10/10 - the game can be played to completion without or with limited sound.Subtitles/TextBastion is fully captioned, but can be confusing about who is talking at first.  There is a narrator that speaks during the gameplay.  It's not essential information for the game, but it does add to the story.For subtitles, I give it 8/10.  It was hard to figure out who was talking at first until I saw the character/narrator much later.Chatting/CommunicatingBastion is single player only.  No rating.Overall AccessibilityThe game's visual signals for events and full captions make it fully accessible for deaf/hoh gamers.  Hearing players frequently comment on the amazing soundtrack associated with the game that plays during gameplay and ties in with the story.  If you're hoh, you may still be able to enjoy some of the tracks.  Otherwise, no vital information is solely passed through sound.Overall, 9/10 for this amazing indie action/RPG game.			"

												Bastion proved to be an amazing, unforgettable adventure, and I will undoubtedly return to this world often.Everything about this game is beatuiful, even breathtaking; painstakingly detailed graphics, soulful music and songs. Grand, moving tale of Calamity upon Caeldonia and Ura, and of it survivors. One of the best Bastion's aspects, however, is the narration - you've never heard a better in-game narrator than our good, ol' Stranger, I can assure you.Actual gameplay is pleasant, although bit hard at some moments; luckily there is an option of adjusting difficulty. Challenges are in my opinion really quite challenging, too, elongating time spent in game.I recommend Bastion wholeheartedly - it's honestly one of the best games I've ever seen :)			"

												No doubt Bastion has its share of flaws, but in the end the good far outweighs the bad and it's definitely deserving of a playthrough by just about everyone. The gameplay, the art direction, the music and sound are all excellent, but there are just a few nagging bits that dragged it down for me personally. It's best to start out with the art and the narration, as those are Bastion's immediate appeals. The art, as you know if you've seen any video or screenshots, is amazing. The hand drawn backgrounds appear before you as you traverse the level including plenty of destructible objects that can be bashed in for fragments of the old world, the currency in the game. The overall motif of the game is a sort of exotic, alien western populated by no shortage of bizarre creatures native to Caelondia such as Anklegators, Squirts, Rattletails, Lunkheads and more, but each level introduces new environments that always keep the game feeling fresh and making the player feel like they are progressing through this world. At some points it was difficult to tell what was destructible and what wasn't, and I ended up falling off the map a few times because I wasn't able to tell where the physical ground stopped and the background art began, but it's hardly worth mentioning. You gain a sixth sense for that sort of thing as the game goes on and it happens less and less. Another big appeal for this game was the ""interactive"" narration, and while it is charming every time you see it happen, it's utilized far less than I was expecting. It's funny to hear him say ""The Kid just rages for a bit"" when you begin smashing objects left and right, or ""It's easy to lose your way in the Wilds"" when you retread old ground in a level, but I can count on one hand the number of times I noticed a direct relation to what was being narrated and what I was doing, which is a real shame. I went into the game thinking this was going to be a major part of the game, but it happens less and less as you go on. Perhaps it's because the developers didn't want the tongue-in-cheek narrator stepping on the toes of the increasingly dark and serious storyline of the game, but either way I wish there was more of the narrator-player interaction.The gameplay is traditional hack and slash with counters, special attacks, customizable perks in the way of liquors you can equip, and plenty of upgradeable weapons to choose from (perhaps too many upgradeable weapons, I'll touch on that in a bit). The game has a varied collection of enemies for you to fight, each with their own strategies, strengths and weaknesses. Anklegators (Essentially a land narwhal that pursues the player underground until it's ready to strike) need to be lured out into the open before being attacked, but what happens when the game pits one of these at you in addition to a Lunkhead (Leaping armored frogs that must be attacked from behind) and a few Pincushions (immobile plants that shoot thorns at the player in a continuous stream) all at the same time? The player must use their loadout that they've customized, their evasive and defensive manuevers, and decide how they're going to complete the encounter, which almost always proves to be tricky and fun. Back at the Bastion, the level hub and also the main plot device of the game, players can use their Cores they've gained in the levels to populate the area with helpful structures, and Shards let the player upgrade those structures even further. The distillery let's players customize which liquors they want to equip which grant bonuses such as more health or a higher critical chance all the way to more loadout-specific benefits such as a higher counter-attack damage and doing more damage when falling on enemies. The Arsenal let's players customize which weapons and special attack they want to bring into battle, and the Forge let's them use upgrade materials they've found or purchased in the world to further enhance their effectiveness. One great thing about Bastion is that it doesn't limit what combination of weapons you can equip. Where most games would require you to have one melee and one ranged weapon, you can equip any combination in Bastion and it really makes you feel like you can take on the game however you want. The Lost and Found let's players use their fragments gained in the world to purchase upgrade materials, special attacks, and unique liquors that can't be found anywhere else, and the Memorial presents a number of goals that the player can attempt which will reward them with more fragments. The Shrine is my by far my favorite structure in Bastion. It gives the players a number of optional difficulty modifiers (similar to skulls in Halo) which reward those brave enough to activate them with substantial experience boosts throughout the game. Activate more than one and the rewards can be quite steep, granting the player up to 75% more experience, but also making the game much more difficult and in some cases even bizarre and unpredictable. While I love the modifiers such as those that slow the player when getting hit or make enemies drop grenades when defeated which let you scale the difficulty of what some might call a rather easy game for veterans of the genre to something more challenging, some just seem tedious and poorly thought out. One modifier randomly deflects attacks, and another causes enemies to become immune to attacks for a time. These don't make the game harder or the fights even necessarily more interesting, they just become longer and more frustrating. All the modifiers are optional however, so I suppose this is more of a nitpick than a significant complaint. What IS a significant complaint, perhaps only for me personally, is the frequency of which you get new weapons. If I remember correctly, you get a new weapon almost EVERY SINGLE LEVEL, excluding optional weapon challenges you can choose to play on the map screen. Not only that, but most of these levels are designed around using that particular weapon, and only rarely do the developers give you an arsenal mid level to allow you to switch back to your previous weapon if you don't want to use the level-specific item. It begs the question, what is the point of upgrading your items, customizing your loadout with special attacks and liquors, and creating a battle plan if the game is going to force you to use a new weapon (which you haven't had time to upgrade) every level? I get what they were trying to do. They want you to mix up your strategies on the fly, adapt to everything they throw at you, but a new weapon every single level? I don't get a chance to appreciate any of these weapons if you stick a new one in my hands EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. Some players might like this aspect so this point is largely a personal complaint, but it certainly feels like the game is undermining itself by giving the player all these tools to customize their playstyle and then ripping a whole through them at the beginning of every new stage. I also have to mention that many of your special attacks are tied to your weapon, so if you pick up a new weapon that takes the place of the weapon tied to your special attack, woops, I guess you get no special attack that level. Thankfully the music is amazing. It's a mix of instrumental western tunes, some arabian sounding themes, and even a few voiced songs by the characters' voiceactors. It's a good variety and a few even became stuck in my head. The story is somber and at times vague, but even though most won't remember Bastion for its story it does a good job of keeping the player's interest and making you eager to find out how it will all shake out. Bastion has its flaws, but at the end of the day it's still a fun game. It's been in a million bundles and it goes on sale for only a few bucks, so there's really no excuse to not at least give it a shot, and if you're one of those who have it sitting in your library for a rainy day like I did, give it a try, it's worth it.

												A lovely game with amazing visuals, design and artwork. It's all about the white-haired kid, a bastion and a destructed world. The levels are interesting and invite to explore, there are many different weapons and special skills for our 'lil kid and it has a lot of replay value due to a ng+, a score system and two different endings. All in all it's a great little action-rpg with an easy but well done fighting system, a catchy story and some of the best soundtracks and voice actings I've ever heard in a videogame (seriously the narrator voice is brilliant!) - it can definitely be recommended without hesitation! The art, the style, the narrator voice and soundtrack in combination ... let's describe it with an ingame quote: ""OK, now that's just plain overkill. I mean, come on.""  "

												Wspaniała gra. Pozycja obowiązkowa dla fanów gier RPG. Świetna fabuła, świetna muzyka i piękna rysunkowa grafika.Elementy gry związane z rozwojem postaci czy rozwojem broni nie są zbytnio rozbudowane, ale wystarczą by trochę pokombinować. Dodatkowo są do dyspozycji poligony, gdzie można ćwiczyć posługiwanie się broniami, oraz mapy, na których do pokonania jest kilka fal wrogów.Po ukończeniu gry można zagrać ponownie w trybie ""plus"" z całym zdobytym ekwipunkiem i doświadczeniem.Polecam. Trzeba zagrać.Amazing game. Definitely a must for RPG fans. Great storyline, superb music and beautiful cartoon graphics. Game elements associated with the character development or the weapons development are not very extensive, but they are enough to combine a bit. In addition, we can find many Proving Grounds where we are able to practice weapon skills. Another good addition are maps on which our goal is to defeat several waves of enemies. After completing the game we can play again in the ""plus"" mode keeping our equipment and experience.I recommend Bastion. You just have to play it.			"

												You can make a game with great mechanics or visuals or sounds or plot and it will still be just a game. By combining all of those in harmony in tight package you make an art. But if you go further and make all of those aspects shiny, neat and interesting - you will create a masterpiece. Such as Bastion.Unique, pleasant visuals. Memorable and solemn soundtrack. Nicely chosen narrator voice actor. Great, interesting plot with twists here and there. You will even have a moral choice. Smooth and fluid controls. More than that - the game isn't 50 hours long, its mostly concentrated fun. Leaves you wishing more yet satisfied with what you had..Overall: Quite a rare gem, must buy.			"

												A nice narrative-driven action RPG with very beautiful and colourful visuals. Bastion has you visit different stages in a quest for collectible items to help you restore the hub area (called The Bastion), which is a small flying fortress.The gameplay is similar to most other isometric action RPGs with hack and slash elements. There is a variety of enemies, weapons, and special skills. The game offers a nice hub area management, so you get to see it improving with each mission you. You raise important buildings, such as the forge, distillery, etc, which allow you to upgrade your weapons, buy stuff, accomplish memorial challenges, and even activate shrines of peculiar deities that make enemies stronger in exchange for earning you more of the game's currency with each kill. In addition to regular missions, there are also proving grounds associated with each weapon you find. These proving grounds provide you with unique challenges, and depending on how well you do, you get a prize. Each weapon's challenge is different. For example, the hammer's challenge requires you to smash 100 objects as fast as possible, whereas bow's challenges requires you to destroy all targets in as few shots as possible, and so on.I liked the variety of weapons the game had. It diversified the gameplay and allowed you to choose your preferred playstyle since each weapon acts differently and is useful in different situations (I personally enjoyed destroying things with a Galleon Mortar). For an action hack and slash game, it has a fairly good story. Don't expect something super tense and immersive, but you can be sure that you won't just be going from area to area with no goal. The narrator who speaks whilst you're out adventuring is also fun to listen to (and in my opinion way better than in Supergiant Games' other title Transistor).Overall it's been a fun game to get through. The presence of a couple of story choices in the final mission seemed a bit strange, since the rest of the game didn't have those, so this addition seemed a bit off, and some parts of the game could feel a tad repetitive, but otherwise there's nothing much to complain about.

			Bastion is a Narration heavy hack and slash game available on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/107100/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing:...		

Bastion is a narrational led hack and slash game.  It runs smoothly,and offers leaderboards for those that enjoy them.  The music is wonderful,professionally done and really complementary to the combat and actions ofthe game, as is the voice acting.The story is based around surviving an apocalypse, and bringingthe other characters together.  The story reacts to your actions, whichmakes the player feel like they are actually making a difference.The game offers several different options for tailor making thedifficulty of gameplay, which can be changed in game.   Increasingdifficulty will allow the player to level up faster, but the game doesget harder with options such as the relic outpost.Resources can be accumulated during gameplay, which can be usedtowards upgrades, potions, or building.  Again, even the use of resourcesdepends on the choice of the player, which I can respect.The combat is fluid, and is tied to the story where who theplayer chooses to fight effects later battles and the universe.  I neverfelt like my time was being wasted, and every aspect of this game isintegrated and complimentary of each other aspect.  I have no problemrecommending it.This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you towatch if you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												Bastion got me hooked from start to finish, despite not playing and liking RPG games in general... and that says it all!It's a great little indie RPG, with really nice story presentation and colorful backgrounds, well made gameplay and good soundtrack.Speaking of the story, it's a nice short fantasy tale, nothing too big, but the way it's presented keeps you interested enough. After all, the main game's length is 5-6 hours tops, so it definitely won't get you bored.The graphics are great and really fit the game's world, which is full of colors and beautiful environments.The way the ground shapes itself in front of you as you walk was a really nice addition too, totally innovative.The gameplay is probably Bastion's strongest point, the variety is big in pretty much all of the game's elements: weapons, enemies, power upgrades, side quests and items. The soundtrack is good and fits the world too, but it just didn't hook me enough.Aside from the main campaign, there are also some extra missions, in which you can raise the difficulty and, in order to get some achievements, you have to play in the highest possible one. They are the classic floors/realms in which hordes of enemies attack you and you have to survive to the end, beating the odds... I'm way too familiar with them thanks to games like Onimusha, God of War and Batman: Arkham Asylum and boy, did I miss this feeling, the one where you have to master the game's gameplay in order to get to the end, by aquiring experience through trial and error!Winning after many attemps felt really good!Finally, I wanted to note that this was the last game I missed from a list of great ""classic"" indies that I had made in my mind, which is made of the following games: Braid, Machinarium, Limbo, Super Meat Boy and Bastion!All of them have an ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" rating here on Steam too, so if you haven't played some (or all!) of them, go try them!Of course there are other great games of the same category out there, I don't dispute that, but for quite some time I had categorized the above games on my list of ""amazing little indie games to suggest to anyone"", so I really wanted to play Bastion to complete the list, having read so many good comments around it and despite it being an RPG... and boy, was it worth it!

 Personal Opinion: 9.7/10Worth The Money. I'd recommend.Pros:TL;DR -SoundtrackGameplayStoryCharactersPlot,Narrator's voiceCons:Doesn't have a second game.This game has an amazing storyline, lots of unexpected plot twists, (I know, that's the definition.)Plenty of extras, the game doesn't seem too hard at first, but then there are lots of things that get thrown at you that gets you to learn the game and figure out good pairs of weapons (war machete and dual pistols did it for me) , and with a controller or mouse, it's fun. The soundtrack is amazing. I actually bought it. The songs are noticable, they're good, and they fit. They make you want to listen over and over again. Unlike alot of modern songs.all and all. This game isn't another hole in the wall. It's definitely worth the money. "

												Bastion is an RPG top down game created by an indie developer, Supergiant Games (creators of Transistor as you know). The game's setting is in Caelondia, a war torned atmosphere left by after the war between Uras and Caels (I tried to remember the plot but this is a close one as I can remember). You will play as The Kid, an amnesiac warrior who cannot remember the past and tried to unravel. This game's dialogue have a minimalistic feel because the protagonist doesn't talk and same thing as support characters as well. The narrative voice acting, oh man, the best voice acting I have ever heard in my whole entire life. The musical scores are top notch, especially when you are in the dream sequence and every region you explore. The graphics are eye candy and visually stunning, the art style is immersively well done, the animations are well executed. The combat system is solid and fluid, you can have 2 weapons to carry and you can change the weapons if you can find The Arsenal during missions or before starting the mission. You have abilities to choose from to eliminate enemies with ease. The Forge lets you upgrade your weapons but you need a particular parts to upgrade the weapon. The Distillery lets you drink any potions you like, it gives you the benefits for your stats but also there are side effects or negative effects in it. The enemy A.I. are smart and tough. Every enemy you encounter needs a proper strategy because they have different attack patterns and weaknesses, so it's best not to mash buttons to win. If you want a challenge(it's an optional), you can turn them on by building the Shrine and enable any idols you like to enable. I recommend everyone to use a controller, the controls are tight and responsive, no problem. There are 2 endings you can choose from, so it's better not to spoil for everyone (for the sake of not to ruin their experience).+ Pros+ Narrative Voice Acting and Musical Scores+ Graphics and the art style of the game+ Variety of enemy A.I. behaves and attack patterns differently+ Tons of weapons you can use, suited for your playstyle+ Replayability (New Game Plus available after finishing the game)- Cons- Keyboard and Mouse are not recommended unless you don't own a controller or don't like using a controller- Not many varieties for main objective (finding a same life crystal to restore the Bastion)In this game's honest review, I enjoyed playing this game, just relax playing this game while the narrative is soothing my ears. The graphics, the musical scores, narrative voice acting, solid combat system and challenges that made this game's biggest strength. But there is a lack of variety during missions like finding a life crystal, encountering NPCs, it's a tiresome experience for me. I recommend you to buy this game during Sale because it's $2.50 (just in case if someone doesn't like the game, correct me if the price point is wrong). It's a solid recommendation.			"

												I have to say it's been a while since I played a game this good. It's not without it's flaws but there's so much good about it that the negative is barely noticeable.- The Good- Awesome, badass narrator/Actually get to meet the narrorator/Great voice acting.- Tutorial short and fun.- Controls amazingly.- Combat is some of the best I played in a while. Easy/Smooth/Fun. Counter ability is actually useful.- Auto-aim makes for easier and better flow of combat.- Most objects destructable (fun if your like me).- Collectables for extra xp.- Collectables have somewhat story's connected to them/Collectables connected to survivors.- Large variety of weapons/Skills for weapons/Can upgrade weapons/Upgrades give extra abilities that can be change at any time.- Large variety of skills.- Passive abilities for each level up/Large variety of passives/Can change what passives you want at any time with no penalty like weapon upgrades.- Can eventually buy skills, passives abilities, and materials for your weapons.- Get to rebuild Bastion/Get to choose what buildings go up first.- Game ran great. No frame drops, crashes or issues of any sort.- Alternate areas to go outside of the storyline/Weapon training areas for material to upgrade weapons/Arenas for grinding xp, money, and back story to main character and Zia - Singer.- Collect cores to rebuild Bastion/Boss fight for every core/Boss fights feel intense and most times challenging.- Music and sound effects are AMAZING. Some of the best, most memorable I've heard in a long time/Whether it was the main menu music, ingame music, fighing music, boss fight music or in Bastion music. All was amazingly composed and perfect for this game. Vocals are beautiful and not something I see many devs do.- Amazing story about ""The Calamity""/Search for survivors/Story about starting over.- Each survivor has their own story/Each have their own connection to collectables and tell what they know about them/Unneccesary detail but adds to the story of the game.- Can eventually add challenges for extra xp.- Large variety of enemies and ways to combat them/3 are commonly used but they aren't the only ones used.- Beautiful level design/Beautiful sceneries/Perfect mix of colors with the level design that made everything look good.- Money is really easy to collect, especially when the arena is added.- Perfect difficulty progression.- New game plus/Score attack mode (after you beat the game). Replay ability.- $14.99 Canadian/$11.40 U.S. With everything that comes with the game originally and the replay ability $14.99 is cheap.- The Bad- Healing fountains in the beginning not used after introduced/Not really needed.- Cannot return to previously finished levels.- Started to feel a little repeatative.- Don't understand why enemies were sometimes on my side or looked like they were being charmed.- Wish Kid had a voice actor.- No manual aiming, hard to deal with faster moving enemies.Overall I enjoy Bastion way more then I expected. As of right now it has to be one of the best games I played this year and if you don't own it already, you should.YouTube Video If Anyone Is Interested -

												TL;DR A great 3D isometric adventure game with never before done story narrative with an incredible narrator. Getting it at full price is great but if waiting for a discount just know you will be missiong a story meaty game. What Is Bastion.In its core? A simple 3D isometric game where you collect crystal to advance the story while hoarding alcohol and weapons. Sounds simple ja? Not really. A deep system has a narrator narrate everything to you based on your actions and performances even boss types i must say get their own dialog to differentiate from the common rabble plaguing the world.Review a go!1:GraphicsA refreshing take on the indie game stuff, Bastion emplys colourful world that is reminds you of watercolour with everything has a distinct blob to it to help with the effect. Special attacks and enviromental damage are beautifully done. Not much else to say though.Here's a link to somewhat show what i mean. A gameplay video would be even better i suppose. [fish, steam deleted my link. oh well next time i suppose]2:SoundFrom the husky voice of the narrator to the frightheningly well done tempo music that ratchets up as you serve the beatdown on gunky slim Bastion apparently paid the sound guy quite a good of cash. Not getting in the way while providing their purpose there is nothing wrong with such an approach. The famous narrator of this game tells the story as you go and play with repeating challenges, killing enemies and even repeating a failed challenge will produce a different response from him each time. The warm husky voice definitely helped pull you in into the game world where no one else speak save for the surprise the game saves for you.Go do yourself a favour and download the OST even if you do not wish to buy this game. Its art by itself.3:Gameplay.Oh boy the meat!Where shall i shall i start? Well Bastion utilize a 2 weapon system that is mapped to the left and right mouse button respectively and clicking it will trigger said weapon. Now what makes this fun is that you have a shield that can block anything provided you counter at the right time or otherwise receive reduced damage instead and you even have a slot for 1 special attack that at the beginning has 3 charges. Sounds typical? Well here we go. Fights are often arena based with smaller enemies appearing before a bigger baddy appear for you to squash. In between the healing, the frantic sword fight and the 'OH DARN' moment when you realize you used all the special attack Bastion nailed the meaty delicious part of combat to the letter but it does help that the narrator keeps on narratin throughout the battle as you desperately struggles to block a giant sack of pus from squashing you as his gentle smoky voice guides you to death. Snarkiness is guaranteed.For weapons themselves....... lets just say i wouldnt spoil things but theres everything for everyone. I myself prefer bow and machete. Yes even in Bastion i play as berserker.4:NEW GAME + 5 years ago such a thing would be all too common, these days they have all but dissapeared into the gutter but what a pleasant surprise to see Bastion packing a new game + and boy do i like it. 2X Everything for everything that wants to kill you and 0.5 for yourself. enjoy cutesy Dark Souls. :3Conclusion.Great game, great story and great gameplay. Bastion narration held it strong all the way to the end where you shall get a satisfying ending as befit a gaming warrior such as yours truly. Recommendation to pick this up is a definite yes!P/S: Did i mention you should pick this up yet?If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

			Bastion may not look appealing at first, but trust me when I say that this is a game that you should seriously consider.		

""Oh look, Bastion, another indie game with a unique art style and shallow gameplay"" - Yep, that pretty much summed up my thoughts when I first saw the game. However, I decided to give it a chance before judging it so harshly, and I'm glad I did.Okay, credit given where credit is due. The art style of bastion really did blow me away. The way that every level builds itself as you go through it as well as the general design and even the characters themselves really won me over. Not to mention the narrator truly making the game feel unique.Where I expected it to fail, the gameplay, actually turned out not only to be fun and diverse, but extremely polished. Each of the 12 weapons behaves completely differently and you can mix up any two of your choice, combined with one of 30 secret skills, providing LOADS of ways to play.You slowly upgrade the Bastion however you want after completing each level, unlocking more options. There are some challenges to do here and there but besides that, the game is fairly linear. An average playthrough to one of the 4 endings will last about 5 hours but more content is offered in the much appreciated New Game+ Mode w, allowing for a lot more replay value.I'm trying to think of something bad to say but I find it difficult. Technically there is only 5 hours of content, so for £11.50, that is a lot. Also, the game may not appeal to everyone, it took a lot of self-encouragement to actually force myself to play the game. It doesn't do a good job at drawing people in initially.Bastion gets an 8 out of 10 from me on 60 Second Reviews.			"

												I personally love RPG. I've just played Bastion in 2013. Is it too late? It's late, yes, but it's NOT too late. After clearing the entire game, I know that I'm gonna play it again in the future, maybe years later, I'll still feel impressed as the first time I did.Beautiful art; all colors, scenes, characters, monsters, items and well, everything is totally beautiful. I was captured when I first opened the game. While playing it, I absorbed the art and can't help, but feel impressed more and more.Good story; of course, RPG should has story. It completes itself. I can't actually review on the story much, just to avoid spoiling. But to me, at least, I love how the story goes...Enjoyable gameplay; I don't feel bored with the gameplay, not yet and maybe never. I finished the game with both different endings. And now I'm still playing it. Never been bored to collect the rest of achievements in New Game Plus.Awesome game world; the enrite game world is really interesting. It helps the story complete itself. Such an indie game that makes me impressed more than usual.I, myself, developed a role-playing game once. And to me, Bastion is really something. JUST BUY IT. IT WORTHS EVERY CENT OF YOUR DOLLARS.

												It would be another Calamity to miss out on this amazing game.Wonderful story.  Amazing artwork and animation.  Fun and rewarding gameplay.  Phenomenal soundtrack.  Usually games don't live up to the hype... usually games fall short.  For me, this game surpassed any hype and praise I'd seen for it prior to play and I can't recommend it enough if you're a fan of this genre of gameplay.			"

												After buying Bastion during the 2011 winter sale and playing the few minutes necessary to get the achievement for the coal-crafting metagame, I filed it away in my mental “play later” category, but never got back to it until just recently. (After all, I wouldn’t have felt quite right adding Transistor to my backlog until Bastion was done.)Honestly, it took me a fair amount of time to warm up to Bastion. The voiced aspect of the narrative didn’t hook me right away as it did for many other players - in fact, I found it somewhat distracting and stylistically difficult to follow while beating away on the baddies. The combat, while serviceable, didn’t immediately motivate me to experiment with different weapons or special abilities. As a result, I pushed through the first half of the game primarily because I like to finish the games I start, and not because I was particularly impressed with it beyond the superficial stuff.It wasn’t until all the cores were gathered up that I felt Bastion was finally starting to click with me. By that time I’d had a decent opportunity to upgrade a few different weapons, and the creature variety made me think a bit more about approaching each situation (although I certainly wouldn’t characterize any of the enemy encounters as difficult). In addition, I had put together enough of the backstory that the plot started to get interesting. Narration redeemed. After that point, I was much more motivated to play the game to completion.The soundtrack and art were superb throughout, but I don’t think there’s a lot of disagreement on that, so no need to go into any great detail there. I can’t think of any area of the game that lacked in the visuals department, although I did find that forested area with the armored frogs to be incredibly annoying.Regarding optional stuff, I didn’t spend a lot of time with it. First, I’d like to go back and try some of the idol challenges. I enabled one of the idols once, but lost interest in them when I noticed that it deactivated itself when I was done with the level. I didn’t really want to revisit the shrine between each area to keep them turned on. Second, I’m thinking about going through New Game+ after a short break (a month or two).So, short and sweet, I’d give Bastion a decent recommendation. It wasn’t among the most compelling experiences I’ve found in gaming, nor did it really live up to the level it was hyped at to me. Regardless, it’s a good game and short enough for anyone to give it a fair shake. And it was most certainly good enough to make me look forward to buying and playing Transistor at some point. "

												Excellent voicework, interesting design choices and great art help set this solid game apartThe usual suspects of an action game are present: you can roll, block and use a handful of weapons and customization to destroy enemies. Though that might sound like slim pickings compared to other action RPGs (specifically Diablo clones). The hammer does more damage if you aren't moving, the sword can be thrown and is speed based, etc. and there are upgrades that make so that all of the customization options can be felt. Personality is the key to this game's design. In a way, this game plays how you want it to. There is a high degree of difficulty customization (eventually, by way of ""idols"" in game), a few very important story decisions and combat customization. Alcohol acts as equipment in the game, and they can drastically alter how you play, on top of this you have special skills you can use and switch  out freely (unfortunately some of these skills are similar). If all of this sounds like an old hat, I can't stress enough how much you can change your gameplay experience: you can have enemies explode on death while you use two melee weapons for some nice reflex based challenge, or you can make your shields counter hits heal and do critical damage as you turtle along.The highlight of the game features is without a doubt the narrator. There are certain portions of the game where what you do or don't do is spoken by the narrator in that golden voice of his. I even caught myself smiling as the narrator called me out on having fallen off the ledge so many times. When you change up your weapons he will remark how that reminds him of something, or some of the items history. What is great about the narrator is that he adds more to the narrative and lore, bit by bit, and adds more personality to the game. The story is solid, it is not experimental, but is great and delivered extremely well.This game is worth your time. It is not a grand epic like any of the Elder Scrolls or a loot fest like Diablo. What you have here is an earnest gem of a game that isn't trying to be anything more than a solid action RPG.(This review needs an update)			"

												Here is my review of Bastion:First waking up in Bastion you have no idea what is going on. What starts your adventure is that you do not remember anything about what happened to the world after the calamity hit.  Bastion follows the story of ""The Kid"" , who happens to survive all the events prior to the game. You first start of with just a trusty weapon and begin to slowly build your arsenal.Gameplay / Sound- it almost works as a action RPG. The action includes shooting guns with cooldowns, dodging to avoid enemy attacks and special attacks. The RPG element works with upgrading guns and deciding what weapons to bring into combat during a certain mission. Some of the weapons become ridiculously strong, but with the increase in difficulty it shouldnt be too much of a problem. Unlocking the shrines and using them makes the game more fun and it also creates a bigger challenege in the game. Outside of those the game plays pretty much like an action game more than a RPG one. Playing on different level makes the game feel as though the worlds are all different yet are a part of a bigger story. Sadly you do not get to see even part of the world. The soundtrack to this game is one of the best I have heard in any video game. Once you hear it, you'll want to download it and keep on listening to it.Story- The story revolves around ""The Kid"" and his quest to collect shards to save the world after the Calamity. While the story is fleshed out over the course of the game, i cant help but feel that the world isnt as interesting as I thought it would be. What i mean by this is that there is a clear beginning, middle and end, yet not any more to it. I expected to find notes or more journal types of items to help flesh out the world. It exists already to some degree in the game, but i would have liked to know more. Other than that little nit pick, I found the story to be good, but not great.Replayability - While there is a proving grounds and some wave enemy combat, I see Bastion on Campagin as a one and done type of deal. There is content to keep you interested for the better part of about 15-20 hours though. If you getting everything and doing the extra missions you should finish within that timetable. The campaign for me took between 6-8 hours. Once you get the hang of the combat it runs though pretty quickly. As a game to pick up in the future again, I say it has limited replayability.Controls - Controls are pretty straight forward and really easy to learn. I would recommend using a controller though because keybindings are on the backburner for this game. Conclusion: If you are looking to buy Bastion, do it. It is a fantastic game and well worth purchase. The only negative takeaway is that the story background  isnt fully fleshed out and the replayability factor is pretty low.Final Score: 9 out of 10 "

Plus, combat is more interesting than in many other games of this type (including the Diablo series, IMO).Fun, cool and interesting. The setting is quite unique. A bizarre fantasy world of floating land-masses with a bit of old wild-west, a hint of post-apocalyptic, with some rather strange beasts.

												This game is really well written, I'm usually not big on plots, in fact, most of the games I have don't even have a singleplayer story mode because of that reason. However, Bastion was different for me, since the moment I began playing the game, I felt really immersed. The narrator speaking as you play is probably my favorite part of the whole game, it really makes you feel like you're part of the game and I wish more games would do the same.As for the gameplay, it's rather good as well. There are quite a few number of weapons as well as skills throughout the game making it pretty simple to develop your own style of play. The game itself is rather easy in my opinion, it only gets a tad difficult if you invoke all of the idols (Items that add various effects to monsters that make the game more difficult, but giving you extra EXP to compensate). The only part that I had some real difficulty with was the Stranger's Dream with all idols invoked, and even that only took me two attempts. However, if you have difficulty with these sort of games, there's a No-Sweat mode which allows you to continue unlimited times no matter how many times you die. Though of course, some of the achievements can't be obtained via No-Sweat mode.I'm usually not big on music in games either, but the soundtrack is also another thing to love about this masterpiece. It costs $10 to buy the soundtrack here on Steam for download, which sounds a little pricey, but I personally thought it was well worth the price. The music in the game is just amazing, and I can't get enough of it, just like the rest of the game, it's extremely well done.If you're big on achievements, like I am, the achievements in Bastion aren't too difficult, to 100% the game, all you really need is time. I estimate that it would take most people 16-18 or so hours to perfect this game, I took a little while longer since I spent a lot of time messing around in the game, it took me a little over 20 hours. Each playthrough takes roughly 6-8 hours, New Game+ should take a little less than that, though if you haven't done the dreams, those might add on a bit more time. Then you have to play Score Attack, but you only need a million points and that doesn't take the entire storyline if you do the dreams with idols invoked. There's not much else to say about this game, it has beautiful art, music, gameplay, story, and it has decent replay value. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone. I think this game is more than worth it at normal price, but it goes on sale every now and then as well, so if you really want to, waiting for it to be on sale is a pretty good option too.

												Hooolllyyy mother of God, this game is amazing. I don't know what makes this game, so, awesome. After seeing the release of Transistor, I decided to review this wonderful game. I have no idea though. The narrator? Visuals? Soundtrack? Either way, I must say, I haven't played a masterpiece quite like this in such a long time. To me, it outclasses Braid, which, for some odd reason, is used to compare Bastion, but don't have much in common. Man, where to begin...I guess I'll start with the visuals. The art in this game is absolutely amazing. It was done extremely, extremely well. Everything was painted beautifully, and I can't help but love everything about it. It makes you feel like an adventurer. You're curious to explore and willing to take risks. You just can't help but stop, take in all of the scenery, and realize you spent an hour staring at the visuals. All of it is wonderful, and if you mix it with the soundtrack, oh man. Ohmanohmanohman!Soundtrack is next. It's kinda hard to admit, but after drooling over the Super Meat Boy and Faster Than Light soundtracks, these songs will make you drool out a waterfall. Before you know it, you'll have created the ""Drool Ocean,"" which covers all of Earth. It's just that amazing. Just go on Bandcamp, iTunes, Youtube, whatever. I swear to GOD, you will start loving that soundtrack.Now for the best part of this game: The narration. One player, dunno if it was Steam, but I remember him saying this: ""His voice is velvet silk on this wonderful game"" or something along those lines. I'm a madman, I know. But this narrator makes me think of Morgan Freeman. I don't know why, but he does. To me, this guy might just be the Morgan Freeman of gaming, no joke. He's a god. He speaks with more emotion than most AAA characters, heroes, villains, etc etc COMBINED. If you never heard his voice. PLEASE. I'm BEGGING YOU. PLEASE look him up on Youtube. Last but not least, the gameplay and replayability. The gameplay is simple, hack and slash controls. It's simple, but a little bland, and I admit, this is probably the weakpoint of the game. The difficulty is very easy, and I have no difficulty fighting enemies, even with the shrines. The weakweakpoint of this game, yes, weakweakpoint, is the length. You can easily beat the game in a few hours. I'm about to finish my first playthrough already! It's that short. However, the game is pretty replayable, so that's a good thing. You have about 20 hours or so of fun for this game.Graphics- 10/10Gameplay- 6/10Story- 7/10Audio- 10/10Replayability- 7/10**GANDHI GAMING PERSONAL PICK**.:9.0/10:.+Wonderful narrator+Amazing visuals+GODLY soundtrack+Has some replayability+Lots of emotion+Interesting characters-Short-Dull gameplay			"

												One of the first indies bundles I bought featured this game. I had no idea what I was getting into, nor how amazing this game was going to be. In reality it turned out to be nothing short of a masterpiece. If you ever manage to have the opportunity to play this game, do so! You will be treated to a rare experience, not easily found in the gaming industry. Few games accomplish what Bastion has done.Bastion is an action-RPG, the first of two games developed by Supergiant Games, their second and most recent being Transistor. While they are both amazing games, and both equally worthy of praise, this review is all about Bastion. If Bastion and Transistor are anything to go off of, then we can expect great things in the future from this developer! Bastion puts you in the role of the Kid, as he fights to uncover the secrets of ""the Calamity"", an earthshattering catastrophe that leaves the world in pieces. Bastion redefines storytelling, with reactive narration and superb voiceover work - simply playing the game and listening to the narrator is a joy in and of itself. The game also features a critically-acclaimed soundtrack, which is available for purchase along with the game.The controls are extremely easy to use and get used to. Bastion features the typical but tried-and-true method of using the WASD keys for movement commonly found in many game, along with point and click input for combat. The direction you move the cursor is the direction the Kid will attack when you click. Left clicking uses your main weapon, which is more often than not a melee weapon, such as a hammer or machete; while right clicking is generally a ranged weapon, such as a bow or gun. Holding down either mouse button for a brief period unleashes a charge attack, dealing more damage than usual. Spacebar causes the Kid to roll in the direction of your cursor, allowing you to dodge most attacks. Some enemies have the ability to knock you into the air, at which point you have the opportunity to perform an air recovery by hitting the Spacebar.There are many varied, handpainted environments, each crawling with savage creatures hell-bent on putting an end to your arduous journey. At your disposal is an array of different weapons and abilities, which are all upgradeable as the player progresses through the game. Also available is an assortment of Spirits, which grant various passive bonuses, such as an increase in Max HP, or increased critical hit chance. The game also has a New Game Plus mode, where you can replay the story carrying over all the items from your previous playthrough.From an enthralling story told through superb narrative, to lush, detailed environments and deadly enemies, Bastion has everything you could want from an indie RPG. It's definitely worth adding to any game collection. It's the kind of game that will turn anyone into a gamer.A Must Play "

												Bastion is an amazing game with stunning graphics and soothing narration. Gameplay is pretty versatile. You can choose between a close-range, mid-range, or far-range weapon through each mission. Certain weapons let you double up on close and far range but using it is up to your preference. The music is alright but the narration, however, is music to the ears. Best part about the game is having creatures that can potentially kill you as pets. Also, you have a mailbox at the Bastion which is always empty because, get it, everyone's dead. Your roommates are basically an old man with a godly voice, a harp-player, and a backstabber. Besides them, there's really no one friendly around to give you their regards.			"

												An amazing game with a great narrated story and incredible soundtrack.Tons of ways to change your loadout combination to appeal to a large variety of playstyles. Weapon upgrades change how they behave making a single weapon extremely versatile. Without giving too much away, other buildings in the Bastion allow for greater gameplay modification such as passive abilities, and difficulty enhancers.The artwork is stunning and fits the game really well.Bastion is a bit of an emotional roller coaster that will have you coming back for a second ride. After you beat the game you get the option to start ""New Game+"" which lets you take all your unlocked goodies to the start of a new playthrough.PRO TIP: It's not considered crying if you wipe away the tears fast enough.

The gameplay is exiting with a range of different weapons and conbinations that you can utiilies in various scenarios.  It's a relatively short game, but packed to the brim, and well worth jumping on.It also hosts a fantastic soundtrack.			"

												I listened to Bastion's soundtrack way before I sat down and played through the game itself. I'm glad that the game is just as enchanting as its music. Bastion is one big errand mission as you travel through the skies to find the essential pieces needed to rebuild the Bastion--the hub world you escaped to when the world was nearly destroyed by a 'calamity.' I don't mean to tear down Bastion, as it's a fun game that I thoroughly enjoyed. The only unfortunate thing about such a straightforward task is that it can't go on too long before it gets old, which the developers must have realized as they kept the game at a perfect length. Bastion offers several weapons that you can hold in any combination. You can also upgrade them with abilities that strengthen their unique attributes--meaning most people are going to have different setups by the time they reach the climax of the game. I had a lot of fun messing around with different combinations to see which weapons best fit my playstyle. To top it off, you can also use different 'tonics' to give yourself a boost via an assortment of perks. Once you're finished with your customization the gameplay is solid. Blocking, attacking and rolling all feel great and you feel like a pro after a few minutes messing with the controls. The story is intriguing, but I'm going to leave it at that since I could easily give something of the plt away. If you're hoping for a deep, fulfilling story, you'll certainly find it here. I can say that the narration of 'the stranger' is one of my favorite parts of the game. I thought I would grow tired of his constant talking as I fought through and explored the world, but it's well done and never overbearing. Overall, you should definitely pick this one up if you want a fun adventure with a great story and stellar soundtrack.			"

												All stories start at the beginning. Ain't so simple with this one. Boy wandered for a while... Videogame was beautiful for one. Caelondians really have a way with art, he thought, then heard a girl humming in the distance. He took her to the Bastion, where everyone had agreed to meet in case of trouble. Old man was right, the calamity was no accident. Boy had a mission now, a purpose. Go ahead boy, show us what you got.			"

												I heard a lot of hype for this game before I tried it.  Usually I'm wary of such games, as it's difficult to live up to so many high expectations.  I'm glad to report that this is one of those rare circumstances where a game not only lives up to its hype, but exceeds it.  Bastion is an action RPG with the gimmick of a real-time narrator.  The story is quite good, but the variations in combat are really what shine with Bastion.  Multiple weapons and weapon pairings allow you to play this game as you choose, and also allow for different playthroughs each time you approach this game.  Add in one of the best video game soundtracks I've heard in a long time, and you have a complete package.  Bastion is one of the few games that upon completion I fired it up again to play it from the start.  I would give this game an outstanding 9.5/10.			"

												Fun and beautiful, with excellent soundtrack. There are many different weapons so the gameplay has got plenty of variety, and extra missions to learn more about the backstory of the characters.One flaw is that you only have one save file, and it saves automatically to boot. While admittedly it makes sense story-wise (the story is all about moving forward rather than trying to correct past mistakes), it's extremely annoying gameplay-wise.Also, it can be annoying that the story is so vague about the way the Calamity affected the world. We quickly learn how it affected two countries (and even then the long-term survival of one of the two is left up in the air), but unless the whole world was only made of those two countries (heck, could be, they never say) it's pretty weird that there is never even a hint about what the rest of the world is doing. The game focuses exclusively on the protagonists at the expense of world building.Even so, overall it's most definitely a game worth playing.			"

												Bastion brings you in as The Kid. One of the few survivors to the Calamity in the world of Caelondia. Travel the world (levels) to find the cores and shards the were left in the aftermath of the disaster to bring back to life The Bastion. The beauty and color that this game brings with the deep system of ugrades and different weapons offers a kind of RPG to mind. This has been one of the most beautiful, creative and luscious games that I have ever played, seen and heard since I have started gaming. Even with its downfall of being a bit short, its story is so well played out that you will play it to experience it at least twice.Pros: Beautiful, colorful, creative, different.Cons: short (even though this doesnt mean this makes it anything less than a good game.)9/10			"

												Bastion is visually stunning game with a clear and crisp art style that quickly makes you forget this was indie developed. The sound is equally impressive, with an array of well chosen musical tracks and one of the best narrator's I've ever encounter.As you play through the game various actions and events are narrated by Ruck, one of the few survivors other than yourself in this colorful post-apocalyptic world. His smooth and soothing voice might be a gimmick but it sure as hell adds character to the game and lets you feel less alone when grinding through the hordes of enemies you encounter.The gameplay itself is a fairly basic Diablo clone. You can carry two weapons at any time and got the option of using a special attack every once in a while and that's about it. Most of the more difficult challenges are about learning dodge and block timing rather than complicated attack moves.It is a fun and cute little game and definitely one of the best indie games of the year.

												Oh my gracious sauce, it is time to review Bastion.Let's first begin by talking about the gameplay. While it is not extraordinary, it is very solid and I enjoyed it like I enjoy a rich potato salad.  You can carry two weapons in your main loadout as well as one special move or skill. As you progress through the game you will find more weapons and your options will increase dramatically.  Experimenting with the different weapons to find the playstyle you like best is great fun. There is also an upgrade system for these weapons which allows you to experiment even further. All super sauce.You play through many different levels as you defeat enemies and collect shards.  This is where the great visuals are shown off.  They are crazy delicious. Ridiculously good. They did great work on the art style of this game and it pays off.  The music is also fantastic. The biggest flaw of Bastion is that the main game is shorter than most. However, the replay value is boosted by optional challenges and endurance tests.  The difficulty level is also quite tame, but they allow the player to make the game harder and recieve more EXP by playing on harder difficulties.  It is up to the player to add more pasta sauce to the game if the length and difficulty do not satisfy.What I believe to be the most defining part of Bastion is the narrator who narrates all that the main character does in the game as you control him.  It is a very unique and fresh idea that made me say ""Holy iguana lungs, this idea is pretty sauce!"". The voice actor for the narrator is also excellent and his voice is quite godlike and very fitting.Overall, this game is definitely a slam dunk worthy of a top 10 special on ESPN.  The music, the art style, the narration, the story, and the gameplay are all as professional as a broadway musical. I have awarded Bastion a rating of ""5/5 top notch godlike"".  Thank you for reading my review.			"

												One of the most uderrated and underestimated games.  In my humble opinion it's a top-class action title with profound storytelling, optimal gameplay and great design. Do not be fooled by cute graphics and not-badass enemies - Bastion is a mature story about war, loss and sense of identity. According gameplay, every gun combination is nice - army carbine&machete: yeah. Mortar&shotgun: be my guest, kiddo!Last but not least - Few unique factors will also surprise you: Shattered world builded by narration, Gods turn up the challenge, not give you a nice time, etc.Find it, buy it, play it, replay it! It's really worth it. I guarantee, that kid won't disappoint you. "

												   Bastion is one of the best games I have ever played. The mechanics work well, combat and movement is fluid, the game isn't too punishing, and if you took what makes it special away, it would still be a fantastic game.    What makes it stand out is the narration and story. I have never in my life heard a narrator as beautiful as this one. It doesn't interfere with gameplay, and adds to the enviroment. The story is wonderfully crafted, works with the enviroment, the art is beautiful. The ending is a texbook 'what to do'. I'll try not to spoil it, but it's the kind that makes you think about what you've done, and are about to do.   If Supergiant games can continue making masterpieces like this, Valve may be booted to my second favorite publisher.			"

												 ...It's just a beautiful package for the senses+ Art style+ Sound design+ Combat variation- Rather short (took me 6 hours)- Can feel slightly repetitiveThe game is beautiful, maybe one of the best looking games I've played. It's graphical beauty is matched by the sound design, it's some of the best voice talent/soundtrack I've heard in a game. It's just a beautiful package for the senses but it also plays pretty well with a varied combat system, allowing you to play as you want. It took me a little while to get into the story but I became curious about the origins of the event in the game, so much so I found it difficult to put the controller down. It's length is a little meagre but offers replayability through a 'new game plus' mode in which your levels, exp and equipment carry over which allows you to play it differently and also a different ending.If you're into action RPGs, you should give it a go.

												Absolutely amazing indie game. The art, the animation, the voice acting, the music: All very good and fit the game quite well. The story is a little strange, but it's interesting how it and the world unfolds (literally). The gameplay is no slouch either. While simple, it's quite enjoyable and fun all around. There's quite a few pretty cool weapons to find and upgrade throughout the game. The game isn't exactly hard, but through the use of one of the buildings at the Bastion, you can invoke different Deities to enhance the enemies to make them stronger in some way - regenerating health, more damaging, move faster, explode on death, etc.I would honestly say this is a ""must play"" for anybody who enjoys platformers, indie or not. The quality on this game is so high and everything is polished beyond most normal games that you may as well forget it's indie. I am very much looking foward to these guys' next game, Transisitor.

The amazingly colorful watercolor aesthetics give it a unique look (seriously, the artwork for this game is freaking gorgeous), the narrative is immersive and engaging (and absolutely heartbreaking at times), the way the story is told through interactive voiceover is nothing short of wonderfully clever. Gameplay-wise, it's a lot of fun, fast-paced and well-developed. The game makes you care deeply about the characters, too, and you end up feeling not only for your protagonist and his allies, but for your foes as well; you get to experience the loneliness and the longing for the old world felt by all who survived the Calamity. Also, the music is absolutely brilliant, it makes you experience a whole range of emotions, from nostalgia to hopefulness, from sadness to joy. All in all, Bastion is an amazing experience that I would recommend to virtually anyone.			"

												There isn't much I can say about Bastion that hasn't been said already. The art is pretty, the music wonderful and the narrator amazing. You play as the Kid, trying to find out what happened to your world which suddenly crumbled into pieces in an event called the Calamity. Along the way you meet a couple of other survivors and gather them at the bastion, a flying fortress that has the power to make everything right again. The NG+ is useful if you want to see both endings of the game because there is only one automatic save slot and the no sweat mode was a salvation for me ( I died more times by falling off the edge than by actual monsters - except perhaps the pesky anklegators).TL;DR: Play this game if : You love clicking your mouse. You love stalker narrators with raspy voices. You like falling off cliff edges and dying. You are a masochist with all 10 shrine idols invoked for impossible-to-beat who-knows-wheres. Even if you don't like any of these things, play this game. It's brilliant.			"

												If there's anything I can say about Bastion, it's that it looks absolutely beautiful. The art style just blew me away, and it was admittedly the reason I got this game in the first place. But of course, good looks aren't the only thing Bastion has going for it. The combat style is very enjoyable due to the variety of customisations available, especially as you progress further into the game and unlock more weapons and potions, which affect your character's base stats. For those looking for a challenge, the interesting gameplay mechanic of invoking idol statues of gods further increases the difficulty of combat, with extra XP and money rewards. But the most interesting thing about this game for me was the fact that you're accompanied by a deep-voiced narrator, telling you the story as you play through Bastion. Whenever you progress through the story, whether it's finding a new ability, walking into a new area, or even falling off the edge, the narrator will have something to comment about it right as it happens, more often witty than not. The live narration very effectively immerses the you in the game, making you feel as if you are part of the story itself. I have never seen a game do this kind of narration before, so it was a new and often amusing experience for me.Despite how great this game is, there is one thing I'd like to point out, and that is the game's lack of definitive area borders, making it very easy to fall off ledges sometimes. For example, there would be something like a chunk of land that you think you can walk on, but when you walk over to it, it was actually in the background and so you end up falling off the ledge. This was a bit annoying particularly when I was low on health, but it's not a huge problem I would deduct any theoretical points for.With a compelling story, great soundtrack and amazing art, I thoroughly enjoyed playing Bastion and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good adventure RPG.

												I can say that this is one of the best games I have played in my entire life. It does so much right. The gameplay is a lot of fun, although simple. But the strongest points of the game lie in its artistic and emotional values.Bastion just looks beautiful. The graphics are hand-painted, and the colours are really well done. It almost makes every screen of the game looks like a real painting, but a lot of things on screen can be destroyed or interacted with. Your character and the NPCs look a bit more 3D, with maybe a little bit of cell-shading on it too. It makes them stand out, but it still fits really well with the 2D painted background.The music is also amazing. There are a couple of songs in the soundtrack that still make me a little emotional when I hear them, just because of how they were used in this game. One of the later moments in the game is one of the strongest moments I've ever experienced in a video game, and the song that was playing at that moment was an important part of that.The story seems pretty simple when the game starts out. But as you progress, you will find out more about the world and its people before the Calamity, and what the Calamity is and what caused it. The Bastion is pretty much the only thing left that can save the world from the Calamity, and you need to travel to different areas in the world to recover cores, which power the Bastion. It's also narrated by a great voice actor, who occasionally foreshadows things that are about to happen, and interacts with you about saying something specific to what you're doing at that moment. The world in Bastion is built up with some simple themes and ideas, but at the same it feels so real and deep, if you pay enough attention to the story and understand everything about it.Even though it felt like the gameplay was one of the game's minor focuses, it was still solid and fun. There are plenty of weapons for you to use, and you always have a primary and secondary weapon with you, together with a secret ability. Each weapon has five upgrades, which you can apply if you have enough fragments (currency) and upgrade materials. Each character level-up brings along an extra slot in which you can equip a liquor that gives you a passive bonus. You can also invoke shrines to customize the game's challenge. Each God has their own shrine, and invoking it will make the game more challenging in a specific way. One would, for example, grant enemies health regeneration, while another one makes them drop a bomb when they die. Each invoked shrine increases the experience and fragments you earn by 5%.I've played through this game about four times now, and I still enjoyed every minute of it. After playing through it, you can move on to NG+, with all your equipment and character level from the previous playthrough, to unlock the alternate ending. After that you can try score attack mode, or play arenas through the form of dreams of the survivors you rescued and brought to the Bastion. The game is not that long, but it's such a wonderful experience.			"

												This game is art. I don't say that lightly. While i wouldn't call it perfect, It achieves what so many games try and completely fail to do. it should be mentioned in the same breath as half-life, bioshock,metroid prime and shadow of collosus. its get narrative structure right. It tells a story that adds to the gameplay instead of pausing it. Aided by the soulful narrative work of Logan Cunnigham and gripping music of Darren Korb and Lisa Barret, the team at Supergiant games crafted an expereince that will keep you spellbound.That is not to say the gameplay doesn't deserve props. Even without the top tier story, the narration, the music, and art the gameplay deserves top honors as well. With a huge arsenel of weapons that completely change gameplay, and constantly evolving obstacles + enemies, it will take a decent while for you to get bored. As an isometric smash em up action, everything is so crisp, with barely any fat. the controls are simple, yet give way for complex gameplay. special shout out to the unique way bastion handles difficulty levels. very unique and refreshing. with up to 10 extra buffs you can apply to enemies in exchange for more experience and money. I've never seen that before in a game and thought it was ingenious. much better than unlocked ""insane"" modes. Replay value is there, but not as high as some would like ( I expect) and i wish the story was longer as it feels (slightly) rushed at the end(i want a second one!!!!!!). But these are the most minor of gripes. This game is a steal at anything less than 15 dollars, and is worth more.  "

												Cool story-telling game with a neat combat system.As for the narration, unfortunately for me who wants to focus as I play the game especially during combats, I started to feel annoyed by the narrator. It's a good concept, but not everyone will enjoy endless babbling on whatever you do. Had a hard time whether or not I should mute the narration, but at the same time I also needed the narrator to learn the story. Sure, I can just use subtitles to learn the story... but I still can't just read as I fight the enemies, plus the high needs to watch where I stand else I fall to death. Quite a dilemma right there for me.Struggled with the control a little at the beginning of the game. The character's movement was a bit clunky. Nevertheless, it's a very well-made game. Choices of upgradable weapons as you find them along the way enables you to try different approach to fight the enemies. The game also has the feature to buff the enemies to increase difficulty. Combats feel fresh with those changes. Challenges/trials are given for you to master your favorite weapons. There's no need to grind through the game to level up, or even completing the story. Difficulty level is just right.Not to forget the great soundtrack!If you are interested in Supergiant Games' creations, I recommend to play starting from Bastion. I played Transistor first so I couldn't help comparing the two and struggled a little in Bastion... but definitely can see how much Supergiant Games has improved! Now I'm so looking forward to the upcoming Pyre!			"

												I was gifted Bastion by a friend a few years ago. WHY DIDN'T I PLAY IT UNTIL NOW??? IT'S SO MUCH FUN!!!Wow. I haven't enjoyed a game this much in a long time. The story is great, the visuals are beautiful and colorful. The whole atmosphere is really lovely. The music is so good and it is fluid in that you can flow from one mood to another easily when the narration changes, you enter a specific area on the map, etc.But what really keeps me coming back is the combat. I don't usually love hack'n'slash, but these weapons & abilities are SO much fun to use. I love all of them, too bad you can only use two at a time. The option of using spirits and idols to make the combat easier/harder depending on different variables you can choose to control is just brilliant. And the eventual upgrades you get, are awesome. The (increasingly difficult) maps & monsters are all introduced at a good, flowing pace, and in the end are all super fun to fight. I'm probably going to keep playing and toy with the difficulty and different weapon combinations for a while, even after I've beat New Game Plus.I was very motivated by the narrator and other rewarding, and interesting parts of the game to keep on playing and complete the story. Too often I don't finish games, but the Bastion called my name every hour of the day since I began playing. Even after you've completed the story there's still more stuff that you can do. Or, rather you can do other fun things while taking your time with the story. It's cool. The currency, and the rate at which it is acquired, is really in sync with natural progression. Everything about this game is just, ""in sync"". It flows. It makes sense. Nothing worried me about it. It is most excellently designed.Whoever came up with the idea to introduce New Game Plus after you've beat it the first time, knew how important that feature would be for people like me who couldn't get enough and wanted to keep playing.So, you should get this game. It's really perfect, especially if you like rpg's, this is a special one. There's really no way you wouldn't enjoy it, unless you have real poor coordination and fall off the map all the time (but this is just another fun thing about it). Also. Most of the world is destructible so that's fun (it's so pretty though, why would you want to do that? Maybe to make more room for fighting monsters, or getting past obstacles...) So much fun. Get it!			"

												Bastion is a very stylized isometric action game in which you play a young character who finds himself awaken shortly after the apocalypse. As you explore, the world fills in around you. Over the course of the game, you pick up a variety of weapons, powers, abilities, and even penalties you can equip to give yourself better rewards, all while working your way through the areas and story.Bastion's strengths are three main areas: first, how it tells the story. The actions of the player are narrated by a fantastic voice actor, providing a feeling of having the tale be told as you play it out, which is very unique among games. Secondly, it has an amazing soundtrack, which I don't know exactly how to describe - maybe Electronic Folk? Anyway, it absolutely has one of the best soundtracks of any game I've ever played. Finally, the story itself, which I obviously don't want to spoil in the review, so I'll leave you to that.There's a fair amount of replayability and challenges to complete if the player is so inclined - I personally chose to play through once and enjoyed it as that. At any rate, the most important thing is this: buy this game, and when you do, buy the soundtrack.			"

												Super nice game. I was bored one day and saw it in my inventory, launched it - and was not bored anymore. Once you finished the game you can replay the story while keeping all unlocked weapons and skills. It's also one of the few games I was looking forward to replay. The game begins really easy but becomes more and more difficult. If you still feel like the game was too easy to beat you can try out the challenge missions and give the enemies perks that make them far more dangerous. I really recommend everyone to give this game a try. Now with the Summer Sale coming it should be 75% off again.			"

Like the game, Bastion delivers an atmospheric experience whose story, music and design all emerse me in a great world with everything fitting together so well. This game should be applauded for how well of an experience it gives the player as it dripfeeds you weapons, story and enemies to fight. The only real thing i can fault is the gameplay, which is pretty linear and has no real replay value.

You get used to it quickly, and it's an excellent tool to move the story.And the story itself is outstanding ---- set up comes in the middle of events and go from there, filling in as needed.Gameplay is easy to understand for the casual player even though there are plenty of challenges and complex tasks to master.Artwork is gorgeous, music is great, and controls are easy.It's been around for a good while, and is on sale often ---- pick it up then, if you haven't already.

												There are many games out there that can tell you a good story.  Some of them tell one so great you'll gush about it to anyone who'll listen.  Bastion does something a little different.  It's not the story itself, but the way it's told.  Lush environments assembling themselves under your feet at every step, robust landscapes waiting to be explored, and a gorgeous narrative alongside the natural squeak and strum of strings blend together to create a masterpiece.In short, Bastion will not disappoint.  You'll even want to spring for the soundtrack.  10/10.I expect 'Build That Wall' (Zia's Theme) will sit at the top of my favourite track list for a very long time.			"

												Crisp, detailed artwork. From the clouds rolling over the map, to the in-game items, everything is thoughtfully crafted and coherent. A single aesthetic for the entire game scales from little elements to full-fledged splash pages.The music does well to pair with the artwork. There's no let down. As much mood is created visually, there is equally fine musical pieces that create the sensations of adventure and tension in all the right places.  There's a major ""cool"" factor with the audio in general. The gruff but smoothly delivered voice-over fits the writing styles comfortable brevity. I never felt tired of sitting through narration. It was quick, to the point, but stylized to keep the entertainment flowing. The tunes mix atmosphere and raw, bluesy-western sounding guitar. Like our hero was born ""cool"" right out of the womb.  How easy it would've been to fudge these artistic choices and end up with something cheesy. Bastion is coherent on all fronts visual and auditory.  As for the mechanics and gameplay? I think they play second fiddle. Passable by all means - nothing seemed to be lacking, unresponsive, imbalanced, etc. But this game, in my opinion, is primarily a sight and sound to behold by the senses. Eat it up! "

												Bastion is a memorable experience that transcends its parts.Gameplay is typical ARPG, with lots of weapons upgrading. This game gives you about a dozen melee and ranged weapons to choose from. Too many to upgrade them all fully, but it does mean that you can select weapons that match your preferred style of gameplay, and upgrade them with effects that you prefer (knockback, damage over time, crits, etc.). This is all very intuitive. But the gameplay itself is dull and repetitive.What makes Bastion work, though, is what's happening when you're not blasting, pounding, or burning alien critters. The just-in-time narration is excellent, and teeters between over-the-top seriousness and great dry humor. This narration that comes as you need it, mid-gameplay, works wonderfully and much better than cutscenes. There is a lesson here for other games.There is a compelling story here that takes effort and attention to comprehend. You have to continue past the main game into other modes to get the full story, or just look it up on Google when you're done. I frankly found the story to be a bit too abstruse to keep track of. I never developed too much interest in the characters who may not be what they say they are, or may be betraying you or not, or ... whatever. Blah blah blah. But the way the story is plugged directly into the gameplay via clever narration, gives you some very memorable experiences. No spoilers here, you'll have to trust me.I can't not mention the soundtrack. It's an excellent mash-up of old-West and Far-east, with electric drum beats and a stellar blues number thrown in for good measure. It reminds me of the old-West sci-fi soundtrack that accompanied the TV show ""Firefly"". There is no denying the spiritual influence. Listening to the song ""In case of Trouble"", I see scenes from Firefly in my head. This complete soundtrack stands alone wonderfully; my only wish would be for more vocal numbers, because ""Build That Wall"" is so moving when it's presented in the game.In summary, Bastion works because the whole is far greater and more memorable than its parts. Each element of this game augments the others - the average gameplay is elevated by the narration and the always-appropriate soundtrack, and the story that I struggled to care about still gave me chills and a jaw-dropping experience near the end, fueled by a sudden change in the gameplay and the always-appropriate soundtrack. Bastion is, most of all, a COMPLETE game experience, with a start, a middle, and an ending, where each element was clearly planned and thoughtfully executed, with polish and shine. Compare this to most games that simply end with a boss fight and a tacked on cut scene that explains what happened and teases a sequel, and you'll appreciate what a rare bird Bastion is in today's game market. Whether or not this particular title works for you, I hope you will agree with me that we need more games like Bastion. "

												Everyone should have a chance to play this game. The story is very thought out and beautiful as well as every aspect of this game. I haven't played anything like this, and yet here I am wishing for more. It's not too long of a playthrough. Also, the soundtrack, if you can, is the one the best ones I've heard.			"

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Bastion. A Narrated Story About The World Falling Apart.Genre: Fantasy isometric hack and slash aRPGDeveloped and Published by: Supergiant Games & Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, PS3 and Xbox360. Business Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay ThoughtsThis hack and slash aRPG has the player controlling Kid, a youth surviving the events of the Calamity. Said event destroyed much of the world that he knew and now he must traverse it, seeking to restore the Bastion. The Kid is a silent protagonist but the narrator following him around definitely isn’t. The narration is the main selling point of Bastion and where it got a lot of its praise from. The narrator’s deep tones are used to describe both the story, the interactions between characters and the player’s actions with an almost AI level of cognition. Falling off a ledge, getting hit by enemies, not figuring out where to go next gets either encouragement, prodding or almost sarcastic remarks from the narrator depending on the situation. But the narrator remains ever steadfast, determined to help the Kid out. It won’t comment on every single action taken but it’s enough to be interesting during this four hour or so campaign.  There's the Bastion level where you’re able to trigger parts of the story plot, customize the Kid’s weaponry and choose which level to go next. On each combat level is a piece of the Bastion (shards) that you must locate (usually hidden behind bosses) in order to reassemble and power it up. On combat levels, pieces of the level come falling down from the sky so you won't always know where to go next. I’m pretty mixed on this idea. I get that they didn’t want the entire level to be seen immediately nor wanted to use darkness to hide it, but it often leads to you running into walls a lot of the time. Combat ThoughtsCombat is a repetitive hack-and-slash with guns, hammers, blades and many other assorted weapons. Kid can only have two weapons equipped along with a special ability. The special ability can be summonable monsters to special weapon attacks and require dark potions to use. The Kid can’t recover his health over time, so the player will need to keep an eye out for health potions and use them when low on health. There’s an upgrade tree for weapons that changes the ability and strength to the player’s preference. It’s a good idea to figure out what weapons you’ll like early on. Each weapon upgrade requires a unique material as well as a number of spirits/currency in order to be applied. The currency can take a while unless you wish to grind the proving ground or monster waves (remembrance) level. There's also collectible items (Mementos), Vigils that change monster behavior and stats for increasing your risk/reward. All of which help take the edge off the repetitiveness of Bastion but only a little bit. For the most part, I found I ended up setting these to what I preferred and forgetting them. Unless you visit the challenge levels and complete them for the rewards, there's not a lot to choose from in the normal course of the game. Combat is pretty solid though the main problem is definitely the lacking variety of enemies. You’ll see the majority of them pretty early on and they get reused a lot. The way to defeat them is also pretty samey. Line up a shot, hopefully triggering a power-shot which gives it an extra boost, dodge out of the way if the enemy gets too close and shoot again. Rinse and repeat. A lot of the time it can feel like long battles of attrition between the health potions and seemingly endless stream of monsters. PC Settings, Visuals and SoundtrackBastion has a reasonable selection of options to customize the experience. It does give you a selection of resolution options depending on your aspect ratio. Though anything outside of a 16:9 resolution will be letterboxed. Fullscreen is on/off though you can force borderless windowed mode through a launch option. Read about how to do that on PCGamingWiki[pcgamingwiki.com]. Visual settings are extremely limited to vertical sync on/off and anti-aliasing up to 4x. I’ll grant that it’s a 2D game so lots of graphical options are probably unnecessary. However, Bastion makes up for it with a plentiful audio menu. (Where the brightness slider is located, strangely). Music, FX and narration volume can all be adjusted here with sliders for each individual one. Keyboard, mouse and controller are all supported for Bastion though controller seems to be the preferred method. Bastion still holds up as a good looking indie title with its cartoony, colorful visual style. A style that has been very well implemented and holds up all game. The soundtrack is very well done and remains one of my favorite albums from gaming. I recommend picking up the soundtrack[supergiantgames.bandcamp.com] after you've finished playing the game.Final ThoughtsBastion is a solid experience from beginning to end. The narration is very well done, constantly keeping the player engaged and not getting overbearing or annoying. The story and combat are both solid and reasonably enjoyable for the short experience. Though I do feel like the customization/crafting system requires a bit too much grinding and the combat system can feel far too repetitive at times due to the small pool of enemies. Still, I think it's worth giving Bastion a look over, even after all this time. Read this review and more at A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												So many great reviews that completely cover thgis one, so I'll just say a couple of things about this winning game.The narration is what makes this game for me. You get used to it quickly, and it's an excellent tool to move the story.And the story itself is outstanding ---- set up comes in the middle of events and go from there, filling in as needed.Gameplay is easy to understand for the casual player even though there are plenty of challenges and complex tasks to master.Artwork is gorgeous, music is great, and controls are easy.It's been around for a good while, and is on sale often ---- pick it up then, if you haven't already. Recommended for sure. "

												There are many games out there that can tell you a good story.  Some of them tell one so great you'll gush about it to anyone who'll listen.  Bastion does something a little different.  It's not the story itself, but the way it's told.  Lush environments assembling themselves under your feet at every step, robust landscapes waiting to be explored, and a gorgeous narrative alongside the natural squeak and strum of strings blend together to create a masterpiece.In short, Bastion will not disappoint.  You'll even want to spring for the soundtrack.  10/10.I expect 'Build That Wall' (Zia's Theme) will sit at the top of my favourite track list for a very long time.			"

												Bastion is a beautiful game. The game play flows well, very intuitive, the soundtrack is beautiful, and the artwork is gorgeous. Think a pretty version of Diablo. You hack and slash your way through amazingly well fleshed out environments and are able to customize the upgrades your weapons. The music is amazing, so I'd recommend buying the version with the soundtrack included. The narrator has a rich, smooth, cowboy voice and the storyline is intriguing. It's never boring, and although the enemies don't have many variety, the colorful worlds bring this game to life. I played this on a PC and had no troubles with the controls what so ever. This game is not easy however. You can however chose to have unlimited amounts of lives which helps greatly, especially when you don't care to dodge or block any of the attacks being tossed your way. Great game. 9/10			"

												Bastion is a memorable experience that transcends its parts.Gameplay is typical ARPG, with lots of weapons upgrading. This game gives you about a dozen melee and ranged weapons to choose from. Too many to upgrade them all fully, but it does mean that you can select weapons that match your preferred style of gameplay, and upgrade them with effects that you prefer (knockback, damage over time, crits, etc.). This is all very intuitive. But the gameplay itself is dull and repetitive.What makes Bastion work, though, is what's happening when you're not blasting, pounding, or burning alien critters. The just-in-time narration is excellent, and teeters between over-the-top seriousness and great dry humor. This narration that comes as you need it, mid-gameplay, works wonderfully and much better than cutscenes. There is a lesson here for other games.There is a compelling story here that takes effort and attention to comprehend. You have to continue past the main game into other modes to get the full story, or just look it up on Google when you're done. I frankly found the story to be a bit too abstruse to keep track of. I never developed too much interest in the characters who may not be what they say they are, or may be betraying you or not, or ... whatever. Blah blah blah. But the way the story is plugged directly into the gameplay via clever narration, gives you some very memorable experiences. No spoilers here, you'll have to trust me.I can't not mention the soundtrack. It's an excellent mash-up of old-West and Far-east, with electric drum beats and a stellar blues number thrown in for good measure. It reminds me of the old-West sci-fi soundtrack that accompanied the TV show ""Firefly"". There is no denying the spiritual influence. Listening to the song ""In case of Trouble"", I see scenes from Firefly in my head. This complete soundtrack stands alone wonderfully; my only wish would be for more vocal numbers, because ""Build That Wall"" is so moving when it's presented in the game.In summary, Bastion works because the whole is far greater and more memorable than its parts. Each element of this game augments the others - the average gameplay is elevated by the narration and the always-appropriate soundtrack, and the story that I struggled to care about still gave me chills and a jaw-dropping experience near the end, fueled by a sudden change in the gameplay and the always-appropriate soundtrack. Bastion is, most of all, a COMPLETE game experience, with a start, a middle, and an ending, where each element was clearly planned and thoughtfully executed, with polish and shine. Compare this to most games that simply end with a boss fight and a tacked on cut scene that explains what happened and teases a sequel, and you'll appreciate what a rare bird Bastion is in today's game market. Whether or not this particular title works for you, I hope you will agree with me that we need more games like Bastion. "

												This game is wonderful. It has a great soundtrack, but what really makes it is the narrator, who speaks throughout the game and gives the story a great deal of impact. How can an empty world have a story? You'll find out by playing this game.The gameplay is only okay, but as a part of the greater package that is this game, you'll love it. Probably the second or third best game of 2011, without even needing to add the qualifier of ""indie game"" - it is better than virtually all AAA titles.			"

												Bastion is a very stylized isometric action game in which you play a young character who finds himself awaken shortly after the apocalypse. As you explore, the world fills in around you. Over the course of the game, you pick up a variety of weapons, powers, abilities, and even penalties you can equip to give yourself better rewards, all while working your way through the areas and story.Bastion's strengths are three main areas: first, how it tells the story. The actions of the player are narrated by a fantastic voice actor, providing a feeling of having the tale be told as you play it out, which is very unique among games. Secondly, it has an amazing soundtrack, which I don't know exactly how to describe - maybe Electronic Folk? Anyway, it absolutely has one of the best soundtracks of any game I've ever played. Finally, the story itself, which I obviously don't want to spoil in the review, so I'll leave you to that.There's a fair amount of replayability and challenges to complete if the player is so inclined - I personally chose to play through once and enjoyed it as that. At any rate, the most important thing is this: buy this game, and when you do, buy the soundtrack.			"

Once you finished the game you can replay the story while keeping all unlocked weapons and skills. It's also one of the few games I was looking forward to replay. The game begins really easy but becomes more and more difficult. If you still feel like the game was too easy to beat you can try out the challenge missions and give the enemies perks that make them far more dangerous. I really recommend everyone to give this game a try. Now with the Summer Sale coming it should be 75% off again.			"

												It's wonderful that in the days of the AAA triumph and corporations tightening their grip around the gaming industry's neck we can still see examples of truly wonderful pieces of art, the memories of which linger long, long after the main storyline is finished and detailes became fuzzy. And Bastion is one of the better examples of games as art, where the story is conveyed in its own unique manner that couldnt've been done in the form of a book or a movie. The plot of the game is intelligent, serious, romantic, touching - it has it all for those of us striving for a bit of fairy-tale brilliance in our boring working lives.

												I like Bastion and I recommend it but it's probably not for everyone.The levels are generally well done but choosing the right weapons etc. is quite important which can lead to some frustrating trial-and-error (and a bit of grinding to level-up the weapons too perhaps)The narration and story are going to be loved by some and not others.  I started-off really enjoying it but it does get a bit wearing after a while - there's a change of tone from detatched observation to an almost ""I told you so - harder than you think""-ness about it and it REVELS in revealing that you're nowhere near the end when you think you might be;0It's mostly a charming and enjoyable action game tho and so I kinda point a thumb upwards here...

												Finished this game from start to finish in about 4 and a half hours and I have to say, it is definately one of my favourite games! The narration alone makes the game somewhat fantastic, let alone the music of this game! THE MUSIC.... My god it's just incredible. The gameplay is very fun as well, but I do suggest that you play it with controller, cause I did play part of the game with keyboard, and switching to controller made it much more easier to handle. Would definately play this game again in my spare time if I wanted a little bit of fun, and to complete it 100% :) MUST BUY!			"

												It's wonderful that in the days of the AAA triumph and corporations tightening their grip around the gaming industry's neck we can still see examples of truly wonderful pieces of art, the memories of which linger long, long after the main storyline is finished and detailes became fuzzy. And Bastion is one of the better examples of games as art, where the story is conveyed in its own unique manner that couldnt've been done in the form of a book or a movie. The plot of the game is intelligent, serious, romantic, touching - it has it all for those of us striving for a bit of fairy-tale brilliance in our boring working lives. Mechanics blend into the mix perfectly, being simple enough not to get in the way of the story, and yet complex enough to give some room for imagination and all kinds of neat little tricks that hardcore gamers are prone to. And narrating... Do I even have to mention how good it is and how fresh the whole idea feels?

												A worthwhile adventure. The rundown...The beautiful hand-drawn animations, fun combat, cool story presentation, and great music all come together to make this a great game. Gameplay: Mostly centres around combat, which is very well done, and fun for the duration of the game. As you progress you unlock cool weapons that make a lot out of simple controls. Story: Not particularly amazing BUT the narrator who guides you through the game is so cool. Really incredible presentation, with lots of style - think Firefly (the TV series) mixed into a fantasy world.To consider...- It's got a New Game+ feature so that you can hunt achievements based on modifiers you find. This is good, because the campaign is only about ~5 hours.- Really meant for a mouse and keyboard! The aiming is a little wonky with controllers.			"

												Typically when a game's length comes into question, it's because of triple-digit hours on one save file. However, Bastion is one of those rare flames that petered out too quickly. Whether this complements the strong gameplay and story or serves as a complaint of an unfinished product is up to the reader. I am certain of this, though: some developer somewhere is scribbling down ways to turn Bastion's novel approach to RPGs into a multi-million dollar project. Few games can claim that they revolutionized the industry, and when they do, it's the one simple, novel idea that makes the mark. For Bastion, that's the velvety narrator who comments on nearly every aspect of gameplay. Fall off the landscape? He's got something to say about it. Thwart a boss without getting nicked? Expect a new piece of dialogue. Choose any two weapons? Prepare to methodically run through every combination of equipment. But he does more than simply comment. The narrator tells the story from the perspective of a weathered, rustic old man who's made mistakes and bears the burden of regret. At the same time, he speaks of The Kid as a champion–someone who can make things right. And that's where you come in: as The Kid, you have the opportunity to fix a sort of man-made apocalypse called the Calamity. Finding survivors along the way, The Kid has to restore power back to Bastion, the protagonists' headquarters. By finding crystals through linearly explored areas, The Kid grants Bastion energy, and buildings for some reason. Players have the illusion of choice when deciding which structure to erect, each of which grants some sort of ability or perk. The Arsenal, for example, allows the player to choose which weapons he'd like to equip, as well as a super power. Alternatively, the Shrine invokes the gods, which can make the game more difficult with a slight boost to experience and money; it's worth mentioning that the ways in which a player may increase difficulty are creative and keep the game new. However, all aspects of the game maintain a pine-fresh scent. Initially, Bastion's quick-paced, action-based gameplay is good, simple fun. Truly, without activating an idol or two, the game is a bit on the easy side. Though, should you falter, you're granted one reprieve. An additional pratfall results in running the entire level over again. Normally, a lack of checkpoints in extensive stages is a critical game design flaw, but with adjustable difficulty, this is more than fair. For those looking for a challenge and adrenaline rush, the penalty of running some of the longer levels over again can be enticing; however, those who enjoy whimsical hack-n-slashery need just avoid the idols. Although the game gets harder over time even in its vanilla state, leveling up and weapon upgrades maintain one's interest. When leveling up and choosing a potion to make The Kid stronger, players have several choices to make. Do I want more mobility when holding up my shield, or do I want to have a slight increase to critical chance? Another shop allows players to purchase gods for the Shrine, potions for leveling up perks, and even special powers for the Arsenal. Other buildings include achievements and weapon upgrading with customization. Although Bastion egregiously offers pseudo-choices the way so many other games of its ilk do, the customization, challenges, and achievements are well thought out. Valve and Kongregate will tell you with firsthand experience that easy, medium, and hard difficulty achievements are necessary if goal-setting is going to motivate players even a bit; Bastion has this covered. I completed certain auxiliary objectives without even knowing about them, while others took conscious effort and practice. Thankfully, customization makes challenges easier. In this way, some of the side missions can be thought of more as puzzles with an element of skill, but others will require finesse, alacrity, and accuracy to conquer. However, I didn't find any Excalibur equivalents, and even if I thought I did, my brother glanced over at my screen and asked me how the heck I was using that weapon combination and special power; the sentiments were reciprocated. And isn't this the goal of any designer who includes gameplay options? As alluded to in the beginning of the review, Bastion is more than just gameplay and a novel plot: it's an experience. For those who've read my King's Bounty reviews, you're probably well-aware of my love of color. Modern gaming can be so monochrome and drab that when a game as vibrant as Bastion comes along, the appeal is two-fold; not only is color in itself enticing, but we're so starved for it that our love for it is accentuated. Additionally, not only has Bastion been graced by daubs of the palette, it's extremely busy. While clutter can certainly reach a threshold, Bastion never oversteps its bounds. The developers made sure to keep the minds and eyes of its consumers occupied while not getting in their way. Another marvel of the layout is just how intuitive foreground breakables are. Many other games leave questions as to what can be examined and destroyed, and what is meant to be left alone in the background. Some may complain that foreground pillars and structures can get in the way, but this reviewer perceives that as a necessary evil given how beautiful the game is. But what would a game be without music to match the visuals? Although most of the music is forgettable, some of the tunes have lasting power. Keeping with the atmosphere of a western, the occasional acoustic guitar and harmonica make for some innovative RPG music. However, the aural highlights of Bastion lie in its vocal numbers. Simple instrumentation matched with truly melodious voices grants us serene, wistful songs. Couple this with intelligent lyrics, and Bastion leaves an imprint on anyone with a love of music or beating heart. Typically, voice acting hurts or helps in a humble way. To my knowledge, never has a game been recommended purely because of the voice acting, but Bastion might be the first. Sure, we play games to enjoy deep, fun gameplay and funny or immersive storytelling. However, what if the defining feature was its narrator, and how that story was told? Take away Bastion's voice, and that leaves a pretty good game with fun combat in a slightly unique take on a post-apocalyptic world. With the voice, Bastion isn't just a great game, it's a work of art. Never before had I anticipated a person's name in the credits of a game, just so I could seek them out online and see what they've done and what they will do. I would be absolutely astonished and floored if this is the last we hear of Logan Cunningham. Finally, the controls are what you would expect of a game of this caliber. Nigh-perfect in its intuitive rolling and hit detection, the only complaints I can make are in its auto-targeting mechanism. Due to Bastion's archaic take on defending, players may steer clear of the shield due to its unreliability. When defending, The Kid automatically faces the nearest target, which makes sense. When I close a good, long book, I always feel a little sad, as if I had just said good bye to an old friend. I want to know what happens to the characters that I grew to love, but I have to accept the end and move on. Bastion is a short game, which will run most people around five or six hours. Nevertheless, I feel that same kind of loss. Although I truly believe that Bastion could have doubled its length in terms of gameplay, I'm glad that the story didn't risk imploding on itself. Don't let anyone tell you this is a Diablo clone–that would cheapen Bastion; it needs to be heard to be believed.			"

This game deserved an overwhelmingly positive reviewEven if Bastion is short (just a few hours <11hrs' mine>, depending on how many challenges you're keen on passing with a gold medal rating) it's one of the few games in which the New Game+ (rewinding the whole adventure but keeping the endgame resources) was just as much fun as the first playthrough. The content might be identical, but you've probably missed out on a few platforms the first time around, so you'll have the opportunity of discovering them and testing out your untapped weapons as well.The storytelling is unique and relaxing. While you do work fighting off enemies, the narrator gives you the lowdown. The world you explore is fragmented and broken, but the visual element of the game is gorgeous. Most importantly, Bastion's music ties everything together. I can still hear the bluesy guitar line and the hurt voice of a character you meet early in the game.A game you should buy 10/10 !			"

												Bastion is, and will, probably always be one of my favorite games if not THE favorite game.Bastion at its core is not a really unique game, with simple but fast and fun gameplay.But Bastion relys on something else entirely,the atmosphere.The Graphics, the music, the narrator, everything fits together so perfectly.I listen to the music on my way to school pretty much evey single day. The Graphics  matches perfectly my interests - Blooming, colorfull fantasy and a somewhat Steampunky Atmosphere. Everything is wonderfully designed, every level has a unique feeling to it and nothing seems to be repetetive.And then there is the narratorBastion would probably lack something if the narrator wouldn't be there. Everytime i hear this old fella i feel like coming home, with such a wonderfull gravely and 'Old man from the west' Voice that you will easily get into the game in no time.Here is a real advice though:Go into the game with no real expectations, take your time, play it at a time where you don't have to worry about things, get yourself your favorite Drink and enjoy this wonderfull piece of an Adventure.I highly reccommend you to buy this game, especially when its on Sale.

												Bastion is by far one of the greatest games that I've played. Although the game is linear, it's easy to forget that as you slowly uncover the details of what caused the Calamity. In addition, there is a large amount of customizability with what weapons you use, and they allow for many different playstyles. In addition, instead of picking an arbitrary difficulty at the beginning (For example, if you pick between easy and hard, what makes hard more difficult than easy?), the game allows you to create your own challenge - while also rewarding you with more EXP if you choose to do so. The storytelling in the game is also phenomenal, and makes replaying the game so much more fun - because you can't catch every detail in your first play through. I've beaten the game many times and still notice something new each time. Overall, this is a great game and shows that Supergiant Games will definitely continue to be a great video game company.  "

												This game is the bastion of a well-designed RPG, and game (heh). Now that we've got that one pun out of the way, I truly do think that Bastion is one of the best RPG games out there, especially because it focuses on untraditional aspects of a game, and focuses on making a game a piece of art.Obviously, Bastion does the RPG-part of an RPG well. The plot is pretty well-crafted (no big holes), and I truly do buy into the story of the game. The characters are well-made, and while they lack a bit of depth (the game is a bit short compared to, let's say, Skyrim), they're still pretty cool. The in-game mechanics also are pretty good, and fit into the RPG-ish genre: you run around on an isometric platform, using your weapons to defeat the many nefarious enemies you'll encounter. You upgrade (and sidegrade) your character, weapon choice, and even game difficulty as the game goes on. All things normal for an RPG, and all things done well.I think where the game excels is the concept of art, and art in the game. First of all, the game is very visually appealing. According to the creators, Supergiant Games, the entire game is hand-painted; I've got to give kudos to their painting. The landscape is breathtaking, enemies really do look and feel like enemies, and each part of the map has its own special graphical feel (e.g. forests, swamps, cities). From an audio standpoint, there's also this narrator that accompanies you around the game, and he's one of the best serious narrators I've encountered. In addition, the soundtrack is absoutely amazing. Whoever they hired to do their sound really puts you into the game: common RPG tropes like ""boss-fight music"" are done very well, and the atmosphere is set during troughs of playtime. I've even added some of the songs on Spotify, and that's something I rarely see from video games.The game is also replayable (there's a new game + mode), and has a mechanism called ""shrines"" that can make the game harder, for better rewards. Plus, as you level up and gain access to more weapons, different playstyles are available.Overall, Bastion is one of the best RPGs I've played in a long time, and I definitely think it's worth its selling price. It functions well as an RPG game, but also has the added bonus of being a well-developed piece of art. If you're someone who likes games that are both fun to play and fun to just watch and listen, Bastion's definitely the game for you.			"

												Once again, close friends and strangers of the internet, I'm back to review a game. I rarely feel the need to instantly write a review for a game; I generally like to replay the game so that I can see it from multiple angles (with the exception of FarCry 3-Blood Dragon. I've suffered enough. However, this game is still making my hands tremble from excitement some 12 seconds after I finished it. Without any further build-up, I give you... The Review Developed by Supergiant Games, Bastion sets place is a post apocalyptic world (Man, this steam sale I really went all out in Post-apocalyptic games) I don't really want to give too much away about the story (That's a lie, I really do want to, but for you, loyal or disloyal reader, I won't), the whole experience really is a journey more that a game. The excellent storytelling by voice actor Logan Cunningham was exceptional. This guy has the sexiest voice since Morgan Freeman. Seriously, his voice is like velvet. I loved the story all the way through. I did feel like it was balancing on the edge of getting repetitive like some kind of tight rope walker of dullness, but it never crossed that line, creating a rich game with plenty of replay value (Blood Dragon, Take note)Okay, now to something I can never seem to appreciate outside of the video gaming world.  ART!!!  This game was beautiful. It removed all need for me to go outside or even leave my chair. The way the world generated itself around you did a great many things including1. Add to the uniqueness of the game2. Create a need for completionist to search every single edge with the hope it might create a secondary pathand, subsequently3. Make REPLAY VALUE (*Cough Cough Blood Dragon)The art design of the characters, enemies, scenery and weapons was truly something to be admired. Hats off to Jen Zee, the god in human form who made this exist.The music of this game was a delicacy. I know I say this a lot with my reviews but I'm seriously considering putting the soundtrack on my phone. It always perfectly supported the art style, the story at that point and Logan Cunningham's sexy voice (Call me!)The combat was smooth and also commendable. Players had the choice of 13 different weapons (Excluding the battering ram) and were required to choose a melee and a range as well as a special move. The special moves were never over powered but they certainly did aid combat and contrasted against what was never dull combat. The combat in itself was great. There was a countering system which, though difficult to perform, were occasionally the only way to do serious damage to an enemy (This often depended on the weapons you chose.) The weapons you chose definitely affected the game. Weapons varied in range, speed and some required reloading and cooldowns. I choose to use the hammer and the duel pistols, however I'm sure everyone who's played this game will have less then positive opinions on my loadout. It really does depend on the individual play styles. The weapons could be upgraded, which was both significant and necessary to the game.Along with the main story line, there were also trials that you could do on the side for each specific weapon. Receiving a high score would earn you either third, second, or first prize depending on how quickly you completed the trial, how well you completed the trial or how many shots it took you to complete the trial. The rewards ranged from an upgrade for a specific weapon, the games currency or even a special move if you took first place. I was discouraged to say the least when I couldn't unlock the special move for my duel pistols and could have easily spent another half an hour if my fingers weren't about to start bleeding. This was a great way to add extra content and add to the depth of the game (This is the last reference I'm making to Blood Dragon)One great addition to the game was basically a wave based combat system in which you fought off waves of enemies whilst receiving back-story for one specific character. This was a great way to add depth and extra content to your game. I hope whoever came up with this idea was given a raise. (The back-story for the characters was well written and well voiced by the very sexily voiced Logan Cunningham.Finally, Something I never really explored in the game was the ability to use the shrine. This basically granted bonus XP or currency, but made huge effects onto the game (enemies respawing after you killed them, more enemies, more health and powerful enemies ect. Some shrines even did the reverse, making the game easier.Alright, if I haven't convinced you yet, go visit a doctor. This game deserves your money. Go get it now.Seriously, I'll wait.What are you waiting for?If you haven't got it yet, I'm very disappointed in you. Let's recap.Everything about this game is perfect, except that I'm not playing it right now.Anyway, needless to say, this game receives a 10/10Thanks for reading, see you next time.			"

												Bastion is a game that involves anyone that plays it. It's art, narration and music combined creates an unforgettable experience for the player.The game has a nice story, somewhat predictable, but it still manages to touch the mind to a certain degree.The learning curve is smooth, adding features as you progress, with little ramification.The action can be really fast paced and require skill for those who want the chanllenge, but there's also a mode for those who want to see the story and ""skip"" combatA game that deserves to be in the library of every true gamer out there.

												Bastion is by far one of the greatest games that I've played. Although the game is linear, it's easy to forget that as you slowly uncover the details of what caused the Calamity. In addition, there is a large amount of customizability with what weapons you use, and they allow for many different playstyles. In addition, instead of picking an arbitrary difficulty at the beginning (For example, if you pick between easy and hard, what makes hard more difficult than easy?), the game allows you to create your own challenge - while also rewarding you with more EXP if you choose to do so. The storytelling in the game is also phenomenal, and makes replaying the game so much more fun - because you can't catch every detail in your first play through. I've beaten the game many times and still notice something new each time. Overall, this is a great game and shows that Supergiant Games will definitely continue to be a great video game company.  "

												I missed it back in the days. I thought it's a some diablo clone.My God, how I was wrong. Bastion is the first game in 10 years I think which I started second time. And it was right after my first playthrough.It's just brilliant in every detail and in the same time pretty simple. Brawler with fantastic design of Jen Zee (check her on deviantart) and beautiful story told by strong but gentle voice of the narrator would capture your heart. This part of the game is so good that Bastion don't need any mind-blowing gameplay. But it does. It's simple but solid, skillful and highly addictive. Oh I forgot to mention the music, one word... amazing. Buy it with OST.Do you need any numbers? 89/100			"

												The reason why I bought Bastion was because of the immense praise and positive reviews it recieved on release. That might have been a mistake on my part, since I expected it to be a lot more than what it turned out to be. I didn't get the indie gem I thought I was getting, but instead a mediocre hack n slash with some underwhelming RPG elements slapped on top. It does have one thing going for it admittedly, and that's the presentation. The isometric graphics are beautiful, they were clearly shown a lot of love, and the narration is enjoyable, even though it gets kind of irritating after a while.The gameplay on the other hand is dreadful. It may be responsive and functional, but it is incredibly dull and repetitive and offers little challenge or variation. The levels are essentially all the same, there are no puzzles or interesting gameplay elements to differentiate them, only a slight difference in color hue and tileset. There isn't much enemy variation and it just feels like you're powering through mob after mob to get a little bit of story to keep you going(and the story is only decent at best).My advice is to try the demo and see how you like it, since it will give a pretty good idea what you will do for the rest of the game. Don't believe the hype.			"

												 It's an isometric action indie game (although I don't know how being published by Warner Bros is indie but nevermind that.) This is probably the first indie non-sandbox game I’ve played. It follows through the adventures of a boy the „Kid” who’s entire race was wiped off of the face of the earth „Bastion” by a strange event called the „Calamity”. The „Kid” is trying to salvage through the remains of his civilization exploring the world trying to find clues, and certain items to restore „Bastion” to its former glory.I’ll follow the usual format of game reviews just to make it easier to read.-	Story/QuestsThe story itself is quite mediocre I’d say, there are no mind-blowing twists or hilarious moments in it. The quest mechanic are basically the same „go and fetch this and that” repeating around 16 times which can be tedious after a while. However an unique feature of the game is that EVERYTHING is narrated, no not by Morgan Freeman but by a more „macho” sounding gentleman Logan Cunningham who is also great in what he does. The narration gives an interesting vibe to the game, you feel like you’re part of the story and it feels like „living in the book”, making the fights/progression and story more immersive. The narrator also has some quirky comments when you change your loadout or accidentally fall off of a floating island which made me smile quite a few times. -	Graphics/LooksThe art of the game is beautiful. Every level has a different story, feel to it which makes you forgive the (otherwise tedious) quests. Everything is colorful, rich and vibrant. Thankfully the game doesn’t have any serious system requirements it runs easily on a laptop so you can enjoy it in its full glory. There’s not much more to say, go watch some trailers or gameplay videos :)-	Combat/GameplayThe game is very combat-centric, you don’t have much time to immerse yourself into the game or admire the scenery without getting ♥♥♥♥♥ by the various enemies. It’s like Bioshock Infinite, beautiful and interesting but you must keep on grinding through hordes of various enemies. The enemy variety is alright when you start to get bored there’s always a new type of enemy appearing. The combat itself is surprisingly fun with a great variety in weapons and combat styles. There is no quick-save or even checkpoints, a game is only saved after you successfully finish a level.You have one primary and a secondary weapon slot and a variety of weapons (ranging from katanas to muskets) which you can upgrade. You also have a special ability slot which you can use to throw grenades or place a decoy of yourself to confuse enemies. There’s supposed to be an alchemy system and stealth in the game but I didn’t really want to get into it, I stick to my guns thanks. The combat is incredibly fast-paced and hectic with tons of enemies coming at you, sometimes you even feel like you’re playing an isometric „Shoot ’em Up” dodging projectiles all the time. The game is HARD, the enemies hit hard even on easy difficulty you find yourself grasping for breath, looking for health potions and trying to survive. You have three chances to „respawn” after dying if you exceed it then you must start the level all over again. There are the usual boss batles and you should apply a different strategy for different foes.Conclusion:Bastion is a fun little game, but it has its flaws. I love reading classic literature in my free time so my expectations of a „story” are quite high when I play video games. The game is beautiful, the combat is fun but challenging, and the narration brings a refreshing change to the storytelling. I recommend it to people who like games with an unique world, and lore but who also like getting their hands dirty in frequent fights. I don’t recommend it to people who don’t like hard fast paced, crazy combat and to people who don’t like to start a level all over again. The game takes around 6-8 hours to beat, but I heard that there are two different endings so it gives some replay value (I didn't really care about the story so one playthrough was enough for me :) )Story 6/10Graphics 9/10Combat 8/10Overall 8/10Oh I forgot to mention:THE SOUNDTRACK IS F*****ING AMAZING!!!!I mean really, I was even thinking of putting it on my phone just to listen to it its so great.

A Modern ClassicIf there was Five Indie games that everyone should play, bastion would be among those games. The game offers are kickass soundtrack among lots of replayability, with great combat system and variety of different weapons (that you can upgrade and customize) there is plenty to do, whatever its unlocking everything or setting higher records on weapon challenges. Narrator is also pretty badassPositives Strong Rock/Western Soundtrack that brings unique feel to the game Epic Narrator  Lot of replay value Multiple Weapon choices to fit different playstyles Smooth controls and gameplay, it feels very responsive and no complaints thereNegatives Bit lackluster story I wish the maingame was bit longer "

												Oh man, where do I start? I absolutely LOVE this game. It is one of my favorite indie games that I've ever played (though I do still have a lot left to get around to!).The story of Bastion is definitely an interesting one, and the way you learn more of the details is relatively simple but intriguing. For instance, learning through the Dream levels turns out to be more fun than you would expect. The perspective of the characters shifts as the game goes on and it definitely has you wonder what is going on.I liked the frame of everything with the narration, but I don't want to spoil any of the story so I won't say any more. The graphics of the game are great; it is straight up beautiful to look at. Very nice sound all around, and I love the music it has. The actual vocal songs they created were amazing as well and fit the style of their scenes almost perfectly.Gameplay-wise, Bastion still continues pulling things off. There are enough unique enemies and bosses in the game to keep things interesting, and the weapons available also allow for you to test out different builds. The development of the Bastion is nice, even if you end up building everything in one playthrough (meaning you can't necessarily make a ""bad"" choice of what to build). But it helps tie everything into the world as a whole. Each level has a unique feeling to it and definitely keeps me focused. The training grounds for the weapons give you some nice challenges to overcome, and all of them are certainly doable. The potions you can equip further your build for Kid.All in all, Bastion is just an amazing game. It keeps you focused and interested, with next to nothing wrong with the game at all. I never got bored with it, and I never will. I have played it multiple times since it was released, and I am always excited to play it every time I return.			"

Bastion is a hack n' slash role playing game, however this game has some really interesting aspects that contrast from other games inside the same genre.You play as ""The Kid"" someone that just woke up in the middle of a catastrophe that neither the player nor the character know anything about, however we can count on the strong presence of the Narrator to enlighten us during our adventure.I want my first point on this review to be exactly about the Narrator, something that really standed out from any game I've ever played. We are used to games which story develops over time with strong interactions between characters, or with the environment however in Bastion, every interaction is very  subtle, and that's where the Narrator comes in, as someone telling and unfolding a story and interacting as much with the main character as with the player himself which is awesome. And the developers really hit gold here, since first of all the voice fits perfectly on the western theme that surrounds the game, and at the same time the voice acting is also amazing, since you can feel every emotion which helps create a certain empathy with this being, and that's something fundamental in this story.Since we're talking about voices and sounds let's jump to the soundtrack, which after the Narrator is the best aspect of the game, since it manages to develop and transform according to the story which is phenomenal. You'll understand what i mean since it's quite rare to hear a soundtrack which contain tracks with lyrics, and even though I think that including something like that is risky since it could break the atmosphere of the game, it does exactly the opposite and traps you even more on this brilliant story.Now onto the gameplay, this is up to you to decide if it is a good thing or not according to your standards but to me it felt like the combat and exploration is something secondary. Don't get me wrong, the combat is fun and this aspect of the game is very well developed with a big array of weaponry, abilities and upgrades. The developers even managed to make this part of the game more interesting with the fact that all the way to the last part of the game you unlock a new mechanic, however it didn't feel as good as the plot, which was what really kept me going.The visuals are very interesting, the 2D visuals with the isometric camera really fitted into the style, nevertheless some models seemed quite odd, as an example the main character which on some drawings shows up as someone quite slim, when you look at the model you see someone quite bulky which doesn't make much sense. Same goes for Rucks which the model doesn't look that good either.Something that also bugged me was the fact that you're being told a story and all of a sudden the game gives you the option to make a couple decisions on the final stage and to me it felt out of place, I think you should be either given more choices to make or none at all. Although i think I'll play this game again someday I can't justify playing the main storyline for 5 hours again just to make a diferent decision at the end and see an alternate ending, but if I had more choices throughout the game I could justify a second playthrough immediately after the first one.Nonetheless I consider this game to be a master piece, the story is interesting, the length feels just right and the western/badass vibe throughout the game is an amazing experience.+ Great story;+ Fun mechanics;+ Amazing Atmosphere;- Some models are just ugly;- Lack of more decisions.92% cool game!Join my Steam Group page for more reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/jereviews "

I mean you've got your different weapons and places and the narrator sounds cool. I mean, I'm happy I got this for free, but i'd definitely buy it if it's on sale.

I don't think I have enough hours under my belt to really give describe in detail what I feel makes it awesome, I know there's still a lot for me to discover in the game, but from I saw already, it's definitely worth checking out.

												Buy this. Now.Seriously, this game is possibly one of the greatest games I have ever played- the story is phenominal, the characters interesting and deep, the atmosphere hauntingly beautiful, and the most important to me, it NEVER felt like an indie title. The game stars a set of four characters after the 'Calamity', a mysterious force that next to destroyed the world. You play as 'The Kid', and head to Bastion to meet ""The Stranger"", who narrates your story to build the Bastion and give hope to the new world. Along the way you meet Zulf, a fabulous character and probably one of the best in any game ever, and Zia- a young Singer who brings a vision of innocence and childlike wonder to the otherwise bleak world.I've played through the game three times, and every time I notice something new- some piece of narration with a second meaning, or even a theory about the world I hadn't seen before. If you can't pay for this game now, buy it when it hits the sale shelf.Overall, this is one of the most flawless games I've ever played. 10/10.			"

												From the second you drop into the game ~ quite literally ~ you're greeted by a deep, rich voice who decides to narrate your every move from that point on. You travel through numerous regions filled with gorgeous handpainted artwork, finding an arsenal of unique, diverse weapons and learn to master them all through various trials of skill. Finally, as you come closer and closer to the end of the line, you slowly uncover the pieces of a heartbreaking tale between two peoples that leads to the calamity.4 years later, this game still has high replay value and I constantly listen to the soundtrack outside of the game.Awesome story. Awesome narration. Awesome music. Awesome gameplay. Awesome game. One of the best games I've ever played.			"

												I've played some great games this year, but I honestly think this was my favourite. One of the most cleverly developed aesthetics I've seen, and more significantly, heard. Worth twice the meagre pennies it's available for. Though I will warn you that it's hard to play Bastion and not start to hear a narration for everything you do afterwards...			"

												Play this Game.I bought Bastion back when it first showed up on Steam and I played a while but I never got the chance to finish. Recently I was looking for something different to play so I thought I'd fire Bastion up again and give it a play through. I love this game.Bastion is about a boy who ""wakes up"" in the middle of what the game calls the Calamity. Your story is narrated as you (this boy) progress through levels that build themselves around you. This should not be confused with procedurally generated levels, rather there's a hint of where a path should be and as you move, tiles form up around you. This is a pretty cool effect even if it's totally linnear. As you progress the story deepens, you find new weapons, upgrades, secrets etc. to battle your way through the game's enemies with a goal of restoring the Bastion, the game's home point. I never found the combat to be particularly challenging, with enemies brodacatsting attacks well before they happen and picking up fairly predictable patterns to counter. Your weapons and skills are more than strong enough to handle everything the game throws at you. You will have the opportunity to make things harder on yourself as you complete more peices of the Bastion if you wish. Weapons can be upgraded at the Bastion's forge, adding extra damage, or critical chance etc. You'll also be able to switch out skills and buy power up type items to help you along. And at the end you'll get to unlock a new game plus mode which adds a little replayability.Level design is pretty cool, as I mentioned above the world forms around you as you move along. Sometimes leading to dead ends, sometimes leading to secret areas containing upgrade materials, or new story items, even companion type characters. It's worth exploring every corner you can in these well built, beautifully rendered, but often very small areas. The story itself is at first just a narration of what you do as the game's hero character, but soon enough you'll start to feel it coalescing into something bigger. As you play, the game's narrator continues to tell the stories of the boy and various survivors of the calamity. This takes place in the game itself along with aquiring items to learn about and that help tell the history of the Bastion and it's home world and the people who inhabit it. Once things begin to move the story progresses quickly and in my opinion is told pretty masterfully. Now, Ive heard of people complaining about the narration of the game. Saying that he's too involved, or too in your face. That he never shuts up and they just want to play the game. I'm sorry to say that you can't shut the narrator off for those of you who may find him annoying. But on the other hand, he's the one telling the story, and Bastion is a story driven game so you need the narrator. I personally loved listening to him, the voice is pleasant, smooth and to me at least was nothing close to invasive. The narrator is integral to the game's story being told so you'll just have to deal with it and even if you don't like listeing to him I'm sure as things go on you'll at least be interested in what he has to say. The story itself is emotial, fairly deep and told really really well.As is usual these days the game is short, around 6 hours I think total with potential of a couple more if you complete the optional mini games. But the fact is the story is fully told in this time, so you get a feeling of completion even though you it's a short play through, and with new game plus you can double the play value and still have fun.Bastion, also has an epic sound track. ""Zia's song"", and the end theme ""Coming Home"" are two that stick out in my head. I believe the game even comes with a copy of the sound track if I remember corrctly. In conclusion, Bastion, is a beautiful, short, story driven game with an excellent story and great original music. It's inexpensive and worth a play through. Give it shot I'm sure you'll dig it. "

												I cannot sing the praises of this game enough. I went into this knowing next to nothing, not even knowing how well praised it is. This has become my favorite game. The story is interesting and quite grim. There are no cutscenes or excessive text. It doesn't try to be a movie, it's a very subtle and gameplay driven story. The Narrator's voice gives Morgan Freeman a run for his money. The gameplay is fun and stays fresh for the most part. Interesting enemies and lore. The art style is beautiful, I adore how the land forms at your feet.And the soundtrack? Don't even get me started on the soundtrack. It is PHENOMENAL. I could listen to it nonstop. There is not a single song that is any less than the others. There are a few songs that have singers, which is usually a no-no in video games, but it suits the situation perfectly.The one thing that really bothers me only applies to you if you want to complete every little thing in the game like I do. It's no problem if you're a ""finish the story then I'm out"" kind of person. But the grinding. To buy every upgrade for every weapon, you have to beat Who Knows Where many times, or replay New Game+ multiple times. It gets stale, but I need to beat the Calamity Cannon training grounds, dammit!Bottom line, buy it. I'd wait for a Steam Sale (then again, I do for everything), but it's worth every cent. Supergiant Games deserves it so they can hopefully make more awesomeness. I can't wait to try Transistor.			"

												Original review by 17 year-old Luke: ""A narrator who compares with even Morgan Freeman, challenging gameplay and a deep story - with a unique storytelling style. If you have working hands: play this game.""While 19 year-old Luke agrees, I feel as though there's more to say, since looking back at Bastion: it still feels like one of my most significant gaming experiences of ever.That viewpoint is perhaps somewhat nostalgic; this was one of the first real PC games I played back when I was still primarily a console gamer. So I will look back on it with that same sense of importance as Assassin's Creed 2 or Uncharted 2, the first two PlayStation 3 games I played.Nevertheless, there are elements of this game that make it recommendable to anyone, despite its personal significance to myself and the close friends who played and discussed it with me back then.Firstly, the narration is exquisite - and yes, past-luke, it does compare to Morgan Freeman. The narration really draws you into the world quite quickly, and although I don't have a vivid memory of the world that the game was set in, I do have a vivid memory of the (protagonist) kid's adventure through that world. The narration is your first contact with that world, right into the game's ending moments - which I won't spoil, but I will say that they are very well crafted from a storytelling perspective.Secondly, I said the game had challenging gameplay. I'm not sure why I said that really. I did die a few times, but that was just because I wasn't used to playing with a keyboard and mouse more than anything. As James (M!dD3) points out in his comment, the gameplay is straightforward and simple, with a wide array of weapons to choose from and experiment with. And for those who want more out of a game's challenge - there are indeed way to buff your enemies in the name of bragging rights.For me though, the gameplay wasn't a prominent factor. More important was the music, the soundtrack is amazing and undefinable by common genres. I've heard it described as ""acoustic frontier trip-hop"", so....yeah. Lovely. I still listen to that soundtrack today, and everyone I've encouraged to listen to it has loved the sounds: from friends my age, to adults, to grandparents.However, a game's soundtrack isn't rated by the quality of the sounds alone; in-game that is an irrelevant quality. But the music fits the game perfectly. I can still recall the chilling hammer-on-stone clangs of ""mine, windbag, mine' as I entered an eerie stage and began to learn more of the truth of the strange world. And don't even get me started on ""build that wall"" and ""mother, I'm here"" - or better yet, their lovechild: ""setting sail, coming home"", to this day one of my favourite songs.The artstyle is equally captivating while in game, there's a certain childish element to the designs that mix with the seriousness of the plot - summing up the kid's overburdened mindset perfectly. There's a reason that kid looks so melancholy on the game's cover art.And I suppose that brings me to the final element that I mentioned, the game's ""deep plot"". Yes, well, that's one way to put it. Let me just say the decisions I made in that game hold true to the way I intend to continue to view my failures and embrace the future for the rest of my life. That is by no means an overstatement, or some pretentious interpretation of the game's plot. This game is simple and important, that's all there is to it. So, as past-luke rightfully said: ""if you have working hands: play this game.""Storytelling: 1/1Plot: 1/1Gameplay: [who even cares, just play it]/10Visuals: 9/10 (impressively beautiful, but not the recommendation-point on this one)Soundtrack: 11/10 (the music itself is 100% recommendable, even if you don't play the game - check it out right now if you're reading this)Do I get a boner just thinking about this game?: Yes/Yes			"

												Bastion is an amazing indie title about world after apocalypse. You control silent protagonist which is narrated by someone who has replaced his vocal cords with  chocolate candy and that voice guides the protagonist through levels. Throughout progression you find 2 human survivors and 4 pets that will accompany you in Bastion when you return from your quest. I liked the part where you picked up Zia, the  singer. Her song is so beautiful that you don't want her to stop, but unfortunatelly you have to. I think it's the best episode in the whole game. The story is quite interesting and engaging, because you'll care about your new found friends and pets. Gameplay is quite fun, you run around and smash various creatures with your weapon of choice (mine was Brushers Pike and Mortar) and retrieve Cores and Crystal shards to make Bastion functional again. You get quite big weapon arsenal and passive abilities (which comes in the shape of alcohol) to chose from. If you wondering whenever you should buy it the answer is yes, definately fun, aestheticly pleasing and good quality product. 8/10			"

												Beatifully made indie game which is very rare these games. Has a very well fitted and nice soundtrack, the music always seems to kick in at the perfect times. Story is very nicely done and worth the sale price you can pick it up for. Combat flows very well as a whole with the rolling mechanic being very smooth with its transition in combat. The only real fault i could put against it would be minor nitpicks like the lack of sprint, or the lack of replayability. All in all it is a nicely made game that can be picked up for a good price. TL;DR: Good game, nice story, smooth flowing gameplay, fun fighting, beautiful graphics, Nice narrator  = Yay.No Sprint, Slow at times, lack of replayability = Nay			"

												Bastion and Limbo are the most artistic games I played, and also really satisfying experiences. These two made me really interested in Indie games.Bastion feels like anything but a soulless game when I play it. It's really a captivating experience. The music is truly awesome, that narrator is an impressive feature, the story is flawless and the mood it creates is irresistible. Bastion is simply amazing.Of all games I played, it has the best soundtrack by far. Check this for an example:

Easy to play with extra options to increase the difficulty for a higher reward. The combat feels a bit lacking, but the game is definitely not a chore to play.

												One of my all time favorite games.  Bastion tells the tale of ""The Kid"", (possibly) a young man waking up in the aftermath of what's deemed ""The Calamity,"" a disaster that overtook the entirety of Caelondia.  From there, you're on a journey to restore the Bastion, a place of sanctuary for when the situation arose.The story creates a perfect world where details are up to the player's interpretation, being quite scarce and vague overall on the land itself, and the landmarks which litter it.  Throughout the game, you're given a beautifully executed narrative by Logan Cunningham, who - with every step of the way - informs you of your progress as you roll along, and provides interesting pieces that could tell a thing or two about the land's past, or your own. The game is played from an Isometric perspective, with that being the camera being held at around an seventy-five degree angle.  Gameplay can often be mixed up to however your choosing with two weapon slots for you to make use of. Two melee weapons or two devastating range weapons?  Sure, why not. The game can provide wider mix of playstyles as well, having access to a special skill to make use of between your two weapons, it can turn the tide of battle in your favor.  Furthermore, the game can give you special ""tonics"" that you can equip within the game's Distillery that can give you a boost to help your survive longer in battle, or to compliment your playstyle of being at a distance or up close.With it's hand drawn art, intricate story, fairly diverse gameplay, deep narrative, and great soundtrack, I'd say this game is well worth the money you put into it.

												""Abstract"" ""Indie"" games is where all the (K)ool Kids are. Just about recently, gamers are regularly met with a surfeit of these indie games that have a history of HYPE. Too bad most of them turn out to be vaporware or pretentious garbage. But there is that minute gleam of light that promises quality. Supergiant Games, thankfully, ends up being one of the few that actually develop decent games. Bastion, the game in question, is not one that should be adjudged ""decent"", but rather, astounding. Far from flawless, as this game is locked at 30 frames (Just, why?), but an overall stellar game that is worth every penny, or whatever crap currency you wield.Meet the Kid. One of the handful of survivors that has endured the Calamity. This catastrophic event brought the whole world to ruin. He sets off to the Bastion, where he is greeted by Rucks, the Stranger, with words claiming that the recent disaster can be undone. By constructing the Bastion back to health with monument cores and shards there are odds of restoring Caelondia and its neighbor lands to a time before hell unleashed, hence the title of this game. Throughout the Kid's travels to seek out the materials needed, players will learn more about the world and its people and you get to learn the backstories of the few survivors you come across as the game progresses. It might seem engrossing, but the story is where Bastion falls shortest. The journey with the Kid was complete in every angle it is viewed in, but it was also rushed from start to end, and had inadequate time to develop. Build-up starts to occur profusely around the last third of the game, only to conclude in some half-baked ending that proved to be unfufilling. Despite the mediocre narrative, Bastion is a feast for the eyes and ears due to it's gorgeous presentation.It is not an overstatement when it is said that this game has the potential to be sold solely on it's presentation. Hell, some have avowed that they bought the soundtrack before the damn game. It's just that damn delicious. Bastion's visuals is where that abstract tag comes into play, because it is most certainly what most reckon to be unconventional. The playing stage constructs itself as you tread along the path and the camera is complimented by a shiny filter, and other things I won't bother typing as it's better experienced than read. The soundtrack, done by composer Darren Korb, is brimful with impressive songs that seemlessly attach to the rest of the presentation. I'm not one that gushes over video game OSTs, but this one is pretty damn good, and I'm convinced everyone that isn't a moron agrees.If only it wasn't locked at thirty frames...that idea bothers me way to f****** much.Even with such wondrous superficial values, a game is crap if it isn't fun, and it is relieving to know that Bastion succeeds in this fundamental aspect too. Not much can be said about it however, it's just the average action-adventure game with a few tweaks that enable it to distinguish itself from the rest. The Kid can be equipped with 2 weapons at once and he has a ""secret"" move, and by, of course, playing the game (no way), the Kid is met with unlocks in his arsenal and attributes that gradually form him to an impetus of destruction by the end of the game. Sounds a little, unamusing, but this is without the mention of the copious ways one can up their game. The game played vanilla is laughably easy, but there are shrine idols that can unexpectedly rise its difficulty, which is recommended. There are also Vigils to complete for moneys, and wave-based side missions to earn more moneys and achievements, and a New Game Plus option that actually bears fruit! All of this will keep many entertained for a appreciable amount of time, around 20 hours or so maximum.There's more to be said, but I'm done. Bastion is a worthwhile game that I'm sure many have already invested their time in, and I hope people continue to pick this up. Supergiant Games is a talented developer, and they only demonstrate so with this installation. Where it fails in storytelling makes up in well-done game-structure and incredible graphics and sound. I'm looking foward to playing more entries from this group.Still haven't played Transistor at the time of this review, so I need to get to that quick.			"

												Do you want a new and exciting game? Look no further. There is no imitation, Bastion is unique in many ways and for it, it is a breath of fresh air. I cannot say how grateful I am for the release of this game. It helped me enjoy gaming again in a sea of sameness and overdone sequels.The mechanics are simple enough to learn, but complex enough to enjoy. The mix of upgrading weapons, using different potion upgrades and adding different gods in the shrine make for unique challenges throughout.The story is bizarre in a way, but everything is explained with enough context through out so that you keep pushing to learn more and more, eventually feeling sad for what they had brought upon themselves.

												Bastion is a fine action-adventure game set in a fantastic world after a near apocalyptic event. The scenery is superb, beautiful places that show some of this world's former glory. The gameplay is quite varied, as there is a wide variety of weapons, each with their respective upgrades and secret skills, that you can combine in every way you want. You can also customize the difficulty by invoking different gods that will make foes stronger in a variety of ways, while providing you with greater rewards.The soundtrack is another strong point for this game. Each song seems fitting to the situation you're currently in, and there's plenty of them.Finally, the story is very well crafted. The narration aspect is quite interesting, and as you progress, it begins to make more and more sense. Not to mention that a second playthrough, in New Game+, will add new details.All in all, a highly recommendable game.			"

												Fair warning:  I will most likely be gushing for duration of this review, about how brilliant this game is.  The art direction and graphical assets complement the isometric perspective.  The music stands out being one of the more solid sounds tracks I've heard in recent dates.""  The game play is simple; yet deep enough to warrant multiple play throughs.  The story is nothing short of a brilliant.  I'd highly recommend this game to anyone; it's one that simply can't be passed up. Cons: Very few.I once had a interface issue, but it was resolved with a simple restart.			"

												Bastion: The first game made by Supergiant Games. Also the first amazing game they created.Bastion's a hack and slash action-adventure game, and a great one at that. You play as ""The Kid"", who stumbles upon the Bastion after the Calamity's wiped pretty much everything out. Your job? Restore the Bastion. You'll go through a relatively short, but well written story, with a small amount of replayability and lots of challenges along the way.Pros: -Great soundtrack-Great story-The game looks amazing with the color/lighting scheme-Amazing narration-Somewhat challenging achievements for the completionist-Many different ways to play the game, from difficulty to weaponsCons:-Not too much replayability - After NG+/Score Attack, you're pretty much done.Overall:Easily in my Top 10 Favorite Games. A great soundtrack + stellar narration + variety of playstyles + a great story + a fantastic looking game? That's a combo for a successful game right there. At $15, it might seem slightly overpriced, but take my word for it - It's not. That said, if you can pick it up for even a penny less, do so, as you for sure won't regret it.  "

												I recently reviewed this game for my game review blog, Five Penny Review. If you enjoy this review, please visit my page:http://fivepennyreview.blogspot.com/2013/04/bastion.htmlWhat sets this game apart?Conceptually, Bastion could be considered a fairly typical action RPG.  It features a silent protagonist, a small cast of enemies, a selection of weapons for which you develop new skills as you progress, and a combat system heavy on combos and dodge rolling.  What makes it unique is its presentation, and to say that Bastion is an artistic endeavor would be an understatement.  The art creates a world somewhere between catastrophe and storybook, the music has a multicultural feel that creates something familiar but foreign.  The only character to speak is the narrator, who is a constant presence in the game and provides information about the world, the characters, and your course of action, serving as both storyteller and tutorial.  The way this was accomplished creates an experience that envelops you in what would otherwise be a decent game.What is the difficulty factor?The tutorials for Bastion are pretty straight forward, and the controls are fairly simple to pick up and play.  The narrator also does a good job providing little hints for moving forward, especially early in the game.  The timing for dodge rolling, blocking with your shield, and even just attacking can take some time to master and feel a bit clumsy, especially given the differences in the available weapons.  The weapon proving grounds provide a good method for mastering the techniques for various weapons.As far as the challenge curve goes, Bastion does a great job of starting off easy and escalating slowly to a proper difficulty.  The proving grounds and dream sequences allow you to build up your level and money, often while earning new techniques.  If you aren’t feeling challenged, the shrine allows you to drastically increase the difficulty of specific aspects of the game to increase your rewards, allowing you to customize the difficulty of the game in a unique way.Does it use media effectively?Bastion has a very stylized appearance that gives it a persistent otherworldly feeling, like you are experiencing a dream or watching the illustrations of a story book.  The enemies and foreground objects are often strange and brightly colored, the world itself is made up of chunks of ground floating in mid-air that form as you progress, and the backgrounds consist of little more than gradient colors and clouds.  The culmination of this look is a sense of nihilistic beauty, which seems appropriate in drawing the audience in to the story of the survivors of a world shattering apocalypse.The music in Bastion is a bit hard to describe, both because of its occasional strangeness and the obvious scope of its influences.  At its core there is often a folksy acoustic guitar, but many of the tracks feature distinctly eastern sounds as well.  The lyrics are simple and poignant, and the vocal tracks have a haunting beauty to them.  Ultimately, the music has the same effect as the visuals, to draw you in to a place that is both alien and beautiful, and reminding you of what has been lost to the world you explore.Best moment in the game?While not a specific moment, the best thing about this game to me was Rucks, the narrator.  Voice actor Logan Cunningham did a great job creating a character that sounded familiar and warm, further connecting you to what could otherwise be a somewhat alien world.  Rucks serves as a storyteller and historian for the viewer as the game progresses, serving as the medium for each major plot point in the game, and telling you about the history of places, events, and character as they become relevant to the story.  In addition, he provides commentary as you move through each level.  There is something shocking about the first time you hear Rucks provide commentary on what is happening in the course of a battle, something that seems like it could not be scripted, but obviously must be.Who needs to play this game?Once again, I would encourage all brands of gamer to check out this game.  Bastion uses great art, music, and storytelling to create an environment that you can be drawn into.  The action may not always be on par with some modern titles and parts of the game may not feel especially challenging, but the gameplay is always fun and the sliding difficulty scale will help keep you under pressure.  Bastion is available to purchase and download on the X-Box Live Arcade and on Steam.			"

												Quite an amazing indie title. [Scroll down for Intro, Pros, Cons, Pseudocons, and Conclusion]Intro:Its controls are simple and utilitarian, anyone could pick it up and have a good time. Sometimes it's bad if a game is too easy; but I've never once felt that Bastion was too easy. Bastion is a piece of art which drops you (literally, often) into the middle of ""The Calamity"", which destroyed this town of yours, which you are completely unfamiliar with. The storyline is explained through narration. The narration, which reminds me a bit of Ron Perlman (Fallout narrator and actor), is extremely well done and the narrator himself is given his own characterization. Your own character never talks, but the narrator speaks through you, always in the past tense. When you do certain things, the narrator reacts. I chose a bone-repeater and a War Machete, and the narrator commented that weapons don't have to be complicated to be effective [along those lines, at least].The upgrade system for weapons is based on levels which are increased by finding one material and spending some in-game currency; and with each level you can choose one of two traits and it is always available to change it back. The distillery allows you to keep two drinks, but since only beneficial drinks were able to be served in town (I like it when the devs describe game mechanics, even if it isn't perfect. It adds character to the town) you can choose perks from the drinks, including an increased crit rate at full health, more health, a larger radius to collect money, instant crits at very low health, and many more which I have forgotten or not unlocked.The story keeps me intrigued, with this mysterious town, and my gradual learning of what happened. I am excited to play more.Pros:Nice artwork, simple fighting and controls, non-punishing mechanics, nice story, cool narrator. A nice variety of combat choices. It isn't ever edgy, inappropriate, or brutally violent for no reason. Kid friendly, but was designed for adults. Many challenges and upgrades to work for.Cons: It's an easy game, which would bore me if it wasn't a good game.Pseudocons [NOTE: These are cons which I included to warn those that may not like this particular developer's choice. I love Fallout 3, for instance, but some may hate that you can't earn every perk and get 100% in every skill] : A very basic level-up system, which has no real permanent choices. There is no real choice in the storyline, ie, it is linear. Most of the game is just mashing click to attack, right click to range-attack, shift to block/parry, and f to heal: potentially repetitive combat.Conclusion: If you are new to Video Games, or if you are a veteran, you'd like it. Great gift for kids or your S.O.  "

												Four hours into this game and it's definitely worth saying a few things. I'll start with the graphics only because the style in which this world is built is breathtaking. The art direction is watercolours, and do they ever add a fluidity to the movements of The Kid, the silent protagonist of whom you are controlling in this adventure. The colours themselves either have an undeniable shine to them that gently turn into black and white as your health decreases. So does your vision, which I found to be a great mechanic to have.The story is unique in where a narrator occassionally comments on your actions, while giving the player a sense of direction of where they are going and why. Honestly it's the only sense of direction you are likely to receive, given as to how each level is ""summoned"" step by step.A final word would be on the soundtrack. It goes with the game perfectly. What else is there to say?Get yourself this game if you're a fan of Adventure games!			"

												Why I play games is both for the challenge of the gameplay and the immersion of the story itself. On both counts Bastion is superb. The story itself can be hard to grasp while you're too busy learning the ropes and not trying to die, but this only serves to make replaying it all the more rewarding. You're in a post-apocalyptic world, and all you have is the voice of a Stranger guiding your steps, to build a Bastion where all can be safe, all can be rebuilt, though your enemies won't see it that way. If you take advantage of all the game has to offer, you'll find that your skills have been challenged to the utmost and you are the better for it; and tears may come to your eyes when you make your final choice.

												This is one of the indie classics. Shame NOT to play it. It's got great gameplay AND great writing, particularly considering how cool the constant narration of your actions is.If I had any complaint, it would be that Xbox 360 gamepad controls pretty much don't work for me, and the game seems to kind of be made for this style of controls. Keyboard+mouse is fine for gameplay but menus can be a little hard to navigate sometimes.Oh well. It's still an excellent game. Took me a little over 10 hours to do pretty much everything there was in one playthrough, by the way, so if you blitzed through it, the game would probably be like half of that, or even less. But there's New Game Plus (which unlocks some new stuff) and another special mode, not to mention many different challenges and ""quests"" to complete, so there's plenty to do. "

												This game was a breath of fresh of fresh air for me, Purely because of the games i played beforehand. Before this, i played several games, ALL of them Story-based. All Story, no gameplay.This game is singificant in that the Soundtrack is beautiful, which is no surprise, but the star is an addictive gameplay AND a gripping story. And a pretty good replay value, though it's one of those 'You'll never feel the same' things after completion such as in games like Life is Strange.I got the game on sale, so the fact i got this masterpiece for 4$ was brilliant.

												Figured i'd write a little something since this game is on sale.First of all, as far as indie games go, this is one of the best, let's go over what it has to offer.+ Top quality soundtrack.+ Beautiful, and mostly hand drawn art style.+ Narrator is a nice touch, with a very fitting voice, wich means fantastic storytelling.+ An excellent system to increase difficulty (wich comes with rewards of course).+ A total of 11 weapons (that come with upgrades) and a distillery building that provides you passive bonuses.There are some arguable negatives.- Game is quite short.- Not much replayability (offers a New game+ option and a ""survival wave"" mode where you get to discover each of the character's story).I had have to edit the review a bit. I'm just not satisfied with what i said, take the above as a short version so to speak.First of all a critical thing i forgot to mention in my short review is that you use two weapons at once. That means you can kind of build your playstyle based on two weapons. Other then that: the storytelling that is backed up by the narrator has a good attention to detail, he'll say certain things if you fall in a certain area, he'll say something if you kill all enemies in a certain section of the game etc.To make a spoiler example: You can ""adomesticate"" certain creatures and keep them in the bastion. At some point in the game you get invaded by the Ura's, one of my pets that was fighting the ura died. The narrator promptly said ""Our woodpecker friend, he don't make it.Apart from the attention to detail part, the game narrator has his own charm, his own way of speaking so to say wich i found deserved mentioning. The writing also was very well executed, one area stuck to my head in particular. Jawson Bog (light spoiler follows)Jawson bog is the area where the kid (protagonist) loses hope, he goes trough some hallucinations, basically playing small segments of previous areas again with an altered dialogue that was spokem previously by the narrator. For example at the start of the game you find a shield in an old distillery, then you learn to use it against some turret like things. The first time the narrator comments about you using the shield to your advantage to ""counter"" the turrets, in the hallucination however he says ""He has the nerve to flash the shield he just stole, he's a petty thief. The owner of the distillery is also there, just turned to... some sort of stone i think it was, anyway he's dead, that's the point. In the ""original"" segment you can hit him and the narrator comments about you putting him out of his misery, in the hallucination he says ""Would you look to what he did to poor Rondy""I Think that's about it.

Amazing Gameplay, Suffering StoryGorgeous, hand-rendered art utilizing creative, luscious settings and vibrant colors to set the mood. Fun and unique gameplay coupled with a beautiful and memorable soundtrack. There is a lot to love about this visually arresting game. As fantastic as Bastion is, there were a few things I had problems with in terms of storytelling.They touched on some sensitive subjects that could have worked well with the story but fell a little short. Basic gist (spoilers abound): Group #1 is part of a community that historically committed atrocities upon a rival community, Group #2. Group #1's resolution to make peace with Group #2 and right wrongs was to...kill a bunch of people from Group #2 and cause more destruction to their home. The narrative was written in a way that everything that happened to Group #2 was self-inflicted, despite it being the player character's fault. That part could have been removed and the story wouldn't have suffered.The mechanics, art direction, and soundtrack is what makes this game great. The story itself is told over and over again in movies and shows time and time again; a group seeks power by destroying and the oppressed is (rightfully) angry and seeks to avenge their own. No justice is served for the oppressed group and, by the end, it really feels like the game was saying ""it was their own undoing"" which is morally wrong. It had a lot of potential to tell a deeper story, possibly one of redemption, but they dropped the ball on that.6/10			"

												Four hours into this game and it's definitely worth saying a few things. I'll start with the graphics only because the style in which this world is built is breathtaking. The art direction is watercolours, and do they ever add a fluidity to the movements of The Kid, the silent protagonist of whom you are controlling in this adventure. The colours themselves either have an undeniable shine to them that gently turn into black and white as your health decreases. So does your vision, which I found to be a great mechanic to have.The story is unique in where a narrator occassionally comments on your actions, while giving the player a sense of direction of where they are going and why. Honestly it's the only sense of direction you are likely to receive, given as to how each level is ""summoned"" step by step.A final word would be on the soundtrack. It goes with the game perfectly. What else is there to say?Get yourself this game if you're a fan of Adventure games!			"

												Apparently I haven't written a review about this game yet. Well, here I go. The game is fantastic. That's simply it. The story is wonderfully done, and told in an engaging, uninteruptive fashion. The combat system has such a great deal of potential variation, switching up the ability sets and weapons between a good number of choices keeps it constantly interesting. When you beat it the first time through, there's a new game plus which makes the game more challenging, and gives you more toys to play with.I've played it twice all the way through (~15 hours each) and still listen to the soundtrack on a regular basis. Fully recommended.			"

												I usually avoid Hack & Slash games, but Bastion is special. Instead of drowning you in endless grind, the designers kept it short & sweet. This allows story to actively drive the game all the way through, rather than merely serving as punctuation. The smooth, standout narration deserves your careful ear, as its backstory adds so much depth to the overall experience. Bastion is one of the few games which enticed me to seek out other's analysis on its themes and philosophy afterwards.The cartoonish, hand painted world blends together to defy the sterile, methodical aesthetic many isometric games suffer. It's cute how these gorgeous tiles and assets fancifully fall into place just a few steps ahead of you, all in theme with the recollective nature of the story. The only jarring result of Bastion's isometry is you can only move in 8 directions; not granularly. However, the important thing is weapon aiming is granular.I won't lie, there were times I found the combat frustrating, but it did improve as I levelled (and equipped) up, and by the end, I was even enjoyed it. I also appreciated the fact that you have a good old fashioned hunk o' metal shield. As in, one you have to actively face the enemy and raise to counter with. The combat is definitely more interesting for that decision.Besides, Bastion is worth it for the music alone.			"

Story is very nicely done and worth the sale price you can pick it up for. Combat flows very well as a whole with the rolling mechanic being very smooth with its transition in combat. The only real fault i could put against it would be minor nitpicks like the lack of sprint, or the lack of replayability. All in all it is a nicely made game that can be picked up for a good price.

												Original review by 17 year-old Luke: ""A narrator who compares with even Morgan Freeman, challenging gameplay and a deep story - with a unique storytelling style. If you have working hands: play this game.""While 19 year-old Luke agrees, I feel as though there's more to say, since looking back at Bastion: it still feels like one of my most significant gaming experiences of ever.That viewpoint is perhaps somewhat nostalgic; this was one of the first real PC games I played back when I was still primarily a console gamer. So I will look back on it with that same sense of importance as Assassin's Creed 2 or Uncharted 2, the first two PlayStation 3 games I played.Nevertheless, there are elements of this game that make it recommendable to anyone, despite its personal significance to myself and the close friends who played and discussed it with me back then.Firstly, the narration is exquisite - and yes, past-luke, it does compare to Morgan Freeman. The narration really draws you into the world quite quickly, and although I don't have a vivid memory of the world that the game was set in, I do have a vivid memory of the (protagonist) kid's adventure through that world. The narration is your first contact with that world, right into the game's ending moments - which I won't spoil, but I will say that they are very well crafted from a storytelling perspective.Secondly, I said the game had challenging gameplay. I'm not sure why I said that really. I did die a few times, but that was just because I wasn't used to playing with a keyboard and mouse more than anything. As James (M!dD3) points out in his comment, the gameplay is straightforward and simple, with a wide array of weapons to choose from and experiment with. And for those who want more out of a game's challenge - there are indeed way to buff your enemies in the name of bragging rights.For me though, the gameplay wasn't a prominent factor. More important was the music, the soundtrack is amazing and undefinable by common genres. I've heard it described as ""acoustic frontier trip-hop"", so....yeah. Lovely. I still listen to that soundtrack today, and everyone I've encouraged to listen to it has loved the sounds: from friends my age, to adults, to grandparents.However, a game's soundtrack isn't rated by the quality of the sounds alone; in-game that is an irrelevant quality. But the music fits the game perfectly. I can still recall the chilling hammer-on-stone clangs of ""mine, windbag, mine' as I entered an eerie stage and began to learn more of the truth of the strange world. And don't even get me started on ""build that wall"" and ""mother, I'm here"" - or better yet, their lovechild: ""setting sail, coming home"", to this day one of my favourite songs.The artstyle is equally captivating while in game, there's a certain childish element to the designs that mix with the seriousness of the plot - summing up the kid's overburdened mindset perfectly. There's a reason that kid looks so melancholy on the game's cover art.And I suppose that brings me to the final element that I mentioned, the game's ""deep plot"". Yes, well, that's one way to put it. Let me just say the decisions I made in that game hold true to the way I intend to continue to view my failures and embrace the future for the rest of my life. That is by no means an overstatement, or some pretentious interpretation of the game's plot. This game is simple and important, that's all there is to it. So, as past-luke rightfully said: ""if you have working hands: play this game.""Storytelling: 1/1Plot: 1/1Gameplay: [who even cares, just play it]/10Visuals: 9/10 (impressively beautiful, but not the recommendation-point on this one)Soundtrack: 11/10 (the music itself is 100% recommendable, even if you don't play the game - check it out right now if you're reading this)Do I get a boner just thinking about this game?: Yes/Yes			"

												""A really great example of what a game should be. Original, interesting, and fun!""  (Dec 27, 2011)I still really enjoy this game. There's no sugarcoating it. This is one of my favorite games of all time and it probably had an influence in my life choices. Looking at the game closer, everything about it appeals to me. I love the character design, the music is above fantastic, and the scripting is amazing. The game mechanics are pretty smooth too, but that wasn't the thing that made this game one of my favorites of all time. The characters became a part of my life while I was playing this game, and not to sound like a crazy person here, but I connected with them all on an emotional level. Every single protagonist made me wonder about my life choices. I'm including Zulf in the pool cause I believe that he is in fact a protagonist, but that's an argument for another day. The Kid is the character that really makes this game. You befriend him as the player. The Kid isn't some faceless hero that you can imprint your own desires on to. The Kid, is The Kid, and everyone in the game recognizes that. The Kid has a personality, yet he's quiet the entire game. Again, I could rant about the similarities and differences that The Kid has to Link from LoZ, but that's an argument for another day. The kid, different from Link, existed before you started to control him. He had a mother and a life of his own. The Kid had feelings and dreams that the player can experience through dream snippets that make a separation possible between character and player. Rucks' narration also helps separate The Kid from the player, but when it comes down to it, this game is beautifully written and I can't stress it enough that this game is worth your money and time.Have a good one,CoffeeGoat			"

												I picked up Bastion when it was on sale with the Humble Bundle. I really just wanted to get my hands on trine, and the game soon fell into dark corners of my game library. A few days ago, for some mysterious reason, i installed it and played it, expected yet another indie game. Don't get me wrong, I love indie games, however with their independent label, we kind of lower our expectations and judge them on their own scale, seeing that a ""small team made it against all odds in their own garage"". I would have never guessed Bastion was an indie game made by a group of 7 people on my own. The game art and world work flawlessly, the innovitave and dynamic narration system makes the whole tale all the more engrossing, and the soundtrack is exquisite. I won't go into details about the game elements, for half of the pleasure is discovering what next the game throws at you. This game is an achievement of human ingenuity, a must play for everyone!

Must Play not only for Indie FansBastion is a top-down action adventure and the first title by Supergiant Games. It takes place in a dystopian, destroyed fantasy world that is nevertheless colorfully painted. You play as The Kid, a mysterious young man with white hair, and are aided by an omnipresent narrator that dynamically narrates your actions and is also used to deliver the game's lore to you in a very natural way.The gameplay focuses on a combat system based on dodging and rolling. It features an arsenal of melee- and long range weapons that all work and control differently, including a warhammer, dual pistols, a flamethrower and a machete that can also shoot blades. You can customize your experience using a variety of light RPG elements like weapon upgrades, an active ability(like a spin for the hammer or an AoE attack for the flamethrower)and passive boni that you receive by drinking different kinds of liquor you can unlock with experience. There is also an option to make your game harder and receiving more XP in return and a New Game+ Mode.Bastion is an interactive piece of art. The handdrawn art is gorgeous, the soundtrack is among the best ever heard in videogames, and the gameplay synchronises really well with it.			"

												Bastion is an amazing indie title about world after apocalypse. You control silent protagonist which is narrated by someone who has replaced his vocal cords with  chocolate candy and that voice guides the protagonist through levels. Throughout progression you find 2 human survivors and 4 pets that will accompany you in Bastion when you return from your quest. I liked the part where you picked up Zia, the  singer. Her song is so beautiful that you don't want her to stop, but unfortunatelly you have to. I think it's the best episode in the whole game. The story is quite interesting and engaging, because you'll care about your new found friends and pets. Gameplay is quite fun, you run around and smash various creatures with your weapon of choice (mine was Brushers Pike and Mortar) and retrieve Cores and Crystal shards to make Bastion functional again. You get quite big weapon arsenal and passive abilities (which comes in the shape of alcohol) to chose from. If you wondering whenever you should buy it the answer is yes, definately fun, aestheticly pleasing and good quality product. 8/10			"

												Beatifully made indie game which is very rare these games. Has a very well fitted and nice soundtrack, the music always seems to kick in at the perfect times. Story is very nicely done and worth the sale price you can pick it up for. Combat flows very well as a whole with the rolling mechanic being very smooth with its transition in combat. The only real fault i could put against it would be minor nitpicks like the lack of sprint, or the lack of replayability. All in all it is a nicely made game that can be picked up for a good price. TL;DR: Good game, nice story, smooth flowing gameplay, fun fighting, beautiful graphics, Nice narrator  = Yay.No Sprint, Slow at times, lack of replayability = Nay			"

The replayability in this game is great, you can try to go trough the campaing choosing different choices, weapons, or power ups.

												I usually avoid Hack & Slash games, but Bastion is special. Instead of drowning you in endless grind, the designers kept it short & sweet. This allows story to actively drive the game all the way through, rather than merely serving as punctuation. The smooth, standout narration deserves your careful ear, as its backstory adds so much depth to the overall experience. Bastion is one of the few games which enticed me to seek out other's analysis on its themes and philosophy afterwards.The cartoonish, hand painted world blends together to defy the sterile, methodical aesthetic many isometric games suffer. It's cute how these gorgeous tiles and assets fancifully fall into place just a few steps ahead of you, all in theme with the recollective nature of the story. The only jarring result of Bastion's isometry is you can only move in 8 directions; not granularly. However, the important thing is weapon aiming is granular.I won't lie, there were times I found the combat frustrating, but it did improve as I levelled (and equipped) up, and by the end, I was even enjoyed it. I also appreciated the fact that you have a good old fashioned hunk o' metal shield. As in, one you have to actively face the enemy and raise to counter with. The combat is definitely more interesting for that decision.Besides, Bastion is worth it for the music alone.			"

												Bastion is pretty much just great all around. The story is powerful and makes unique use of a narrator in a way I've never seen any other game do, especially at the last level. At the end, I wasn't totally sure I'd made the right decision, but like...in a good way, I think? The soundtrack is fantastic; finding Zia for the first time is a magical experience. There's a ton of different weapons with different upgrades and stuff. The art is fairly detailed despite the simplified style and works really well with the design and the weird ""level assembles itself under your feet"" dynamic. It's super great and you should play it.			"

												Let's begin with a disclaimer: Bastion if really freaking hard to describe.At its core, it's a top down action game with RPG elements, and at that, it does its job. The game plays like a charm, and most of the weapons are fun to use (even if I found myself liking the ranged options more). The whole game feels extremely tight and polished.Where Bastion really shines, however, is its story AND the way it is presented. Every action you take, even some really meaningless ones (being hit by an enemy in the first level, breaking crates) are commented by the ever present Narrator - if you ever played Portal and liked how GladOs reacted to your actions, you'll like this, too. The story is very good, too, and among a plethora of brown and bleak post-apocalyptic scenarios, I feel the colorful fragmented world of post-calamity Bastion is a refreshing spin on an over-abused genre.With how little it costs, seriously, you just owe this game to yourself. And your friends, possibly.			"

												Bastion combines a wonderful mix of story, art, music, and gameplay all in a way that feels unique to itself.  The game starts you off with little direction but the narrator's voice as you get used to the controls, combat system, level flow, and most importantly the signature level design.  Every environment is Bastion ""builds"" itself from the ground up around you creating a very unique take on the ""fog of war"" style exploration you commonly see in strategy games.  Story-wise all of this is the result of some far-flung calamity that literally destroyed a good chunk of the world.  This puts the story's focus half on keeping up the progress of the Bastion's buildings and exploration of what's left around you.The graphics are wonderfully rendered and everything looks like a mix of semi-realistic 3D and hand-drawn sprites similar to a sort of top-down version of Braid.  Despite the bleak undertones, the colors are vibrant even in the darker levels and every place feels both desolate yet full of life as you see what's become of the world around you.  All of these are explored via your home base- the titular Bastion which acts both as a hub for missions, power ups, weapons, and side-quests, but also serves to both tell and fill in the holes of the story you missed through the narration that goes on throughout the levels.There are only four named characters in the game counting the protagonist, but all of them are surprisingly well-developed for how little any of them actually speak.  All of them have special reactions to pretty much everything you bring back with you on each trip and each has a backstory to explore through special bonus levels.  While interaction with them is minimalistic at best, you really grow to know who they are and care about their well being just as much as in games where you spend most of the story talking to them, which is quite the accomplishment on part of the frankly stellar narration.For how much of the game you're going to spend in combat, it sometimes feels like it takes a back seat to everything going on around you.  However, you'll never get distracted from it and each of the game's unique weapons has its own bonuses and downsides making no combination (you can take two with you, plus one special move of your choice) a bad call.  It really calls to create your own fighting style and do what suits you best.  Due to how you can upgrade any weapons in a variety of ways, there's really no wrong way to go into battle and it's always fun.  What makes things more interesting is that depending on what weapons you pick, how you choose to go about a level, and even how well you're doing or whether you decide to simply derp about, the narrator has a response to pretty much EVERYTHING you do, which adds a bit of flavor and life to the game that feels a lot more like you're actually being watched and having your story told.The soundtrack of the game is just as varied as everything else in it and always manages to hit the perfect mood, particularly with the wonderfully done vocal songs.  Many levels or situations have their own music and no two songs really feel the same or reused whenever they appear.Overall Bastion is a wonderful experience that takes roughly seven to ten hours to complete in one playthrough.  It's not a long game, but at the same time it's not any longer or shorter than it needs to be.  But you'll be thankful for that because it means you can easily play it again.  If you ever see it appear in sales or the Humble Bundle as it's often wont to, I highly suggest picking it up if it even sounds remotely interesting to you.			"

												I picked up Bastion when it was on sale with the Humble Bundle. I really just wanted to get my hands on trine, and the game soon fell into dark corners of my game library. A few days ago, for some mysterious reason, i installed it and played it, expected yet another indie game. Don't get me wrong, I love indie games, however with their independent label, we kind of lower our expectations and judge them on their own scale, seeing that a ""small team made it against all odds in their own garage"". I would have never guessed Bastion was an indie game made by a group of 7 people on my own. The game art and world work flawlessly, the innovitave and dynamic narration system makes the whole tale all the more engrossing, and the soundtrack is exquisite. I won't go into details about the game elements, for half of the pleasure is discovering what next the game throws at you. This game is an achievement of human ingenuity, a must play for everyone!

												This is a very good game overall.The gameplay is fun, though it might become a bit repetitive, but the developers try to avoid this by giving you new weapons throughout the whole game. The weapons are easy to use and quite fun aswell.The storytelling is definitely the most solid part of this game. The narrator uses his GOD DAMM FANTASTIC voice to voice over everything you do. I.E: when you defeat an enemy with no problems he will comment on that, or if you keep falling off the map, he will tell you that you are stupid. The narrator tells also the story, which is quite good and very engaging.The art style is gorgeus. You can spend minutes just looking at some of the sceneries that you are shown. Just beautiful.As I said, it´s a very enjoyable game and you should totally purchase it.			"

Must Play not only for Indie FansBastion is a top-down action adventure and the first title by Supergiant Games. It takes place in a dystopian, destroyed fantasy world that is nevertheless colorfully painted. You play as The Kid, a mysterious young man with white hair, and are aided by an omnipresent narrator that dynamically narrates your actions and is also used to deliver the game's lore to you in a very natural way.The gameplay focuses on a combat system based on dodging and rolling. It features an arsenal of melee- and long range weapons that all work and control differently, including a warhammer, dual pistols, a flamethrower and a machete that can also shoot blades. You can customize your experience using a variety of light RPG elements like weapon upgrades, an active ability(like a spin for the hammer or an AoE attack for the flamethrower)and passive boni that you receive by drinking different kinds of liquor you can unlock with experience. There is also an option to make your game harder and receiving more XP in return and a New Game+ Mode.Bastion is an interactive piece of art. The handdrawn art is gorgeous, the soundtrack is among the best ever heard in videogames, and the gameplay synchronises really well with it.			"

You travel through numerous regions filled with gorgeous handpainted artwork, finding an arsenal of unique, diverse weapons and learn to master them all through various trials of skill. Finally, as you come closer and closer to the end of the line, you slowly uncover the pieces of a heartbreaking tale between two peoples that leads to the calamity.4 years later, this game still has high replay value and I constantly listen to the soundtrack outside of the game.Awesome story.

The story is wonderfully done, and told in an engaging, uninteruptive fashion. The combat system has such a great deal of potential variation, switching up the ability sets and weapons between a good number of choices keeps it constantly interesting. When you beat it the first time through, there's a new game plus which makes the game more challenging, and gives you more toys to play with.I've played it twice all the way through (~15 hours each) and still listen to the soundtrack on a regular basis. Fully recommended.			"

												Play this Game.I bought Bastion back when it first showed up on Steam and I played a while but I never got the chance to finish. Recently I was looking for something different to play so I thought I'd fire Bastion up again and give it a play through. I love this game.Bastion is about a boy who ""wakes up"" in the middle of what the game calls the Calamity. Your story is narrated as you (this boy) progress through levels that build themselves around you. This should not be confused with procedurally generated levels, rather there's a hint of where a path should be and as you move, tiles form up around you. This is a pretty cool effect even if it's totally linnear. As you progress the story deepens, you find new weapons, upgrades, secrets etc. to battle your way through the game's enemies with a goal of restoring the Bastion, the game's home point. I never found the combat to be particularly challenging, with enemies brodacatsting attacks well before they happen and picking up fairly predictable patterns to counter. Your weapons and skills are more than strong enough to handle everything the game throws at you. You will have the opportunity to make things harder on yourself as you complete more peices of the Bastion if you wish. Weapons can be upgraded at the Bastion's forge, adding extra damage, or critical chance etc. You'll also be able to switch out skills and buy power up type items to help you along. And at the end you'll get to unlock a new game plus mode which adds a little replayability.Level design is pretty cool, as I mentioned above the world forms around you as you move along. Sometimes leading to dead ends, sometimes leading to secret areas containing upgrade materials, or new story items, even companion type characters. It's worth exploring every corner you can in these well built, beautifully rendered, but often very small areas. The story itself is at first just a narration of what you do as the game's hero character, but soon enough you'll start to feel it coalescing into something bigger. As you play, the game's narrator continues to tell the stories of the boy and various survivors of the calamity. This takes place in the game itself along with aquiring items to learn about and that help tell the history of the Bastion and it's home world and the people who inhabit it. Once things begin to move the story progresses quickly and in my opinion is told pretty masterfully. Now, Ive heard of people complaining about the narration of the game. Saying that he's too involved, or too in your face. That he never shuts up and they just want to play the game. I'm sorry to say that you can't shut the narrator off for those of you who may find him annoying. But on the other hand, he's the one telling the story, and Bastion is a story driven game so you need the narrator. I personally loved listening to him, the voice is pleasant, smooth and to me at least was nothing close to invasive. The narrator is integral to the game's story being told so you'll just have to deal with it and even if you don't like listeing to him I'm sure as things go on you'll at least be interested in what he has to say. The story itself is emotial, fairly deep and told really really well.As is usual these days the game is short, around 6 hours I think total with potential of a couple more if you complete the optional mini games. But the fact is the story is fully told in this time, so you get a feeling of completion even though you it's a short play through, and with new game plus you can double the play value and still have fun.Bastion, also has an epic sound track. ""Zia's song"", and the end theme ""Coming Home"" are two that stick out in my head. I believe the game even comes with a copy of the sound track if I remember corrctly. In conclusion, Bastion, is a beautiful, short, story driven game with an excellent story and great original music. It's inexpensive and worth a play through. Give it shot I'm sure you'll dig it. "

												""Abstract"" ""Indie"" games is where all the (K)ool Kids are. Just about recently, gamers are regularly met with a surfeit of these indie games that have a history of HYPE. Too bad most of them turn out to be vaporware or pretentious garbage. But there is that minute gleam of light that promises quality. Supergiant Games, thankfully, ends up being one of the few that actually develop decent games. Bastion, the game in question, is not one that should be adjudged ""decent"", but rather, astounding. Far from flawless, as this game is locked at 30 frames (Just, why?), but an overall stellar game that is worth every penny, or whatever crap currency you wield.Meet the Kid. One of the handful of survivors that has endured the Calamity. This catastrophic event brought the whole world to ruin. He sets off to the Bastion, where he is greeted by Rucks, the Stranger, with words claiming that the recent disaster can be undone. By constructing the Bastion back to health with monument cores and shards there are odds of restoring Caelondia and its neighbor lands to a time before hell unleashed, hence the title of this game. Throughout the Kid's travels to seek out the materials needed, players will learn more about the world and its people and you get to learn the backstories of the few survivors you come across as the game progresses. It might seem engrossing, but the story is where Bastion falls shortest. The journey with the Kid was complete in every angle it is viewed in, but it was also rushed from start to end, and had inadequate time to develop. Build-up starts to occur profusely around the last third of the game, only to conclude in some half-baked ending that proved to be unfufilling. Despite the mediocre narrative, Bastion is a feast for the eyes and ears due to it's gorgeous presentation.It is not an overstatement when it is said that this game has the potential to be sold solely on it's presentation. Hell, some have avowed that they bought the soundtrack before the damn game. It's just that damn delicious. Bastion's visuals is where that abstract tag comes into play, because it is most certainly what most reckon to be unconventional. The playing stage constructs itself as you tread along the path and the camera is complimented by a shiny filter, and other things I won't bother typing as it's better experienced than read. The soundtrack, done by composer Darren Korb, is brimful with impressive songs that seemlessly attach to the rest of the presentation. I'm not one that gushes over video game OSTs, but this one is pretty damn good, and I'm convinced everyone that isn't a moron agrees.If only it wasn't locked at thirty frames...that idea bothers me way to f****** much.Even with such wondrous superficial values, a game is crap if it isn't fun, and it is relieving to know that Bastion succeeds in this fundamental aspect too. Not much can be said about it however, it's just the average action-adventure game with a few tweaks that enable it to distinguish itself from the rest. The Kid can be equipped with 2 weapons at once and he has a ""secret"" move, and by, of course, playing the game (no way), the Kid is met with unlocks in his arsenal and attributes that gradually form him to an impetus of destruction by the end of the game. Sounds a little, unamusing, but this is without the mention of the copious ways one can up their game. The game played vanilla is laughably easy, but there are shrine idols that can unexpectedly rise its difficulty, which is recommended. There are also Vigils to complete for moneys, and wave-based side missions to earn more moneys and achievements, and a New Game Plus option that actually bears fruit! All of this will keep many entertained for a appreciable amount of time, around 20 hours or so maximum.There's more to be said, but I'm done. Bastion is a worthwhile game that I'm sure many have already invested their time in, and I hope people continue to pick this up. Supergiant Games is a talented developer, and they only demonstrate so with this installation. Where it fails in storytelling makes up in well-done game-structure and incredible graphics and sound. I'm looking foward to playing more entries from this group.Still haven't played Transistor at the time of this review, so I need to get to that quick.			"

												Is your world falling apart? Bastion can relate.       Maybe not in the mental state but taking place in a world that begins to crumble into pieces, Bastion manages to capture a beautiful unique scenery that has a quite amuzing arcade like gameplay. Positive    The story follows to be short but powerful, the game follows a young boy on the curiosity and discovery on what's happening to his world, and how can you stop it.   Captivating dialouge, you will enjoy this classical hit if you love the enrichment of emotions this story can and does indeed bring.      If you have enough money for the soundtrack i also highly reccomend you download that too. I'm not much on soundtracks, however Bastion does have an extremely rich and cultivating music producer. However the beauty if music is there is aways gonna be a song out there to enjoy....just not for everybody. Thus,https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA6BDC6AA59483A76      I give you a quick link to hear some of the music so you can see for yourself if you would rather buy the game with or without it's soundtrack. Im kinda repeating mysef here but again, im not much of a fan for the soundtracks, thats why i recommend this one, because i just absolutely love it.(I'm listening to the ending credits song as i write this review!!!)Con      The game doesn't have much of a replaybility, I mean Bastion contains extra modes after the intial completion of the game isn't the type of game you can have 500 hours on....unless you enjoy the game that much but in hinde sight, it is a short game. Additional Info     The game contains multiple endings. Basion contains about as many choices as the size of one grain of rice, but very powerful in game choices you, the player, have to make.  It is not a choice making game like Mass Effect, but I just needed to add that because I still to this day regret all the decisions this game forced me to make. It's a balance of depression and joy that the presence of the choices were involved.In short, for any fan of an enticing, rich storyline with captivating scenery and ear endulging music, this game is a must have. Bastion is a definatly an 11/10 in my book and the music is a must have in your itunes library.			"

												I cannot sing the praises of this game enough. I went into this knowing next to nothing, not even knowing how well praised it is. This has become my favorite game. The story is interesting and quite grim. There are no cutscenes or excessive text. It doesn't try to be a movie, it's a very subtle and gameplay driven story. The Narrator's voice gives Morgan Freeman a run for his money. The gameplay is fun and stays fresh for the most part. Interesting enemies and lore. The art style is beautiful, I adore how the land forms at your feet.And the soundtrack? Don't even get me started on the soundtrack. It is PHENOMENAL. I could listen to it nonstop. There is not a single song that is any less than the others. There are a few songs that have singers, which is usually a no-no in video games, but it suits the situation perfectly.The one thing that really bothers me only applies to you if you want to complete every little thing in the game like I do. It's no problem if you're a ""finish the story then I'm out"" kind of person. But the grinding. To buy every upgrade for every weapon, you have to beat Who Knows Where many times, or replay New Game+ multiple times. It gets stale, but I need to beat the Calamity Cannon training grounds, dammit!Bottom line, buy it. I'd wait for a Steam Sale (then again, I do for everything), but it's worth every cent. Supergiant Games deserves it so they can hopefully make more awesomeness. I can't wait to try Transistor.			"

												An amazing game. Great story, good gameplay, terrific music and the best narrator ever.The storyline is quite cool, with a little element of choose your own adventure at the end. I just wish they expanded on the world of Bastion a little more, maybe with a sequel, it's a very fascinating world.The way the game progresses through the story is sort of simple compared to the extensive background of the Bastion. Most of the game is ""Collect the core to build the Bastion. Oh no, Bastion broken, collect shards to rebuild. Not again, more shards please."" The storyline is very linear and I feel that some other plot device could be used instead of cores and shards. The story was too formulaic because of this.The soundtrack, the art, and the narrator are fantastic. Every level felt awe inspiring, each environment looked incredible and well designed. I really loved that Rucks was used to narrate everything, it was a neat twist to story-centric games, and with Logan Cunningham's voice I didn't mind at all.The weapon system is very awesome and most of the weapons are mechanically very different, but there are some obviously underpowered and overpowered weapons (UP=Fang Repeater, OP=Galleon Mortar). Generally the weapons are mostly balanced sidegrades.The passive upgrades via Spirits is quite unique. There is also a faulty power balance among spirits too: eg. Leechade should always be equipped regardless of build. There aren't enough spirits to make different builds viable except for a tanky build and a high risk high reward build, which are both outclassed by the all around build. In all fairness the game isn't deep enough to warrant more builds than those.I really enjoyed the difficulty of the game. It's a very easy game until the idols are all turned on, now the squirt mobs instakill you when they die with the dropped explosives on death, the spinning gasfellas permaslow to a quick death, and the Ura move at godlike speeds; the fundamentals of the enemies change quite a bit. Regen god + Damage block god + Invulnerability god challenges on vs a really tanky and high damage enemy such as Pyth is really stupid though, it almost forces you to use the Galleon Mortar or other high burst damage.Don't take my review the wrong way though, the criticisms I've made with this game are very minor, the game as a whole is amazing and worth every penny.

Amazing Gameplay, Suffering StoryGorgeous, hand-rendered art utilizing creative, luscious settings and vibrant colors to set the mood. Fun and unique gameplay coupled with a beautiful and memorable soundtrack. There is a lot to love about this visually arresting game. As fantastic as Bastion is, there were a few things I had problems with in terms of storytelling.They touched on some sensitive subjects that could have worked well with the story but fell a little short. Basic gist (spoilers abound): Group #1 is part of a community that historically committed atrocities upon a rival community, Group #2. Group #1's resolution to make peace with Group #2 and right wrongs was to...kill a bunch of people from Group #2 and cause more destruction to their home. The narrative was written in a way that everything that happened to Group #2 was self-inflicted, despite it being the player character's fault. That part could have been removed and the story wouldn't have suffered.The mechanics, art direction, and soundtrack is what makes this game great. The story itself is told over and over again in movies and shows time and time again; a group seeks power by destroying and the oppressed is (rightfully) angry and seeks to avenge their own. No justice is served for the oppressed group and, by the end, it really feels like the game was saying ""it was their own undoing"" which is morally wrong. It had a lot of potential to tell a deeper story, possibly one of redemption, but they dropped the ball on that.6/10			"

												Figured i'd write a little something since this game is on sale.First of all, as far as indie games go, this is one of the best, let's go over what it has to offer.+ Top quality soundtrack.+ Beautiful, and mostly hand drawn art style.+ Narrator is a nice touch, with a very fitting voice, wich means fantastic storytelling.+ An excellent system to increase difficulty (wich comes with rewards of course).+ A total of 11 weapons (that come with upgrades) and a distillery building that provides you passive bonuses.There are some arguable negatives.- Game is quite short.- Not much replayability (offers a New game+ option and a ""survival wave"" mode where you get to discover each of the character's story).I had have to edit the review a bit. I'm just not satisfied with what i said, take the above as a short version so to speak.First of all a critical thing i forgot to mention in my short review is that you use two weapons at once. That means you can kind of build your playstyle based on two weapons. Other then that: the storytelling that is backed up by the narrator has a good attention to detail, he'll say certain things if you fall in a certain area, he'll say something if you kill all enemies in a certain section of the game etc.To make a spoiler example: You can ""adomesticate"" certain creatures and keep them in the bastion. At some point in the game you get invaded by the Ura's, one of my pets that was fighting the ura died. The narrator promptly said ""Our woodpecker friend, he don't make it.Apart from the attention to detail part, the game narrator has his own charm, his own way of speaking so to say wich i found deserved mentioning. The writing also was very well executed, one area stuck to my head in particular. Jawson Bog (light spoiler follows)Jawson bog is the area where the kid (protagonist) loses hope, he goes trough some hallucinations, basically playing small segments of previous areas again with an altered dialogue that was spokem previously by the narrator. For example at the start of the game you find a shield in an old distillery, then you learn to use it against some turret like things. The first time the narrator comments about you using the shield to your advantage to ""counter"" the turrets, in the hallucination however he says ""He has the nerve to flash the shield he just stole, he's a petty thief. The owner of the distillery is also there, just turned to... some sort of stone i think it was, anyway he's dead, that's the point. In the ""original"" segment you can hit him and the narrator comments about you putting him out of his misery, in the hallucination he says ""Would you look to what he did to poor Rondy""I Think that's about it.

All of those elements made this game.GameplayBastion has lots of play styles to experiment with. The variety of melee weapons and ranged weapons gives you lots of different combinations to eliminate your foes. Speaking of enemies, each enemy has different ways to eliminate them and as you progress, you'll need the right tricks to cleverly eliminate your foes with the weapons you choose.StoryI'm not gonna spoil the plot for you, but I can tell you it is one the most heart-warming and clever video game story I've ever experienced. And Logan Cunningham delivers a very fine narration to top it offSoundtrackThe music in this game really immerses you into the theme of the game. Some parts of the story has successfuly shed a tear because of the beautiful music.Verdict+ Extreme variety of weapon play styles+ Beautiful and captivating art+ Surreal music+ Clever and well thought story10/10			"

												Finished it in 6,5 hours. Well worth the money, even though I think it's a bit short in the end (storywise). The graphics are outstanding by the way. They reminded me of Braid.The game itself plays like a linear action RPG. During your quest you'll receive lots of weapons, that you can upgrade several times. There are also idols to increase the difficulty, a distillery to equip potions with different effects and challenge rooms to earn extra items. There really is a lot to do in this game (never mind the story for now) so it could take you about 12-13 hours, maybe even longer, to 100% this game.To be short: this game should be in your collection, no matter what.[Rating: 88/100]			"

												Yeah, yeah, it's super-good. The graphical style and narration are brilliant. Most of the gameplay is Zelda-style timing combat (parry, dodge, aim, strike, in varying combinations) but thankfully doesn't rely on ever retreading ground. The gameplay is probably the only issue - it starts to wear thin after awhile, and moments with lots of enemies often turn too messy to be fun - but the game is still absolutely worth it The story can drag a bit at points, but when it's on, it's on - easily one of the most emotional experiences I've had since... what, Silent Hill 2?Buy it, it's worth experiencing.

												You play Kid who sets out on a mission to restore a land to which is once was. The story is what makes this one of my favorite arcade games. It is so immense and is unique is so many ways. This game extremely well done. The artwork is fantastic and the gameplay is just astounding. The game mechanics are so great, they are fairly simple and easy to grasp hold of. The narrator for this game is extremely talented, his voice is so pleasant and fits the game perfectly. The weapon system allows you make many weapon choices and combinations as well as certain and unique properties to go with those weapons. From a simple two handed hammer to what is basically a shoulder cannon that obliterates anything, the weapon system truly is amazing and fun to play around with. It also lets you choose between many traits as you progress in level. The game also provides mini challenges for each weapon which if you complete the assigned task you will rewarded with special items and secret moves for each weapon. The characters in this game is also what dragged me into this amazing game. Each one of them, even the enemies, are unique in their own way and their diffifulcty can be increased through the use of Idols which give enemies new abilities or a boost in health, damage, or their mechanics during battle. Another thing that I found neat about Bastion was that after you beat the game you can start the game from the beginning, but this time you will start out with the level your last playthrough, skills, weapons, and Idols.

												this game is short, very short, short enough to finish the story in an afternoon/ evening. but it is very fun doing so, and the story and narration are amazing. it even got a wee bit emotional towards the end and the Narrator always kept the story and action moving along, in some ways it had some strong similarities to call of Juarez : gunslinger in the narration style, with it responding to players deaths and weapon usage as well as interaction with the surroundings.  it's a gorgeous looking game as well and frankly i think anyone who is looking for an easy to pick up isometric rpg should seriously consider this one :) all in all a cute, fun, humouress and well written little game			"

Bastion is a fun little top-down view dungeon crawler where you smash stuff and upgrade your weapons. The gameplay is good enough to hold your attention but nothing special. The real charm is the Narrator who describes everything you do and expounds upon the storyline. Add to this the excellent soundtrack and the beautiful art and you are left with an all around enjoyable experience.Bastion's greatest strength is the cohesive art direction that runs through the story, visuals, and sound design.

												Bastion is what every indie game hopes to be. The excellent fast-paced action/adventure combat pales only in comparison to the visual vibrancy and storytelling immersion. Far from a gimmick, the narration fits so seamlessly with the rest of the game it will leave you wondering why it hasn't been done more. This game will draw you in with its addictive combat mechanics, and keep you enthralled with its emotionally-charged storyline.

												A great game, a friend gifted it to me and it really was a pleasure to play through. Its always a joy to listen to the narrator talk, unlike my harping girlfriend constantly talking about how I keep looking at other girls, its every single day. I don't think we even talk about other things anymore. It has really put a strain on our relationship. I'm not sure what to do, I want to talk it over with her but I'm not sure if I should.			"

												You wake up.  Stuff's falling apart.  An old guy starts narrating as you run around trying to figure out what the dink is going on.  This is the Kid's story about the Calamity.StoryWhile the actual storyline in itself has been done before, the presentation of it feels fresh and new as you discover what exactly is happening and everyone's lives beforehand and so on.  If I must make one qualm is the story is completely narrated to you during play.  That means while you're trying not to die fighting a boss or something, there is actual story being presented and it can be difficult for those who can't multitask to be able to pay attention and lose details.  It's also incredibly short, and you'll be able to do just the story in around 3 hours (not including sidequests) though the game has a New Game+ encouraging you to play a second time through with all your assets still in check.GraphicsSprites are sharp looking, environments lush.  I think the Kid's ingame proportions look a bit off from his artwork design but eventually you get used to it.  The enemy variety was a bit lackluster, which is a fault of the game being rather on the short side unfortunetly.  Sometimes it could also be difficult to figure out what you could and couldn't walk on leading to a fall, but I could've just needed my eyes checked I have no idea since it happened to me three times.ControlsThis game was meant more for a gamepad I feel, as the keyboard just feels rather awkward overall.  You can get used to it but never feels nearly as fluid as the controller with it's precise movement.GameplayI have to admit, blowing something up with a mortar or whatnot brings a shimmer to my eye.  Everything in the game feels organic, leveling your character, using materials to upgrade your (very large) cache of weapons and equipping tonics to your character instead of armor to grant special quirks.  Again as stated earlier, due to the game being so short it's necessity you need to play through the New Game+ just to be able to upgrade everything and even unlock the rest of the achievements since you can't play through any areas except Proving Grounds or character related arenas.  The Proving Grounds force you to complete a task using the specific weapon for each area.  My main issue is the difficulty ratios for each of them are wildly different, and sometimes you cannot complete a proving ground until you fully upgrade said weapon which is a tad irritating.  God help the Machete Proving Ground and it's stupidity.  If the game ever feels too easy, you can also add in Deities or Gods onto your person which grants you an experience bonus but adds difficulty and let me tell you, the game can be impossibly ruthless with those settings on.  The main flaw I feel of the combat system is the targeting, as you automatically target the enemy closest to you, but if you wish to switch to another target, any enemy between it and them will have to be manually cycled through leading to massive headaches due to the frequency of tons of enemies being dumped on you.  This also coincides with your shield use as you have to be facing the target to be able to use it and is just best left to dodge and roll then to block.SoundAt first I wasn't too enthusiastic about the music, but it has grown on me over time and I enjoy it.  Is it the best soundtrack ever? No particularly though there are some choice tracks in there that are worth listening too.  The voice acting is also done really well with the Narrator narrating everything from what weapons you equip to if you slip off a ledge and fall on your face.ConclusionA highly enjoyable game that is unfortunately really short, New Game+ or no.  Some small tweaks here or there and it could benefit greatly.  It also has some sort of 3rd mode of play which I never attempted involving some kinda scoreboard, which indeed this game does have leaderboards that surprises me but hey, why not right?			"

												Bastion is a 2D isometric hack and slash that (unlike every other game I’ve ever played) works well with both controller and keyboard & mouse.  The first title released by indie studio, Supergiant Games, Bastion is a colorful, fast action platformer that is great for kids and adults alike.The Good:  Everything!  This game is %&@$ing amazing in every way!  The color, the way the story is told, the story itself, the music, the upgrades, the way the difficulty increases, the way new game plus is done, the artwork, the level design, the combat mechanics, the upgrades … you get the idea.  Literally everything is wonderful in this game!The Bad: The game is a little short and … Uhh … hmm, I am REALLY fishing for anything here.  OH! I got it! If you can find a way to make the hammer or machete work better than the pike I’d love to see how, the Brushers Pike/Spear is WAY better than the other two melee weapons.The Funky:  If you get it on Steam they give you a turret from the Portal games.  Talk to it and it will utter phrases such as, “sensory overload” and “location unknown.”The Verdict:  I really wish saying “10 out of 10” was not so over used because here it actually applies.  It is damn near impossible to get more entertainment for 15 bucks anywhere.  I realize this review is a bit short but the game has to be played to be understood and you’d be reading 2-3 more pages just for me to set the stage to talk about the experience that is Bastion.  Get it, play it, LOVE THE HELL OUT OF IT!			"

												You play Kid who sets out on a mission to restore a land to which is once was. The story is what makes this one of my favorite arcade games. It is so immense and is unique is so many ways. This game extremely well done. The artwork is fantastic and the gameplay is just astounding. The game mechanics are so great, they are fairly simple and easy to grasp hold of. The narrator for this game is extremely talented, his voice is so pleasant and fits the game perfectly. The weapon system allows you make many weapon choices and combinations as well as certain and unique properties to go with those weapons. From a simple two handed hammer to what is basically a shoulder cannon that obliterates anything, the weapon system truly is amazing and fun to play around with. It also lets you choose between many traits as you progress in level. The game also provides mini challenges for each weapon which if you complete the assigned task you will rewarded with special items and secret moves for each weapon. The characters in this game is also what dragged me into this amazing game. Each one of them, even the enemies, are unique in their own way and their diffifulcty can be increased through the use of Idols which give enemies new abilities or a boost in health, damage, or their mechanics during battle. Another thing that I found neat about Bastion was that after you beat the game you can start the game from the beginning, but this time you will start out with the level your last playthrough, skills, weapons, and Idols. Overall this game is definitely a 10/10 for me.			"

D'AWWW that little squirt is so cute :3oh and of course the narrator.now this game when i first played it gave me a unique experience i had never encountered with anygame before. before playing bastion i wasnt that huge a fan of these types of game as i tend to have a lot of depth perception problems with isometric games, but the sheer amazment i felt from the narrator made me want to continue with the game, i became so involed with the story i felt a genuine WANT with carrying on and wanting to find out what happens next, what is going to happen to Zulf WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE Squirt! and somewhere along the way i fell in love with the games mechanics and how it played and how it felt.Now this is somthing i think more games should do, if theres a game that people dont know if everyone is going to enjoy the gameplay at first. create a facinating story and get an amazing narrator to narrate, chances are people will get so absorbed in to the story that they wont notice about the gameplay and get used it with out noticingI havent played a game in a long long time that made me feel the way bastion made me feel, and havent felt again since.Reveiw word of the day : WANT			"

												A beautiful arcade game with hand painted graphics supported by an interesting and original story and an even more original storytelling. The world you are evoling in is building itself while you are moving, and nearly every of your step is accompagnied by a deep and grizzly narator voice.The game comes with a variety of enemies using different tactics to bother you and of course with bosses. You on the other hand have a big choice of weapons and perks allowing you to always be best prepared for the next world you enter. Weapons are upgradable with ""fragments' of the world you collect during your adventures, and you can also gain fragments while completing challenges related to your weapons or to the story.Expect 20 hours of gaming at least on your first run, and 10 to 15 more if you want to complete the ""New Game Plus"" mode and/or all Steam achievements.I highgly recommend it for anyone wanting to play a ""different"" arcade game.One last thing: there is no way you could not enjoy the beautifully crafted soundtrack.

It's music, sotry, graphics, and gameplay will forever remain in my mind as I hold it to be one of the most brilliant and memorable experiences I have ever had the fortune to have.

												After completing Bastion, I realized that the ending is actually really thoughtful, you have two ultimate choices; restore the world to a time before the calamity which is the apocalyptic catastrophe that caused an outbreak in plague, monsters, and fighting factions, or evacuate the Bastion, the mechanical floating island that the old man, Rucks, and you, the kid, live on. That's the central point of the game, to get the Bastion back in working order, gathering shards and minerals to fix the Bastion.Along the journey, the old man, Rucks, narrates every move you make which might sound annoying but was actually intuitive because of all the context he is able to give. Later on in the game, you figure out that he's narrating to one of the Ura, a girl named Zia who comes to the Bastion after meeting the kid.I can't say much about the gameplay, as it's rather repetitive, shooting down enemies, blocking, and hacking, no depth to it. But the options you get in weaponry and special abilities and the leveling up make up for it. The game's design is isometric but also 2D, kind of cel shaded. And the floating islands which are part of the world was an interesting way to represent how society has turned out.Very good game though, with heavy depth in narrative.9.1/10			"

												A beautiful arcade game with hand painted graphics supported by an interesting and original story and an even more original storytelling. The world you are evoling in is building itself while you are moving, and nearly every of your step is accompagnied by a deep and grizzly narator voice.The game comes with a variety of enemies using different tactics to bother you and of course with bosses. You on the other hand have a big choice of weapons and perks allowing you to always be best prepared for the next world you enter. Weapons are upgradable with ""fragments' of the world you collect during your adventures, and you can also gain fragments while completing challenges related to your weapons or to the story.Expect 20 hours of gaming at least on your first run, and 10 to 15 more if you want to complete the ""New Game Plus"" mode and/or all Steam achievements.I highgly recommend it for anyone wanting to play a ""different"" arcade game.One last thing: there is no way you could not enjoy the beautifully crafted soundtrack.

												Well ladies and gents, it took me almost 5 years but I finally Beat the game with 8 hours on record. With that said I took this game pretty slowly and I still beat it in 8 hours, Just keep that in mind. Let me just start off by saying this game is a work of Art, A Masterpiece. This game honestly shocked me, Before I knew who supergiant was, I went into this game thinking it was just some average indie game with little story. I thought that  you would just be  going from zone to zone grabbing these crystal shards until you finish the crystal. But slowly you start to realize it is not just that, you start to notice it is more complicated than that and encounter new characters and Items. As you get further and further into the game,the story starts getting thicker and thicker. The narrator (Who is absolutely fantastic by the way) Is pretty much telling someone the story of what you are doing in that moment and this mechanic is what helps guide you through some parts that you may not have figured out.As you progress you get these items which you use at the Bastion to upgrade the weapons which adds some variation is play styles.  My only complaint is that the OPTIONAL dream levels took so long and there was no checkpoints so if you died on the last wave you would have to restart and redo the last 20 minutes over again.9/10, excited to move on and play transistor finally!!

												""Bastion"" - if it wasn't for my friend, who knows I love good stories and good soundtracks I might have never tried this game. He got me a copy, and I got addicted.In the game, you play as the Kid, who wakes up, and finds his world is literally falling to pieces. The ground shatters beneath him, it's like something is devouring the land like a disease. And that something is called the Calamity. The Kid has to find his way to the Bastion, a place created to gather any survivors in case of a catastrophy. A place that is supposed to save to world. But through his travels the Kid meets other people, finds their stories, and then discovers the horrible truth about the Calamity, and the Bastion itself.It's an action RPG set in a two-dimensional world with an isometric camera. Sounds simple, and boring enough, right? Wrong! The world is beautifully painted, colourful and vivid. There is a vast number of different enemies and environments. You also have a large group of weapons to choose from, and create your own style of fighting. For me, I always prefered the war machete as a melee, scrap musket as ranged, and squirt lure as a special ability. But there is a number of combinations, and everyone will find something fitting. The gameplay is mostly hack&slash, not gonna lie. But the story is just gripping. You do get involved, you do get attached, and at some point, you will be forced to make a decision. And it is not an easy one, it squeezed a tear out of my eye.The soundtrack deserves its own review... From blues bar sounding ""Slinger's song"", through the sweet notes of ""Build that wall"", exciting and fun ""Terminal march"", and the beautiful, heartbreaking ""Mother, I'm here"", this soundtrack provides about an hour of eargasms... I listened to it for two weeks non stop, after I completed the game, it's that good.Oh, and I forgot the best bit. The whole game is narrated by a deep, warm voice. With a hint of sense of humour, a lot of sarcasm, and plenty of emotions, the narrator, also known as Rucks, creates an atmosphere of a campfire story, being told to anyone who dares to listen.Will you dare?

This game also mainly focuses on the narrator, as he talks about the story through the whole game. One of the great features of this game is that you can change the skill-level depending how you would like personally. The soundtrack is very traditional. Overall, this is a an exellent Action-RPG game with a deep storyline and great features also including 2 different story endings.Overall Rating: 9/10			"

												Bastion is an amazing game, with entertaining gameplay, a unique and beautiful artstyle, and most importantly an intricate, thorough, and moving story. The gameplay and combat is fairly straightforward, but the combinations of two weapons and a single skill can allow for many styles of play, and the lack of straight upgrades adds to this dynamic as well. Additionally, the system of leveling up was unique and further added to the styles of play, and the difficulty of the game scales well, with additional options to offer a greater challenge. Regardless of the engaging gameplay, Bastion excelled in its storytelling. Told through amazing narration, you experience the story of the world of the Bastion. The environment is defined by the artstyle and the soundtrack (which is definitely worth a listen). What stood out most to me concerning the story, however, was its ability to invoke an emotional response from me. As someone who usually plays games for just their gameplay, the whole story (and particularly the conclusion) I was surprised at how much I actually cared about the kid and the characters he meets. Overall, Bastion is definitely worth a purchase. Decent gameplay in an amazing environment with an engaging story made for a great game.			"

												9.75/10My freaking god, is this game good? Why are you asking that question? You don't have the time! Play it now!This would be 10/10 if it wasn't beatable in about 5 hours.You are The Kid. You awake in a world shaken by the calamity, the name should be enough for you to take a stab at what happened. But what really shines in this game isn't the amazing narration (which is 10/10) or the gameplay (9.5/10), but the ending. You have 2 sets of 2 choices, something unheard of until that point. SPOLIERS: The first decision is to take a half-dead man back home. Answer is simple, yes right? Wrong. For one, you have a leigon of angry people on your doorstep wanting to attack you, and for two... That man is the one who caused this whole mess. The second one is even harder. Do you revert the world back to before the calamity? Or adventure with the quartet you got to know over the game? If you choose the first option, the calamity will happen again. You will do what happened in the game again. You will choose that choice again, forever. If you choose the next one, you get to adventure with everyone you came to love other the game... The catch? The world stays in it's ruined state, forever.Get. This. Game.			"

												If you like adventure games, you must give Bastion a try.The art, aesthetics, music, lore, and especially the great narration all combine to provide you with a refreshing adventure experience. The levels are very detailed, and the routes you can take are assembled in front of you as you walk (you can easily fall off the map, which will result in some health loss). There are many destructable objects in the game - this is indicated by the object flashing red whenever you hit it (most objects can be destroyed).As you play, a narrator comments on certain things you do. For example, you may come across a mechanical bull and, if you decide to attack it, the narrator will say something like: ""the kid (you) gave him exactly what he deserved."" The music also changes appropriately when you are in the heat of battle.The controls are very easy to use, however, the feedback prompts can get annoying (for example, when you are at less-than-half health, the keyboard key ""F"" will appear next to your character, along with ""heal."" These button reminders can be helpful, as the game will prompt you to block if you are taking constant damage, however, it can become repetitive if you arleady have mastered the controls.There are many weapons to unlock, and you can equip two at a time; you can also use your shield by pressing/holding shift. Blocking right before the moment an enemy's attack hits you will result in an autoattack. You reflect enemy projectiles if you block with the correct timing. There are a variety of special ""secret moves"" available, and you can equip one - you have to have the specific weapon the skill is bound to equipped. Later, you will also be able to select things like drink passives (provide bonuses like extra health) or ""god"" artifacts that make enemies stronger, but also provide you with a bonus to experience. Everything is upgraded with experience that comes in the form of little blue collectibles. You can select between uo yo 6 different upgrades for each weapon ( 3 active at a time).The game consists of you collecting cores/shards in each level in order to bring the ""Bastion"" base to life - each core you collect usually opens a new building slot in the Bastion, allowing you to select which building type you would like to build first (ex: armory for equipping weapons and skills, or distillery for equipping passive drinks). There are a variety of buildings, each unlocked for building as you progress through the story.There are also weapon challenge levels, where you have to perform a task like destroying a number of items with the hammer within a time frame. Each challenge level has 3 difficulty tiers, and beating the time for that tier yields a prize (1st place is always a secret move). The learning curve is very good, however, the game can get difficult if you use a lot of god trinkets (to increase enemey characteristics) - I equipped a total of 4 and would die from most enemies within 4-5 hits.The game is very charming and I strongly recommend it if you like adventure games with very nice aesthetics and narration.

												Bastion is, hands down, one of the best games I have ever had the fortune of playing. The visuals are incredibly appealing vibrant, fitting colours, detailed artwork. The western-theme nicely by the western music, which is very fitting on the game as a whole. The narrator's voice-overs and explanations for things are flawless and quirky, and make you want to hear more. The gameplay is great fun the combat, starting simple, becomes increasingly fast-paced and skill-based, especially when all idols are enabled for full difficulty. As you progress through the mysterious-yet-lore-heavy storyline, more weapons are unlocked, allowing you to play using different styles. You can eventually customize a ""build"" (a weapon loadout and some bonuses, called spirits). And the gameplay doesn't get old. Many games turn into grinding for levels, but Bastion encourages to play just to play. I am playing through the main storyline for the third time now, having already beaten it once in its regular story and difficulty, and another time in New Game with all idols activated. Replay-ability is very high, and I still have not grown bored of it.			"

Long enough for me to become rather fond of it, but not so long that it ever felt like it wasn't in motion. None of it felt like a grind.

												Bastion is a super fun, yet challenging game with a pretty art style and a good soundtrack!As to be expected from a Super Giant game, it is very story rich, with a fixed narrative. There is however, some agency you keep, since the narrator is only an NPC and his view can be challenged. But the gameplay isn't just follwoing the plotline-levels, there are the seperate weapon-levels as well where you can gather prizes based on your performance. To me, those were a welcome change and a fun challenge! I also liked that there is the possibilty to manually upgrade and put together your own weapon set. It encourages you to experiment with differnt fighting techniques and combos, which is always nice.All in all, I enjoyed playing Bastion and look forward to replaying it! "

												I just finished Bastion and really enjoyed it. Highly recommended!Gameplay: 8/10 -- Pretty standard stuff, i.e. everything you need from an isometric top-view style action-RPG. Not too complicated, not too simple.Visuals: 9/10 -- Really beautiful hand-drawn world, with a genuine ""feeling"" to it. Animation and cutscenes were also cool. I like how the world ""came together"" as you walked.Audio: 11/10 -- The music is fantastic and the ""Narrator"", accompanying you throught *all* the game, is just awesome. Easily the strongest aspect of the game.Story: 7/10 -- The story is OK, but there's too few characters (err, 4 of them!) and only a couple are really ""explored"". The world the game unveils is interesting, albeit tuned for ""all ages"" audiences.It took me about 12 hours to finish the game; the difficulty was quite OK, maybe a bit easy. I completed almost everything in the standard story-mode, and I didn't do any of ""Game Plus"", for the time being.Achievements (both in-game and steam ones) were quite finely tuned to my liking, keeping me reasonably motivated to play and earn more as I went.My sole problems were: (1) my no-name PS3-like USB gamepad wasn't recognised; typical... (2) Isometric top-view has the NE-SW and NW-SE as the two principal axes, so playing with WASD keys [N-S and W-E axes] was a little weird at first; but I quickly adapted.			"

												Bastion is an amazing game, filled with colorful art and a sexy narration that tells the story as you play as oppose to ripping the camera and controls from you so you can watch a 5 minute cut scene. I would love to play another game with this guy as a lead voice. Music for the game is also very good and fitting for this kind of game, somewhat somber at times.The game play is pretty fast pace and excellent, though has it's short falls. One of them is that you are given too many weapons, Unless you plan on experimenting with the weapon load-out, You will usually stick with what works for you. Same with secret skills, which I hardly ever used while playing. Overall, an amazing game that opens up for you the more you play.			"

												One of the best Indie games I've ever played. That is the best example for can be done without being an AAA title.First, the story. The voice of the narrator was the first thing that baffled me. He describes everything (so no character voice), but it's in a unique, very fascinating way.The combat is balanced and well designed. There is no A click, there is more to discover and ""learn"". If you hit an enemy you really can ""feel"" it.The graphics are simple but awesome. The are is painted and differs from any other game I've played. There is no 3D super-hyper-cool-AAA-Shader-Textures-Bling-Bling (thank god). Even the graphics were well-thought-out and matches perfectly.The soundtrack was so good, that i just had to buy the soundtrack.With pure conscience I do recommend this game, if you like RPG style games of course :-)			"

												Although I truly believe that Bastion could have doubled its length in terms of gameplay, I'm glad that the story didn't risk imploding on itself. Don't let anyone tell you this is a Diablo clone–that would cheapen Bastion; it needs to be heard to be believed.			"

												If you like adventure games, you must give Bastion a try.The art, aesthetics, music, lore, and especially the great narration all combine to provide you with a refreshing adventure experience. The levels are very detailed, and the routes you can take are assembled in front of you as you walk (you can easily fall off the map, which will result in some health loss). There are many destructable objects in the game - this is indicated by the object flashing red whenever you hit it (most objects can be destroyed).As you play, a narrator comments on certain things you do. For example, you may come across a mechanical bull and, if you decide to attack it, the narrator will say something like: ""the kid (you) gave him exactly what he deserved."" The music also changes appropriately when you are in the heat of battle.The controls are very easy to use, however, the feedback prompts can get annoying (for example, when you are at less-than-half health, the keyboard key ""F"" will appear next to your character, along with ""heal."" These button reminders can be helpful, as the game will prompt you to block if you are taking constant damage, however, it can become repetitive if you arleady have mastered the controls.There are many weapons to unlock, and you can equip two at a time; you can also use your shield by pressing/holding shift. Blocking right before the moment an enemy's attack hits you will result in an autoattack. You reflect enemy projectiles if you block with the correct timing. There are a variety of special ""secret moves"" available, and you can equip one - you have to have the specific weapon the skill is bound to equipped. Later, you will also be able to select things like drink passives (provide bonuses like extra health) or ""god"" artifacts that make enemies stronger, but also provide you with a bonus to experience. Everything is upgraded with experience that comes in the form of little blue collectibles. You can select between uo yo 6 different upgrades for each weapon ( 3 active at a time).The game consists of you collecting cores/shards in each level in order to bring the ""Bastion"" base to life - each core you collect usually opens a new building slot in the Bastion, allowing you to select which building type you would like to build first (ex: armory for equipping weapons and skills, or distillery for equipping passive drinks). There are a variety of buildings, each unlocked for building as you progress through the story.There are also weapon challenge levels, where you have to perform a task like destroying a number of items with the hammer within a time frame. Each challenge level has 3 difficulty tiers, and beating the time for that tier yields a prize (1st place is always a secret move). The learning curve is very good, however, the game can get difficult if you use a lot of god trinkets (to increase enemey characteristics) - I equipped a total of 4 and would die from most enemies within 4-5 hits.The game is very charming and I strongly recommend it if you like adventure games with very nice aesthetics and narration.

												Bastion is, hands down, one of the best games I have ever had the fortune of playing. The visuals are incredibly appealing vibrant, fitting colours, detailed artwork. The western-theme nicely by the western music, which is very fitting on the game as a whole. The narrator's voice-overs and explanations for things are flawless and quirky, and make you want to hear more. The gameplay is great fun the combat, starting simple, becomes increasingly fast-paced and skill-based, especially when all idols are enabled for full difficulty. As you progress through the mysterious-yet-lore-heavy storyline, more weapons are unlocked, allowing you to play using different styles. You can eventually customize a ""build"" (a weapon loadout and some bonuses, called spirits). And the gameplay doesn't get old. Many games turn into grinding for levels, but Bastion encourages to play just to play. I am playing through the main storyline for the third time now, having already beaten it once in its regular story and difficulty, and another time in New Game with all idols activated. Replay-ability is very high, and I still have not grown bored of it.			"

												what a game! i hate to rave about the soundtrack, since so many often do, but it really is something special. one of the first game soundtracks i've ever purchased, and felt good about purchasing. the gameplay catches a lot of crap, and i can see why, but i think that if you experiment with your loadout enough, the game stays fresh. a lot of people just stick with the hammer/repeater, which is good, but can get really boring really fast. only two characters have any real voice work, and it's done absolutely beautifully. the characters and their stories are compelling, and you'll do the same god damn level over and over to learn more about them. the story started off confusing and difficult to get into, but the more you learn, the more interested you become. highly recommend even at full price. get the soundtrack, too.

Well today, being super bored that I was, and trying some of these games that I own, but never played, this was an unexpected surprise!  It's a narrative story, that narrates as you are playing, and surprisingly it included actions that I did in the world that I wasn't expecting at all.

Bastion is an action adventure set in a wonderfully colorful hand-drawn surreal world. It is accompanied by a very unique soundtrack and a stunning narration, which reacts to every move of yours. The both story and action pacing are well tuned.What I liked:+ wonderful and colorful, hand-drawn surreal artstyle+ one of the best narration performances+ a fresh style of narration, which comments everything you do with your character+ amazingly unique soundtrack, described as ""acoustic frontier trip-hop"" (I told you it's unique!)+ the action and arcade plattform elements were varied up with different weapons, each with its unique fighting style+ all the weapons are customizable, allowing for further variety+ the world builds up and crumbles around you as you go and the story unfolds+ the length was just right with around 10 hours to not become staleWhat I disliked:- if you go for the challenge areas in the game or even one step further and replay the game in NG+, you will get a repetitive experienceVerdict:  MUST BUY!  Bastion is an indie action adventure game breaking many frontiers. A unique, refreshing and fascniating experience. "

												This is quite possibly the best game I have ever played. Bastion presents itself as a work of art in so many different ways - from the visual style and narration to the combat and characters. Even though this is a short game, it is the only game I've ever played in which I immediately started playing again once I finished it. Not to mention - the story is engaging, making you care for the characters deeply. It is not only engrossing, but the added features like a Challenge Mode and New Game + Mode make this game easy to come back to again and again. I couldn't recommend Bastion enough.			"

												A unique aspect to Bastion, and possibly the reason of it's positive reception, is how the game engages the player: instead of having dialogue boxes, you have a voice narrating your every move in the game, whether you're countering enemy attacks, switching your weapons, and even falling off cliffs or dying. This gives a persistent idea that even the simplest action you take in the game is meaningful, an idea that I guarantee you'll enjoy.A small catch is that Bastion doesn't offer much aside from the first playthrough, but that's still a 10-20 hours of a good game, mind you, and this game definitely worth the price.

												Kid finds the Bastion on Steam sale...It welcomes him with a familiar, yet fresh style. Its landscapes like an oil painting, its soundtrack envelopes the world beautifully and animations are elegantly sleek. Certainly a strong argument that games can themselves be a work of artHack n slash... kid's seen it before. But not like this. Elegant combat mechanics and a hearty arsenal that continues to grow throughout the game - each with their own distinct niche and style. Hard to comment on balance... kid seemed to believe that some were stronger than others, but friends found otherwise. Certainly reassuring to see each weapon come with its own learning curve of sorts. But kid can only pick two... that and the shield on his back. Game's not that cruel though... kid can change loadouts, and even change the upgrades themselves for free - allowing the full enjoyment of exploring different combinations to suit their style without punishing the decisions. Certainly more forgiving... than the calamity...About that... this story ain't anything new. It doesn't twist and turn, but is elegantly spun with nothing more than the guiding sound of a rustic narrator to weave the story together as the world itself continually weaves beneath the kid's feet. Every now and then the plot will be augmented with a single, simple, yet beautiful drawingBlack potions also help the kid to... swing things in his favour in a pinch. A single special ability. Balance is definitely more questionable here. Use the Calamity Cannon multi-shot ability and come tell me the other ones match it.

												A unique aspect to Bastion, and possibly the reason of it's positive reception, is how the game engages the player: instead of having dialogue boxes, you have a voice narrating your every move in the game, whether you're countering enemy attacks, switching your weapons, and even falling off cliffs or dying. This gives a persistent idea that even the simplest action you take in the game is meaningful, an idea that I guarantee you'll enjoy.A small catch is that Bastion doesn't offer much aside from the first playthrough, but that's still a 10-20 hours of a good game, mind you, and this game definitely worth the price.

												Years after its initial release, Bastion still stands strong as a fresh, entertaining approach to storytelling. Good games usually show off dazzling graphics, super fun gameplay, or memorable quests; truly great games sometimes even contain strong characters or engaging plots. Rarely does a video game story transcend its medium, however, and also carry emotional weight. Bastion is lush and beautiful, but it's also heart-breaking and soul-searching. This is the sort of prophetic adventure that everyone should experience. Strongly recommended.			"

												I think it's about time I write a review for what is probably my favourite game of all time.Bastion is something that I view as the pinnacle of games as an art form. Not only does it have great art in many forms (music, aesthetic, the writing of the plot and the narration), but the main instrument of that art is still the gameplay. By this point, you probably already know the main ""quirk"" of the game: its narrator that comments your actions, sometimes important, sometimes trivial. However, Bastion goes beyond that. It's packed full of music that wouldn't shy away as a standalone album, visuals that would probably sell as paintings, and a story that warrants a book. And on top of that you have the action packed and surprisingly complex gameplay that serves both as a challenge and a tool to explore and reveal more of the game. The beatiful environment literally builds under your feet as  you walk. The story unravels through the narration of your actions. And the wondeful music supports it all.If you love indie games and somehow never picked up Bastion do it. You will not regret it.			"

Bastion presents itself as a work of art in so many different ways - from the visual style and narration to the combat and characters. Even though this is a short game, it is the only game I've ever played in which I immediately started playing again once I finished it. Not to mention - the story is engaging, making you care for the characters deeply. It is not only engrossing, but the added features like a Challenge Mode and New Game + Mode make this game easy to come back to again and again. I couldn't recommend Bastion enough.			"

												It's all about the presentation, and it's amazing. The sound design is incredible (the soundtrack is spot on, and the narrator is legendary); the visuals are spot on: the world falls in place and collapses all around the main characters as he moves, mimicking the main theme of the game. I've been singing the main theme song for years after playing for the first time.Main game is 6-8 hours long, with a few extra stages focused on specific weapons. The game, however, can be replayed using different equipment combinations and, most of all, activating specific conditions to make the game harder (enemies don't drop potions, character is slowed after taking damage...).A must have, even if isometric brawlers are not your favorite genre.

												Please...give me...more thumbs up buttons to click, for Bastion!!!This little game swept me off my feet and reeled me in at the first few seconds of starting it...First of all - Logan Cunningham is probably the best choice -ever- to be a narrator! His calm, deep and yet somehow so soft and pleasant voice follows the player throughout the whole game, and it could not have been a better 'companion'. The little parts of story that he tells you (well, or is telling Zia, in game, whilst The Kid goes and does the hard work) are a great little adition to your adventures. A more serious look at the past of that world, a bit of a comical insert (especially if you roll off an edge. *cough* Totally not me. *cough*), a touching, warmhearting little story...all of it is like a puzzle of vocal little pieces, that you have to put together to understand what has happened in the world of Bastion. And quite honestly - it's a brilliant way of making the player 'dive into the Bastion's Universe' and enjoy the game, his own actions during the game, whilst getting told facts or stories about the world (or the particular creatures that he's fighting currently. Second - the gameplay and looks. Amazing! As in...I could not have wished for better, from a little indie (and at the current moment - already OLD indie) game! It's rather beautiful and eerie, fluently swapping between various enviroments even on the same level. Yes, of course, the actions, combat itself will be simple and noone should expect some ultra-super-duper-gazillion-slashes-in-air-in-a-wave-like-motion-before-smacking-a-mob. But I still found it extremely enjoyable. Mostly due to the fact that you actually get such a weapon and playstyle variety, that even some of the new games pale in comparison! The mix and match of the combat possibilities is amazing. Third - the soundtrack! It's brilliant! Going from a heart-pumping rythm that makes you want to score the best...to an almost tear-jerker, as you listen to some more emotional parts of the story, told by the excellent narrator....If I knew it was so amazing, I would have bought it for the full price as well! An excellent little game that kept me entertained with every second I spent on it. And oh you bet - I will be going back into it, to get those achievements and explore the rest of the weapon combinations... :D			"

It really only took me about 6 hours to go through every level and do moderately well at the challanges and achievements.While normally this is a problem for me because I like to get a lot of time out of my games as I'm pretty stingy when it comes to buying games, but it wasn't.Bastion took me for a ride I never expected. With an intriguing post-apocolyptic/ frontier theme, Bastion packs gameplay, story and asthetics all into one neat package that doesn't drag on spoiling the games like many other longer games might. All in all, Bastion is well worth the money and time it costs.I hesitate to call Bastion a masterpiece as that is not lightly given, but regardless, Bastion was masterfully done and I enjoyed every moment of it.

You will enjoy this beautiful story told by the narrator, while you play in a similar Hack and Slash mode. The game offer a lot of modes and extras to complete the game several times and more even if you want the achievements.I have to recognise that the dreams with the 10 idols are sometimes frustrating because they are hard, but even then you will be enjoying a good game with an epic soundtrack.Buy it, you will not regret it.

												It's all about the presentation, and it's amazing. The sound design is incredible (the soundtrack is spot on, and the narrator is legendary); the visuals are spot on: the world falls in place and collapses all around the main characters as he moves, mimicking the main theme of the game. I've been singing the main theme song for years after playing for the first time.Main game is 6-8 hours long, with a few extra stages focused on specific weapons. The game, however, can be replayed using different equipment combinations and, most of all, activating specific conditions to make the game harder (enemies don't drop potions, character is slowed after taking damage...).A must have, even if isometric brawlers are not your favorite genre.

												Please...give me...more thumbs up buttons to click, for Bastion!!!This little game swept me off my feet and reeled me in at the first few seconds of starting it...First of all - Logan Cunningham is probably the best choice -ever- to be a narrator! His calm, deep and yet somehow so soft and pleasant voice follows the player throughout the whole game, and it could not have been a better 'companion'. The little parts of story that he tells you (well, or is telling Zia, in game, whilst The Kid goes and does the hard work) are a great little adition to your adventures. A more serious look at the past of that world, a bit of a comical insert (especially if you roll off an edge. *cough* Totally not me. *cough*), a touching, warmhearting little story...all of it is like a puzzle of vocal little pieces, that you have to put together to understand what has happened in the world of Bastion. And quite honestly - it's a brilliant way of making the player 'dive into the Bastion's Universe' and enjoy the game, his own actions during the game, whilst getting told facts or stories about the world (or the particular creatures that he's fighting currently. Second - the gameplay and looks. Amazing! As in...I could not have wished for better, from a little indie (and at the current moment - already OLD indie) game! It's rather beautiful and eerie, fluently swapping between various enviroments even on the same level. Yes, of course, the actions, combat itself will be simple and noone should expect some ultra-super-duper-gazillion-slashes-in-air-in-a-wave-like-motion-before-smacking-a-mob. But I still found it extremely enjoyable. Mostly due to the fact that you actually get such a weapon and playstyle variety, that even some of the new games pale in comparison! The mix and match of the combat possibilities is amazing. Third - the soundtrack! It's brilliant! Going from a heart-pumping rythm that makes you want to score the best...to an almost tear-jerker, as you listen to some more emotional parts of the story, told by the excellent narrator....If I knew it was so amazing, I would have bought it for the full price as well! An excellent little game that kept me entertained with every second I spent on it. And oh you bet - I will be going back into it, to get those achievements and explore the rest of the weapon combinations... :D			"

												Surprisingly good and lovely game. It has a nice and intriguing story and cowboy-like songs and narrative that mixes very well with the intended atmosphere. I love the narrator's voiceover, btw. The game itself is easy and fast paced. You have to clear levels and, one after one, the story advances in the ""city"" (Bastion), revealling more details of future and past. You gain abilities and new weapons and customizations each level aswell. You can carry two weapons and one power at the same time, but can shift between all your unlocked weapons anytime at the arsenal buildings.On the last part, you have to make a choice (no spoilers) which leads you to one of the two avaiable endings. I recommend this game for pretty much everyone, specially those looking for a light story with soft gameplay elements and not so time/commitment requiring. I also recommend this game to children of 7+ yo; not because this game is silly or childish, but because there is no gore or explicit violence and kids could find the colorful themes and animations quite entertaining. At last, there's something on the moral of the story that parents could find inspiring and teaching aswell.			"

												Bastion is a short game. It really only took me about 6 hours to go through every level and do moderately well at the challanges and achievements.While normally this is a problem for me because I like to get a lot of time out of my games as I'm pretty stingy when it comes to buying games, but it wasn't.Bastion took me for a ride I never expected. With an intriguing post-apocolyptic/ frontier theme, Bastion packs gameplay, story and asthetics all into one neat package that doesn't drag on spoiling the games like many other longer games might. All in all, Bastion is well worth the money and time it costs.I hesitate to call Bastion a masterpiece as that is not lightly given, but regardless, Bastion was masterfully done and I enjoyed every moment of it.

Yes, of course, the actions, combat itself will be simple and noone should expect some ultra-super-duper-gazillion-slashes-in-air-in-a-wave-like-motion-before-smacking-a-mob. But I still found it extremely enjoyable. Mostly due to the fact that you actually get such a weapon and playstyle variety, that even some of the new games pale in comparison! The mix and match of the combat possibilities is amazing. Third - the soundtrack! It's brilliant! Going from a heart-pumping rythm that makes you want to score the best...to an almost tear-jerker, as you listen to some more emotional parts of the story, told by the excellent narrator....If I knew it was so amazing, I would have bought it for the full price as well! An excellent little game that kept me entertained with every second I spent on it. And oh you bet - I will be going back into it, to get those achievements and explore the rest of the weapon combinations... :D			"

The art style and voice over for the game is what really sets it apart and has some quite touching moments. The game took me a total of 8 hours to complete, but that was on and off playing.

												This is quite possibly the best game I have ever played. Bastion presents itself as a work of art in so many different ways - from the visual style and narration to the combat and characters. Even though this is a short game, it is the only game I've ever played in which I immediately started playing again once I finished it. Not to mention - the story is engaging, making you care for the characters deeply. It is not only engrossing, but the added features like a Challenge Mode and New Game + Mode make this game easy to come back to again and again. I couldn't recommend Bastion enough.			"

Progressing through the game, you find yourself being able to customize your character's unlockables to fit your playstyle and what you do best with, and the choice to upgrade what you want, when you want is great. If you pay attention to the lore that the amazing narration fills in for you, you'll be wholly immersed.

												This game is great. I was immediately surprised by how easy it is to play with multiple combinations of weapons and skills, especially since each weapon is rather well balanced, and it is both possible and feasible to use any combination you can imagine, except perhaps in the case of weapon-specific skills. Also, the dynamic narration and music (also dynamic!) really help with the atmosphere, and the decisions you make actually have consequences. This is a fine example of a game where YOU get to choose how you will play. Will you bring a pair of ranged weapons? Or will you go full melee? Maybe you prefer a ranged weapon and a melee weapon. This game lets you play with any combination! The roll ability especially adds to the gameplay, allowing you to gain distance for a ranged strike, or move in for a quick melee attack. It has been a while since I played a game this dynamic and fluid, and I happily recommend it to anyone reading this.			"

												My God, I've just finished this game and I have no words to describe how hilarious it is. Maybe it's just me, and this game suits me well, but I've had one of the most awesome experiences in my gamer-life. Mostly it's thanks to the story - smooth and perfect, it slowly unfolds before your eyes. The ending touches, but I won't be relling a word not to accidentally spoil someone's gaming experience.The second awesome thing is soundtrack. My Goodness, how I loved it! One day I've caught myself humming one of the motives during the working day - and than's when I realized i was in love with it. So grammophone was just another piece of game for me, perfect in itself.The other aspects of this hilarious game were also leaving only positive impressions - battle system, weapons upgrade system, spirits, special ablities, shrines with varying difficultie through the game, pets (omg, Squirt was sooo qute!) and so on. Of course the draphic design - the style is just complementing the whole picture, creating the masterpiece.So, if you ask me, I would completely reccomend this game to everyone who loves game with strong breathtaking stories.

												This game was like a book. Rucks narriates the story as you go, and your actions will be mentioned sometimes as well. Sometimes when you die Rucks will act as if he forgot where he was at or his trend of thought broke. It's like someone sitting down and telling you the story of the calamity and the Bastion, except your imagination of how the story goes is right in front of you. It's the best story a video game has ever told. Besides the superior story telling, this game is lots of fun. You can find and upgrade weapons and use secret skills to help fight your way through the many trials and battles. Choose two weapons to fight with and one secret skill and head for the many floating islands the calamity has caused to find cores and shards. In the end, you have to make two very tough decisions. Chose whether you are a thoughtful and unselfish person (my choice), or if you're a self-centered person and you don't care what happens to your friends. All you want is the calamity restored. The end of the game made me almost want to cry. I think I almost did. There's no other game that can come close to the feeling I had at the end of my journey. NOTHING can ever come close. Now, I am battling with my throat. It's both a good and bad feeling. The ONLY minus there is to this game is that it was too short and not hard enough. This game can be completed in just two days. I stopped playing on the second day because I wanted to preserve the game, so counting that delay, I completed it in three days. The difficulty wasn't hard enough. On a scale of 1 to 10 of difficulty, I rate this game 6/10 (or simply medium). Fortunately, there's an extra mode you unlock after beating the game, and I still have to check that out. But I think that the original mode was a little too easy and short, but besides those two, I rate this game a 10/10! I hope a sequel comes out soon. It had THE BEST video game story and is my most favorite game as of now. I don't think any other game will pass this out, and if it does, not by much. I recommend this game to everyone!			"

												Bastion is one of those games that will really stick with you once you complete it. Though the gameplay can be frustrating at times, especially because of the isometric viewpoint, the story is absolutely incredible. You explore the crumbling remnants of a ravaged world, trying to restore the Bastion, the one safe haven still available. As the game progresses, the story becomes even more engrossing, making it harder and harder to stop playing. The last few minutes, from the final portion of the last level to the end of the credits, is undoubtedly one of the best moments in gaming. Bastion is a phenomenal game, and I am still thinking about it even now. Definitely worth buying!			"

												Bastion is a Fantastic game and i enjoyed every single second of it! The game has great music and graphics. An interesting narrator that comments on your actions / decisions. And it also has a ""Campaign+"" Mode, Where you play the game over again with all of the stuff you got on your first playthrough. Its however a fairly short game that is not very challenging. However you can up the challenge by adding ""Idols"" Which makes the monsters harder to defeat, such as they attack faster, Take more damage on you, drop grenades once killed, Can't be shot with guns etc. This makes the game much harder.It's a fun little title which you'll beat in a few hours. I've read that some people have played it for more than 60Hours. I myself haven't come back to it yet but now im thinking about playing it once more as it was so fantastic!

												I picked up Bastion when it was on sale because I've heard so many great stories about its beauitful design and magnificent story. Both of those things don't generally appeal to me when searching for a game. I'm not one for graphics or storyline in any respect, but both of those things ended up being the reason I continued Bastion to the end and started it over once more.Its one of those rare games that triple A titles can't compete with.

												Short version: It's a good game with an awesome atmosphere and audio. Honestly it's too good to be an indie game and for it's price I'd definitely recommend buying it especially if it's on sale.What is Bastion? Well for me it was not only a game, but also an experience like Journey, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and other similar games. An experience that I will always remember.The gameplay is pretty simple: you move around the isometric maps and kill enemies and occasional bosses using a variety of melee and long range weapons. A more interesting twist is that later on you can set difficulty level you want by activating up to ten shrines that give various buffs to your enemies. Playing certain levels with all of the shrines active can be quite challenging. There is also a ""New Game+"" option when you finish the game and since it has multiple ending it can be worth having second playthrough.The visuals are very nice. Each level is beautifully drawn and the level builds up under your feet as you move which makes the overall look even more appealing. The sounds. There are two sides worth mentioning. The music and the Stranger. The music is really good and fits the game great. I'd probably think about buying it if I hadn't gotten it together with Bastion in the Humble Bundle. The Stranger is this games most known feature. He is the narrator that talks about you and your journey with a deep and very nice voice. He is so popular they even made a Bastion announcer for Dota 2.All in all this game will probably leave a lasting memory and is a great experience. I have really enjoyed playing it and it's definitely worth it's price. I would definitely recommend you to try Bastion. You will not regret it. "

												So freaking good. Almost five years later, it's a timeless masterpiece that you just want to keep playing more and more. At its core, it's a pretty simple story but it manages to charm and captivate like no other. The voiceover narration embedded into the gameplay is so expertly done. The soundtrack is easily one of the best ever in any form of entertainment, creating a new genre by itself. Combat it very satisfying and the game encourages you to try out different weapon combos and experiment with upgrades. There's plenty of totally optional ""proving grounds"" where, even if you fail the challenge, you learn something about how to best use a certain weapon. It's really well designed. The the upgrading and weapons system is quite in-depth for a game that looks so deceptively simple and playful from its tone. Passive bonuses from potions are great. There's a dynamic difficulty system where the player intentionally makes the game harder for themselves in exchange for more EXP, which is genius.All the areas are diverse and different enough so that you don't ever feel like you're doing the same thing twice. The handpainted environments are drop-dead gorgeous, only enhanced by the amazing soundtrack.I could go on for hours, but just buy the game. It's that good. "

												I have finished the game in normal mode, so it's time to write a review.If you expect a pure RPG like Runescape, this is not the type, but the graphics, audio, story, combat mechanics and effects are SO GOOD your money will not be wasted.This isn't a difficult game, you'll die once or twice, that's all.If you have time and money, just sit down and relax on some Bastion gameplay.+amazing story+awesome narration+mind-blowing graphics and fluidity+nice combat mechanics-not a ""real"" RPG, may be misleading-not too much freedom out of the story, however the story is very enjoyable-a bit too easy at times, and the save system may be frustrating (you need to finish the area before quitting)This game also has a touch of surrealism I enjoy.

												Should you play Bastion if you haven't done it yet? In one word : YES. Gameplay-wise the game is very well done. You collect weapons, spirits, level up, upgrade you weapons, etc. The difficulty level is adjustable by use of idols : you practically invoke the gods who in return make your life harder :) . To be honest, i played the game 3 times using the idols just to get more achievements. It's a blast! To make it short, the gameplay is engaging and challenging at times. Now the best part of Bastion : it's music and graphics. About the music there is nothing to say except that it's gorgeous. You'll definetly download the soundtrack and integrate it in your playlist. The narrator does a fantastic job at depicting the story and describing your every action. The narrator is no more that person who talks only between mission. If you break a vase, he tells you that, if you defeat a boss, he's certainly got something up his sleeve to say. And all this happenes without becoming too annoying.The graphics are astounding despite the fact they are 2d (or at least the background is). In fact, this has an even more powerful impact on your perception than a game who has 3d graphics. Every detail in the game is finely drawn and you'll feel the urge to explore every nook and cranny just to see the vistas.So, what are you doing here reading ? Go buy the game!9/10			"

												This is a brilliant game in which you can play for hours in the main story line and side bits and acheivements to complete. The game is very colourful and the narration is done brilliantly in which it comments on things you do as you do them and can be very funny at times. The game has some epic weapons which give you extra satisfaction at killing those pesky enemies. Highly recommend.			"

												Much <3 for Bastion.  Has a simple but deep tree of weapon and character upgrade options for people who, like me, are obsessed with building characters.  Beyond that, the story is deftly told by an amazing narrator, and is a wonderful ""weird adventure""  tale that doesn't overreach itself.  You'll want either an actual Xbox controller or Joy to Key, probabably.			"

												One of the most competent, enjoyable, and original indie games that I have played in recent memory. An Action RPG that blends the water-color paint style of Braid with the insanely addictive character building of 16-bit era games such as Secret of Mana, Bastion is an easy two thumbs up. What surprised me about Bastion the most was the unique storytelling format with an unusual, unexpectedly deep plot. The lack of multiplayer is the only significant issue, but at this price I have no reason to complain. If the developers could brew a sequel with multiplayer, it would be a classic for the ages.

I finally got around to playing it and absolutely loved it. The graphics and soundtrack are perfect. The way the story is told is really awesome and fairly unique. It's not a very long game (I think it took me about 4 hours to finish it). Towards the end of the game I started to feel like it was a bit repetitive, but never once did I want to stop playing. The game is an absolute must-play and is a truly wonderful experience.			"
