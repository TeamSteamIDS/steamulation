												If old style RPGs are your thing then this game is for you. It has most of the traits of old RPGS and JRPGS, random encounters, leveling systems, good background music, and occasional comedy.			"

												Breath of Death VII, along with Cthulu Saves the World, is a nice throwback for JRPG fans and has some nice comedic dialogue and characters that'll entertain you. It's about 6 hours for both games, for a measly 3 dollars. So you should get it, you cutie, you.			"

												This game is a turn based-jrpg with a retro feel into it. Don't expect a game in the scope of Chrono Trigger, FFIII and all those jrpg classic's. It is not a such a game. I would describe it as a ""parody"" of those games. It has some good dialogues and there are tons of references of retro games. Even the title is a reference to Breath of FIre. A feature that I liked it that when you level up, it gives you two choices of what you want to upgrade. For example it can be your defence, or you may improve a certain spellThere is also a limit in each dungeon for the rendom encounters, so at some point there will not be any more random battles. But that doesn't mean that you can't fight at will. If you bring on the pause menu, there is an option to fight an enemy if you fought all the battles in that dungeons and you want more. . The story is not anything special and the combat can feel a little bit repetitive. Later on, on the game I found that I could just skip some battles with just mushing the A key. It is about 5 with 7 hours long. There are not that many things to discover outside of the main story, so you can't enhance that time.Buy if: - You are a fan of the snes jrpg classics and you want to play a parody about them.Don't Buy if: -You expect it to be the next Chrono Trigger, Earthbound, Breath of Fire, Final Fantasy III etc.                    -You have never played a jrpg before, and you to want to intorduce yourself to the genre.

												Breath of Death VII is an old school RPG where you find your party members and fight random battles with a turn based system. Part of the charm to this game is that it mimics the original Dragon Quest games in color, menus, maps and even the feel of the towns. After each battle, each party member gets restored to full health, including dead characters. Even if you escape, you get full health. This makes the game streamlined and easy even on hard difficulty. To compensate for this, the game balances out by powering up the monsters after each round. Their attack strength keep going up by 10%. It puts pressure to finish the fight fast. There is also no run, but instead its relegated to a magic skill given to one character. One of the biggest enjoyments that I get out of the game is the ability to chose one of two bonuses every time a character reaches a new level. Do you chose this spell or that spell? Do you want +20 Max HP and +20 strength or +10 Strength + 10 Willpower +10 Magic +10 Vitality? After level 30, the game runs out of choices for you.The challenge is in your MP / mana. You will get some back after each level, but outside of an Inn or a save point (you can save on the fly too). You won't be able to refill your magic. On the surface, fighting and button mashing make quick work of enemies. Deeper into any dungeon makes fighting difficult without using magic or techniques (both cost MP / mana). While battles are random, the dungeons have specific numbers of battles before the random battles get down to 0. So if you fight 20 random battles, you won't have any other random battles to fight. This works well, because you can go deep into a dungeon, have no mana left and need to walk back out of the dungeon. Having 0 remaining random battles ensures your survival. Since there is no sort of easy teleportation. A few dungeons force you to beat the boss and walk back. Luckily there is a run button.Spells get upgraded. The heal spell can get upgraded to resurrect. Making it easy if a character dies that you're trying to heal, well they're just resurrected! There aren't items, but there are potions. You can't buy these, you need to find them in caves. They resurrect and give full health to any character. These are necessary if your lone healer dies. There is a health regenerating zombie though and a vampire sort of attack with another character.The leader of your party is a silent (yet thinking) skeleton, a ghost princess healer, a vampire nerd and a prince zombie. They are all powerful in their own way. In battle, two of the characters can join forces for big attacks. The only problem is both need to be alive to do them. Its not a problem toward the beginning of the game.About 7 hours into the game, I noticed there is a combo system. Sure its always been there. I just didn't find it useful. Every attack builds a combo. There are special combo boosts and breakers that when used will multiply the damage by the combo, but reset the combo to 0. It would be more useful if these specials weren't already the highest damagers in general. You can keep using them to kill the enemies quickly without having to build a combo.When I played, I found normal (medium) difficulty far too easy, so I played on hard. On hard, the bosses became insurmountable. Like any RPG, grinding made any boss easier. The menu has a 'fight' command that will cue up a random battle for you! For the most part random battles are a numbers game. Not your stats vs their stats, but your remaining members against their remaining members. The party that outnumbers the other wins unless one of them balances out the numbers. Bosses were a major issue on hard, which made for an hour long grind on many of them. One boss, I had literally run out of enemies to grind and couldn't beat a boss. I had to leave the dungeon by walking mind you and grind on over world enemies. Then walk all the way back to the boss with 0 enemies. It just felt unnecessary and hindered my ability to enjoy the game.For equipment, Breath of Death is bare bones. You have a weapon and armor. No headgear, no accessory. Towns don't have more than a couple weapons and armor for your four characters. There are a few treasures here and there in dungeons. Treasures in towns get relegated to jokes, like ""A true hero wouldn't steal from a person, even if there's a bazooka in there."" There is no interaction with anything outside of talking to townspeople. Nothing hidden in book shelves or pots. It is sad how little effort got put into the details outside of readable tombstones in one lone graveyard.The world itself feels big enough. There are around 10+ dungeons and 3+ towns. You won't get to travel the oceans or visit far off lands, but the dungeons are the real maps. Each dungeon feels big enough. There are mostly underground areas, a prison and the ruins of giant towns. You can tackle them pretty openly. The second area has three dungeons you can visit. Yet, with the fourth, it bluntly tells you not to go in there yet. It just seems like a cheap reason, when other RPGs would point out we need the X to continue.The game really wants to hang its hat on comedy. There are funny tombstones and excessive references to classic lines in other video games. ""Hey listen!"" ""Its a secret to everybody!"" ""Master of unlocking."" ""Welcome strangah! what-cha buyin"" ""I am error"" ""Motherbound"" ""Perhaps your prince is in another castle?"" Even a reference to Bionic Commando that made me laugh, because that one was unexpected. The rest of the references have become commonplace on the Internet. Not only that, but there is a replica / parody of Zelda 2's version of Death Mountain. Other than that, the humor doesn't seem overwhelming. Sometimes less is more.I just didn't care for the game's humor like I did with Cthulhu Saves the World. Breath of Death VII feels like it doesn't have its own jokes and relies too much on your knowledge from 25 year old dialog.Then there are the game's other issues. Three years after its release, the game still has issues here and there. Enemies immune to poison, still get poisoned. Two dungeons have no music. That could be a good thing when all the other dungeons have the same music that overstays its welcome. Getting experience still seems glitched. plenty of times, I'd look at the status screen. I needed 4,000 more EXP, then beat another group of enemies earning 1,500 EXP only to discover that I still needed 4,000 more EXP. In a game where grinding is necessary, its an issue. I'm left with a feeling of knowing that I have to invest another hour into the game grinding before I'll face the boss of any area again.If you don't want to get too involved with a 40 - 80 hour RPG, Breath of Death could be for you. With saving anywhere and refilling your HP after every battle, that makes for an easy game. Some people like easy! Some complain that the game is 3 - 5 hours, that's perfect for $3 in my opinion. For the $1 combo pack that I bought it in. I feel like I got my money's worth thanks to hard mode. As for this being a fun, entertaining game, it wasn't. I spent several hours grinding to overcome boss after boss.  Maybe I made it too hard by playing hard mode and turned a 5 hour game into an 11 hour game with 6 hours of grinding, but I can only review my own experience with the game.			"

												This is a must buy for fans of early JRPGs. Lots of jokes about other JRPGs, mainly from the NES and SNES eras. The battle system is fast paced and everytime you level up, you have a decision on what type of upgrade you want for each character. The storyline is about 5 hours long, but the game includes extra modes to try out also.			"

 “The chest screams ‘Bazooka of Ultimate Destruction’ to me!” Breath of Death VII: The Beginning (BoDVII) is a classic 2-D turn-based role-playing game (rpg) developed by the company Zeboyd Games with emphasis on combat mechanics and tactics.  Atmosphere & presentation: + The 16-bit-style and general layout of the game provides a retro-feeling. + Various entertaining allusions and references to rpgs from the ‘90s. o Relatively short game that can be finished within a few hours.- The musical background lacks variety. Combat & gameplay: + Fast paced battle system with round-based combat mechanics. + Easy character development with branching level-up system. + Employs an interesting combo system with multi-character combination techniques for special attacks.o Party size is limited to a maximum of four characters.o Encounters in an area are limited (with a manual option to have additional encounters).- Next to the protagonist there are only three recruitable characters. Characters & story: + Creative characters offer amusing dialogues and slapstick humour.  - Lack of coherent and fluid story telling.- No voice acting during the entire game. Summary: Zeboyd Games has created with BoDVII a short and entertaining game experience. It pays tribute to the classic rpg genre and successfully mimics the basic mechanics without overstaying its welcome. Trivia: Despite its title, it is the only game of its ""series"", and the previous ""six"" do not exist. The title is simply a parody. Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements.

												It's been awhile since I played through this game, but I'd like to write my lasting thoughts on it.  The game was incredibly short for the style of game it was; however, for what it was it was an amazing experience.  It typically can be purchased for next to nothing during steam sales and for what you pay vs what you get, this game is amazing.  Decent story line, fun old style turn based RPG, and let's not forget the humor spread all throughout the game.  If you're a fan of the old style RPGs like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy this game will delight you for a few hours.			"

												Breath of Death VII is a very short and basic, yet enjoyable, RPG. As someone with little experience playing RPGs, I found myself able to enjoy this one a lot. I imagine hardcore fans will find this game boring and lackluster, so don't have very high expectations. This game is enjoyable for a very simple reason; it's fun, the dialogue is funny, the storyline is somewhat intrigueing, the battles are cool and the soundtrack is pretty sweet. There is not much character development or a big world to explore, instead, most of my personal enjoyment came from the dialogue and basic gameplay. The characters are pretty cliché, but still feel a bit unique. They're not that developed, this always left some room for imagination, personally,  when I was imagining this game through the dialogue.A very short, but fun (and cheap) RPG is the best way to describe it in short. If you enjoyed this game, you'll also definitely love Cthulhu Saves The World, which is basically a straight improvement in almost every way.			"

												Its sometimes hard for me to get into turn based RPGs like this. Their not really my type of game. I bought this game because it was on sale and when I played the game it was not what I was expecting. This game is a lot of fun. I only played a little bit of it and I enjoyed every secound of it. This game is very funny and very fun. The random encounters don't even bug me as much as they do in pokemon or something because you feel like you get a lot XP, coins and stuff like that after you defeated what attacked you. There is a lot of Humor in this game and its just funny as hell. If you are into turn based RPG games and you haven't played this yet, buy it because you will love it, or if you don't really play games like this then you should still try it out. "

												After playing games of this genre my entire life, I was excited for a throwback to the style of other games that I loved. Unfortunately, Breath of Death VII didn't live up to my expectations.The one original idea I noticed in the game was the battle mechanic that builds momentum each turn of the battle. Enemies get stronger, and you can build up a combo as long as you don't heal and just keep attacking. While an interesting concept, it ended up removing most semblance of the strategy that exists in turn-based RPGs and turning it into each battle essentially feeling like a race to try and see if you can kill the enemy or boss before having to heal.That, combined with the short length of the game and the sense of humour that seemed a bit forced, made me fairly disappointed with this title. I would sooner recommend an RPG made with RPG Maker, or that you simply replay the games whose nostalgia this title is trying to capitalize on.			"

												Breath of Death VII is a classic styled RPG with some interesting improvements to the genre. In many ways, this is a very simple and standard RPG. You have a party that maxed out at four people, basic stats, spells, random encounters, leveling up, gear management... basically, if you've ever played an RPG before, you'll get this game. And even if you haven't, you can have fun with it as an introductory one. However, fans of RPGs will appreciate a few of the innovations here.One cool twist on the formula is that, upon leveling up, you get to choose one of two upgrades. They might be new spells, enhancements for old spells, better stats, or any combination of these. This give some customization and replayability to the game. Another is the upon winning a battle, you will recover some of your MP and ALL of your HP, plus anyone who died during the fight will be revived. This makes it easier to get from place to place without having to use up MP to heal, carry healing items, or walk back to towns constantly in order to progress. An especially nice feature for those mazier dungeons. By far my favorite addition to this game is how it handles random encounters. Whenever you go to a new area, it will have a set number of random encounters in it. This means that, while walking around, you will randomly encounter enemies that many times. After you have that many battles, you will no longer have any random encounters there. This means that you can clear out an area and focus on exploring without the distractions. However, if you want to grind more in that area, you can simply bring up the menu and select the fight option and BOOM, you're in a battle. It's a beatiful way to work around the annoyance of rancom encounters while keeping the grinding aspect possible. The whole design seems to be built around being a fast, enjoyable RPG. You can speed up your walk to a run with the tap of a button. In battles, your fight still images of monsters with sparing animations for attacks. Quick displays, combos, and a decent engine all make this game move by swiftly, even when mindlessly grinding. You are also sometimes teleported out of mazey areas when finished so you don't have to backtrack. And the simplicity of gameplay (aside from strategic bossfights or harder difficulties) blends all these things together to deliver a very fast paced RPG experience.I also liked the retro style of art and play, even though I never really played much for old RPGs. I'd comment on the music but I mostly had the sound off... watching stuff while I was grinding... so sorry I can't say. The simple display and gameplay... that retro feeling is really nice. It's much less intimidating than some other RPGs I've tried. The characters are alright, and some of the dialogue is interesting. There are a few red herrings in there as well, unless I missed something :P It's a cool little game.However, there are a few issues. While it is built around making the RPG stuff less annoying, it still includes those RPG things. Random encounters are limited... but they're there. Grinding is easy... but it's still tedious. Lack of a map makes the mazey dungeons and even some of the overworld more confusing than they need to be. Some of the display is a bit lacking, not telling you all the information you might want. You can probably use your head a bit to remember what enemy is low on health or poisoned or other such things, but this game doesn't have much of a reason NOT to display such things other than for the retro style. Still, overall, Breath of Death VII is a really fun game. If you like RPGs, retro games, and the simpley yet effective gameplay style, this game is worth checking out. At the time, I've only been able to find it in a two pack with Cthulhu Saves the World, a game in the same style, for 3 dollars. I would say it's worth it if you're looking for some light and fun RPG action. What do I think of Cthulhu Saves the World? Well go look for my review on that game for yourself and see if the pack is worth it for you. However, I WILL say it's very similar in style, so if you're interested in one, you'll probably like them both. Breath of Death VII gets a 7/10 for being a fun RPG that does its best to lessen the inherent burdens of RPGs while still keeping those iconic characteristics present.			"

												Prior to playing this, I hadn't played many RPGs at all. I'd played Oblivion and Skyrim, but that was really it. I had also played The Stick Of Truth and that was the only turn-based RPG I'd played. However, I had seen enough gameplay of the Final Fantasy series and Earthbound to know what I was in for. After playing The Stick Of Truth and loving it so much, I wanted to get into turn-based RPGs. I saw the price of this game and decided to get it. I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed.Story:Set in the future, humanity has been wiped out by nuclear warfare. The undead remained, who rebuilt civilization. All was well until evil invaded the lands. You assume the role of Dem, a skeleton hero and silent protagonist. Dem meets Sara, a historian and mind reader who forces her adventure on Dem to uncover the secrets of the past. Join Dem and Sara on their journey as they meet new friends and combat evil foes along the way.Gameplay:This is your standard turn-based RPG gameplay. There's really not much else to comment on. You roam around, a random encounter happens and battle ensues. You can use your basic attack, a more advanced “Tech” attack, magic and even use double team or “Unite” moves with someone in your party. As you advance in the game, meet new party members and acquire better weapons and armor. You'll also level up and learn new attacks. This game breaks the fourth wall constantly. You won't have to question what type of game you're playing. It will be sure to let you know that you're playing a turn-based RPG with it's constant references to the typical happenings of these types of games. That's one thing I loved about this game. It adds comedic relief to an otherwise serious genre. I mentioned that Dem is a silent protagonist. He doesn't verbally communicate, but the game allows you to read his thoughts. Sara is also able to read his mind so there is still communication, which adds to the light-hearted narrative.Conclusion:Overall, I'd recommend this game to anyone that's a fan of turn-based RPGs or is trying to get into them. This is a tribute and love letter to the classic JRPGs of the past. The gameplay is fun, the story keeps you interested and it's use of satire gives it charm. It's a short game, but for the price, I can't really complain.			"

												This is simple and short old school RPG. Four characters travel through undead postapocalyptic world, through linear storyline and side adventures. Characters constantly making jokes about world and game itself. World around them - is a total mess. Characters and NPCs reactions idiotic.  So if you into serious RPG - try something else.Game mechanics is easy to understand and follow. There is no hard gear choices and complex strategy (maybe there is on harder difficulty). But it is quite addictive.Graphics is on good level of 8-bit classics.			"

Zeboyd game and it's a solid 4 hour RPG that is often on sale for a buck along with the more polished CSTW.You're certainly not missing out on anything by not playing BoDVII, but if you've got a hankering for SNES style gameplay you'd be hard pressed to do worse. The dialogue and humour are a touch predictable and can get tiresome after sometime; there's only so many times you can retread same jokes about RPG tropes and cliches that have been repeated ad infinitum elsewhere on the net.Notable features are the limited encounter rate per dungeon that still allow you to reach a decent level and the option at level ups on how you wish your character to advance. Admittedly the latter feature is not fully realised in this game as the ""alternative"" paths are limited in their viability by equipment.It's a fun little game and extremely cheap and short! If you're really strapped for time though you would probably be better off with the game it is bundled with as all the features here are better implemented in that game.			"

												Good game, well worth even the full price, but it comes on sale often enough that you can get it for less if you wait.  The JRPG genre in general effectively line up battles triggered by wandering and you simply play them one after another while travelling location to location, and once you hit an experience threshold you level up (thus the RPG element).  What I find is that the RPG aspects of a JRPG are usually very fun as you can play the character(s) in a variety of ways. This is what I like about the genre.  The weakness of the genre is the game progression can be shallow and it forces you from one location to the next without much choice where combat can be 'too easy'.This one is a little different.   While it is still linear to a point, the game doesn't feel especially linear.   It feels a little more Open world which is quite novel for JPRG.  Each area has max battles, and the open terrain area counts as one so you can get rid of them all early so that you're not interrupted while moving around, or you save them up to get higher experience from later battles.  If you find yourself losing you can trigger battles allowing yourself to level up.  So while that would be grinding, at least you can never get a build where you have to start over.   From my point of view, this ability to choose and wander is a definite plus for a game in this genre.  The combat is also enjoyable.   Play the game on expert otherwise it plays too easy - you'll only need to hit enter for most battles which takes away from the game experience.  Play it on expert and you have to work thru with the skills chosen from leveling up to win many battles - much more enjoyable.   If you're reading this to compare a good JPRG vs. a bad one and why you should choose this one - see my review on Penny arcade 4 for what a JPRG shouldn't be).  Summary - There is no ""wrong"" build, reasonable number of skills to choose from thereby allowing you to solve the game in variety of ways and combat can be fun on expert.   "

												Even if you are an oldschool RPG fan, I cannot recommend this with a clear conscience. The writing in this game is absolutely abysmal, relying on knowledge of video game memes and injokes instead of actually attempting to be funny. The setup to the plot is wasted; the idea of an RPG taking place after the apocalypse has been proven to be incredibly engrossing. Here, it is used as a fresh coat of paint over your typical NES RPG.The combat is somewhat fun. Depending on your skill with RPGs, you'll either blaze through the game with no difficulty or get irreversably stuck depending on the levelups you pick. If you pick the wrong level up, you can potentially be stuck somewhere later in the game, with no way to reverse your choice. There is no feedback in battles as to what's happening. If you are going to play one of their games, I would recommend their Penny Arcade games, or at the very least, Cthulu Saves the World. Don't buy this one, it's not worth the 3 dollars nor is it worth the sale price.			"

												Breath of Death VII is as advertised. A ""classic"" RPG that borrows heavily from the early Dragon Warrior/Quest games as well as other games from the same period. Those looking for a nostalgia trip will certainly get their fix, while newer gamers will probably find it dull and uninteresting.The game is fairly short and, except for a few side dungeons, very linear. I was surprised by the lack of a few features, like the ability to search every ever pot, crate, bookshelf for loot. The lack of mouse support was also odd; playing on a keyboard felt strange having played most games of this type on a console controller back in the day.Combat was simplified with very few options and little gear to play with. The one thing I did appreciate was the random encounter...er, ""counter"" that turns off random encounters in an area after a specified number of fights. (You can still force a fight via a menu option.) That would be a much appreciated feature in many RPGs I've played.All in all, I enjoyed my time in 20XX and would definitely recommend it to fans of old-school JRPGs.			"

In fact, you'll love most of the games from Zeboyd Games.Has different modes and difficulties to fit different levels of players as well.Oh and the music is very good!			"

												A humourous take on old-school JRPGs. Great bits of funny dialogue that keep the game interesting enough to carry you through.The battle system is simple and familiar, but you must always keep an eye on your Magic points, as they only replenish slightly between battles whereas HP is fully restored. It can also be tempting to keep mashing A to move quickly through battles, and while this works great on weaker enemies, it can be easy to get caught out and die by not planning your moves more carefully.The ability to team up with another party member to unleash a combo attack is also interesting. There are also more powerful attacks that are 'combo breakers': the longer the battle goes on, the higher a combo is gained and the more damage you (and your enemies!) do. 'Combo breaking' moves reset the combo meter to 0x with the payoff being a powerful attack. However, I found myself not really using 'combo break' moves as I felt it was more pain than it was worth to lose a 16x or so combo.Another great aspect of the game is the ability to have instant encounters, which can be really helpful if you need to grind a little more XP to level up, since you don't have to walk around in circles and wait for a random encounter. There's also a limit on random encounters in each area; for example, a dungeon might have a limit of 15. If you want to, you can sit in one spot and instantly fight through 15 sets of enemies and be free to explore the dungeon without encountering enemies. But also, if you run out of enemies in an area and want to grind some more, you can instantly summon some to fight against.Overall it's well worth the small price, even more so when it goes on sale. There is really no reason not to give this game a try. If nothing else, do it for the puns. The sweet, sweet puns.			"

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Breath of Death VII: The BeginningGenre: 2D jRPGDeveloped & Published by: Zeboyd Games Platform: Windows only. Business Model: Duo Pack PurchaseCopy Purchased by Myself What Is This Game?Breath of Death is a retro-styled RPG solo campaign game. It features a fast turn-based combat, graphics reminiscent of 8-16bit RPGs, many dungeons and locations to delve and many more features. Its also a parody of other RPGs that came before, hence the the ridiculously long title that is apparently part of a series of games. I can’t imagine what game they could possibly be poking fun at with the title. The game takes many chances to poke fun at itself, at other RPGs and the characters as well. They also like to break the 4th wall from time to time too. But it all fits into the universe somehow without feeling awkward or thrown in. The campaign itself is around 4-6 hours with additional modes and difficulty levels to keep you challengedCombatThere are quite a few interesting features to the combat and leveling up system. The leveling up system was fairly deep but simple to understand in this game. You had two choices anytime your character leveled up and each choice had its trade-offs. It could be that the one spell hit all enemies but for lower damage or you raised specific stats. This kept things simple when leveling up and I rather liked it. The leveling system seems to end at level 30 though and after level 30 you just get a simple stats boost. Which I actually like that the end of the leveling system is reachable. Some games have the end levels at such a high level you have to do a ridiculous amount of grinding to get the spells you want. BOD, thankfully, avoids doing that.The turn-based combat system has a combo count system. The higher your combo count from attacks, the more damage certain combo-breaking attacks did to the enemy. And you have a pretty wide array of spells to choose from. However, some of these spells included combo breaking so you had to plan out how you were going to attack your enemy as well as keeping your companions alive. You’ll need to pull off those combo-breaking moves at the right time too because as each turn passes, your enemies grow in strength and hurt harder and harder every round. So this prevents you from using any sort of tanking strategy, you’ll have to take them down quickly.Overall though, I didn’t find the combat system as satisfying as I would have liked. It was challenging enough, but I felt like it was in constant conflict with itself. Reason being is that in order to regenerate your magic points, which are needed for your techniques, was difficult to do. You couldn’t regenerate your magic points without either visiting an inn, finishing a battle quickly or find a save point. There were no potions to recover them. So even if you try and conserve your magic points, this can get you in trouble as the monsters hit harder and harder each turn. The conflict, to me, is that your only viable spells in this game are damaging attacks but so very often you needed to use very costly spells in order to survive all the monsters. This could lead you to getting stuck in the middle of the dungeon if you ran out of magic points all of the sudden. I felt like there should have been something added to make the techniques more interesting, rather than they just be primarily damaging attacks, healing or stat boosting abilities. Lita did have some techniques that let her bind or put enemies to sleep, but far too often the enemies would resist or be immune to it, so I quit bothering using them as the game progressed.PC SettingsBreath of Death VII has fairly basic settings, unsurprising for a 2D game. It only supports 1280x720, 640x360 and fullscreen mode stretched. As BoD is light on effects, there isn’t any other visual settings to customize. The game does run superbly though and is very well optimized. Remapping and controllers are supported as well but not mouse inputs. It’s also got a reasonable soundtrack for such a ""budget"" game. I didn’t encounter any crashing or bugs during my playthrough. Final ThoughtsBreath of Death VII: The Beginning is an interesting jRPG. There’s plenty of amusing references and humor to keep a somewhat dry story going. The battle system isn't my favorite. I feel like their efforts to refine the jRPG typical battle system has created conflicts. However, it does make sure you’re paying attention but can be frustrating at times. If you're into jRPGs, this is one to check out. It’s short and refined to a polished shine. Plus, its ridiculously cheap as it comes comboed with Cthulhu Saves the World.

												If you like old-school turn based RPGs or have played Call of Cthulu and enjoyed that you will enjoy this! A fun and light-hearted (despite what the opening cinematic wants you to believe) JRPG parody stuffed chock-a-block full of references to not just role-playing games but gaming classics in general (I particularly got a chuckle out of Motherbound). Gameplay is fairly simple, you move through the overworld to a variety of dungeons where you do random battles until you reach a boss. Random battles are turn-based and involve three novel mechanics: firstly is a combo system where each hit builds up a combo which increases the power of certain combo breaker moves (either attacking or healing), secondly each round the monsters power increases by 10% meaning that the longer a battle goes on the more difficult it gets and thirdly (to avoid you chugging potions willy nilly) all health is regenerated after battles. Another novelty is that there are a limited number of random battles in each area meaning if you get through them all you can explore without being interrupted (however you can still trigger some if you feel you need to grind). Note: The unique features I mentioned are also in Call of Cthulu.My main comment is that I found this game great to play while watching something else. Its a simple story and a really simple gameplay loop which can be satisfying if you like finding the most efficient ways to win battles. However, there are moments when it can just be a case of mashing the ""ENTER"" key to get through battles. However, on sale and considering it is in a bundle with Call of Cthulu (which I preferred since the humour resonated better with me) I definitely can recommend purchasing it.In Summary: 3 DEM BONES out of 5			"

												Very cool little game with a lot of character. It has tons of references to older JRPGs, a nice sense of humor, and entertaining characters. The gameplay is a pretty standard turn-based system like one you'd see in old JRPGs, but actions stack into combos and you can use certain moves that are boosted from high combos. Some of the features that make it a very easy game to just pick up and relax with is the fact that health and magic regenerate a certain amount after battle, each area has a set number of encounters that you can see from looking at the menu, and you can choose to battle at any time from the menu (even if there are no more encounters for that area). More than worth it for the price, and it comes in a double pack with Cthulhu Saves the World! Definitely worth picking up if you're looking for something to keep you entertained for a few hours.			"

												First off, no, there aren't six other games that came before this one. Second, I wish there were as many that came after, because this one is amazing.It's built like an old Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest title: four-directional movement on a tiled plane, hub towns that are roughly the same size as your sprite on the overworld map, turn-based combat (which has a design that actually reminds me more of Mother or EarthBound than FF), retro synth music, pixel art graphics, and lots of recolored enemies.However, while it's definitely meant to evoke the old era of JRPGs in technical design and some of its aesthetics, it's not a copy/paste replica by any means. Combat is surprisingly difficult. Even just outside the tutorial dungeon, random encounters can easily spell your death until you get a second party member; speaking of which, there's a fixed limit to random encounters for each area, meaning they'll stop after a while. You can force an encounter at any time by opening the menu and choosing “FIGHT,” even after the random encounters have stopped. It doesn't necessarily force you to backtrack for healing, either — after winning a fight, your HP is restored fully, and you regain a bit of MP, assuming you spent any.Which you will, more likely than not, since most characters' standard attacks are woefully inadequate for survival.It doesn't take itself seriously at all, and though I personally found its brand of fourth wall-breaking comments and sarcastic acknowledgement of (J)RPG clichés and mainstays to be a bit overdone, it's also still endearing in its delivery.All in all, I would definitely recommend it.

												6/10Breath Of Death has a funny dialogue and a cheesy storyline, yes the writing in the games like Penny's arcade, Cthuhlu saves the worlds and Breath of Death is not that great. Covers the bones of every JRPG Game, don't expext Breath of Fire, Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger level of complexity in mechanics.The world looks like it was designed in Microsoft Paint, Its regional cubicle and doesn't have the detailed scenes and colourfull overworld like the games I mentioned above. If they we're going for a 8-bit feel, they used MIDI ingame music and it's the most generic RPG soundtrack that you know. What I really miss about the JRPG games is The astonishing music, the incredibly detailed scenery and overworld, some depth in mechanics that is simple to learn but difficult to master, and most importantly the depth in character developement. So far no Indie JRPG game has learned from their masters in the past, and sadly these new feel like there was no effort to be made.Aside me ranting, this is a cheap experience that maybe worth trying, but for a demanding person like me it feels like I'm wasting time.

It's a basic plot and nothing too mind bending happens, but it's pleasant to play and not too terribly hard. If you liked Cthulu Saves the World, you'll probably enjoy this, as the games are often bundled together and they similarly.

It's a fairly short game, but it feels worth the money and the experience doesn't drag on.			"

												A short and sweet homage to the days when I would play Dragon Warrior for hours on the NES. This game packs all the basics of the classic RPG: Turn-based battles, a simple HP/MP system, overworld/town/dungeon locals and nothing else, and so forth. But while Breath of Death VII fits the classic RPG mold, it knows where to breathe fresh life into the genre. The combat is fast-paced and engaging, with combo and enemy power-up systems that are simple but allow for strategy. The choice between two bonuses when a level is gained gives your characters flexibility without overwhelming the player with ability trees and whatnot. The option to fight at any time makes grinding quick so you can move on to the next thing. These upgrades, along with some fantastic writing, prevent the game from getting stale in the 4-6 hours you'll spend with it.I bought this in a double-pack with Cthulhu Saves The World (which I haven't played yet) for 99 cents, if I would have known then what I know now I would have gladly payed full price for just BOD7. I would completely recommend to anyone familiar with RPGs of yore, or anyone who's hankering for some classic turn-based action.			"

												I picked up Breath of Death VII along with Cthulhu Saves the World at a really cheap price, and I would say it was worth it.This game doesn't have a whole lot to offer, but it's​ good for when you just want to play a simple RPG that has you grinding your levels. I actually got lost at one point, so it added a more rewarding value to me when I figured out where to go.The pros are that the main character Dem can be a little ""humerus"" at times while talking with his companions, as he can't actually speak to all of them because he's a skeleton warrior (see what I did there?). There isn't a whole lot of variety for music or other sound effects, but they get kind of catchy. Also, it does provide some challenge and allows a little bit of customization for your companions.The cons, as mentioned above, there just isn't a whole lot to offer to the players. The story is kind of short, but that's about it. It's pretty generic, nothing too special.Don't buy the game at full price. If you can get the bundle for a low price and you are really looking to get it, go for it. I do give this a recommendation only because I personally enjoyed it and it's a nice little game.			"

												Zeboyd's first commercial RPG, Breath of Death VII hearkens back to oldschool 8-bit RPGs like the original Dragon Quest, but with more character customization and a significantly deeper battle system. Unfortunately, the absolutely terrible dungeon design and awkward difficulty dragged this game down for me.The character customization - where at each level, you pick one of two choices of what to gain - was fairly neat, and something I appreciated, because it allowed for frequent interesting choices about your character build as you played through the game, even discounting that some of the choices were obvious once you chose whether certain characters were going to be physical attackers or magic-users. It could have used a respec option in case the player chose poorly or just wanted to see some of the alternate abilities, but given that the game's only 3-4 hours long, just restarting it isn't too much of a downer.Likewise, I appreciated the battle system, at least as it applied to boss fights, which added a ""time limit"" in terms of enemies getting stronger each turn and a ""combo counter"" that you could build up to deal out powerful attacks to the standard JRPG formula. I felt it fell down in terms of random encounters, however, because the game used completely replenishing your health between fights as an excuse to make random encounters quite difficult, such that mashing attack would be a poor way to get through them... but didn't replenish your MP very much at all, only in towns and at rare ""save points"" (in quotes, because you can also save anywhere) usually found at the end of dungeons only. Since using MP was the only thing you could do other than mash attack, but the game rewarded not using MP very much against random encounters, I found the random encounter difficulty to be awkward and leading to game overs that felt avoidable, but also which I didn't want to avoid because it would have meant taking the fight seriously from the start, which would have been a large waste of MP had I not needed to.The dungeon design is just awful, though - half of the time it's corridors and rooms branching in all directions with no rhyme, reason, or in-game map, and the other half it's navigating around ruins where small shrubs or cracks in the ground block your path and require you to loop around the entire map to get around. Of course, despite the awkwardness of fully exploring these dungeons, it's also rewarded by chests scattered around them... except that due to the minimalistic nature of the inventory system, much of what you find in them (healing potions that I rarely bothered using, or money) is useless. Except, of course, there are also unique pieces of equipment that can only be found in chests, including most of the best items in the game, so ignoring the treasure chests is also not a good option.The chest situation reflects one of the other places I felt the minimalistic design detracted from the game, because with very few exceptions, none of which apply by the end of the game, equipment and items never become interesting. Almost all equipment is straight upgrades in every stat from the last piece with little to nothing in the way of special effects except for Lita's guns, and the only non-equipment items in the game are healing potions. With the effort the designers put into character customization, it felt like a bit of a letdown that equipment wasn't a part of it at all.I figure I should also mention the story - while Breath of Death VII bills itself as a parody, I didn't really find it funny except for one scene midway through the game, and the story was rather minimalistic and barely present in general. Of course, that's accurate to the 8-bit RPGs that inspired it, so ultimately I didn't really fault it for that, it's just something you might want to know before playing.Ultimately, partially because of the extra-hard random encounters and partially because of the abominable dungeon design, despite the very short 3-4 hour length of the game I felt that it had overstayed its welcome by the end and was glad to be done with it. While I can't be too negative about the length given that it's $3 bundled with a second game, some of the design decisions - especially the frustrating dungeon design - mean I can't really recommend Breath of Death VII too much.

												Recommended.Breath of Death VII and Cthulu Saves the World are two fantastic Dragon Quest-style retro RPGs with adorable graphics, a great sense of humor, and a little bit of strategy thrown into the combat mix.While I may not be able to in good faith tell everyone to buy the Penny Arcade games, BoDVII is a short and sweet introduction to the dev studio's games for a very reasonable entry fee and will leave you feeling satisfied. Zeboyd deserves your support.			"

												A must buy for everyone who loves RPGs and do not want to pay to much for a game. In Breath of Death VII you have the silent skeleton Dem, which can only think, the ghost princess Sara, which possess the power to read minds (and the only member in the party which is able to communicate with our skeleton hero), Lita, a vampire girl, who lived alone in ruins and Erik, the Zombie Prince, who speaks with a kinda similar french accent. Talking about the roles, Dem is the guy fighting with a sword, Sara is using a staff to cast some magic spells, Lita is made to shoot arround with guns or rifles and our prince Erik usually fights with an Axe. The story is really awesome, not to boring and not to slow. It contains also lots of comedy and parodys about other games, so read the dialogues carefully and do not skip them, I bet you would may miss something. You can play it in easy, normal , hard and after you beat the game once you can also check out the Score Attack, where you fight against enemies while being underleveled. It took me ~ 4 hours to beat the game. I totally recommend it, you will love it !!			"

												Breath Of Death VII is, as the name suggests, a traditional 2D top down RPG in the vein of many a (S)NES classic. It is a bit short, but has all the essentials of a game in this genre, such as a bickering party, annoying random encounters, romance and gold. Don't expect much more, however! The story (as well as most levels) is very linear, there is not much variety to character development and equipment, and only one combat item exists (potions). Nonetheless, the game has quite a bit of charme, as it really doesn't take itself serious on the storytelling level - this is a really good thing that actually (paradoxically) gives this otherwise rather generic and forgettable game some character and makes it somewhat memorable.

Though Cthulhu my overshadow it a bit...it's better than wearing yourself thin on the similar combat style. The games aren't connected at all through the story, so there's no reason to play this first.Definately worth having if you get the bundle.			"

It is based on Zeboyd's new engine that focuses on the classic 16-bit action/adventure dungeon games that became instant classics to the gaming industry. The game itself is a wonderful modern rendition that pays tribute to the classic genre and successfully mimics all the fun mechanics that made those RPGs so worthwhile. Breath of Death, is simply a must for any retro-gaming fans out there.			"

												This game is very fun, at the beginning.The gameplay is a bit dull at first, but once you level up you get to choose a bunch a different things for your characters that fit your liking.  You will upgrade stats and unlock spells which actually spice up the game nicely.  Sadly you will need to do a WHOLE lot of grinding about half way through the game.  This game also has a neat little feature that I had/have never seen before, which is a random encounter limit.  It's basically that once you have had a certain amount of random encouters, you don't get harassed on the over world, but you also get to choose to make a battle happen so you can still level up in one area, which ties in with the grinding I mentioned earlier.This game has no interesting gamemodes other than the story mode, but over the course of the game you can unlock some little still images that go to a bonus menu.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!This game has an interesting story, basically there was a nuclear war that wiped out humanity, but the dead have come back alive, as Zombies, Vampires, etc. and started from scratch.  Throughout the game you find rements of the past and slowly peice the whole lore together.  It's a creative take for an RPG setting, and I think the game made it all work out.  The game is filled with little jokes and is clever with it's humor, it never quite feels like the game takes itself seriously which I am perfectly fine with.The biggest problem with this and Cthulhu saves the world is that it has terrible amounts of grinding in later sections of the game, primarily once you've recieved all 4 party members, but I did play the game on expert so maybe just go with medium.But if not for the grinding, I would have to give this game a 8/10.With grinding a good 6/10.

												A legit, comedic 16-bit era RPG with most of the garbage cut out.  Breath of Death VII knows and loves RPGs of yesteryear, and seems to have learned from mistakes of the past and delivered a breezy, straight forward, but still satisfying adventure.  Everything from the snappy (and eventually skippable/fight-on-demand) turn based combat to the ability to save anywhere makes progress relatively painless.  Humor permates throughout, and even with a few references and self aware jabs it thankfully avoids being juvenile or overly meme-y.  That doesn't undercut the staples of the genre, either: battles can be difficult unless you (quickly) do some grinding and there's a learning curve to the characters' abilities and roles.  Nothing seems insurmountable or overwhelming or cryptic; it's just a good time all around.  My only complaint is the envirnoments can be overly maze-like in same-y looking areas (the last level in particular), but that's just a matter of puzzling out the lay of the land or grabbing some graph paper if you're crazy.  Other than that I highly recommend Breath of Death if you're the least bit curious of old school console RPGs.  It's not going to steal your money or time, and will most likely put a smile on your face.			"

												Before i start my review i have to say that i bought this game and other Zeboyd games because i want some games to play on my low spec laptop. I mean the graphic looks so dated that it can't be using too much power right. Guess what i can't play the games on my laptop because my GPU isn't supported by XNA Framework REACH!! Unsupported by REACH!! Ridiculous...Breath of Death VII is a throwback to the original Dragon Quest back in late 80's.If you have played that game then youll feel right at home when playing the game. From the graphics to the music.Outside of nostalgia, this game also address some of features thats so annoying on that game and add some new features to keep the game up to today's standards.If you have played JRPG back in late 80's or early 90's you must be familiar with the ridiculous encounter rate. This makes games in that era very hard and pretty bloated. You playtime is basically consists of 95% battling random enemies.Here you have a very low encounter rate and there is even a limit. Exp and gold drop is very benevolent. This makes the game easier to get into but also serves as double edge sword since you can basically finished the game under 6 hours. But this is perfect for us people who works for 8 hours a day and just want to have some fun and feel some sort of progression in the game even though we are rarely playing it.There is also a character cuztomization here. When you leveled up you have 2 choices of stats/skill growth for your characters. Adding replay values to the game and makes the game more interesting. The battle system is done through 1st person view with your run of the mill command such as attack, skill or magic.THere is also a combo system. The higher your combo count the harder your finisher will be. But there is a catch, Enemy will become stronger as turn goes. SO you have to kill them ASAP.Oh yeah you also regain ALL HEALTH and some Mp after battles depending on your performance. Making the game even much easier.Overall this is a good game. It's easy to get into. Very easy difficulty wise (i recommend playing in hard) and have good and silly dialogue albeit very scarce. All of those negative reviews about this game is basically some random kids expecting this game to have high end graphics and serious and awesome storyline of epic proportions. No it's not. And the devs never advertised the game like that nor the tried to. But if you are looking for some retro fun and that feeling of nostalgia then go get this game.			"

												As a fan of both Japanese RPGs and parodies, I am surprised how badly this game fails at both. I'm not sure if it's appropriate to criticize level design or battle system (not to mention the story) - you don't expect ""You Only Live Once"" to be a good platformer, right? But it also lacks humour. I am about half through the game, ad so far, there's been not a single decent joke. Mark Leung's ROTB was way better in this (playing it was still a pain, though). What this game does, however, is repeats most common flaws of JRPGs. One can think it IS the promised parody at work, but it's done in such unentertaining way, that any good JRPG of old (not to mention modern indies) with their inner jokes and self-parodies easily beats it.The JRPG tropes are widely presented - with equal parts love and criticism - in popular culture nowadays - from Eat Lead to Abenobashi to Sophie Houlden's ""The Linear RPG"" to Robot Chicken. To make an entertaining game, it's not enough to put in a vampire wannabe and a world map that looks like Dragon Quest's. Not anymore.			"

												This is a smart little RPG.  It's a call-back to all of the old school RPGs of the 8 and 16-bit days, both teasing about the ridiculous and embracing the absurd that was born out of that genre.  The mechanics are actually quite clever, not content just to replicate old methods but implementing new and clever ideas.  Breath of Death is notable for letting you choose the progression of your character, such that each character has two paths they can take, and you can pick and choose from the two.  This adds some replay value to a fairly short game.The shortness, however, is a benefit.  Longer RPGs always had to rely on filler to pad the gameplay time so you'd have feel more accomplished and time to level.  The problem is, you never felt accomplished doing fetch quest #50 and getting to an area only to find your macguffin or villain had just left, of course, like always.  It's frustrating!  Cutting out all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t knocks Breath of Death down to a 5 hour playtime if you're an expert like me (hah), but that means you gain real powers at a reasonable rate and don't spend time backtracking or doing annoying quests that make no sense, except for the quests that make no sense because they're SUPPOSED to make no sense.  If we can take a lesson from Portal, it's that a game being quick doesn't mean it isn't good.  It can just mean it isn't wasting your time.The game is funny, clever, and quick, and that's a good thing.			"

												There is something to be said about Breath of Death VII, although I'm not sure what it is. On the surface, Breath is nothing more than a mediocre parody game, offering little in humor and even less in story. The characters are just barely charming enough to carry the player through, and while the settings can be interesting enough, only the main character serves to be anything more than 1-dimensional. The story doesn't do the genre justice, and leaves a lot to be desired in writing. Story is often the sole reason one plays a typical RPG, and its always dissapointing when that falls through.Whatever you do, don't buy this game expecting a wry and witty parody to challenge your beliefs of modern gaming. Buy it because it's a wonderful game.I can't begin to state how much I love the battle system in this game. Taking cues from Earthbound and Dragon Quest, Breath of Death implements a 1st person turnbased combat system that looks wildly archaic, but fits with the time its emulating. Like the games that inspired it, the enemy sprites are sparsely detailed, and there isn't even a backgroud to speak of. Attacks are picked from a sad little wall of text from the right, and give the damage and whatever status effects it might cause. No attacks are animated, save for the enemies flickering when being attacked. I wish I could make this sound more appealing, but the retro flavor fits the battles perfectly, allowing the player to focus on the numbers. If the thought of number watching turns you off, please, feel free to avoid at all costs, but I personally loved it. Calculating attacks and knowing when to heal your characters is crucial. There is a sacrifice for every choice you make, and the game implements an engaging combo system that can make or break the tougher battles in the game. Believe it or not, combat is extremely fast paced for an RPG, as with every turn, the enemy's attacks become stronger. This is a non-issue with the earlier battles, but becomes a deciding factor in mid to late-tier encounters, especially bosses. If your usual plans involve delicately whittling down health while keeping yours up, prepare to have your butt handed to you. Your offense is the best defense, and the streamlined item selection saves you any micromanaging you'd usually worry about in other games. After every battle, your health is completely recovered at no cost, and depending on how quickly you dispatched the opponent, a small amount of mana will be restored. In battle, mana is essential for getting out of a tight spot, but there is only so much, so use it wisely. Like mana, potions can be found throughout the game, and serve as an instant heal in battle, but are worth stocking up for the later battles. And as a rule with any classic RPG, save often, as you can save anywhere, so be warned; you will die in this game. Just when you think you've leveled well past the normal encounters, the difficulty spikes, so don't be afraid to grind. In fact, the game rewards grinding, as each area offers only a finite number of encounters.  As an added bonus, you can initiate an encounter at any time on the menu, so you could get all the fights out of the way and then explore the new enviornment at your leisure. Of course, you could go the classic way and enjoy the occasional random encounter, but I found the freedom to choose a very considerate nod to the player. Grinding also opens the lovely door of the level-up, which is handled ingeniously throughout. A tiered system takes place, with every level gained offering a choice. Sometimes its statistical, choosing health over magic, for example, but on occassion, moves can be chosen. This is where the game shines in replay value, as there are numerous branching paths that expand organically as you evolve your characters throughout. Some moves only offer minor decisions, such as faster combo boosts over more power, but whenever I was challenged with taking a strong area attack over a single devastating blow, I would struggle. The amount of options are staggering and can lead character development in wild directions, but even then, I never felt the game become unbalanced. Replay value can also be found within this game, as there are multiple hidden dungeons and secret bosses that offer weapons and armor you can't find anywhere else in the game. That on top of the multiple difficulties and character customization, Breath of Death more than exceeds the measely 3$ dollar price tag. The game its bundled with is also considered rather good although I have yet to play it, so its hard for anyone to come away unsatisfied.All in all, Breath of Death VII is worth your time no matter what you're looking for, as it welcomes both newcomers and veterans alike. Whether you're looking for a corny in-joke or an engaging combat system, this game is definitely worth giving a shot.Thanks for reading!			"

												This is one of the funniest, retro styled RPGs out there. Definitely worth the money.The combat system and overworld is remeniscent of old-school JRPGs like Dragon Warrior. The humor is definitely the game's strong point. The banter between characters is witty and If you played a fair amount of JRPGs and NES games, you will definitely find yourself chuckling at many of the references and easter eggs laying around.My personal favorite part of the game are the different types of enemies you fight. From traditional monsters, to creative mash-ups, the beastiary offers some unique creatures to pummel to death.For the price, you can't go wrong with this little indie gem.			"

												By far one the best values I have ever seen on Steam. For only $1 during the Steam Sale, this game, along with Cthulu Saves the World, kept me entertained and enjoying every second of gameplay for a good 5 hours. The story is short, and a little predictable, but the game cracks some good jokes. It took me back to FFVII for a little while (Hence the name I think) and really was simply a pleasure to play. It has some slight replayability, but not much. If you're looking for some quick fun that will have you smiling from ear to ear for a good while, I highly recommend this game.

												If this game were released 20-30 years ago, it would have been incredibly innovative. It's very accessible, and imitates the style of old Nintendo RPGs quite well...maybe too well. Despite the mechanical innovations, it's still a grind-fest where you run around hacking apart enemies until the next element in the paper-thin plot reveals itself. There are so many other games today delivering much more substance that the streamlined mechanics can't overcome the fact that this is a somewhat upgraded version of a game type last in vogue decades ago.

												Started out promising but quickly fell apart. No substance behind the parody, and much of it quickly becomes forced references and overused memes. As far as gameplay goes, the combo effect added some flavor but it's standard turn-based rounds. Eventually the dungeons get tediously long just to pad out the game, so I found myself using the ""Fight"" option repeatedly to clear out the dungeons before treading past the entrance. And then BOOM it was over. Turn-based RPGs are like a zen garden to me, otherwise I wouldn't have finished.			"

												A retro-style comedy RPG originally an X-box Live indie Game, developed by American developer Zeboyd Games known for creating retro-style 2D RPG.It's developed with developer's own engine, not ""RPG Maker"".The title says this is the 7th of its series, but previous 6 titles don't exist so don't be fooled.Despite its cheap looking graphic, it has its sophisticated system to make gameplay smoother and more enjoyable. (players can save at any time, characters replenish their HP after each battle, the number of random encounters is limited in each dungeon...players can start battle from menu button for exp)Battle system has its depth to keep its tension and fun...visible enemy HP, Unite attacks, enemy's getting stronger each turn, and each character's option for level up bonus allows players to customize their own party to their style.Though it has its flaws, dungeon's too large and complicated and its restore points are far apart, it's still a decent RPG with its unique systems and hidden dungeon for its cheaper price.Now sold as double pack which contains the developer's next title ""Cthulhu Saves the World"", get this during Steam sale for less than 1 dollar!I'd recommend playing with the highest difficulty or gameplay gets too easy and boring, even the highest difficulty takes only 13 hours or so to see the ending.Tips for playing:Save your game often especially on the highest difficulty.Higher combo counts deal more damages.Usurper is somehow vulnerable to Lita's skill ""Computer Virus"".Choose level bonus wisely (especially on the highest difficulty), or you'll get stuck.Stick to restore points until your party grows stronger as each restore points are far apart.(Japanese translation below)==================================================元々はX-BOX Liveの配信作だった昔懐かしいグラフィックのコメディRPG、昔ながらの2D形式RPGで知られる米国Zeboyd Gamesのインディ作品です。RPGツクールではなく自社製ゲームエンジンで制作されています。第7作と書いてありますが、第1～6作は存在しませんので騙されてはいけません。いつでもセーブ出来る、戦闘終了と共にHPが全回復する、ダンジョンごとのランダムエンカウントの回数制限といったシステムのおかげで快適に遊べます。(経験値が欲しい場合はフィールド上のメニュー画面からでも戦闘を開始出来ます)またレベルアップの度に成長ボーナスを選んで習得させることで自分なりのパーティーを作れます。更に敵のHPの可視化やキャラ同士の連携技、ターン毎に敵が強くなるおかげで戦闘に緊張感が保たれています。ダンジョンが広すぎて迷うことが多いのとダンジョン内の回復ポイントが少ないのが難点ですが、独自のシステムと隠しダンジョンのおかげで値段以上に濃い内容となっておりRPG好きなら損はしないと思います。開発元の次回作Cthulhu Saves the Worldが同梱されており、セール中は1ドル未満と破格の値段で入手出来ます。他の難易度は簡単すぎるので最高難易度で遊ぶことをお勧めします、その場合でも13時間程度でクリアできます。役立つ情報：まめにセーブしましょう。Combo回数を溜める程に高ダメージを出せるので可能な限り溜めましょう。Usurperには何故かComputer Virusが効くのでLitaに覚えさせましょう。最高難易度では成長ボーナスをきちんと選ばないと詰みます。ダンジョン内の回復ポイント間の距離が遠いので、強くなるまで遠出は控え回復ポイント周辺で戦闘しましょう。			"

												For the money that I spent on it, when the game was on sale, this game is well worth it. It is short but given that one could have cthulhu saves the world when buying this, well worth the couple cents I paid.			"

												A short, JRPG-styled throwback.+Light-hearted game that can be amusing at times.+Really liked some of the music.+Level-ups allow you to choose between what skills/stats you want and allows for a decent bit of customization and replayability.+Good length at around 6 hours, not long enough to get burnt out on it.+Simple UI and ""limited"" random battles-Humor is awfully reference-based at times.-Just a black screen background in combat.  A bad type of retro.-Graphics are bland.This game is always on sale with its sister game at around a buck.  A solid little title for fans of traditional RPG's that will probably get a few smiles out you.			"

												Breath of Death VII is the game where if you threw it back in time, we'd all be excitedly waiting for Breath of Death XXII. Breath of Death VII is a love letter to JRPGs from the 90s. It takes all the best parts of Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy (1 through 6) and sped up the combat system. The developer really stripped out all the 'formulas' that classic RPG system had, and reduced them to the basics. Random battles are limited. Enemies get stronger the longer the battle lasts. Hoarding items is not possible.The story is funny too. It's absolutely great writing!After beating this, I recommend you check out their 'sequel', Cthulu Saves the World!			"

												A decent throw back to the days of classic Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy for the NES. The game has a forgettable story, uninteresting characters and nothing particularly innovative. However, the battle system is solid, the world is fun to explore and the bosses are challenging. Music and graphics are both high quality as well. Recommended for hardcore jrpg fans only. However, non jrpg fans who maybe interested in getting into the genre may consider this a good starting place as well.			"

Simply amazing, do not expect a lot, since you can find it on Steam packaged with Cthulu Saves the World for dirt cheap.Perfect if you have a free evening, u can beat it in one try (approx. 4 hours).+ Funny story and characters, controller support- Pretty linear, sometimes hammering the A button does all the work			"

												Had a great time playing this satirical take on classic RPG games! I've been a fan of old school turn-based RPGs since I was a kid and this game doesn't disappoint! You want chests full of gold and loot? This game's GOT IT! You want a team of unique heroes to command and level up? This game's GOT IT!You want a humorous story line and atmosphere that doesn't take itself too seriously? This game's GOT IT!I also thoroughly enjoyed the modern additions to the genre, including:- Winning battles replenishes your MP by a few points and fully restores HP. - Each level earned gives you a choice of two different sets of upgrades. - Resting in Inns doesn't involve a 20 second cut-scene or fade away- Each zone has a 'random encounter counter.' When it hits zero, you can explore freely!- Monsters have a 'momentum' mechanic. Monsters get more powerful every round, so kill them quick!- On the flip side of the monster's momentum, the heroes have a combo counter. Each attack adds a stacking multiplier. These are then triggered by certain powers (look for the ""Combo Boost+"" attribute)  for devastating effect.Now, I've gushed enough. So let's throw in some negative features that could have been improved on.1) Level design was particularly mazelike and seemingly spitefulFans of the genre will no doubt recognize a good old fashioned labyrinth, but these were particularly mean. Lots of interlinking circular corridors with no interactive items (READ: nothing pertinent to the story or game). In other words, the maps seemed extra large and complex for no apparent reason... get used to long hallways that lead to an empty dead end. >_<  Oh yeah, and the occasional chest you can't open! I think it was done for comedic purposes, but maybe I missed something?2) Limited ShopsI think there were only 3 shops in the whole game? And they only sold like 5 items a piece. Then, whatever loot you find in the dungeons were usually either slightly better or exactly the same as what you just bought. >_< 3) No Side Quests, Hidden Easter Eggs, or Map abilities (That I'm aware of)The game is extremely linear, extremely straightforward and extremely to the point. Which is not necessarily a  bad thing (actually it was sort of a welcome change in my opinion!). Nonetheless, I think I ought to throw it out there.4) Only about 10 hours of content. All this shortage of content... I can't say I'm really surprised it only took me 10 hours to hack and slash through it all. To sum up, I recommend this game whole heartedly as a fun spoof of traditional RPGs, particularly since it was included in the $3 dollar bundle with Cthulu Saves the World!			"

												I haven't gotten very far yet, but the first thing I do in every area is stand still. Just standing still to listen to the beautiful music. I am absolutely in love with the music in this game.And the gameplay is simple, fun, and solid. A nice spin on random encounters: The monsters get ""afraid"" of you after killing a lot of them, so they'll stop coming after some time, which is very helpful if backtracking to search for dungeons you might have missed. You can still start fighting anywhere except in towns through your menu.			"

												So Awesome! They reminds me a lot of the original Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy games for NES. For both games the story is good, the map is nice, and the banter is hilarious. If you play in easy mode the games might be way too easy for you, but I personally liked it. I felt kind of like a god and could focus on the story more than the combat. If you are more into the combat you can play hard mode or kick it up to insane mode. You'll have fun on any level.If you love the old NES turn-based adventure games you will love these. You really can't go wrong, especially for the price. And the dialog alone makes these games worth playing.			"

They have about the same amount of story, but the gum dosn't come with annoying 1dimentional characters, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes, or a boring combat system consisting of which number is higher without anny type of visual or even text feedback. (Is it that hard to add some descriptions, seriously).  Also the progression kind of sucks, the flavour realy falls out of this pice of gum when you realise that basically every item and lvl up is a pure stat boost, with multistrike and heal being the only skills you need.

												A bit on the short side, but for people who love old JRPGs like the original Dragon Warrior (which this game echoes in more ways than one) this is a must play. Charing graphics combine with surprisingly tough (at times) random battles and clever writing to deliver an homage to/ parody of a genre almost as old as video games themselves. Even though it is short, it has unlockable difficulties and a score attack mode, which is more than you could hope for at the asking price of two bucks. Lastly, if you do play it, keep your eyes peeled for all the references and parodies of other games they crammed in here, because there are a lot of them!			"

												This game is a steal.It's a three to four hour RPG that lovingly pokes fun at the JRPG genre while still offering a solid dose of classic RPG goodness. And for, what, less than a dollar?I've read that some people have a problem with the simplistic gameplay. It's a throwback to oldschool JRPG's: it's supposed to be an oldschool grindfest. The combo system was a nice change of pace, choosing level-up bonuses was fun, and while simple, the core gameplay worked.Again, considering that I spent about $0.67 on this game, I was very impressed. I do understand that this was made for people like me, having grown up with the games this references and spoofs, but I still think newer gamers can find a good time with this game.Yes. Buy this game. Be aware that it is oldschool in design, and as long as you know that, you'll be fine.Oh, and pro tip: sit next to a white save circle and grind out battles until you clear dungeons worth of encounters. Boss fights will be a breeze.			"

Now, my complaints, no robot, werewolf, or demons as playable characters, at least thus far, if I find any, I'll amend this. Very disappointing that. Also, there is no cow level.			"

I enjoy the battle count downs, the Unite are fun, I would have loved attacks like them back in the day. I love the humor, all the little tributes to games past, Crystals indeed. Now, my complaints, no robot, werewolf, or demons as playable characters, at least thus far, if I find any, I'll amend this. Very disappointing that. Also, there is no cow level.			"

The only difference were that the protagonist on this one was a skeleton and its gameplay is shorter compared to Cuthuhlu saves the world. I think the main problem was that the story line and the enemies on this game does not really relate to each other thats why i didnt enjoy it as much as Cuthuhlu saves the world.

												Breath of Death VII is a short, but sweet take on the 'retro' standard of RPGs. While it's only about 5 hours for a single playthrough, it's a good 5 hours full of humor, quirkiness and fun gameplay.A few of the features of the game that I appreciated most:Random battles are on a counter. Most areas have 20 random battles that can be triggered by walking around or simply by choosing the fight option from the in game menu. After those battles are done, no more random battles for that area. If you feel like grinding (which I never found necessary), you can always use that fight option to do more.It's not a grind. The game just flows. You never have to hang out around a city raising money to get the new best weapon or armor. You don't have to keep fighting to level up to beat a boss. It can help, but a little extra strategy goes a long way.The comedy really played to my sense of humor. I found myself chuckling and laughing out loud on several occasions.All in all, I'd give this game about a 8/10. "

												If you're just looking to get started in the RPG genre, you could do worse than Breath of Death VII.  The game is pretty short; I spent less than 10 hours on Normal from start to finish, and that included exploration trying to find as much loot as I could.  Combat is turn-based; you select the tactics of each member of your party, and battle commences based on the options you selected and the capabilities of the combatants.  The game offers enough in the way of weapons, armor, and skills to remain interesting without overburdening you, and while there is certainly some level-building to do, it rarely becomes tedious before you move on to the next challenge.  The ability to choose how your characters advance in skill adds an extra dimension.  While short, Breath of Death VII is an interesting, humorous, and engaging game, and it's easy to just pick it up and play while still being more substantive than a basic puzzle game.			"

												This game is worth of your interest and money. It takes aproximately 7 hours to complete, including necessary grinding of exp. in dungeons (I even hunted out all encounters on world map). Yeah, 7 hours is not so long, but it doesn't matter. Game itself has good and fast combat system. Graphic is horrible, but I have a feeling that it was intension. Why? Because this game itself is comedy, constantly breaking the 4th wall. It even makes jokes on itself! Characters are likeable, they are mashup of clichés. And the story? It ain't bad, and again, it's more parody to many genres. For me, this game was a good choice.LE BRAINS!			"

												A bit on the short side, but for people who love old JRPGs like the original Dragon Warrior (which this game echoes in more ways than one) this is a must play. Charing graphics combine with surprisingly tough (at times) random battles and clever writing to deliver an homage to/ parody of a genre almost as old as video games themselves. Even though it is short, it has unlockable difficulties and a score attack mode, which is more than you could hope for at the asking price of two bucks. Lastly, if you do play it, keep your eyes peeled for all the references and parodies of other games they crammed in here, because there are a lot of them!			"

You play as a skeleton who goes on some quest or something I don't give a ♥♥♥♥. But, you take some idiots with you and trek across the dangerous monster filled land to find stupid crap to do with your stupid crap buddies. The story is unique, but combat can be a little tedious at the beginning, and it's hard to find things to do once you're out there. Once you progress, it gets fun! 10/10 Would steal valuable treasures again.			"

You are wandering as a skeleton person thing. Killing enemies, talking to other undead things, equipping your hero, going through towns and caves and many other things. The game combat is like a 2D text thing. You click on the target and attack and it is happening. Each time a turn has been passed for both sides. The Monster damage will be increasing. Slowly higher and higher. Death allies still get experience and they are able to level up. I do not think their experience get halved from others. But i can't confirm it. Attacking enemies on the same location will reduce enemy attacks.The game has some funny moments.You are able to search for fights.Once a fight is over, Everyone The HP and MP gets completely restored.You can equip your allies with weapons or armor.Other things.None.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10			"

												This is a parody of the JRPG genre. I thought I would enjoy it, having both a good sense of humor (in my opinion at least) and being a huge fan of the genre.Then I started playing it and found that the humor was not very, how should I put it, thoughtful (or even funny). It mocks the genre by doing the ridiculous things people associate with it, but not in any kind of exaggerated way. Instead, it just does them in an uninspired way and makes the characters barely comment in the most unsubtle of ways. Your brain won't go ""Oh, I see what you did there"", but more like ""Alright, ha ha, I guess...""At other times, which is in fact the majority of ""jokes"", the dialogue is just referential. Quotes from other games or shows are used as is and once again, I think you're supposed to go ""Alright, ha ha, I guess...""The story in itself is very poor and only serves to throw a joke here and there. The battle system quickly becomes boring, like the whole thing, and you'll notice there isn't any strategy to it, unlike the games it's supposed to make fun of.			"

												Everything that could ever be wrong with an RPG.For a game that's trying to nod to Dragon Quest, I could not be more disappointed.  Did the authors ever even play an old-school turn based RPG at all - much less from start to finish?Everything is wrong.  Equipment balance is nonexistant - you barely ever get new stuff - when you do, it tends to either micro-break the game, or make no difference.  Treasure chests never contain anything of import.  Map designs are god-awful mazes.  Encounters are offensively easy (every difficulty except the super-hard difficulty) or ok-or-impossible (super-hard difficulty) - the randomizer swing, given their stupid fully-recover-HP-every-battle balance, turns the game into more of a slot machine.The music is ♥♥♥♥ING AWFUL!  Seriously.  Who could ever dream of thinking this music belonged in a finished game!?!?  I could♥♥♥♥♥♥out a better RPG soundtrack in a week (and have).Add to it a completely underwhelming storyline that fails at being funny and you have an jRPG that fails at literally every single point that a jRPG should strive to achieve.  It's like the wanted me to hate the game.In that case - well done, Zeboyd!  You've failed to do what 15 year old kids, RPGMaker, and 1 month of free time have been doing without pay for well over a decade.			"

It's insanely cheap, and the maker of it obviously has a lot of love for old-school RPG mechanics. There are some interesting improvements on the old school formuia, too. Random battles are there, but only a limited number in each area. Once you run that number down to 0, no more random battles. You can still select ""Fight!"" from the menu at any time, though. That not only eliminates the endless random battles old RPGs had, but also allows you to go almost immediately from battle to battle if you're grinding.I also liked the branching level-up system. You get to decide how you want your characters to specialize. As a hint, ALWAYS pick the +1 attack when it's there!! It literally means +1 attack, not +1 TO attack.The game is a decent length (I think 10ish hours?), filled with satirical humor, solid gameplay, and a ridiculously cheap price. BUY IT.			"

												Some interesting additions to the classic jrpg formula but very poorly designed map/dungeon layouts and tiles even by NES era standards, combined with lazy copy/paste areas (such as all tombstones in an area saying the exact same thing) you end up with decent ideas and character art with extremely poor execution of the game itself.  The idea of combat being able to be triggered in a menu makes grinding a lot easier, but the fights themself are so easy and you get overlevel so quickly, then add on automatic revives and heals between fights, it's a very easy game where every fight can really be won by simply mashing attack as fast as possible.The combo counter and execution attacks is a great addition just never actually useful due to how easy the fights are			"

												Some dungeons feel like they are just a maze to keep me in there. The dialogue between the characters is a bit over done. The transitions between the screens is not very smooth.The music was nice and it is a fun past-time. I wish it was possible to buy potions in the stores, because sometimes you need them when the healer dies.			"

												This is an RPG in the spirit and form of 8-but classics. And, as you may have already discovered, these concepts have not aged well. Compared to the balanced, intricate, funny, and often moving RPGs of modernity, this game has no merit. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of these developers. I liked their next game (Cthulu Saves the World) a lot, and their next game (Penny Arcade 3) tremendously. But this is obviously a first try - a good way for the developers to gain experience but not actually worth playing.			"

												Both of these games uses the battle displays from ancient rpgs, think Earthbound, Shin Megami Tensei, or a numbered Phantasy Star (not online, the original games). Both of them rely on pretty decent jokes, although Cthulhu, being the second game they made, takes the ham way higher, and as a result is mostly funnier. Even though you never see your charathers in the battle, its still pretty involving, with stat buffs and debuffs as well as mana preservation, although it isn't quite as stressful as the games it's actually based on.The game helps you along with some major streamlining, especially in the inventory and telling you where to go next, although you can sequence break if you are willing to overlevel a bit.Although if this is the first time you've played one of these in a while, the game will probbably seem monstrously difficult, especially with its unique health refill feature giving them an excuse to use a set monster encounter rate.In all honesty, I think you should use PSN, GoG, wiiware, xbox arcade, ceirtain indie releases, a compilation game (I can think of several sega genesis sets that include three phantasy star games, not to mention other awesome things in other genres) to experience this sub-genre in pure form.This game and its companion provide some light entertainment, but the gameplay ""outweighs"" it, so you have a system that requires a degree of commitment to come to terms with, but due to the fact that you know it's a parody, you don't really have the motivation.

												All and all, Breath of Death VII is a very simple RPG that pays a certain homage to old retro 8-bit RPG games, mixing that factor with a genuine sense of humor. Sprite design is a plus, really enjoyed most of them. Recommend it if you want a retro RPG game that really doesn't take itself seriously.

At least in Cthulhu saves the world, you have lots of humour even if it uses the same bad game system. On top of that, you can't have a more linear game than those two.Don't buy this, get yourself an NES rom of Dragon Warrior 1 or 2 and it's a thousand fold better even if those two games are like 25 years old!Cthulhu Saves the world, Breath of Death VII, and all those games made with rpgxp and the like should be free on the web.

Sadly not much replay value and it feels like an actual numbered game, as if it's in the middle of a series or part of some ""episodic"" DLC series.

												It's 2 EUR for two games, and I didn't even pay full price, so it's ok. Other way, this game isn't worth the money. There are some ""good"" RPGmaker games out there, but this one is pretty limited. It's a straight forward short game you can finish in a couple of hours.That doesn't mean it's an awful game in the end. The metagame isn't bad: the battle system is fast and original, the difficulty is well adjusted, the character stat-raising system is open and let you develop your characters at your own way. The best part is the jokes and references the developers put everywhere into the game xDBut the game itself feels empty: Few people to talk, no methods of transport, few towns (and all of them are quite simple) or places to go, no hidden items (you know, like ""press X at a garbage can to find a potion""), few sidequests aside from an optional dungeon...

												BOD is the first game by Zeboyd Games.It takes place in a world where everyone is dead after a nuclear war. So the undead such as zombies, ghosts, vampires, etc inhabit this new place.Gameplay is similar to pokemon in terms of how you explore, talk to npcs, and battle. Fights are fast and fluid as there are no long tiresome attack animations.Graphics is oldschool.The storyline is a parody to typical oldschool JRPG's like final fantasy. The characters are amusing and they break the 4th wall a few times.I guess there is nostalgic value this game. It's pretty enjoyable and funny.As I am finishing this short opinionated review, I am starting up Cthulu Saves the world.It is worth playing imo.			"

They must of canned the original 6 versions of the game and settled on this... sad.Seems like this game is trying to cater to older gamers from a generation of when it was cool and unique to be a gamer but I've played and looked at better games in my youth...I'd rather just boot up Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy on NES or SNES than play through this mess of text and obscure references at every turn... not that I didn't understand them... I'm pretty sure I was overanalizing everything in this game and after a while it just seemed like a lot work. Once I ran in to the vampire chick and realized she's basically a reference to Lucca from Chrono Trigger I immediately came to my sense's and quit playing... and booted up Chrono Trigger instead. :)			"

												Really short and full of random RPG jokes, cliches and game design choices. There's about 5 hours of game-play here and the ending is an abrupt ""CONGRATS! You saved the world! Play again on a higher difficulty"" Sadly no replay value and it feels like an actual numbered games, as its in the middle of a series of some episodic DLC series. I guess that was intended but it's still frustrating. I'd be more upset if the game wasn't so cheap.			"

While BoDVII is short with a mediocre story it also provides to be witty and replayable with its custom skill tree and score attack mode.

												The game is a parody of older RPG's, but it's not particularly clever or funny about it aside from a few one-liners.  It mostly just uses that label as an excuse to put little effort into the plot, which is a real disappointment given how many RPG parodies manage to actually be entertaining while mocking the genre's cliches.The game's real strong suits are its combat and levelling system.  On each level up, you either pick between two or four stats to increase or two versions of an ability, allowing you to specialize each character.  The combat is suitably tactical on hard, though the random encounters will become incredibly grating and tedious and you'll rarely reach the encounter cap.  Whether you win or lose has more to do with whether enemies manage to hit the same character or use hit-all attacks than your own foresight.If the selling points appeal to you, then go play any of the countless games made in RPG Maker that do them better for free.

												I have only played a small amount of this game and it is after playing and finishing Zeboyd's other game and follow-up to this, Cthulhu Saves The World, so it's difficult not to compare the two. This game is a bit more primitive than CSTW but that should not be a hindrance. It's a basic turn-based JRPG in the style of early NES Dragon Warrior (Quest) games that takes place in an apparent post-apocalyptic world. That's a pretty generic plot for sure, but it works!! It's fun. The characters are great (you are a skeleton who can't talk but your thoughts can be read and one of your party members can read your mind) and there is a good amount of light humor.If you like the old Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy games, play this! Plus, it comes in a bundle with Cthulhu Saves The World for a really low price as compared to other places (like XBox Live) where the games are separate. I recommend this and cannot wait to dig more into it!			"

Totally worth it if you can get it on sale, especially bundled with Cthulu saves the world.			"

It plays like an old-school JRPG (think early Final Fantasy games) but is definitely tongue-in-cheek with plenty of references to other games and generally poking fun of the genre itself.  If you are looking for a short and fun trip down (and partially making fun of) memory lane then you won't regret picking this up.  I got it in a combo pack with  Cthulhu Saves the World  (which was made after) and I'm quite looking forward to seeing how they've upped their game ;-)			"

This game is almost exactly like CSW in control scheme, just with a different story, characters's, etc. The graphics aren't as good, but I can tell this game was made before CSW. This doesn't diminish it as a good game. This is an amazing game, like it's counterpart, that has a fun story, easy controls, and again, good humor. Not as good humor as CSW, but good humor nevertheless. As well as Cthulu, I reccomend this game highly.			"

												Admittedly this game is homage to the early RPGs for NES, such as Dragon Warrior. And as a huge fan of the NES Dragon Warrior series, I find this game to be very close to spot-on. The major differences are mostly positive: it has much smoother gameplay than the early console games did, more frequent fighting, less tedium in the interface, and rapidly accessible progression. The downsides are minor: the story is very tongue-in-cheek which is somewhat a departure from the stoic tones of the originals, it is easier to get into and therefore requires less commitment (which is barely a negative) and the story is not excellent thus far. A very fun game, if you like these types. Verdict: [ 8 / 10 ]			"

												A nice little turn based RPG made to (sort of) look like an early 16-bit era JRPG. Combat goes fast and is very well balanced, conveyance is straightforward, difficulty curve is steady, music is okay. Everything works. The level up bonus system gives a nice, tangible way to spec out your team. The combo system adds some good risk management. Battle limits ease the tedium of random encounters while still challenging the player. The writing is good and funny, not actually laughing funny, more of a slight smile funny, but still. On the down side, the level design is abysmal. The dungeons are literally just mazes with no logic to their purpose or nature. The dungeon crawl is also very shallow. Aside from bosses, there are no events, and chests typically just contain boring junk like money or potions or things you could've just bought. But still, it's a nice throwbaack to the classic feel with fresh design sense thrown in. I've payed much more for much worse.			"

												A great throwback to the era of the first couple of Phantasy Stars and/or Final Fantasy games -  the good ol 8/16 bit' random encounter RPGs. It's not a tribute mash or reference fest, mind you - it has it's own references and tributes, but it's a game in its own right, with an independent, great story and extreme humor. This one, coupled with Cthulhu Saves the World, make for an excelent bundle of great RPGs. Make sure to play this one first to fully enjoy Cthulhu Saves the World. If you're an RPG fan, you should definitely get this one. DEFINITELY recommend.It's full price is a MEGA BARGAIN for what you'll get. Really, I feel bad for buying this during the Steam Sale, it's worth so, so much more. You'll have much more fun with this one and Cthulhu Saves The World than many big-budget rpgs people shell out multiple bills for. GO GET IT DAMMIT			"

Using the tropes and stereotypes of the genre to craft a solid JRPG in its own right, Zeboyd Games have made what could be the most enjoyment you will ever get for $1.50.  The humor is quick and wry, the characters are quirky, and it is designed with a retro 16 bit style as a throwback to the old NES JRPGs of your youth.			"

Throw in a lot of humor based on gaming stereotypes and you have a winner on your hands.			"

												if you like oldschool RPGs you will probably be able to enjoy this game.  BoD7 is essentially a watered down version of those old games that removing a great deal of hassle of those games to allow for a relaxed and somewhat casual experience.  Item management, dungeons, character progression, combat, exploration, plot and other traditional aspects of RPGs are made very simple.Although there is an extra post-game dungeon, this isn't really something you'd go to for any sort of long and deep story.  There isn't much here to do but fight monsters and continue the game, but if you were looking for more you probably want a different game.Another nice factor is that the key config is simple enough you can play thie game with one hand if you move a few keys around, so you can snack or otherwise multitask while you play.

Promising, but boring gameWhat started out to be a seemingly epic adventure, turned out to be a rather bland jog at best.This game has the absolute bare minimum requirements to be considered an RPG; it is quite possibly the most basic RPG you will ever play.The ""plot"" is as uninteresting as it is forgettable, and the same goes for any characters, locations, enemies, dialogue, you name it.Combat (even on the hardest difficulty setting) is laughably easy - especially after lots of mindless grinding.The game doesn't have any exciting moments, but remains at a constant low throughout the entire ""experience""; the ending being as flaccid as the rest of the game.Mildly entertaining at best, but turns into a grindfest with little to no rewards and especially no feel of satisfaction when finishing a dungeon/boss.Not recommended; save your money or get some other game for the same (or less) money and more value.Hopefully the ""sequel"" is better...(NOTE: Play time is low because of offline-play)			"

												Okay, first off, this game has a really original premise. Lots of games are set in the post-apocalypse, but I'm pretty sure this is the only one where it's after the end of the world and every character is undead.This game is a nostalgic RPG-lover's dream, with the feel of an old, SNES-era RPG with most of the problems of RPGs of that time removed. The encounter rate is low, you regain all your HP after battle, and battle and leveling mechanics are simple enough for anyone to grasp, yet add enough complexity to make things interesting and encourage the player to plan ahead.This game may have had me frustrated a few times, but its clever writing, kick♥♥♥♥♥music, unique story and user-friendly battle system ultimately won me over.Recommended to RPG fans, both old and new alike. Or even anyone who wants a story they (probably) haven't heard before. Just remember to save often, as some battles may have your undead party end up... er, un-undead.			"

												[Spoiler-Free Review]A quick-paced, deliberate, self-aware and irreverent RPG even Generation Y can play - if they can get over the visuals!Breath of Death VII introduces us to Dem and his band of minions as they take RPG tropes from yesteryear (i.e. top-down presentation, menu based combat, magic and dungeon exploring) and reimagine them to fit within a world of immediate gratification and life-on-a-schedule.The story is sharp and witty, the characters are interesting and unique (as much as a skeleton can be anyway) and the combat  is almost slideshow-like as battles can take little more than 10 seconds at times - this usually just consists of you mashing furiously on the action button. Your characters even automatically heal after every battle - less time flipping through menu after menu with upkeep.In this way, it's a bit of a ""My First RPG"". it's the most approachable RPG I've ever played and brings enough ""new"" to the genre to recommend.  A dirt cheap stroll down RPG memory lane.			"

												This is an OK rpg. Most will probably like it for the humor if anything at all. It plays fairly straight forward. Every level up gives you a choice of two options. Some times it's skill related, most of the time it's stat boosts.Of the older RPGs I've played I found this one to be one of the most grindy. Perhaps most of that was because I started on hard, but I've played plenty of other rpgs that still had a smooth progression of difficulty and this one wasn't there.Still combat was fun enough and the campaign took me about 9 hrs to beat WITH exploration where I could. I would back track any chance I got if I felt like I may have missed something.Negatives:This is a very simple RPG and there's not really a lot of content what-so-ever.GrindStill I enjoyed my time with it if nothing else as a time-waster. if you're looking for a more fleshed out rpg, maybe something with actual story. check out something else.

												Breath of Death VII: The Beginning is an ambitious indie RPG that is not only cheap to get, but also has a revolutionary battle system to boot. While BoDVII is short with a mediocre story it also provides to be witty and replayable with its custom skill tree and score attack mode. To say the least you are getting a lot of bang for your buck.			"

												I love simple RPGs. And this is exactly what that is. The combat system is extremely easy to learn and is definitely geared towards letting you win. With attacks that do damage based on the amount of times you've hit targets during a fight it's extremely easy to learn how to beat big bosses really quickly.The quirky nature of the game and it's NPCs being based around the undead is a complete bonus and only adds to the charm and experience of this wonderfully addictive game.

												A nice lampoon of Breath of Fire and Final Fantasy. This is basically Breath of Fire that makes fun of the genre. If you don't know what that means, read on.This is a classic ""RPG,"" a la Final Fantasy. You run around on a big map to get places, then you run around on a smaller map once you get there. All the while, you get in random battles and gain experience (and of course loot) to level up.From what I can tell so far, the story basically drives you to never need to visit the same town (or really any location) twice, which is a nice change from other games in this genre, which tend to have you based in one location for a while, completing quests nearby, then moving on to the next ""base.""While this game may be meant as a joke, it's actually fun to play. If you ever loved Dragon Warrior, Ultima, Final Fantasy, Breath of Fire or Fire Emblem (or even Rogue, for that matter), check out Breath of Death VII.			"

												Skip to the bottom for a summary.Gameplay- Pretty typical JRPG as far as gameplay goes. You have your party and you explore dungeons, towns, and the overworld. As with most JRPG’s you can find a wide variety of armour and weapons, each with their own special abilities. The only feature that separates this game from any other JRPG is its combat. It is turn based, with the unique twist; after each turn the monsters slowly get more powerful. Ultimately all this normally does is forces you to use the spells that cause the most damage, and subsequently use up the most of your magic points. After the battle is over your characters will regain full health and a portion of their magic points back. This seems cool at first, but it gets pretty repetitive. Also, each area has a predefined amount of monsters you can fight, which for me really encouraged exploration as I wouldn’t have to fight endless enemies. 6.5/10Sound/Music: I enjoyed the soundtrack, and all of the other sounds were just generic RPG noises. 7/10Graphics- They are stylized to look retro and I believe it works out pretty well for the most part. The overworld and towns always look pretty good, and handcrafted. The dungeons on the other hand look all pretty similar and boring. I’m a sucker for post apocalyptic settings so I did really enjoy most of the scenes.  7/10Story: It’s set in a post apocalyptic world where the undead rule. It’s a cool setting and there are interesting characters. Jokes are rampant and most of them are pretty funny. This game is pretty short and only took me about two hours to finish. This is by far the best aspect of the game. 7.5/10Summary: If you like retro RPS’s then this is for you. Well the actually gameplay is very generic the story and characters allows this game to rise above some of its competitors. The soundtrack is pleasant, and jokes are everywhere. Pros:+Story+Characters+SoundtrackNeutral:*Sound*Combat/GameplayNegative:-Length and Replay ValueFinal Score: 7/10Recommended Purchase Price: Full Price    "

												Imagine, if you will, a sitcom. It's a sitcom about a topic you really like, so you check it out. You know these sitcoms where the laugh track is the only indication that something funny just happened? This is like one of these sitcoms, only without the laugh track. The title is by far the funniest part of this game. There are lots of jokes or, more accurately, things the devs thought would pass as jokes. The formula seemed to be as follows:- Take classic JRPG trope.- Put said trope in the game, with a note saying ""think of funny subversion later"".- Get bored and work on something else.The game ends up playing straight all of the things it's supposed to subvert, with a few schoolyard level jokes tacked on where there was space.Now, imagine watching said sitcom (why are you doing that again?) with a controller in your hand. Imagine that every few seconds, the image freezes, and the only way to continue watching is to press the ""A"" button between four and seven bazillion times. ""Silly me"", you exclaim. ""I forgot to turn on the difficulty!"" So you press the difficulty button on your remote, and you find out that you are already on the highest possible difficulty. You start the game over on ""easy"", thinking that maybe there's a bug where the highest difficulty is actually the easiest one, and indeed, switching to easy has a significant advantage: You only have to press ""A"" between four and six bazillion times because the enemies have lower health now. Anyway, save for boss battles, the difficulty is of virtually no consequence. You have lots of fancy special moves to use in fights, a combo count to build up, mana points to manage, which is all fabulous except for the complete lack of a bloody difference it makes. There's just no incentive to get into all these intricacies of the battle system when you fare just as good spamming your basic attack over and over. After each battle, your health is fully restored, so it doesn't even matter how often you're hit, as long as at least one member of your party survives.""Well then"", I hear you say, ""the battle system may be an unfortunate abomination of nature, but when I watch Passions, I have to hit my telly every few minutes to get a clear image too, so that's okay as long as I can enjoy the story."" First off, go get a new television set. Second, to enjoy the story, there would have to be a story first. I haven't finished the game (in much the same way I didn't finish pouring that bucket of battery acid over there on my head), so maybe the story picks up somewhere after the two-hour-mark, but I doubt it. So far, it's been: ""You're a hero. Supposedly witty comment. Go east and kill something. Unfunny joke. Now go north and kill something else."" You get party members who are supposedly parodies of some kind. One wants to be a vampire! It's funny because everyone hates Twilight! Why aren't you laughing yet! Said party members provide the crucial addition of being able to push the ""A"" button more often per round.To summarize: I do not recommend buying this sitcom game. Want a funny video game? Go play Monkey Island. Want a nice, retro JRPG? Go play the first few Final Fantasy. They even have a few jokes in them, which is more than I can say about this. Want to donate two quid to charity? I guess this would count.I can't say anything about the bundled game, ""Cthulhu Saves the World"", because frankly, when I think about ""playing"" a second ""game"" from the same people, that bucket of acid suddenly seems oddly appealing.Just my two cents dollars, which I will never get back.- Betta George			"

												I grew up with a lot of old school 8-bit and 16-bit RPGs and I've enjoyed most of them. Breath of Death is a major call back to the older Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest games. The game plays out in a turn based battle system and you get an option to customize your characters at each level up. The game is very streamlined in battles because enemies get a little stronger after each turn that goes by. This makes the player try to finish battles as fast as possible, while still being efficient with MP.The music isn't the stuff of legend, but it does a good job of keeping the old school feel without sounding like it came out of a Gameboy. The story is quite funny with a lot of neat references and it does a great job of not trying to be too epic. The game itself is rather short and can be finished in 5-10 hours depending on how often you get lost in dungeons. Most of the dungeons are pretty balanced, not too confusing and not too easy. The final dungeon is a little long though.I highly recommend this game, especially at the price they are selling it for.			"

												I really loved RPG's on my NES, but I so rarely have time to invest into even the flashy multi-hundred hour RPGs of today.This game cuts a lot of the junk time wasting out, while still retaining the ""Old School"" RPG goodness.I liked that I leveled up quickly, and that the random battles stop if you have beaten the specific number needed in an area, makes backtracking alot easier when you don't have all those weak battles.The replay value is really only depending on your interest in Hard Mode and character builds.  If you get into it, you can play it several times, but there are no achievements sadly.The story is kind of lacking, and I was disappointed in the limited visuals (no animations or sound variations for any attack you choose)But, for 3 bucks on a 2 pack of games, I got my money out of just this one, and I still have CStW left.Honestly, I don't know if most people will like this game, it does contain a ton of references to older dialog and content, much of which will be lost on those who have not played the 8-Bit era much.  If you want a challenge, and liked RPG's where you could totally screw yourself over with a build, then this is a short masterpiece of that exact system style of RPG's.			"

												This is an OK rpg. Most will probably like it for the humor if anything at all. It plays fairly straight forward. Every level up gives you a choice of two options. Some times it's skill related, most of the time it's stat boosts.Of the older RPGs I've played I found this one to be one of the most grindy. Perhaps most of that was because I started on hard, but I've played plenty of other rpgs that still had a smooth progression of difficulty and this one wasn't there.Still combat was fun enough and the campaign took me about 9 hrs to beat WITH exploration where I could. I would back track any chance I got if I felt like I may have missed something.Negatives:This is a very simple RPG and there's not really a lot of content what-so-ever.GrindStill I enjoyed my time with it if nothing else as a time-waster. if you're looking for a more fleshed out rpg, maybe something with actual story. check out something else.

												This recommenation comes with one of these things --> *But I'll get to that in a moment.Breath of Death is a clever little JRPG that parodies a lot of the tropes found in the genre. Characters are amusing and diverse, there's a LOT of sutble references and nods to JRPGs of the past, and the game is genuinely funny.*It's very very short and largely linear. You can uncover pretty much every bit on content this game offers in one run. I beat the game twice, the second time on easy and I felt like I had more fun on easy. Mainly because the game is about 3 hours + grinding based on the difficulty level, and harder combat comes with no positive. Kind of a weak point with menu-based combat: the only feasible way to make the game harder is to give enemies more health, so the game isn't REALLY harder but just takes longer. And since you can scrape up almost everything in the game anyway, combat has no tangible reward. I know that rant was longer that the review, but I still recommomend this game. Just know what it is before you play and you'll enjoy it immensly.			"

Also, each area has a predefined amount of monsters you can fight, which for me really encouraged exploration as I wouldn’t have to fight endless enemies. 6.5/10Sound/Music: I enjoyed the soundtrack, and all of the other sounds were just generic RPG noises. 7/10Graphics- They are stylized to look retro and I believe it works out pretty well for the most part. The overworld and towns always look pretty good, and handcrafted. The dungeons on the other hand look all pretty similar and boring. I’m a sucker for post apocalyptic settings so I did really enjoy most of the scenes.  7/10Story: It’s set in a post apocalyptic world where the undead rule. It’s a cool setting and there are interesting characters. Jokes are rampant and most of them are pretty funny. This game is pretty short and only took me about two hours to finish. This is by far the best aspect of the game. 7.5/10Summary: If you like retro RPS’s then this is for you. Well the actually gameplay is very generic the story and characters allows this game to rise above some of its competitors. The soundtrack is pleasant, and jokes are everywhere. Pros:+Story+Characters+SoundtrackNeutral:*Sound*Combat/GameplayNegative:-Length and Replay ValueFinal Score: 7/10Recommended Purchase Price: Full Price    "

												Breath of Death VII is just as hilarious as Cthulhu Saves the World.  The satirical themes expressed in the game are crack full of jokes that don't get old and originality.  The story has an interesting concept.  Separate, it seems out of place.  The beginning starts with a Terminator-like war, and the remainder of the game looks like it's set in a fantasy world full of magical creatures and demonic monsters.  However, when they're put together, it makes sense, even just a little.  I cannot express my love for Zeboyd games.  I hope more come soon. 8/8			"

Breath of Death VII is so similar to Cthulhu Saves the World that since it has less content, and I thought the story and humor were inferior, I might recommend ignoring it and just buying CStW.  Except you can't buy one without buying the other, and you are going to buy CStW, right?  Right.  No reason not to at that price.  So you may as well also play this short and almost as entertaining game that comes with it.			"

The main character is kind of a jerk sometimes though (also, he's supposed to be the hero and bodyguard, but actually he's the weakest?). And at first it's a challenge, but after maybe an hour it just becomes pressing Enter repeatedly. Doesn't require much thought. But apart from the mundane battles, it's okay.			"

												Pretty good for an old-school NES-era JRPG parody.  The game is short (3-5 hours, a couple more hours if you play on hard and/or tackle the ""secret"" dungeon), but is relatively well made.  It looks and feels a lot like the original Dragon Quest game, with some Final Fantasy elements thrown in for good measure.  The branching level ups are a nice touch, the dialogue is moderately humorous, and the gameplay is pretty smooth for an NES-style game.  I especially like the limited number of random battles per area...keeps you from overleveling too much (unless you want to, 'cause you always have the opportunity to go straight into a battle if you want to) and speeds things up if you spend a little too long in a single dungeon.It's extremely linear (don't expect tons of side quests), but for a buck or two, it's definitely worth it.Rating: 7/10			"

												This will be pretty much review for both Breath of Death VII and Cthulhu Saves the world because they pretty much walk hand in hand.Both games can be completed in 2 to 4 hours in normal model. If you are planning to play both games I highly recommend raising the difficult level to hard for second game. The game offers replay value by giving player some new gameplay options, like playing with only one hero instead of 4. I didn't really put much time nor effort to test those modes but the idea was pretty funny. For people who think normal gameplay was too shot, you should think stuff you really get with couple euros (or dollars etc). I can easily throw those coins to slot machine while leaving the store and that fun doesn't usually last that long.Personally I found Cthulhu Saves the world to be much funnier. For some reason I lost a track of the lore in the very beginning of the Breath of Death VII. And even though I kept talking to every single npc I was able to find during my adventures it took really long to get hang of it.I also liked combat system. Building up your combo points and finishing the combo can really make difference in harder boss fights. You also have to watch not to use skills/spells that might break the combo and lose all the points. Or in some cases it might be wise to use, depends. Also leveling up system was made easy. Game only provides you 2 different options to choose from to increase your stats when you level up.I really recommend both of these games if you are at least a little into old school 8 bit rpg's. If you are unsure, start Cthulhu Saves the world and see if humor catches you up. Personally I'm definitely going to play rest of the developers games through at least once.			"

												Breath of Death VII is an interesting game. It's a parody of old-school RPGs and it definitely shows. Its largest single flaw is definitely battling. The game is very fast compared to old RPGs which makes grinding a breeze, but this in my opinion also makes the game feel very shallow. Depending on your difficulty setting, this game can either be way too easy or very hard. Story doesn't take itself very seriously but I enjoyed it. It wasn't too over-the-top to distract me from following it. Writing was great as I never felt that the game had a weak point in its story.I'd say the game is worth its price, at least on sale. You also get a second game, Cthulhu Saves the World, when you buy Breath of Death.			"

												So even though I put this as a recommend game it was very much a meh type of gamePros+the pathing was really fluid (when you would have 2 directional buttons pressed down it would go in one direction until it hit an obstacle which then it would divert to the other direction you had held down until pathing opened up to go back in the origional way you were moving giving it a good slick feel)+the artwork was bright and cheery+the humor got a few chuckles out of me especially since I knew about every reference+the music at times was nice+I got the game cheap 50 cents total bundled with their Cathulu game+saveing in the game is readily available+can change controls/ other video settingsCons- the combat system (this is the main part of the game and frankly the worst part especailly when this game calls for a lot of grinding experience. basically how the battle sequences go is that you will always start at full health and if you have ever played lufia 2 or final fantasy 7 or something else of the genre its basically the exact same battle idea except your enemies get 10% more dmg every set of turns thus you need to defeat them very quickly or they start dealing dmg comparable to being hit by a fast moving frieght train. now the big problem is that your normal attacks dont deal enough dmg to kill your enemies quick enough by themselves so you have to resort to using your special moves to kill them but the problem is you dont get all your magic back from using your special moves at the end of a battle like you do with your life, you get a pittance back and thats IF you beat the monsters really fast so basically you end up relying on these special moves and you dont get magic points back unless you find a savepoint which gives you them all back so there are basically specific spots that you need to grind experience at which is quite tedius, both to get to the next save spot and to then grind for experience there.)- the storyline is basically nonexistant (It is technically there in that it is used for humourous refrences)- the enemies ramp up in difficultly very quickly (this side of river has old monsters that side has new ones)-really short gameso basically for 50 cents for two games...... sure it was worth it but for 3$ their regular asking price..... eeehhhhh thats up to you dear buyer good luck			"

												Hmm, where to begin?It's humorous at least, consistently so. Trouble is, the gameplay. It's repetitive, which is to be expected for the genre, but I'll be buggered if it's not unnecessarily hard. I'm not playing this game for the mechanics, I don't want to grind out 2 levels on occasion so i can breeze through it.The writing is solid though.Actually found myself laughing out loud a few times. Which is rare for me.Enemies are cleverCharacters are cleverGive it a shot...just temper expectations a tad. It's good, not great.			"

												Bought it thinking it was ""Breath of Fire"".10/10 Would make that mistake again.=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Review =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+ Retro RPG+ Nice 8-Bit Graphics+ Nice Music+ Good Mechanics- Short (4 hours)- Repetitive Overtime- Lack of Story (Party Member Joining)


The Adventure Begins 
A Screenshot of Breath of Death VII 
By: Drin




Overall: Awesome little retro RPG game.To bad it's kind of short, but it's understandable since it maybe the first concluded game from the developers (I guess). It gets repetitive towards the end, so it's a good thing that it ends up with only 4 hours (Normal Mode). And there's absolutely no reason for the characters to join your party (I know it's part of the joke) but I don't think it was that much successful. Other than that, I thought the game was really enjoyable. If you like retro RPG games and this one is on sale, don't pass it.			"

												Game is an enjoyable RPG, simple yet fun. Only about 5-10 hours of play with a little replay value (different game mode after first walkthrough). I would recommend it to anyone that likes old school 16-bit rpg's. Happy hunting.			"

												A mediocre RPG littered with admittedly humorous references to better games. The humor doesn't quite make up for the horrendous level design, poor art direction, banal combat, and shoddy storytelling. I was finally killed by something an hour in, and didn't feel like loading my save file back up again. Overall, a fairly boring experience.			"

												The only thing that might keep you from playing Breath of Death is that its visuals, audio, and core gameplay are very late 80's. It's an 8-bit game through and through. However, the game's short length will help you get through it even if you have a hard time tolerating such an old-school style. It's a hilarious parody/tribute to classic RPGs.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/08/breath-of-death-vii.html "

												Often overlooked, the predecessor of ""C'thullu saves the world"", Breath of Death VII is a highly enjoyable game.The main character, Dem, is a Skeleton in a post apocalyptic world, with no survivors. The world is populated by Ghosts, Skeletons, Zombies, Vampires and other forms of unliving monsters. The game mechanic is in favor of fast gameplay. Enemies grow stronger every round and you regenerate your health completely after every battle. The game has the same dialoge of humor C'thulu has, with unique, and funny character designs.+ Unique Heros (A Skeleton Warrior, Banshee Caster, a Womanizing Vampire Berserker,...)+ Fast Gameplay+ Simple Skill tree that leaves room for creative builds- Too short, sadly			"

The story is non-existant and the characters are nothing more but party member, devoid of anything but being a one note joke. The battle system is ok, but not fun and grind-heavy, which is no fun either. I cannot recommend the game, even with a discount price, the level of quality feels more at home on Miniclip, rather than in a store.			"

												[Spoiler-Free Review]A quick-paced, deliberate, self-aware and irreverent RPG even Generation Y can play - if they can get over the visuals!Breath of Death VII introduces us to Dem and his band of minions as they take RPG tropes from yesteryear (i.e. top-down presentation, menu based combat, magic and dungeon exploring) and reimagine them to fit within a world of immediate gratification and life-on-a-schedule.The story is sharp and witty, the characters are interesting and unique (as much as a skeleton can be anyway) and the combat  is almost slideshow-like as battles can take little more than 10 seconds at times - this usually just consists of you mashing furiously on the action button. Your characters even automatically heal after every battle - less time flipping through menu after menu with upkeep.In this way, it's a bit of a ""My First RPG"". it's the most approachable RPG I've ever played and brings enough ""new"" to the genre to recommend.  A dirt cheap stroll down RPG memory lane.			"

												I really draaaagged myself though this one, but I did play it through after it sat in my library for a while.Design-wise, it's boring.The game's pretty much entirely linear, unless you want to take a long route to a treasure chest you can see across the way, which is just drudgery after a good while.  The towns are practically all the same, with the same NPC's selling slightly better equipment... I guess they nailed that RPG trope.  Woo.  The dungeons are long halls with the occasional turn or dead-end.  Really thrilling stuff there.  Very few things in the game world are interactable with, which means the handful that are manage to be surprises when they shouldn't be.The writing's a bore.The references are just blah while the attempts at humor are worse.  The characters are just RPG archetypes wearing spooky monster costumes, teasing at crappy romance plots that hardly skirt amusing.  The plot is forgettable; the bookends of the intro fmv ""Many years ago..."" and the outro fmv ""insert spoiler here* contain bewteen them effectively no plot content.  It's just, ""Hey let's adventure.  Next town.  dungeon.  cavern. next town... yadda yadda.""  Sprinkle in some boss battles that have virtually no weight in the plot, and that's it.  Some of this curiously plotless content mocks itself, while at the same time not really managing anything better.  It's kind of sad that way.As far as retro RPG's go, this one presented only one surprising concept, the ability to customise your characters' abilities and stats on level up.  Granted, *every* modern RPG does that, so that's uh... nice, I guess.Yes, I got this game for nearly free when it was on sale, and yes, I invested time to beat it.  But no, no, no, do not waste your quarter or your life on this.			"

												A fun, albeit short (~4 hours) turn-based parodic RPG.  The game plays like Dragon Quest/Warrior IV with slight graphical enhancements.  The story isn't particularly notable, but the writing is mildly amusing, with subtle nods to other classic RPGs that probably only fans of the genre would recognize.Overworld maps are linear, but the dungeons become increasingly labyrinthine, with chests hidden away in remote areas and dead ends.  Combat is more interesting thanks to the combo system and unity attacks, and random battles now have a quota - reach the quota in an area and you no longer have to worry about battling monsters (unless you choose to trigger a battle).  Characters have two choices of gaining abilities and/or stats per level up, until level 30 (when they just gain +10 to every stat).  There isn't much to do after you finish the game the first time.  There's a ""secret"" superboss that isn't difficult to find the first time around, straight out of the Atari era.  There's also Score Attack mode, which I thought might be a Boss Rush of sorts - but instead it's just another complete playthrough of the game, except that you gain ""points"" for taking on bosses underleveled, which I assume is just to see who can get the highest score.

The longer a battle goes on - the more difficult the monster become.  It limits lairs to X amount of random battles - once it hits Zero -, you just walk around wtihout battles.  Save anywhere and plenty of areas to get magic points back.  If someone dies in battle, they still get XP and come back after the battle.

												My Rating: 3/10The story was okay,but was a bit made up as you go. This is my first Zeboyd game, and I have heard they are not always set in a realm of seriousness.The game appealed to me at first because of it's Dragon Questesque appearance. Admittedly, I did enjoy it starting out, but the more time I put into it, the more tedious everything became. Battles were boring, the maps were unimaginative and very movement restrictive, and the towns seemed to serve no purpose other than a place to get mana and shop. (Villager commentary was mostly useless.) I just wanted it to end. I only beat it because I was near the end and didn't want it to end up as ""just another game I haven't finished.""The game was not entirely faulty. I did enjoy the skill system, it made you think about your play style and what skills may be more beneficial in the long run. Also, as much as I dreaded random encounters, boss battles were fun, requiring quick thinking to take down the boss before his strength multiplier became too high.I personally believe that there are better games out there, but if you want an RPG to play that is cheap (especially on sale, think I got this and Cthulu as a bundle for less than two bucks,) then give it a shot, but be forewarned; unless you like grindy and unnecessarily long dungeons, look elsewhere.

												I payed Breath AND Chultlu 0.30€, to be honest I think BoD is worth at least 4 or 5€, it's a classic 8bit game, mocking the J-RPG style, the plot is basic, the environnement (with only undeads) is enjoyable and as many will probably have told you, the main feature of this game and what is really interesting, is the LVL-UP system, which allow you to customize you characters.And that's where the repliability lies in this game, if you play it twice, I guess you can have totally different techs from the last play you did, and for me it's the main point of this game, so once I reached lvl 30, I didn't feel as much fun as earlier in this game. But anyway, definilty worth the price =)			"

												Great little JRPG in the style of Dragon Quest. It doesn't take very long to finish but still acceptable for a $3.00 game. Just enough grind to make the game challenging, but not annoying. Most of the battles can be coasted through easily but if you're not careful you'll find yourself dead. It has a wonderful sense of humor that references the characteristics of other JRPGs and pokes fun at them. I would recommend this game to anyone that likes JRPGs or just wants to kill a few hours.

Graphics and sound are comparable to that of late-NES titles, and gameplay is typical turn-based RPG.  It's a short 4 hour quest, but Zeboyd gives you a couple of bonus modes and dungeons to crawl.  Worth the money, (heck it's worth more).			"

Promising, but boring gameWhat started out to be a seemingly epic adventure, turned out to be a rather bland jog at best.This game has the absolute bare minimum requirements to be considered an RPG; it is quite possibly the most basic RPG you will ever play.The ""plot"" is as uninteresting as it is forgettable, and the same goes for any characters, locations, enemies, dialogue, you name it.Combat (even on the hardest difficulty setting) is laughably easy - especially after lots of mindless grinding.The game doesn't have any exciting moments, but remains at a constant low throughout the entire ""experience""; the ending being as flaccid as the rest of the game.Mildly entertaining at best, but turns into a grindfest with little to no rewards and especially no feel of satisfaction when finishing a dungeon/boss.Not recommended; save your money or get some other game for the same (or less) money and more value.Hopefully the ""sequel"" is better...(NOTE: Play time is low because of offline-play)			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Breath of Death VII: The Beginning is another fantastic RPG game developed by Zeboyd Games, the same creators that made Cthulu Saves the World and I must say, from the moment I played the game I fell in love with it. The comedy, the 4th wall breaks, the references to pop culture and so on made me want to play and complete the five hour long gameThe gameplay is like any RPG game. You move around a 2D space, moving around a level, interact with people, fight enemies and gain XP. I usually don't like these type of games but thankfully Zeboyd Games' Breath of Death VII: The Beginning made me want to finish the game and see the whole comedic storyThe only complaint I would complain about is the random encounters and the mazed like levels which kind of made me want to stop playing the gameBut overall, Breath of Death VII: The Beginning is a cheap (in pricing terms), funny and creative game that everyone who loves comedy or RPG's, should really try this game!

												Don't be fooled by the title.  This is not the 7th game in a series.The game has a turn based battle system where enemies become stronger each turn, encouraging you to finish battles as quickly as possible.  Using certain skills and attacking builds up a combo counter that increases the effectiveness of other skills.  This game is slightly more strategic than other turn based RPGs.The story is very silly and full of references to older RPGs.  Don't expect a serious story.If you buy the Double Pack, play this one first.  Cthulhu Saves the World has some improvements that might ruin this game for you.			"

Worth money and often discounted as bundle on Steam.First impression : good.+ Exotic story : squeletton heroe meet ghost woman ^^ (far from classic story)+ Classic graphics for 2D game (more near from ealy consoles than modern pc) on map travels, better graphics looking in city and with npc+ Nice music (somme are near from Hans Zimmer work !)+ Auto level up but you can choose 1 bonus/level up+ Fighting system : basic attacks, skills attacks, magic attacks, with combo counter to deal more damages, unite attack that require 2 heroes+ Shopping system : seem classic shopping+ Map : big map to explore+ Storyboard : dialog are ok that mean not too short not too long, texts often based on humor + Saving system : you can save anywhere+ 4 levels of difficulties- ""XNA Microsoft access violation error"" after intro game, with crash, if you didn't allowed Windows Media Player on system (XNA Microsoft requirement to play game based on game engine)I'll update my evalution later because i need to play deeply game.

												Breath of Death VII is an interesting game. It's a parody of old-school RPGs and it definitely shows. Its largest single flaw is definitely battling. The game is very fast compared to old RPGs which makes grinding a breeze, but this in my opinion also makes the game feel very shallow. Depending on your difficulty setting, this game can either be way too easy or very hard. Story doesn't take itself very seriously but I enjoyed it. It wasn't too over-the-top to distract me from following it. Writing was great as I never felt that the game had a weak point in its story.I'd say the game is worth its price, at least on sale. You also get a second game, Cthulhu Saves the World, when you buy Breath of Death.			"

Its also faster paced than most of the old games it harkons back to which I very much like. Score Atk mode gives it some replay value to. If noting else its certainly worth getting on a sale if you like retor JRPGs			"

												I went into this game with a pretty average expectations. I've finished a few old-school JRPGs like Mother and Final Fantasy I, so I went into the game expecting a pretty average experience.GAMEPLAYWhen I got into my first few battles, I was fairly surprised. The menus are streamlined and though they lack a memory feature (auto-selecting the last command) it's possible to breeze through several battles in no time at all. The ability to auto-heal after every battle was a nice addition too, and it fit well into the game's mythos of undead characters. On the other hand, after playing a few hundred battles I found myself growing weary of the system. Since you auto-heal after every battle, it's possible to blaze through battles with reckless abandon, rapidly mashing A. And for a good 60% of my fights, I found myself doing exactly that. It was only during bosses and particularly challenging encounters did I find myself repetitively spamming my most powerful physical moves. And really, that isn't very much fun either.STORYLINEThe storyline, though, makes up for that. The tone is fairly light-hearted and the game never tries to take itself too seriously. Breath of Fire VII is a parody of Dragon Quest games, you see, and it knows trying to pull off a huge, epic storyline won't accomplish much. Conversations are kept short and to-the-point, groan worthy video-game references are kept to a minimum (thankfuly) and the game always lets you know where to go next. Overall, the storyline does it's job.PRESENTATIONOverall, the game has a very low-budget feel. Super-saturated colors are everywhere, and all of the character graphics have a very blobby pillow-shaded look to them. I understand the game is going for a retro look, but if you're going to imitate the classics at least choose better contemporaries like Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy VI. Just look at games like Echoes of Eternea...It's possible to make gorgeous low-budget retro JRPGS without sacrificing quality.So all in all, would I recommend Breath of Death VII? Yes...but only to passionate fans of Dragon Quest looking for an old-school experience. For everyone else, I'd say pass this one up. There are better ways to spend your time.			"

												It's a game. Meh. I honestly don't have anything of merit to say about it.It's easily finishable in 2-3 hours, there's no story, no side quests, a bunch of obscure video game references, and cheesy dialogue.			"

												Breath of Death VII is a short rpg inspired by classic games like Dragon Warrior for the NES. Gamers from the 80's - 90's era will also notice some Phantasy Star 4, Lufia, Earthbound and many more classic rpg puns. The developers definitely have a sense of humor and it shows throughout the game. They will make you laugh with jokes and wacky conversations.The graphics look like a NES rpg much like Dragon Warrior and it looks very decent. I will even say that it looks slightly better then most of the rpgs of that era. The music however takes a different direction and is more cd quality then the chip tunes of the era. This changes the atmosphere slightly from being a NES game to more of a Sega CD/Turbo Grafx CD style RPG. All in all the music gets the job done and some songs are very catchy. The battle system is simple like the classic rpgs of the era but it also adds some extra depth to keep it fresh. Different attacks and magic can combo with your party. Ending the combos adds massive damage and you also have the ability to use unite attacks that not only do damage but can give helpful status effects. You must work fast to defeat your enemies because with each turn they will grow stronger. This will cause boss fights to become much more challenging and even normal enemies can be a problem you mess around. Leveling up goes fast and as you do, you have choices to how your character develops. I must also mention to be prepared for random encounters because they are here but not as frequent as the classic games.If you like classic rpgs and don't mind some humor then you will enjoy this title. It is short but unlike most classic rpgs it has replay value with harder difficulty levels, score attack mode and a extra hard boss after you beat the game. For the price it's definitely worth it.

												This is an OK rpg. Most will probably like it for the humor if anything at all. It plays fairly straight forward. Every level up gives you a choice of two options. Some times it's skill related, most of the time it's stat boosts.Of the older RPGs I've played I found this one to be one of the most grindy. Perhaps most of that was because I started on hard, but I've played plenty of other rpgs that still had a smooth progression of difficulty and this one wasn't there.Still combat was fun enough and the campaign took me about 9 hrs to beat WITH exploration where I could. I would back track any chance I got if I felt like I may have missed something.Negatives:This is a very simple RPG and there's not really a lot of content what-so-ever.GrindStill I enjoyed my time with it if nothing else as a time-waster. if you're looking for a more fleshed out rpg, maybe something with actual story. check out something else.

												I love simple RPGs. And this is exactly what that is. The combat system is extremely easy to learn and is definitely geared towards letting you win. With attacks that do damage based on the amount of times you've hit targets during a fight it's extremely easy to learn how to beat big bosses really quickly.The quirky nature of the game and it's NPCs being based around the undead is a complete bonus and only adds to the charm and experience of this wonderfully addictive game.

												Breath of Death VII is just as hilarious as Cthulhu Saves the World.  The satirical themes expressed in the game are crack full of jokes that don't get old and originality.  The story has an interesting concept.  Separate, it seems out of place.  The beginning starts with a Terminator-like war, and the remainder of the game looks like it's set in a fantasy world full of magical creatures and demonic monsters.  However, when they're put together, it makes sense, even just a little.  I cannot express my love for Zeboyd games.  I hope more come soon. 8/8			"

												[Spoiler-Free Review]A quick-paced, deliberate, self-aware and irreverent RPG even Generation Y can play - if they can get over the visuals!Breath of Death VII introduces us to Dem and his band of minions as they take RPG tropes from yesteryear (i.e. top-down presentation, menu based combat, magic and dungeon exploring) and reimagine them to fit within a world of immediate gratification and life-on-a-schedule.The story is sharp and witty, the characters are interesting and unique (as much as a skeleton can be anyway) and the combat  is almost slideshow-like as battles can take little more than 10 seconds at times - this usually just consists of you mashing furiously on the action button. Your characters even automatically heal after every battle - less time flipping through menu after menu with upkeep.In this way, it's a bit of a ""My First RPG"". it's the most approachable RPG I've ever played and brings enough ""new"" to the genre to recommend.  A dirt cheap stroll down RPG memory lane.			"

												This feels a little unpolished, but is still very enjoyable.  I got this in a package with Cthulu saves the world and it feels like Breath of Death was made first and they used it to perfect the mechanics and themes that would later be in Cthulu saves the world.  The characters are enjoyable and the story is interesting.  My only complaints are the blank backdrop to battles and the repeating text on tombstones.			"

												Neat little JRPG parody. Main plot takes 4 - 5 hours if rushed, 9 - 10 at a leisurely pace. Like most RPGs, random battles can get a bit tedious, but there is a battle limit in place to stop them happening after a certain amount, which is cool.The humour is cheesy and not for everybody, but will likely endear those (like me) who love a good B-movie.Short and sweet, but what more can you expect for £1.99?

												While Breath of Death VII: The Beginning may not be the most innovative entry in the old-school RPG genre, there are a few things that really make it worth checking out:- Combo System:     Something that I've never seen in a turn-based combat RPG; it really encourages you to be smart and make every move count in the battle sequences.- Soundtrack:    Despite the 16-bit visual style, the game features some very well-made music with real instrumentation (including some kickass battle themes that utilize orchestral and rock instruments).-  Simplicity:     This is by no means a complex game that requires signifcant time investment. It's a fun little nostalgia trip that takes you back to the early Final Fantasy games while making some humorous remarks along the way.-  Price:     At only a few dollars, the game is worth picking up (especially during a sale) considering you can get a solid  6 - 8 hours of play time in your first playthough.Overall, this is a great game for anyone who's a fan of the older RPGs and is looking for a fun, humorus take on the genre.

												My Rating: 3/10The story was okay,but was a bit made up as you go. This is my first Zeboyd game, and I have heard they are not always set in a realm of seriousness.The game appealed to me at first because of it's Dragon Questesque appearance. Admittedly, I did enjoy it starting out, but the more time I put into it, the more tedious everything became. Battles were boring, the maps were unimaginative and very movement restrictive, and the towns seemed to serve no purpose other than a place to get mana and shop. (Villager commentary was mostly useless.) I just wanted it to end. I only beat it because I was near the end and didn't want it to end up as ""just another game I haven't finished.""The game was not entirely faulty. I did enjoy the skill system, it made you think about your play style and what skills may be more beneficial in the long run. Also, as much as I dreaded random encounters, boss battles were fun, requiring quick thinking to take down the boss before his strength multiplier became too high.I personally believe that there are better games out there, but if you want an RPG to play that is cheap (especially on sale, think I got this and Cthulu as a bundle for less than two bucks,) then give it a shot, but be forewarned; unless you like grindy and unnecessarily long dungeons, look elsewhere.

												This is very much in the same style as ""Cthulhu Saves the World"", both in terms of gameplay and storytelling. Unfortunately, that means you have to love grinding through an area until you've killed enough of the same monster to move onto the next area, which will require you to repeat the grinding pattern to move onto the next area, and so forth, and so on.
