												Game starts with no story, no reason why you are there, just begins with you holding an axe outside of town with skeletons coming to attack you. Click to attack, the character swings his arm instead of the axe. Skeletons dont seem to mind, they die anyway. Go into town, no story at all, just asked to get some keys to lock a gate. The skeletons wont be able to get in if the door is locked. As I walk around, scenery pops in everywhere. Graphical glitches are frequent. Ambient sound loops for abour 4 seconds before it repeats. I spec to be a mage as I usually do in these Diablo clones. Find a basic staff, and start shooting ice bolts at skeletons. 45-50 dmg. I upgrade my INT and skill level, and start to do 65 dmg. I run out of mana, and start swinging my staff. 250 damage per hit, one shotting everything. Find a donkey which gives you a quest. Nothing appears on the screen, I have to go into the quest log to find it. Apparently the town in which I came not only has a locked doors issue, but now needs flour. This donkey has flour. Time to save the day via bread. Then it crashed. Best part of the game in my opinion.			"

												This is the worst ARPG I've ever played.Broken, abandoned junk. There is no part 2 for a reason.The game play is slow, unresponsive and ganky, the 3D graphics look like they were pulled from a Game Cube.If you must buy an ARPG get ether Torchlight 1/2, Van Hellsing, Titan quest, Grim Dawn or any other less known ARPGs.Or go for gold just get 'Path of Exile' and never look back. Look on Youtube for videos of Hazen, it's plain broken and bad.			"

												This game is awful. I cannot recommend it at all. The gameplay is frustrating, the fun factor is non-existent and you'll wish you'd  never heard of it after spending 20 minutes playing it. There are no more episodes for this game as the first one was so bad, the company that made it went under. Avoid this game as much as possible.			"

												Recommended if you want to cry yourself to sleep at how you spent money on something that crashes when you use a basic feature. Plus, it's a short ""episode 1"" of an episodic thing that never came about, so the plot basically doesn't go anywhere.Also it's just not a good game.			"

												Starting the game, you will go into an area with no plot. Just you standing there, 'corpsewalkers' swinging at you. Then jarring popups tell you basic controls then guide you to a town across a bridge. The graphics are not that great, the interface is a mishmashed diablo, and quite honestly I had no idea what was going on. Play this on a bet, while drunk, or when you need to feel confused. You can't even alt+f4 out of it.Pros: Honestly cannot think of any. There are many more games out there that are dungeon splunks that do this better, for cheaper.Cons: To many to list.			"

												An ok action RPG if you ask me. It has graphics that are cartoony (similar to Torchlight) and somewhat realistic. It mixes both of them really. I'm not that far in, but I really haven't seen much a story so far. Gameplay is like any other action RPG, so, lots of combat and a bit of quest solving while doing that. For a cheap game it's not that bad. Bit unpolished maybe. And I've been told it's pretty short (since it's an episode). My advice ? Hmm, I don't know... But I'm sure you can find out on your own if this is the game for you.[Rating: 61/100]			"

												Okay, I initially classified this game in my ""This Game Sucks""-category (only after spending a few hours on it).  I actually reloaded this game and forced myself to learn and play the game.  Objectively, it's pretty sound - as most hack-n-slash follow similar key-binding layouts and mouse-behaviours of well-known games of this genre (i.e. Diablo).  I think the majority of the negative reviews come from those that have played Diablo or similar hack-n-slash games as Hazen introduces a differing layout for control movement and attack.  I played this game with the notion - ""this is not Diablo, don't expect it to be Diablo"".  Looking beyond that, the game does quench the hack-n-slash thirst for those willing to overlook it's unique default control layout.			"

												Thought this would be a good time waster. I was right.....wasted my time (and money).Game crashes occasionally. Could get no further than what i believe is the first round. The quest is to find Malestos, which i did, however he just stands there with a big monster beside him and tells his minions to kill me.Did the verify integrity...nothing, uninstalled and reinstalled....still nothing.

												Hazen: The Dark Whispers is problematic in one specific way. The problem is not with this game but with games themselves, or at least with the RPG genre. Playing Hazen, I couldn’t shake the nagging question: Where is “up” from here? "

												You know, if it was the last ARPG on Earth, I'd probably play it.  The art style is not bad for the time it was made and the mechanics work... to some extent.  Fun loot drops and you can feel yourself getting stronger and taking less damage as you get increasingly better armor.  In spite of all the complaints here, Hazen surprisingly ran fine on my Win7 x64 system with only one crash when entering a dungeon.  When reloaded, the game left me back where I was.Now for the bad parts:1. No saving allowed in a dungeon.  If the game crashes you may lose up to a half hour of progress.2. There is some kind of memory leak that slows down the game the longer you play.  Your melee swings and casts get slower and slower while the enemies rush you at the same speed.3. It takes a while to get used to the backwards controls.  You move with rt. click and everything else is left click.  No key rebinds.  Worst of all are the ungodly respawns that slow you down as you travel to your destination then back to your village.  No teleports or shortcuts, just the long, slow trek back while fighting the same enemies you fought on the way there.  The first two hours had me traveling the same path numerous times while fighting the same respawns.  It can be maddening.Compared to a far superior ARPG like Torchlight that came out a year earlier, Hazen: The Dark Whispers just can't compete.			"
