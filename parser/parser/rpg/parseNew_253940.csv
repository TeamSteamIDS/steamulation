												This game...This game used to be a reason for me to rush home from school. While the bigger Final Fantasy games were tearing up the console world (7 and 8 were on PC as well) this forgotten gem appeared in my life through luck. I was browsing the local Hastings for an interesting PC game to play. I had around $30 to spend from my allowance, and I found Redneck Rampage for around $15. So I immediately grabbed it because it looked hilarious. Well, not wanting to leave with just one game, I kept browsing. It was then I seen a ""Jewel"" Pack. It contained within it two of the most influential games I would ever play, Shogo Mobile Armor Division, and Septerra Core, for $10. Feeling pretty satisfied, I got back home, and immediately put in Shogo, because who doesn't want to run around shooting things in a mech suit? After a few days of playing it, I booted up Redneck Rampage, and, as I expected, the game was hilarious and consumed me for another week or so. Finally, I installed Septerra Core. The case had no information, no screenshots, or any detail what-so-ever. I had no idea what I was getting into. But then, before my eyes, a gorgeous intro cutscene played, and then I was on the menu. Excited now, I hit New Game as fast as possible. The amazing voice acting, the wonderful rendered 2.5D graphics, the menu options, the character equipment, the stats, the magic system...Everything just hit me like a tidal wave. It was different, but that was a good thing. The story was just wonderful. The lack of a soundtrack made it better to me, because it made it more immersive. There are no soundtracks in real life, so why would a role-playing game need a continuous one? I can't recommend this title enough. To alot of modern gamers, this may seem like trash, but this is by far a superior to many of it's current companions. Enjoy your time in Septerra Core, I know I have.			"

												This JRPG style game isn't bad but it's held back by several flaws.THE GOOD : the voice acting for the main characters, especially Maya is outstanding. The spell cards are fun to combine and the graphics for the time are pretty good. The character models aren't the best but I did like the backgrounds and lighting effects. What music is there is good although there's mainly over world and battle themes. Dungeons are generally silent. Sound effects are pretty good as well and satisfying to hear. The story isn't bad either. Sometimes you have to bring a certain character to an NPC to get them to say something specific or get a key item. Think about which character might be useful with a certain NPC or on what shell.  Your battle attack/spells have 3 levels of power leading to some strategy involved. Enemies can potentially be bypassed as in games like Earthbound and Chrono Trigger and there are no random battles, enemies are on screen almost always.THE BAD: The dungeons get monotonous really fast, mainly because it's mostly about flipping switches to open doors that often lead to more switches. You're either opening doors or making new pathways and at the end you find a key item or fight a boss. Then you have to usually backtrack out of the dungeon manually which can get annoying if you just want to get out of there and don't care about exp and gold. An option to teleport out would have been helpful. There's also a lot of backtracking,  and clues to what needs to be done next can sometimes be confusing to figure out. Again, bringing the right character along on the right shell can be a big help in this aspect.  Another major glaring problem for me was the slow animations during battle and the sound effects  often took even longer, still playing even when the animations were done. This is especially a problem with the zombie enemies.  I found myself using machine gun characters when I could, just because their attacks are faster.  Characters take one turn at a time or combine turns during spells. You can't input commands usually until the character is done with their attack or spell/item usage unlike say a Final Fantasy game. This stuff is a bigger problem during the first half of the game, once you get a spell card that lets you attack all enemies it helps cut down on this some, but it's still a problem. I found myself running away from battles towards the end, just to get to the end of the game.  Overall I enjoyed Septerra Core for the voice acting and story/setting. The battle system isn't BAD as an idea, and the card concept is neat, it's just feels slow as heck, at least for me. The switch flipping and backtracking got on my nerves fast. If the battle system was just faster, I might not have minded the rest, because that's mainly what made the dungeons more of a chore than anything else. If you're the patient type you might find the battles less grating than I did. I got it on sale here for a buck so it was worth the price. I'd give Septerra Core a 7/10. I'm going to overall recommend the game. Just be aware of the issues above if you decide to play.			"

												Ok, I remember playing this title back when I was much younger and I was gifted this by a very good friend from Amazon VGF. First off, if you get this game, get it from gog. The fix for many issues in the steam version is uninstall the Quicktime that Steam installs and to torrent the executable form a gog download. If you're going to need to get the file from gog in the first place, you might as well purchase it outright from there unless it's deeply discounted on Steam. If you do get from steam, be sure to uninstall the quicktime that was auto installed and install the version that is in the game folder as this will fix some of the issues.First off, anyone needs to realize that this game was originally released in 1999 so don't expect a mind blowing graphical experience. Also, the manual link on Steam doesn't populate anything so you'll need to go to the following link if you don't want to kludge around to see what works.http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=20172&tab=controlsCombat revolves around an ABT that has different sections that fill as time moves on during combat. Enemies appear to have the same ability but they usually seem to only utilize their weak/quick attack from what I've seen since starting the game. The voice acting is pretty decent when you consider the age of the title.Alright, now that we have all of that out of the way, we get down to the nitty gritty details of whether this game is worth your money and your time and the answer is No. If you're like me and have fond memories of playing this at a younger age, this will rip the blinds from your eyes and make you realize that not all games are worth the time invested in. The story is ok at best, the controls take a while to adjust to and never actually feel 'right' and the game doesn't give the option to remap them to where they feel more comfortable. If you enjoy jrpg's and can get past the technical issues, I would still recommend looking elsewhere as there is a decent collection of titles to choose from.			"

												Septerra Core is....a difficult game to recommend. I should preface this review by saying that it is MOST CERTAINLY not for everyone. Septerra Core is an older turn-based RPG from a time where these sorts of games were common on consoles but rather rare on PC. I played the game to completion back in that era, and found it rather enjoyable - however, even then it had its rough edges, and for modern sensibilities it will be rather archaic.The combat engine is location-based, similar to how Chrono Trigger is. However, the speed/pace everything works at is exclusively suited to when you have 3 members in your party, so combat is QUITE clunky in the early portion of the game, which makes it a bit of a hurdle to overcome.The cast is varied, and the story was decent for the time (from what I recall - details are fuzzy). The concept of the WORLD itself is rather imaginative, and wholly unique from what I've run into in gaming. Aside from that, level design as the game progresses becomes....extremely maze-like. Lots of wrapping corridors which look same-y and form literal mazes.Effectively, I'm recommending this because I enjoyed this game when I played it. But anyone who purchases it should know what they're getting when they're going in - a game that was a little rough around the edges when it came out, and which probably won't appeal to most modern gamers. Only purchase if you really enjoy turn-based RPGs, or are interested in very imaginative sci-fi worlds.			"

												It's an old school RPG with turn-based party combat. Interesting story & setting but the ending screams for a sequel that we won't see. It has problems with modern OS (Windows 7/8) but it can be easily fixed. Combat gets tedious, Dungeon design is just ""get the key/ flip the switch and open the gate"" and backtracking to it sucks. But once you get past the cons...it's a good game in its time of release.			"

												Still a great game like it was during the Win 95/98 era. The same bugs persist but these are easily fixable. The Steam version is only 1.02v though when the final patch for the game is 1.04v. You can however still patch it yourself to run the 1.04v version. The cutscenes didn't work at first but installing the version of QuickTime that comes with the game and tunring off the DirectX boxes (not the circle) in the QuickTime options has fixed this issue. (I""m running Windows 7) Other then that running the game in Windows XP SP2 compatability and I've had 0 issues since. This game is a gem for its price with minor flaws. Don't expect anymore patches though because like I stated earlier this is a Windows 95/98 era game and the only real flaw left is sometimes how fast the text plays during minor moments.			"

												I have great memories of the game, but the Steam version is unfortunately a buggy mess. I can't even play the game for more than a few minutes because of problems with cutscenes, dialogue, and crashes.Buy the GOG version instead. It doesn't have all of these issues and is $2 cheaper (as of writing).			"

Short version: 73%Septerra Core is an old Western JRPG with an interesting world and characters, plus surprisingly decent mechanics. If you manage to survive the endless mazes that plague the second half, you can find an oldie gem under its dated exterior.Long version:Septerra Core: Legacy of the Creator is a strange beast: a PC-exclusive Western JRPG not made with RPG Maker; maybe the only one of this kind. It’s a JRPG to the core though with many tropes associated of the genre (like shops carrying better items because you are progressing in the story, not for any logical reason).Don’t expect a cheap Final Fantasy clone though– Monolith shook up the old NES JRPG elements and even added a few new ideas. For example, the battles use a modified ATB system where you can fill up three bars to unlock better abilities in combat– except for magic, which is cast by forming different card combinations.The world left behind the old single-continent setup to feature a planet made out of seven rotating shell layers, each with their own themes. There is also a rich mythology, which also serves as the main plot element: your job is to stop an elitist madman before he destroys the world in pursuit of an old prophecy. And you accomplish that with an unusual cast: a female protagonist (who is not even a healer and doesn’t have a romantic sub-plot) accompanied by the strangest crew possible, ranging from a renegade cyborg to a sword-wielding knight or an armless smuggler.The game’s weak spot is the level design: everything is a maze. It’s a small problem at first, since most of the locations are small and you can progress in a good pace. But after visiting all shells, the designers just gave up and forced the plot into a series of long labyrinths with boring switch puzzles. These easily take up two-thirds or more of the 50-60 hour play time, and probably scared away more people from this otherwise enjoyable game than they should have.			"

***** QUICK SPOILER-FREE REVIEW (WITH BUG FIXES!) *****Solid Sci-Fi RPG with strong characters, good dialogue, nice battle mechanics and a refreshing click-and-point, puzzle-adventure feel. It's a little bit dated now, but the gameplay/world is reminiscent of Chrono-Trigger and Final Fantasy, all with a heavy Sci-Fi/punkish leaning, even sharing a visual likeness with Fallout 2, but much easier on the eyes. The story line is paced especially well, and is done in short snippets so you're not constantly bombarded with text (but there are books of lore if you want to know more). There's also extra side-stuff to explore, as to reach those special areas and get good loot you'll have to pay attention to your surroundings and use your brain. I wish more RPGs did this these days, honestly, it's quickly become one of my favourites! The only thing to be cautious of are the compatibility issues, which can be worked around...FIXING THE DAMN GAME (at least for Windows)1) Go here and follow the patching instructions, takes a couple of mins tops.Now, chances are, the cinematics aren't going to work after that, you'll probably just see nothing but a white screen. I took the trouble of finding the cinematics on YouTube, ripping them and re-encoding them so....2) ...go to my google drive here  download the zip and replace the cinematics in your Septerra Core folder. Should work for everyone and hopefully save you a lot of headache! Obviously I'm not responsible for your computer blowing up or anything like that.3) Lastly, you will probably find that after your first battle, the game appears to freeze. It's actually not locked-up, just a really annoying bug. The solution should be to hold a specific button down on your keyboard. For me it's the Print Screen button, but others report that holding ctrl+a works for them. The camera will move to focus on your players, then you'll get the post battle XP-gain info, etc and you're good to go. Some players report that changing their vsync settings on their graphics card to On or Off fixes the bug all together, but I've had no luck doing that (Nvidia 760, Windows 7).That's it! Enjoy!Extra) I'd recommend saving your ears by turning down the Sound FX to about 3/4 of max and Voice to about 4/5ths of max. Leave the music at max, then change the master volume to suit. Annoyingly, you'll have to do this every time you open the game, but it only takes a second anyway.  "

												So, Septerra Core. Here we are. FINALLY!I've started this game 4 times (thanks to a lot of PC crashes). The first time was back in the day, when this game was fairly new (sooo, around 2000/2001? maybe?). 15th of May 2015 I finally finished it. Did I like it as much as I did back when I was roughly 12 years old? Well... kinda. The thing is: the game AGED ♥♥♥♥ING TERRIBLE!!!!!I don't know what my favorite feature is. Maybe the fact that everything is soooooooo slow. You're basically waiting for EVERYTHING. Wait for the fight to start. Wait until your action bar is filled up to the level you want. Wait for the enemy to finish attacking because it is their turn EVERY ♥♥♥♥ING TIME EXACTLY BEFORE YOUR ACTION BAR IS ALMOST FULL!!!! Wait for the attack animation to start! Wait for the attack animation to end! It takes ♥♥♥♥ing forever to get ♥♥♥♥ done in this game. And that's not talking about interacting with ♥♥♥♥ing objects. (Why Maya, why are you thinking so long about that order I just gave you? Pull the ♥♥♥♥ing lever!!!)Or maybe it is the TERRIBLE DUNGEON DESIGN that stretches the game about at least a third. Enter a ♥♥♥♥ING HUGE dungeon WHICH CONTAINS (apart from some items) NOTHING BUT LEVERS THAT OPEN DOORS AT THE OTHER END OF THE MAP. (Backtracking, Hooray!!!)Add to that the fact that you visit a lot of dungeons AT LEAST TWICE. Multiple times if you by chance don't have a specific item or a specific party member. That's right, most of the game is also a giant fetch quest of ""use that item nobody told you about to progress"". Get random item no.1 from place x to get random item no.2 that you might need 12 hours later at place y. Don't have item no.2 when you are IN THE ♥♥♥♥ING HUGE ♥♥♥ DUNGEON Y? WELL ♥♥♥♥ YOU, GO BACK TO X AND GET IT!!!! Thank god, that leaving one dungeon and entering a different one doesn't take ages...ohwait.I could probably continue, but I rather say that I really liked the world and the characters and back in 1999 all of these features/problems were probably not as much a pain in the ♥♥♥ as they are nowadays. The game even has some smart ideas like the 3-level-attack-bars and the spell casting system. Unfortunately, video games have moved on and kind of left Septerra Core behind. There are probably many other old games that have aged better.So, do I recommend Septerra Core. Well, obviously I ♥♥♥♥ing do because it is a really charming game that always has a special place in my heart. Also, I am now officially done with it and never have to think back like: ""Why did I never finish Septerra Core? That game was kickass back then!"" In my opinion, everyone should experience the sensation that is Septerra Core in its entirety. And if you didn't back then, well, sucks to be you because nowadays the game is horrible, tedious, physical pain. But I still love you, Septerra Core. I do love you! <3<3<3<3<3			"

												This is one of those games that's either going to be a nostalgic thing for you or you're going to have issues with the way it works and the glitches with newer operating systems and hardware that the game wasn't designed to run on. That said, for me, it's the nostalgic side and I'm willing to put up with some hoops to jump through to get it running smoothly, though it does work as is from Steam with some minor issues (see the forums). It's one of those games that I'm glad to see being raised from obscurity since I have been wishing to be able to play again but could not find my old install discs. And fair warning, there is a debate as to if the gog version is the better one to buy due to the version patch.The game itself is a solid RPG with, for its time, a fiarly inovative combat system and quite a well done story and fairly memorable cast of characters.  The voice acting is not specacular given new gaming standards, but they are pretty good given the age of the game.  Expect to do a little bit of grinding in order to afford items and have easier times with later fights. There are serval cut points in the game where you can no longer go back to old areas after you reach them due to story progression so I'd recomend saving often and saving in multiple slots in order to be able to back up to points.

												One of the best JRPGs I ever played. Gripping story, plenty of charm and character development, addictive and best of all a very decent combat system that is not too overwhelming but still leaves a lot of opportunities to explore, combine and exploit. On the cons side, I need to warn you it's damn hard, you will be doing a lot of backtracking (the only really annoying parts are when you are missing an item and you won't find out until you hit a brick wall - literally - and need to go all the way back to fetch the missing item, not to mention figure out where to find it). The game could have used a map/teleport system for already visited places. No biggy though, just look up online when you get stuck what next, and continue enjoying the game.Thoroughly recommending this gem in the rough.			"

												A creative RPG that knows how to tell a story. Great characters and even decent voice acting give this game it's unique charm. The battle system is good enough, if a little slow, to allow for some interesting gameplay. The main draw, however, is the world of the game, which encompasses seven different, attached worlds (I have only been to two so far, but from what I've seen, the other five should be just as interesting).Overall, the game is easy enough to get into without feeling like a walk in the park. Battles are not truly random, which is nice, and can be avoided if desired. Also, this game features a strong female protagonist, which is fairly rare even today, as well as a dog-like robot! So pick it up and enjoy the ride.			"

												I paid $0.76 CDN for this title.After trying to fix and patch and play around with this game I have decided that it's not worth buying. Even at less than a buck.If you did buy this nightmare of a PC game. Here are some tips to get the POS working.1. Septerra.ini contains all the keyboard settings, now you can configure it how you like. RunSelect is to run away from battle.2. In the Septerra.ini under options add ScaleMode = 0 and CpuIdle = 53. Get this patch from http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/3624/305754. Uninstall QuickTime and use the QuickTime installer withiin the Septerra folder.5. Set the new Septerra.exe from step 3 to compatibility mode for Win XP SP36. Do not use Timeslips unofficial patch, it converts the .db movies into white screens with audio.By following these steps you won't need to do the following fixes:1. Resolution color depth changes from 32 bt to 16 bit.2. Disabling any graphical settings through properites of the .exe3. No need to try and configure to run in a window to enjoy its graphics.The game will keep its aspect ratio and play in full screen. Tested on a UHD 4k monitor at 60Hz running ASUS R( 290x Direct CU II OC.			"

												A combination point-and-click adventure and RPG, this game has stood the test of time surprisingly well and this is likely due to its detailed environments, fully voiced dialogue for ALL characters and NPCs, and involved story. With a wide array of characters to include in your party and distinct dialogue options for each one, there is a lot of opportunity to learn more about the world and hear the perspectives of your party members. Some parts can be challenging if you aren't sure where to go or how to find a quest item you need but exploration is rewarded. I can highly recommend this one!			"

I wished to find it and play it for about 10 years and here it is.Would totally recommend it because (for me, at least) the world structure is amazing, the plot is quite interesting, and it's old (depends on your age of course but obviously not new). I just like old games, so, what can I say. Go and play it.			"

												Honestly with how much work you have to do to get this running I could not recommend this to anyone.  What's the point of porting this to Mac if the Wine port you made doesn't even work.  I tried in on Windows and it needs a different version patched over it to even run properly...  This isn't the gamers' responsibility to fix this it's the developer's.  That being said if you like purchasing an immediate chore from steam that may lead to a game instead of a game you'll enjoy this.  For everyone else I'd skip it.			"

												Septerra Core is a fantastic Eastern RPG-style adventure (ala Final Fantasy) set in one of the most unique worlds ever; Septerra. It's a planet consisting of layers, which encircle one another as well as the Core, and descending and ascending between these planetary continents forms the basis of the overworld exploration.As an older game, there's very limited options to configure, but this surprisingly doesn't hinder it that much as it's mouse-driven with pre-rendered backgrounds. There's a number of glitches you'll likely encounter, so I'd make sure to check the Internet for solutions to common problems encountered with modern versions of Windows. If you can get over these hitches, you'll find an engaging setting with likeable characters and turn-based combat reminiscent of the SNES / Playstation era.I truly hope that the sales of this title encourage them to update it, or maybe, one can hope, remake it in HD, because it's something that everyone who's a fan of RPGs can enjoy, and that more people should experience.

A blast from the past.Septerra Core isn't a perfect game. Carefully prepared 16-bit graphics, spritey characters, design of opponents and fully animated cut-scenes were strong advantages but in the last century. The accompanying melody in the background often causes the state of fatigue and a very low resolution might scare most of the players. Nevertheless, the game has stood the test of time and this is due to the specific climate and some interesting solutions. If u don't mind any of the above-mentioned aspects or the frequency and repeatability of fighting I assure you that world presented in the game will engage you for long hours.			"

												One of the great classic RPG's.  Highly recommend this game.  A few minor sound issues (like Grubb's attack being heard a few seconds after) and the everpresent QuickTime videos not playing are part of this game.  However those are like I said, minor and there are fixes for them.  Even if you had to play the entire game with those issues, game would still be worth playing.  They don't make 'em like they used to and Septerra Core is STILL one of the best to date.  You won't regret getting this game, trust me.			"

												One of the greatest Story driven games ive ever played! I love it i love it I LOVE IT! Septerra Core is an Japanese styled RPG like Final Fantasy with its own charm. It was created by Valkyrie Studios and published by Monolith Productions. Later on It was Topware Interactive. Sadly Valkyrie Studios was bankcrup just a few month after Septerra Core was released. The game was sold bad as there was almost no advertisement for it. They also worked on a new game called Seraphin which was never released. Now in year 2014 the game was rereleased on steam with no fixes and no patch for anything. Sadly the publisher didnt do anything to fix that. There many good sites to find tutorials and patches on google. You will find that :)The game itself,it gives you about 100 hours of playtime to finish this game as there many eastereggs and things to find. The most negative reviews are because the game is not very compatible to new Windows versions. It was designd for Windows 95,98 and XP. There patches which makes the game run great on Windows 7. As the Video format was for Quicktime there many problems to get it running under Windows 7 + as Microsoft removed Nativ Direct Draw support. There ways to get the video sequences running which you can google. For the game itself i would rate the following:Graphics: For the time 1999 the graphics was excelent and the world looks delitious!                 9/10Controlls: Easy mouse point and click movement.                                                                          7/10Story: Very nice story with an ending that would have earned a second part of this game!         9/10Gameplay: Game mechanics and movement, animations and all that stuff are very detailed.      8/10Sound: The game is full voice texted which means you can read or listen to anything they say! 10/10Support: Well as Valkyrie Studios closed and Topware dont care there is almost no support :(   2/10Overall: 8/10 I just can say if you love old games and like the way who JRPG's work this game is for you! If you want to have an running game with patches, multiplayer and 3D graphics go and play something else as this game wont make you have any fun!So far my review.Funfact: I bought this game 4 times on CD as i lost 1 and scratched 2 to death as i was much younger. But but now i got my last CD with the original how to printed on paper :)			"

Septerra Core plays like Chrono Trigger, with some point-and-click mixed in.  It's a little rough around the edges (the voice acting, for instance, doesn't flow well), but it's fun, and the steampunk world and story are engaging - with one exception, that is: the ending is a letdown.  I don't want to spoil too much, but they left a major plot thread hanging.  Still, it's worth playing if you like old JRPG's.(No, I don't have much play time logged.  Yes, I did beat the game before it was released on Steam.)			"

If you like a mix of P&C Adventure with an action based combat system like FF7 and Chrono Trigger, this game is just the thing for you! Only downside at the moment is that the steam version is only at version 1.02 and the cutscene and dialogue skip bug is not fixed in this yet compared to the 1.04 version from GoG.com.  PS: Do not watch the trailer video on Steam as they have basically just used an ingame cutscene and it contains a heavy story spoiler!			"

												Final Fantasy, toned down in terms of length, and turned into 3D (in comparison to like, FF 1,2, and sorts). Gameplay-wise, you know little of what to do unless some characters explicitly specify you where to go, but fortunately the areas aren't as extensive and misleading as FF's are, so catching up to where you left at will be relatively easy. Combat goes as follows: you can have up to 3 characters at any one time following you, each with different stats, play-style, and skills. When you're in combat, there is a bar under each of your characters that fills up as time goes on, with 2 3-digits numbers that represent your HP. The bar is divided into 3 parts; simply put, if you let it fill in one part, you can only use the basic weapons/moves which deals less damage, but if you let it fill up entirely, you can use more damaging moves (and the same goes for using cards, this game's equivalent of magic). You click on a character's frame when at least one bar is filled up, select the move you want to use (or use items, or invoke card powers), and target the enemy. There is a big bar of blue on top of the combat interface; that's your core energy, or what you'd call Mana, MP, SP, or whatever. NOTHING in combat regenerates, even post-battle (unless you manually use items or rest to recover those combat stats), so keep in mind when you do anything mid battle. The game is generous enough to tell you that when you use a certain move or card, the energy bar shows how much energy that move/card is going to use up, so you can plan your moves carefully. Overall, the combat feels balanced; challenging if you rush through the game with zero grinding, and rewarding if you decide to grind in one area.However, the game does not tell you what any of your character's stats do, so you pretty much have to experiment with each, or deduce yourself what each does. Also, despite the game telling you where to go next explicitly through well-voiced NPC dialogues, it does not tell you what to do when you're in said location.The plot is quite linear, with little, but appreciable amount of side-missions. The lore is, personally, rather extensive for a game that has no sequel. You go from place A to place B, go to C, then back to A for some quick stuffs, and move on to D.Laziness overtook me. I'll just say that if you're someone who enjoys FF or JRPG in general, puzzles, and exploring, this game is worth the price.P.S. get the official patch for this game, otherwise it's unplayable for Windows 7 and above. I wouldn't recommend installing the unofficial patch because it made the game run on like, 2 or 3 fps.			"

												Note: Considering Septerra Core is my Favorite Game, my opinion may be biased.But first the issues with the Steam version:-It is the 1.02 version, you need to download version 1.04 or the GOG version that fixes dialogue skipping, but has a few delays with a few combat sounds.-The Videos don’t work, unless you have a QuickTime 6 or below and you run it on XP compatibility. Sometimes that will not work either and have to search the internet for additional help.-There is a Spell: Destroyer(Chaos+Law) that may crash the Game, usually on bosses. The game is a JRPG inspired game made by a western game studio. It has turn-based combat, point-and-click puzzles and a save the world story. The most interesting thing for me was the villain, who is a powerful warlord that wants a simple thing, to become the next Messiah, the savior of the world, by any means necessary. And the heroes are dragged into the plot and try to reduce the casualties caused by this obsession. I have beaten the Game twice on Steam and five times in total, I know where all items are, when I need to do what, how meany supplies do I need for every dungeon, who gives what hints, how to do things in the most optimal way. I actually found the dungeons short. And most importantly, none of the games flaws have reduced my enjoyment of it one bit.BUT… for a new player that is not the case. Heck the game doesn’t even have a tutorial on combat, it does not tell you that you can use healing spells and repair outside of combat. It expects you to be a veteran in JRPGs from the start. It has no Objective/Journal/Notes screen to remind you what you are supposed to be doing, it does however provide you with a lot of hints, some of which require specific party members or just trial and error.The combat is turn based, but is determined by the speed of which a three level bar is filled. After the first level is filled you may take your turn or wait for a more powerful charge. After the start and except for a few specific sections of the game, you will be controlling a three character party. Eventually you will have to swap the party depending on what you are interested in: power, speed and Core(Mana), the game has spells, but you slowly get access to them and will use them more in the later stages of the game. There is also a RNG side to it, as your characters can miss, this is especially frustrating if they are slow. A lot of the combat animations are slow and have to be completed before the next one can start. The enemies, that are not bosses, will chip away at your health usually not doing a lot of damage, but it builds overall, there are 3 exceptions however: enemies that have a strong ability, but are fragile, enemies that have a small chance to cast a devastating spell and Enemies that you should not be fighting at that point in the game (Unless they are undead, then if you heal them you hurt them).The Levels or dungeons are designed in such a way that you explore them completely, unless there is loot, then those sections are “optional”. The game does this by the use of levers that open up the level or colored keys if they want to use multiple levels in a specific order. If you press Tab you get a map of the level, except for the elevated areas. Enemies respawn after you leave a area, with a few exceptions, this is important when you backtrack later in the game, however some enemies can be avoided and they do not level up along with you. The game can be beaten without grinding, but that is up to you. The longer levels will tax your resources a lot, so buying supplies should be a priority before every dungeon.A synopsis of the World in the order you get to visit it: Shell 2 a  post apocalyptic Scrapland. Shell 3 a medieval setting with undead. Shell 5 where 2 advanced countries are at war. Shell 4  The World Bazaar that is a massive equatorial City with bounty hunters, loose women and the lawless. Shell 7 lava, caves, mining operations, poisonous lakes and Mushroom Forests. Shell 6 where pirates live and prosper. Shell 1 where the Chosen, a highly advanced civilization that have mastered bio-technologie have their empire. You will get at least 1 party member from each Shell.There is a lot of lore and interesting characters in this game, but you should experience it for yourself.			"

												Only played a little bit, but has me feeling nostalgic for FF7, yet somehow reminds me of first two fallouts. This is likely because of the menu setups, and the battles take place in the field (no cutscene). This game is not turned based though, and there is a distinct lack of directions when it comes to controls, though some of it is talked about in dialogue. (Hint: double click and hold to run)			"

												tl;dr A dated game with a great story and some glitches. Whether it's worth it is up to you.So this is a complete nostalgia purchase for me. I played the original, liked it, wanted to play it again and here we are. I personally would recommend this game, but know that it is very dated. It comes from an era where games were much simpler and got away with bugs they probably shouldn't have. I have had a bug encounter on my gameplay, but only one and it wasn't game breaking, so not that bad.By today's standards, this game falls short on just about everything except story. The highlight of the game is the over-reaching plot that you discover as you explore and complete the game. Everything else, like the graphics, music, etc are going to fall short by a very good measure.So is this game worth it for you? I can't answer that. I can say that this is a turn-based JRPG with a good story, but not a whole lot else. Where it offers an interesting combat system that isn't the typical standard, by today's standards it would fall flat.Based on when the game came out, I'd rate this a solid 7/10.By today's standards I'd rate this a 3/10.Put them together and you get a 10/10 game... lol jk...But seriously though, if you like old JRPGs and you feel like porting yourself back to the 20th century, then you'll have a good experience. Play it like it's the 21st century and you'll be bored unless you're a huge story person.			"

												I remember playing this off a PS1 demo disc back in the day and being somewhat intrigued but not impressed since FF7 was still a thing. Nowadays i cant stomach jrpg style round based combat anymore but to my surprise sunk quite some hours into this already because it puts a good spin on the formula. Theres the typical ATB system but its kinda like charging up instead of waiting for the bar to fully fill to being able to do something. Theres 3 levels - If you just wanna pop a potion or do a quick weak attack you can do that at the first level which is full usually in like 3 seconds. Second level delivers more oomph and third level delivers major oomph (double and triple with damage bonus else what would be the point of waiting) and all levels also have special attacks available. At the start when theres not many options its still unfortunately a snorefest but when you get more dudes with differing attack strength and charge speed it gets interesting, moreso since its all realtime (it stops when you click your dudes to select actions tho).Also no random battles, you can see all enemies on the map.Graphic style and character design is interesting/weird, like FF7 and Baldurs Gate mashed together - i guess western rpgs needed more anime hair. Simple and sensible story by comparision. Some tedium like multiple treks thru the same frikking cave but thats the nature of the beast prolly.Surpassed my expectations by a long shot.			"

												Update:I nominated this game for Steam's ""I'm not crying..."" tag, as I believe that despite it's age, it looks good, but most of all - the story is not just entertaining, but touching and you really grow to like all your characters and the world they live in.Back to the old review:Septerra Core was one of the few western jRPG clones. It offered great 2D graphics, that look good to this day, very unique world with it's own mythology and many playable NPC characters that were both very unique and likable.I personally put this game higher than any Final Fantsy game that I played, with the exception of FF8 (yep, not FF7 fan) - I'd put it on par.The story is very solid, gameplay is similiar to FF games, it even has summons, but magic system is not copied thankfully, but instead uses mana pool and cards, that (up to 3) characters can combine, to create different effects.If you don't mind anime art style and science fiction setting, I highly recommend this game.I have the originl CD and GoG versions. Also bought Steam version :) It required some tweaking to get it running before, but oddily enough, Steam version now worked without any 3rd party patches. Cool.10/10 for me.			"

												Overall, this is a great game. Full voice acting and impressive graphics for 1999 combine with an exciting story and interesting character development to make a memorable experience. Fans of the early Final Fantasy games should truly enjoy this game.Its biggest flaw is that the combat system can become boring or even tedious after a while. I also found it frustrating that enemy health bars are hidden by default. If either of those bother you too much, there are cheat codes (true to any 90s game) to fix both of those problems.Disclaimer: I played the disk version of this game, and purchased the Steam version because I lost the disk. I've heard rumors of bugs in the Steam version, but I emailed Topware support and they said that they were working to resolve them. I couldn't get it to work at all in Windows 8.1 though.			"

												I played this game long time ago and bought the Steam version only to leave this review.This is an RPG, heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger and maybe some other JRPGs. Very similar turn based battles with combination attacks. Just like in CT, there's a robot character, girl engineer character, etc. But crappy plot/dialogue and insane amount of mind numbing, time consuming backtracking. I attempted to play this game several times, wasted tens of hours, never finished it, deleted after one or another boring fetch quest. And plot.. I can't remember much after all these years, but it involved some evil dude hunting for some macguffin and several characters dying while trying to give my character time to escape. Yes, this dumb cliche scene occured 2 or 3 times through the game.Pre-rendered 2D graphics in 640x480 sure looked nice in 90s, but were already dated at the time of release. Its main competitor, Anachronox, also a CT-inspired western JRPG, looks much better on modern PCs, in addition to simply being better written and more fun. Also suffers from backtracking, but has ""secret"" fast-forward button to make it bearable.And this game.. I would not call it bad, but it isn't Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, Xenogears, Fallout, Baldurs Gate, Planescape Torment, Dark Sun, etc. etc. So many great games, so little time. Why waste it on derivative mediocrity?			"

												Strange (and very uncool) that the version on Steam includes a game-breaking bug whereby the game crashes every time a particular boss does one of its attacks (which you can't win the fight without him doing).  So hunt the 1.4 patch down before playing.  The game is definitely showing its age anyway so not much of a fan anyway - in 5 years gaming has come a loooooong way.			"

												A game I prefer over any final fantasy. It uses a similar turn based system where you need to act when the time meter of a character reaches a certain point (with three degree of strength).What's better than any of the FF is the game world. IT IS SUPER ORIGINAL!They could make a TV series in this universe, especially if they get a good budget like the Game of Thrones series.The story is also nice. There are some problem solving and adventuring too.Buy only if you want to see an original game world or if you like old FF-like games.			"

												I love this game. Going back to old locations with new characters and exploring is rewarded. The RP aspect of this title is outstanding if you enjoy a creative sci-fi world with an environment that responds to your actions. Little things like sound changing and out of place land features make me want to explore more of it. Don't buy this from Steam. Lack of support resulting in broken dialogue and errors that crash the game whilst triggering events makes for a bad experience. Will not get to see what happens when I feed all my birds. Still glad I played this game.			"

												""I got this game for about 80 cents and it lasted me for about 59 hours to finished it.""About 6 years ago i bought an overpriced laptop that turns out to be so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that it can't even play warcraft III without major lag (i'm a dota 1 addict back then.) So i turned to retro gaming on my laptop.I've played a good chunk of classic rpg's ever since then, from classic jrpg such as the original Shin Megami Tensei(with emulator) to western rpg like Planescape Torment (GOG ruulezz!!) This game picked my interest back then. I have it on my wish list but thanks to the surprisingly huge amount of classic games on my playlist i kinda forget about this game. Until a few weeks ago i saw it on Steam's weekly sales only for 8 cents, i bought it without thinking twice.After playing for about 3 hours i REGRET my purchase. The premise and the lore is interesting but the combat is too slow and so boring. It's using ATB gauge similar to FFXIII with weaker moves can be used with one ""stock"" of ATB and stronger moves needs more. Sadly with the animations painfully stiffs and so slow(and useless espescially the summoning animation (Totally pointless.) this makes battle really tedious.Enemies are too fast and too strong or maybe it's the characters that is actually too weak.  Magic is utterly useless. Enemies also appeared on the map, this giving you an illusion of freedom whether to fight them or simply leave them alone. But unfortunately as i played the game it is became apparent that the developer is intending for most of them to be mandatory what with enemies placed in the middle of a small maps making them virtually impossible to ignore. The dungeons aren't too big but enemies are everywhere making the game feels bloated. Puzzles are uninteresting because it's mainly ""switch puzzles."" You know press the switch this door open and that door closed. Enemies also respawn whenever you leave a map, making backtracking very painful. And since this game is a mix of RPG and point n click genre you will be pixel hunting most of the time. Unfortunately some key items and unique items can be missable thanks to this feature. I really recommend you to play the game with a walkthrough to reduce this possibility because a simple backtracking can cost you a good chunk of time.I realized that these problems also exist on most of the games i've played but this time it feels so apparent that the game is so badly made. Maybe because i've been playing modern RPGs on my 3ds lately that i've been unconsciously comparing it with some of them. With these thoughts inside my head i grind my teeth and keep playing the game. And without my realization i've already playing for more than 40 hours. Yep i'm hooked up with this game that i once thought to be pretty bad. For your information this game is progressively getting better as the stories unfold.Dialogue and story becomes more interesting, new characters with unique backgrounds and combat style (there is a character that looks like Xenomorph.) Magic becomes more and more prevalent and when you got the attack all card you will be unstoppable in random battles making the game less tedious. And the mix of point n click genre actually makes the game more interesting and near the middle of the game you are free to go wherever you want to gather clues and doing quests, giving an illusion of freedom. I like that.Overall this is a solid game with good voice acts(i got a boner hearing Maya's voice :v ) but the music is a bit underwhelming and boring. Gameplay is pretty solid but marred with slow paced battles. Graphics is well what you can expect from 1999 game. Oh yeah the overall vibe of the game kinda reminds me of Final Fantasy 7, you know a mix of technology, swords and sorcery but in a less grandiose scale.The reason i thought the game was pretty bad at first is because i didn't have the right mindset when i played. I'm inevitably comparing this game to recently released RPGs. Of course it won't hold. If you are looking for classic rpg and you know what you are getting into i really recommend this game.I give this game a score of  7/10With Final Fantasy 7 an 8/10 :vPS: Play your favorite songs on Steam's music player (Seriously who the hell used that?), read a book or playing Adventure Capitalist while playing this game. It helps to stave off the boredom.			"

												Ok so...I never played this game way back when, so I won't say that I played this out of nostalgia. I never played any of those angled top down point and click games like Diablo, so I won't say I'm familiar with those kind of games. But I love an RPG, especially if it promises to be a great experience!I got this game for $0.64, a good price, especially if you use money you earned by selling cards on the Steam Community Market.The games started out fine, but then I realized that it was missing cutscenes.Don't worry, I fixed it within the hour using these steps: just follow the ""How to get Septerra Core working fully guide"" in the Steam Community, then uninstall the current quicktime program, install the version of quicktime in the Septerra steam folder, set the compatitbility mode of the program to Windows XP (SP2), and open up QuickTime, go to Preferences > QuickTime Preferences > Advanced > Uncheck the three DirectX check boxes. Done!So, back to the actual gameThe graphics look outdated, but for being a game of its time, I can overlook it. The plot is engaging, I like the setting, and the combat, while slow, might speed up later in the game. If you can get this game for a good price and get it to work, I would totally recommend this!

Other than that, put on your nostalgia glasses and go!			"

												I had a faint memory of this game from my childhood. This game made me interested in RPG titles even to the modern ones and old school.Septerra Core is a really old school Fallout RPG, turn based combat with special cards to and more.The graphics are actually not polygons like most people would expect, they are actually handdrawn on a computer like you would do in paint. Wich brings me to the pros of the game.Pros : Awsome graphics, old school RPG, puzzle adventure, good sounds, awsome combat.Downside : Resolution won't go up to 1920*1080, sounds can be annoying at times.Tho the minor downsides i spent LOADS of hours into this game as a child when it first came out.This game is truely an RPG that is worth the money til this day and that it's cheap makes it more fun.Also if you own a TABLET have no fear ! you can play it on your tablet aswell (note IOS can't run it cause they suck)Android tablets can run it without a problem and certain android phones.Just tweak and download this, ready set PLAY on the move.Awsome game if you like old school, if your a new school RPG kid. Don't buy this cause you won't get♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it.			"

												EDIT 4 Oct 2014: I've had some more time to play so I have some new insight. First off, you will NEED a walkthrough. The game does give you precisely zero direction on where your objectives actually are. Second, combat is a CHORE. I find myself dumping as many bonuses as I can into my speed stats just so I can get through it quicker. To be clear, an attack is carried out usually by a combatant jumping toward their attack target, performing their attack animation, then jumping back into their position. This whole time, the entire ATB system stops so you can watch. Combat is structured much like Final Fantasy 13's combat, except far less fluid. You get three action bars, but only one action a turn, and any action you take drains your entire ATB meter. I learned this the hard way. The one thing it does have going for it is that its story is keeping me interested (I do enjoy a good story well told), but combat is going to have to start getting much quicker.------This game is fine but not perfect. I picked it up on sale for a whopping 75 cents and at that price, sure, worth every penny. But then, so are most games.I've been playing it for a little while, but it gives you no instruction on how to play it at all. Opening cutscenes finish and you're just standing there like a dunce.The game is controlled by click-and-holding where you want to go (you can use arrow keys, but...just use the mouse), and your first objective is to get to class.This is me, right now, on that first objective: http://youtu.be/7hR34OGe30I?t=2m14sAt 75 cents, it's a steal. At five bucks...give it some thought.			"

												One of those times, when a game is just too old.  And not just the graphics, it's not suited to run on modern systems, you often face bug glitches and just simply bad UI, extreme lack of option. I can see the feel of Chrono trigger in this, yet it's not close being that good, as an RPG. Characters seem interesting , the plot they are actually in is not presented well, and the fact that game skips half of dialog most of the time, even though the voice acting is quite good. "

												One of those times, when a game is just too old.  And not just the graphics, it's not suited to run on modern systems, you often face bug glitches and just simply bad UI, extreme lack of option. I can see the feel of Chrono trigger in this, yet it's not close being that good, as an RPG. Characters seem interesting , the plot they are actually in is not presented well, and the fact that game skips half of dialog most of the time, even though the voice acting is quite good. "

												Classic game by far.  However, it's somewhat of a pain to get the game to run correctly.  Install the game, manually install Directx and Quicktime from within the Septerra Core install folder, run and install the game as administrator, play the game with your onboard video adapter (right-click desktop and go to ATI/Nvidia control panel depending on what is installed) and select your Intel onboard graphics card to run the main Septerra Core .exe; newer cards will not play cinematics and will always cause seizure-inducing flashes on the screen during gameplay.  Thus, Intel HD Graphics x000 (2000, 3000, etc.) will run SC optimally.  Once the video issues are worked around, the game works awesome.  Happy oldschool Steampunk hunting!			"

												An oldie but a goodie.This is probably one of those classic older games, that while graphics engines are so much better now, and the graphics in new titles are mindblowing, you can still make yourself go back and play this game all over again. A lot of us grew up playing this game as one of our early PC game titles and have created a sentimental bond with it, but it can be just as fun for those who have not played it.While the story being told in the game isn't incredibly long, it immerses the player in several characters lives and feelings, especially towards each other. And as with most games, even back then, your choices bear consequences on the world around you.The combat system is incredibly easy to use and understand, if sometimes a little boring and habit-forming to the point of doing it mindlessly automatic. As well, some of the enemies are all pretty much the same with just a simple skin color modification and higher stats.Still definitely recommend playing it!			"

												This is a standard ATB style turnbased RPG and Combat is Boring.  As.  Heck.  Even once you are well into the game, you will generally not need to use anything other than heals and standard attacks.  This turns all combat into excrutiatingly slow slug-fests that you must struggle through in order to get on with the story.To its credit, the story is not bad.  I was genuinely interested in seeing more of the unique seven-layer world of Septerra Core, and frequently read the ample flavor text provided in the form of library books and other such things.  With this saving grace in mind I pushed on bravely, hoping that at some point new skills and features might make combat less of a pain to sit through, but sadly it was not to be.Don't put yourself through this the way I did.  It's just not worth it.			"

												I can definitely see this game working for the right group of people, a group I am not in.  Some reviews use buzz phrases like ""Final Fantasy"" and JRPG.  No.  Any RPG that doesn't allow controller support ends up with a completely different feel.  It still works, but its much more like Baldur's Gate than Final Fantasy.THe game is dated, obviously, but for the price that can be overflooked.  And the story is interesting enough, but the old RPG conventions and very rigid control style make it a game I can't personally recommend.  There are much better RPGs out there, even for this price.			"

												BadCan't say I'd recommend this game. To my understanding, it's a pretty old game so it is possible to be understanding towards it. However, many parts of this game are simply too frustrating and confusing to make it enjoyable. It only has nostalgia value for those who have played it before. If this game ever gets a remake and its problems are fixed, then I might give it a try again.+ Fairly interesting characters+ Battle music is pretty neat+ Funny robots+/- Story; Nothing really worth mentioning.- HORRID combat pace; You have to watch the characters jump through air, hit the target and then jump back. Half the combat is watching is horrendously long animation. I like the main heroine because she just shoots the enemies.- Very bleak; There's no colour anywhere. Every world is just depressing and gloom. It makes you think you're looking at a post-apocalyptic world when in reality it's not.- Pretty quiet; The game doesn't play music often enough.- Confusing story-telling; The story skips many parts that are required for us to form a complete picture of the story. Having cutscenes would help but they're not there.- Frustrating puzzles; True to the games of old, many of the puzzles are VERY obscure. I needed a walkthrough on many occasions to make any sense of what must be done.If you still insist on giving this game a try, wait until it's on sale.			"

												The story is ok from what I played, the leveling is standard, it runs on Win XP/Win 7, but the battle system is horrendous.  The reviews out there are right.  The battles, which is a HUGE chunk of any JRPG-style game, needs to be solid.  The biggest problem is that it's so slow.  Painfully slow to the point you will start to dread each encounter.  In short, you have to wait, and wait for your attack gauge to fill up for a more powerful attack.  Meanwhile, you're being hit repeatedly by the enemy, in very slow and poor animations.  When you attack, you miss often, and also have a slow and poor animation.  By the time I had fought a dozen battles, I didn't want to deal with them anymore.  I could go on about some of the redeeming qualities I noticed, such as the solid music, some witty dialogue, and the overall premise of the game, but it's all completely crippled by the battle system.  You might want to see what happens next, but I struggled to push through the awful fighting and get there.To note, I'm 30 yrs old and have been playing RPG's since the original Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy.  I love those games.  I do not love this game.  I expected better.			"

												This game isn't up to date and is riddled with bugs such as dialog skipping. It also decides that the game must be in German. Sorry my Steam client isn't in German, it's in French, can you please be reasonable and default to English? Buy if you want to fiddle endlessly to make it work... or do like I ended up doing and just get the GOG version: they actually care about selling games that work.Edit: I realized I also owned the game on GOG, so I played that. Now I can recommend the game even less: I've never seen a JRPG with such boring fights. Slow animations, slow refilling action meter, low damage/high health enemies... just stay away if you know what's good for you.			"

												***Some spoilers here***I can't believe people here who said the voice acting is amazing in this game. No, it's not. It's soulless and cheesy, along with the entire script itself.When I played this game as a kid I liked it very much. As of now, I understand why it never made big. That's because it sucks. The main character is unlikable and unappealing. Actually, no character is likable in this game other than the robot dog Runner. Also, I find a lot of things very cheesy in the game, one example being Led's father's bad decision. What you expect to happen is him listening to his daughter. When he refuses and leaves, he also puts men on the bridge to stop anyone from coming, including his daughter. I laughed when I saw this fight; a general is ready to nuke an entire continent to protect his daughter from harm and he'll stop at nothing, he'll even let his men throw grenades at her if she tries to stop him.What a joke. Not worth a penny.			"

												WORST GAME EVER!first off, never wrote a review before on steam, but this game sucks soooooo much, i had to.  I played this game, about 15 years ago, when it was awesome!  saw steam had it, and i was filled with nostalgic joy...yippy!  But it sucks!!  the first monster i fought, had 7 turns to my 1 turn....that didnt end well as i died, then the game crashed and i had to restart my pc for it to work again.  So then i think maybe that was some bad luck, or a glitch or something, so i try it again, fight another monster, he attacked me 14 times, i never had a turn because i died.  then of course, the game crashed.  only played it for 30 mins, and it was the worst 30 mins of my life.  I remember this game being the greatest most fun thing on a disk.  but here....its a broken piece of crap.  save your money, pet a pig at a zoo or something.

												I tried very hard to enjoy this game. I put in a good amount of time just to make sure I wasn't missing anything. The truth is, for a turn-based RPG, this game is simply boring. The effort is there, but it isn't enough. The plot has potential, but in the 10+ hours I played, it went nowhere and felt forgettable. The combat has potential, but ultimately falls flat due to terribly long and uninteresting animations and enemy spam causing gameplay to almost totally stop sometimes (I'm looking at you, zombies). I suppose that's what this all boils down to is spoiled potential. The game is quite old now, and maybe back then it might have held up since there was still discovering to be had within the genre, but with games like Legend of Dragoon close to this game's release, it just doesn't compare. If you think you'd like this game, play Dragoon or Final Fantasy instead. You'll have a much better time.			"

Make your journey to get the Knights of the Round materia so every fight is a big pushover and presents no real challenge throughout the game.Joking aside Septerra Core is a very flawed release.There are virtually no options to speak of, control is just a choice between the input lag of the keyboard controls or the awkward clicking at all times of the mouse controls, crashes VERY often (played for only a few minutes and it crashed twice), dialogue cuts off before it's finished every other time words are spoken, Voice acting is terrible (It's from 1999 this is to be expected). If you are going to make money off of releasing a 15 year old game, at least update it so it works on modern PCs.			"

												This is one of those games. I was welcomed by an extremely low resolution fullscreen. After this pleasant surprise it stopped responding and woudln't close. I had to foce a restart to get things back to normal. Oh and when the computer rebooted, a Quicktime Player icon had magically appeared on my desktop.I can't really speak on the quality of the actual gameplay since I didn't get that far. If you, unlike me, are willing to bear a fullscreen 640x480 resolution with weird behaviors and crashes for the sake of playing an obscure RPG, then by all means go ahead. From a technical perspective, this is a monumental piece of garbage that should be banned from Steam, along with every other game which isn't made for computers that came out after 1995.			"

												i cant recommend this game. few reasons why. 1 is the look of it. it looks like it was made for the PS1. and no that is not a good thing seeing as PS1 games  look far better.  this game came out in 1999 when the PS2 was coming around.  in fact final fantasy 8 looks better then it and it came out the same year. 2 is the play style. u use either the mouse or arrow keys to move. no WASD here. 3 is the combat or should i say lack there of. its not cause combat is turned base. thats not why i hate it. i hate it cause its dull boring and very very repeatitive. 4 is the story. or i should say what story? its about stopping some war from taking place and you have to find artifacts or something. i dont know it was hard to keep track. 5 is the dialogue. its nice they got professional voice actors but the text moves so fast that its hard to keep up. and no there is no way to turn of the text. so over all i give this game a 2/10.

If I hadn't have found a youtube video, I never would have even figured out how to attack. Also, the game would skip some dialogue. Glitches galore.

												The game lacks any kind of tutorial - the player is told to go to a certain place but _where_ that place is and how to get there, there isn't a single pointer. Had to google it after wandering around on all of the small explorable area and still not finding it, the key was to click on a totally unmarked area on the ""map"".The cutscenes are missing because of the ""too modern"" QuickTime version (according to other players on the support sites) and the audio is weirdly clipped off the end of the character's lines. The battle doesn't seem to work, enemies just slowly kill the character while the player can't do a g*ddamn thing, there isn't any option to attack or do anything else in battle.I don't know why Steam releases games that just don't work on today PCs...

												I will admit this game looks and feels great!, I am a willing to go so far as to say that the animation is WAY higher than games of it's time, I am a fan of old classic RPG's but honestly this game sucks I havent even made it into a single battle yet and gotten bored very easily, I watched walkthroughs to see what the game was like, it looked good so I had my Friend get it for me now I wish it was Postal 2 instead the dialog is barely gripping enough to follow and spent more then a half-hour trying to figure out how to save my damn game......that was until I realized that there is very litteraly no way to save your game, I'm not kidding there is NO SAVE FUNCTION IN THIS GAME!, I would have been happy enough just to find a random battle or at the very least have the option to save my friggin game, I mean no disrespect to the programmers but honestly this game sucks Hell even ""Big-Rigs Over the Road Racing"" is more entertaining for those out there looking for a good game to start with start with Final Fantasy 7 than buying this crap if this game was toilet paper I would not even let the Iraqis Wipe there butt with it,EVEN IF THEY WANTED TO WILLINGLY I'd feel too sad for them			"

												So I didn't grow up with this game, but overall still fun. Satisfied with the purchase even without the nostalgia.Story 4 of 5- Good plot, a cool world and intersting enough to make me binge play although it could have had a better flow.  At times it almost rushes the plot, at others you are watching paint dry.  Similar feel of other nostalgic games, Final Fantasy, Chrono trigger, ect.Battles 3.5 of 5- Unique style, but limited customization probably due to the age of the game.  Only thing I didn't like was that battles took so freakishingly long to do, character animations included it made battles way too long.Characters 4 of 5- Good job with what they had to work with back then.  You definately find your favorites pretty quick.As far as all these comments mentioning glitches? I haven't run into a single one, back in the day these games took something called 'patience'  for things to load up and looks like people are taking them as glitches.  Sometimes your character won't walk to where you click it... probably because where you clicked isn't ""movable space to walk on"".  This is normal and it might make your character walk in the opposite direction.  Not a glitch.Also, if you are expecting the game to spoonfeed what to do next, forget it.  This is when games took thought, no fight tutorial, and no hints on what to do next.  It's all on brains and sheer stubborness to beat the game.Overall: would buy again			"

												This is a very enjoyable game.  I have reached Shell 7 for the first time.  I like the combat mechanics, having to choose how to attack and with how much power.  I am still learning how to combine magical attacks to maximize the damage, but it seems to follow a pattern that makes sense.Proslikeable party members.  Each has a background, although, not always compatable with every other party member.The combat system rewards paying attention to the situation and previous encounters with the same or similiar enemies.Logical puzzles, there have not been any combine the wax candle with the brandy and ice cream to open the locked door.ConsNone that are not related to the release date.  Even then, the graphics are better than many of the new indie games being released on Steam today.Give this game a chance and embrace the combat system.			"

												Outdated and GLITCHY but fun.  Worth working through the glitches and bugs.

The voice recordings are not particularly good, either.  Conversation with NPCs and party members is done by static head images with dialogue windows.  Battle is turn-based with a timer for each player; a level 2 action means a longer wait than a level 1 action.

												Has ages well and is still among the great PC-games to use as a benchmark (at least for me). It requires about as much time to complete as a part of the Final Fantasy series, the characters are well made and not just flat stereotypes (we know as there is character interaction on events - and special events with 2 specific characters at special places. Exploring and getting all those nice sidequests can keep you active for hours - highly recommended!			"

												How should I begin to review this gem?Septerra Core is an old game with outdated graphics. I love the game because of its storyline. It is about a world with seven rotating shells. In the middle of all these shells is the Core, which contains a hidden power. Each shell resides different types of people. The furthest shell from the Core belongs to the Chosen Ones. One of the Chosen General has decided to harness the power of the Core for his own. You are Maya. Together with your companions, you will try to stop the General and bring balance to all seven shells.Battle is somewhat turn-based with a twist. You can activate which power level for your characters. Maya can choose any two companions before entering a battle, somewhat similar to other Japanese-type games. The game duration is surprisingly quite long for an old game.100% satisfaction. "

												This JRPG style game isn't bad but it's held back by several flaws.THE GOOD : the voice acting for the main characters, especially Maya is outstanding. The spell cards are fun to combine and the graphics for the time are pretty good. The character models aren't the best but I did like the backgrounds and lighting effects. What music is there is good although there's mainly over world and battle themes. Dungeons are generally silent. Sound effects are pretty good as well and satisfying to hear. The story isn't bad either. Sometimes you have to bring a certain character to an NPC to get them to say something specific or get a key item. Think about which character might be useful with a certain NPC or on what shell. Your battle attack/spells have 3 levels of power leading to some strategy involved. Enemies can potentially be bypassed as in games like Earthbound and Chrono Trigger and there are no random battles, enemies are on screen almost always.THE BAD: The dungeons get monotonous really fast, mainly because it's mostly about flipping switches to open doors that often lead to more switches. You're either opening doors or making new pathways and at the end you find a key item or fight a boss. Then you have to usually backtrack out of the dungeon manually which can get annoying if you just want to get out of there and don't care about exp and gold. An option to teleport out would have been helpful. There's also a lot of backtracking, and clues to what needs to be done next can sometimes be confusing to figure out. Again, bringing the right character along on the right shell can be a big help in this aspect. Another major glaring problem for me was the slow animations during battle and the sound effects often took even longer, still playing even when the animations were done. This is especially a problem with the zombie enemies. I found myself using machine gun characters when I could, just because their attacks are faster. Characters take one turn at a time or combine turns during spells. You can't input commands usually until the character is done with their attack or spell/item usage unlike say a Final Fantasy game. This stuff is a bigger problem during the first half of the game, once you get a spell card that lets you attack all enemies it helps cut down on this some, but it's still a problem. I found myself running away from battles towards the end, just to get to the end of the game. Overall I enjoyed Septerra Core for the voice acting and story/setting. The battle system isn't BAD as an idea, and the card concept is neat, it's just feels slow as heck, at least for me. The switch flipping and backtracking got on my nerves fast. If the battle system was just faster, I might not have minded the rest, because that's mainly what made the dungeons more of a chore than anything else. If you're the patient type you might find the battles less grating than I did. I got it on sale here for a buck so it was worth the price. I'd give Septerra Core a 7/10. I'm going to overall recommend the game. Just be aware of the issues above if you decide to play.			"
