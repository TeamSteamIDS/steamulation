												Note: My play time on Steam is NOT what I determined this review with. I played before it came to Steam.First off my guild(The Oran'Thul) was personally contacted by the devs of Echo of Soul to test the game. This is an unbiased, truthful review of the game.Let me start by saying I plan to give this game a negative review. Now that's not saying its terrible and its not worth playing, but for those who take their MMOs seriously and competitively, you are going to want to steer clear of this one.Echo of Soul at its core is a pretty decent MMO, entertaining pve and pvp. It does not stand out from the rest of the MMO's but for the features it does have, it does do them pretty well.The MAJOR issues that this game suffers from is pretty much what plagues every other MMO that has been released for the past few years.1. PAY TO WIN.This is a MAJOR issue for those who wish to play MMOs competitively and take their MMOs seriously. This game comes from Aeria games, for those of you who have played their games before you most likely are not surprised to hear that this game is P2W.2. BALANCE ISSUES.My god.....my guild and I looked past the pay to win issue in this game and said ""meh its an MMO to kill time with"". When we got into the battlegrounds....  the balance...MY GOD THE BALANCE!!!!The issue became apparent when we were still low levels, so we brushed it off as a balance issue at lower level pvp. As we leveled the issue became much...MUCH worse.There are currently 5 classes in the game, 3 are nearly unplayable vs the other 2. Can you guess who the underpowered ones are? As always, its the melee. The sorceress and the Archer are disgustingly overpowered to the point that you shouldn't even bother pvping at all as a melee.3. CHANNEL SYSTEMThe channel system...the bane on all open world MMOs. For those of you who dont know what a channel system is....here is a quick explanation.A channel system is pretty much a way to take one server and break it up into a ton of mini servers. This allows the developers to spread out a congested world so players arent overcrowding everything to the point that there are no mobs to kill and you cant move an inch without being ganked. There is a right way, and a wrong way to implement a system like this. Echo of Soul does it the wrong way.As you progress through the game you are constantly entering little instance portals, this hurts the game as you get the feeling that the world is not an open worlds, its just a bunch of mini instances smashed together with load screens between each of them. When you enter these portals you are thrown into a random channel of that specific zone.For instance...FOREST ZONE (CHANNEL 2) --> CAVE ZONE (CHANNEL 4)As you can see above, when you progress from one zone to another you are thrown into a random channel. This may be packed full of players, or have none at all.This really destroys the feeling of being in an open, growing world filled with players.In addition this absolutely KILLS world pvp. My guild and I found it nearly impossible to join a friend in a channel to participate in world pvp becuase the channel was filled.Lastely this also allows players to leave the channel to run away from potential pvp.This truly makes for a babies MMO and anyone serious about their MMOs should stay away.-------------------------------------------------------Some cash shop items.-------------------------------------------------------Instant ressing on spot.4% attack damage buff4% defense buff30% increased pvp currencymounts that have a lower chance to be knocked off of when received damage.amnesia = respec (you only get ONE for free....ONE)EXP AND GOLD GAIN DOUBLED FOR 24 HOURS.Digestant = Allows you to use an incredible amount of rediculously powerful food buffs.Appraisers Pouch = Reroll stats on a piece of gear to obtain the one that suits you best.AND THE WORST MOST PAY TO WIN CRAP IN THE GAMESAFEGUARD = PREVENTS A JEWEL FROM BEING DESTROYED WHEN ENHANCEMENT FAILS. - This right here.And in Addition...ENHANCEMENT BOOSTER = INCREASE THE CHANCE FOR A SUCCESFULL ENHANCEMENT.Jewels are single BEST way to increase your gear. You know those MMOs where you can increase a piece of gear from +1 to +5 without failing then anything from +6 to +9 has a chance to downgrade then anything above +9 has a chance to break the piece of gear?Well these jewels are that in a nutshell. A player with +10 gems in every slot can easily kill 5 players at the same time if those players have no gems.If you continue to use this item and shovel heaps and heaps of money into the cash shop. YOU. WILL. BECOME. A. GOD. It may take you $1000, or maybe $2000, but if you throw enough money at this game YOU WILL BE UNTOUCHABLE.Here, enjoy some links.http://cms-content.s.aeriastatic.com/92659e831f6a71673aaff2e483503276/files/eos/image/F/FarmpackEN.jpghttp://cms-content.s.aeriastatic.com/c4d3f6851764005cc00e8f558f711bb6/files/eos/image/2/2-Safe-23.jpghttp://cms-content.s.aeriastatic.com/388506da8cdc0bf28698113eee760cb3/files/eos/image/1/10-EN1-230.jpghttp://cms-content.s.aeriastatic.com/3a9742e1df1c8bcfe89e4e9225c2cc76/files/eos/image/p/pvppackhero.jpghttp://cms-content.s.aeriastatic.com/5e5fe0eed44ce71da5e09675f95a3355/files/eos/image/4/401-AppraisersPouch50WM.jpghttp://cms-content.s.aeriastatic.com/d4924c57c4fcc6da8c3fb528e42e4b7a/files/eos/image/1/101-Amnesia.jpgSource: Their cash shop page: http://echoofsoul.aeriagames.com/itemmall/FeaturedAll in all, its not too bad for casual MMO players.I give it a MEH out of a possible BON QUISLO			"

												I would like to start by saying I havn't tried the PvP side of the game and doubt i will, its just not my thing so I will leave that for people that play that way to comment on that side of things, so that said i will comment on the PVE side which is the way I play my main MMo's (WoW, FFXI, FFXIV and Rift).I've found this nice fun, easy to play and learn, although im not through to end game content yet Im still questing through and leveling my mage I am finding it nicely paced and not too rushed. If you play other mmo's ou'll find the quests are of the usual variety collect X of this, kill Y of those monsters, one feature i do like and wish a few others would pick up and incorperate into thier games is that not only do the quests show on the mini map each quest has a little arrow and distance marker beside it showing where to go and how far it is, nice touch thanks, quest text is clear and easily readable and understandable and also conveys the game lore without it being bashed over your head with it.The single player dungeons are also a nice touch aswell, it gives you  the chance run off do a dungeon without having to hang around either waiting for a group finder to get a group for you or you tring to PUG a group, the instances are not insainely difficault and can be done with quest dropped items and also give good rewards without spending ages to finish   there are some simple tactics to each boss which are easy to pick up and learn, and the usual rule applies ""Dont stand in the Fire"".To the big question being as it is free to play is it pay to win?   As far as PVE goes not really, you can get boosts and safegaurds to your crafting and things of that fayre but most of the pay for items I've seen so far are vanaty Items and these can be perchased in game from merchants with gold and silver anyway.Conclusion...Would i recommend this game to other people? Yes, it makes an ideal starter MMo for people comming into the genre its not overly complicated and everything is explained for you, its not as ""grindy"" as some i could mention and has a nice pace to it. It does not have the cutting edge graphics that some of the latest MMo's have so can be played on an average  PC or Laptop which is no bad thing, not everyone can afford a top end gaming rig. For an experienced MMo player like myself i found it a nice change, everone one i've spoken to in game has been friendly and helpfull which is nice and bodes well for the in game community as a whole. While this will never replace my main MMo's its also not going to be left out either.			"

												I definitely recommend this game!As a ex-hardcore wow player, I would like to share my thoughts on this game as well.I played this game as a rogue through CBT and the OBT!Let me give you an honest feedback about this game1. Creating a character is a little bit weird since you have  gender locked  classes. Beside that: The options to customize your character are really nice! I'm very happy with the way my char looks!2. Graphics: The game will not deliver the best graphics in history but its decent for a f2p. Not everybody can afford to have a BiS computer. It can reach a wider audience and attracts more players.3. First Steps: The game basically supports you in every possible way.  Quests to introduce the dungeon browser, pvp browser and so on. 4. Questing: Of course its the usual Search X and deliver it to Y, Kill X amount of Y but there are other quests as well. I'm not positively surprised but also not disappointed. 5. PvP: You can clearly feel, that the game is made for Characters who reached level 60. You can join the pvp battle as soon as you hit level 10 (with an outstanding matchmaking system) and you most likely get owned by people who have a higher level than you. You resistance and HP are pumped up to level 60 standard but you can obviously not compete with your level 10 gear and skillset. Nevertheless, I was able to get the mvp (best player in the team) a lot of times when i was between level 10 and 40. The PvP is not necessarily innovative but it gives a ton of xp, and is really fun. Even though you are a melee and not level 60.I also dont get why people complain about (always the same). They took the best content of other games and implemented it here. Its a nice combination of my favourite MMOS.6. PvE: I really really like the Single Dungeon System and the grouping is amazing as well. You can match groups or go alone. One criticism: The leader can just kick people for whatever reason. If you dont have the super awesome gear, you get kicked in most of the times. On the other hand: It helps a lot to not wipe infinitely and if you dont have good gear, get some. There are tons of ways to farm good stuff in the game and i dont speak about cashing in.7. p2w?: Yes and No! Of course, this is a f2p title and some paid features give you some kind of advantage. I think, Aeria wants to make things different here and when I compare this Launch to Aura Kingdom back in the days, I can clearly say, that this here is totally different. I never had the feeling that I have to spend money. Questing was always flawless, never an artificial blocker which annoyed me or forced me to buy an xp boost. There are tons of free events which give me some nice goodies. Im pretty okay with the fact that people who spend money get some benefits since they are keeping the service alive!Summary: There are pros and cons but eventually the game is a lot of fun to play, even without paying!The game is not really ""free"". Paying users get some benefits but they dont have an impact on the fairness in game. You can achieve everything without paying in a reasonable time. Its just like a p2p mmo but paying users get a small advantage. Pretty fair imo.			"

												Liked:-Simple, UI pretty easy to navigate-Tutorial wasn't overbearing, things are explained decently-Outfits/gear peices were cute without being overly nude-Gems are per slot. Emerald? Goes in belt slot and so on. -Log in bonus, gives some interesting stuff. XP buff for 7 days, other varies things from the cash shop/found in-game.-End of the first 7 days logging in every day get a faster then ""generic"" mount. Means EVERYONE gets it, not who spent cash.-Classes are pretty basic with ""talents and a path"" to chose from.-Not overly complex coming from class/talent choices. Makes for easier understanding.-Every class gets a dodge/teleport out of AOE/trouble usuable on a short cooldown.-You can be farely close to a mob without aggroing it, making it easy to travel from location to location-Emotes are unique with some thought placed into their animations-If you get a quest you need to kill 4 monkeys, you kill the first monkey and the marker will move to the next ""Monkey"" so you're not easily lost questing-In big quest hub/major city there is a quest guy who will send you to your next questing location via a map teleport, if you're ever lost.-PVP is kind of fun, normally not my kind of thing but for a game with no healers, it makes for a stand your ground type thing.Dislike-Profession system isn't clearly explained-Gender Locking-The Voice Acting, what little there was.-Some of the story feels a bit scattered, all over the place-The Cash Shop doesn't really have a whole lot in it, no dangly carrot to make me WANT to spend money...just two quests kind of introducing the Cash Shop (If you're interested in doing them, you need to drop cash or you can easily ignore the two quests)-It can be poorly optimized in areas-Graphics are pretty but lacking in feeling-Quest text can easily be ignored by pressing F (The function with everything in-game Key) and opening the map to find the number you need/are working on.-The ""eating/food"" buff has NO explanation, it's kind of a stumbled upon fact.-PVP maps not explained, just dumped in.-Incredibly tiny player base.Overall, I'd recommend this as a fun little game. I am not a big supporter on the publisher they chose to go with, but the game is fun. It's got some seriously good potential if the developers take the time and put some serious polish on it. I can't say it's better then anything, the game is very generic and lacks the oomph needed to get it out there with other major MMORPG contenders, but for a niche random choice, it's decent.			"

												How to begin with Echo of Soul...I suppose to begin, I'm gong to give my rating on this game:  8/10 (reserving judgment due to the status of the game being Open Beta) => RECOMMENDEDI've had a bit of a love-hate relationship with Aeria Games since I first became a member in 2008.  Echo of Soul is the third of their published games which I've played for more than 2 days.  In fact, I've been playing this game since their Open Beta launch on June 1st.  But this isn't about my history with others of Aeria's games, this review is about this one in particular.  Let's begin, shall we?=====CHARACTER CREATION=====The first thing you'll notice about Echo of Soul is that there are a total of five classes (thus far) to choose from.  These classes are gender-locked, and each class has two spec mastery paths.  The gender lock is there to follow with the game's storyline.  The classes you can choose from are as follows:1.  Male Warrior2.  Male Rogue3.  Female Guardian (Lancer, for those familiar with Tera)4.  Female Mage5.  Female ArcherAs you will begin to notice, there is no dedicated healing class.  More on this later.Each class has different customization options available to further make your character unique in physical appearance.  You then start off with a default costume (I can assume this to be random from a small pool, as I've created different characters of the same class, and ended up with differing clothing looks from the get-go.)=====LEVELING=====Leveling in Echo of Soul is very much geared toward the casual player.  For the hardcore speedlevelers, it's possible to make it from levels 1 to 60 (current cap, at time of review) in a matter of 1-3 days through the game's PvP Battlegrounds (accessible starting at level 10.)  For the more casual player, you can still make it to 60 relatively quickly or you can take your time with it.  Moderate-speed casual players can make it inside of a week.  Slow casuals can make it to cap in abotu 2 weeks of gameplay time.Both PvP and PvE Questing offer a very generous amount of EXP, so reaching cap is entirely on how you want to do it.  You can go solely as a Battlegrounds resident, through the PvE story, or mix it up a bit.  For the best leveling experience, I would recommend doing either PvP or PvE (depending on which one you want to stick to primarily) just to try it out.Grinding mobs in the overworld will provide very little in the way of EXP.  Grinding overworld mobs is an easy option to obtain enhancement jewels, crafting ingredients, or even some crafting recipes.  If you wish to do PvE grind for EXP, then your best bet would be to do so in the dungeons.  Though, grinding out the dungeons might not be a bad idea, as the sub and main bosses can provide your character with class-specific equipment sets to further enhance your stats and abilities.  There is also the option to take repeatables in maps called Infinite Hunting Grounds which also reward a fair amount of EXP per turn-in.=====ECONOMY=====There are a couple of things which new players will find out relatively quickly:1.  Mobs do not drop money.2.  Items from NPC vendors are really cheap.This means it will be relatively difficult to make solid gold before your 50-60 level bracket.  I would assume it to be a tactic by the developers to maintain a relatively strong pre-endgame economy.  With that being said, there is no restrictions on the amount of in-game gold you can carry in difference to those at level cap.  If you wish to make some quick major gold for your earlier levels, your best bet would be to utilize the cash shop and in-game auction board.As I have not hit level cap, as of yet (I'm a -very- slow player, and have taken more time to get to know the forum community due to my work/sleep schedules) I will not post a comment on endgame economy.=====QUESTING=====PvE questing is quite linear, and very story-based.  While you do get a vast amount of miscellaneous quests (both overworld and dungeon) the magic of PvE questing truly shines with the story-based quests.  As with most typical MMORPGs, you get EXP, money, and the occasional piece of gear to upgrade your set.  However, it's also relatively easy to outlevel some of these quests, but the EXP you gain from some of the lower-level quests is still quite generous.=====Player-versus-Player=====Echo of Soul offers two types of PvP:  Battlegrounds and Open-World Guild vs Guild.  Let's expand, shall we?Currently, there are two Battlegrounds maps (both accessible starting at level 10.)  Both are points-based Capture the Flag-esque types.  One requires teams to capture resources spawned on the map, and the other requires teams to capture and hold towers for as long as possible.  The actual player-kill aspect of these battlegrounds can be quite hectic and fast-paced.  There are also two tiers of Battlegrounds- one for Levels 10-59, and one exclusively for Level 60.Open-World GvG takes place between guilds which have declared themselves to be hostile.  Players in hostile guilds are fair game to be PK'd at any time, anywhere by other hostile guilds' members.  Guildless and Peaceful-alligned guild players do not have to worry about being randomly PK'd while running around the overworld maps.There is also a PvP event (run at least daily) called Valhalla.  Since I have yet to participate in this event, I cannot write a review about it.=====CRAFTING=====Like the rest of the game, crafting is geared toward the more casual player.  Relatively cheap and brainless, it's fairly easy to level both a profession and the two hobby crafting skills available in a short amount of time.  Certain tiers of crafting require certain character levels to be obtained.  Beginner-level crafters can gain most of their supplies directly from their crafting vendor.  However, there does come a time where some mob grinding is required to get higher level base materials.=====UNIQUE FEATURES=====1.  Echo of Soul has a hunger system.  This is determined by two values:  Energy and Satiety.  The higher your current energy level is to your max, certain buffs are applied to your character.  You increase energy by eating foods which are crafted or obtained as quest rewards.  Satiety is how much food you can eat.  With a max value of 1,000 and each piece of food taking up 200 Satiety, this leaves you with a maximum of 5 food waten at a time.  Satiety can be decreased over time, or with the use of a Digestant item.  Energy is depleted through the use of skills.2.  The Soul System:  Through daily rewards or killing of mobs, you can obtain what's called ""Chaos Souls.""  When purified (either near a purification point, or cooperatively with another player) these souls can grant you charges for temporary buffs.3.  The Cash Shop:  While most free-to-play MMOs out there have a cash shop which is mostly geared to be pay-to-win, Echo of Souls isn't geared that way.  Mostly asthetics or RNG fun, there is literally nothing on the cash shop which you are required to get to advance in the game, or gain a significant advantage.  The things on the shop which seem that way are literally a pay-to-be-lazy mechanic.4.  No Dedicated Healer Class:  The entire party works as a team to heal!=====THE BADS=====1.  There is no general server chat channel.  Primary communication is done at either close-range, through the use of the Loudspeaker items, or on the map-specific Shout channel.  Unless you get yourself into an active guild, or are part of a different chat system (i.e. Teamspeak) prepare to be playing mostly in blisful chat silence towards you.2.  Your other Typicals:  Elitists, gold spammers, and general complaining doomsday naysayers.=====TL;DR=====If you're a casual gamer looking for a casual game which you can level relatively easily without getting too far behind the curve, then Echo of Soul is a good pick for you!

												Gave it a try in the closed beta. Wasn't impressed. Gave it another try now it's on steam. Still not impressed. Character creation is seriously lacking with very few options. And gender locks exist on the classes... for some reason.  The controls are wonky, and the animation and graphics, while not really bad, don't exactly stand out as amazing either. Add onto that the fact that Aeria Games - a company that has proven many times in the past they will sink incredibly low to milk money from players - is the publisher, and I think i'll stay well away.

												If you've played a lot of MMO's like I have, there is nothing special about this game. I tried to get myself into this one but just couldn't. It's your basic ""run here, kill that/gather this"" kind of game. But it's a descent MMO non the less... just, nothing new from all the other ones out there.			"

												What made me quit after only 2 hours after reaching ~lvl 13 were only these three things:- generic quests ""get that""/""kill that"" with only the numbers of things to kill or to gather increasing- travelling ways are divided into small areas by warps. sometimes interrupted by a bigger map with more to do. doesn't feel contemporary - as do the overall graphics and limited character creation options (look/races/...)- Quests that tell me to buy something for real money to complete are simply a NO GO and tell me that I shouldn't play this gameI don't know and don't care if this game is a fair free to play title or pay 2 win.In the end it's just not good - and I don't recommend it.

												Stopped playing after I reached level 20. It's not a bad game but it's nothing but ""go kill 3-5 of those monsters""and ""go collect 3-5 of this plant"" back-to-back non-stop. The game makes you think you're not grinding monsters like crazy by giving you low quantity kill/collect requirements per quest. But once I got an achievement for completing a 100 quests I realized I've been doing nothing but killing and collecting stuff. >_>There was never any need to party up with someone. Party quests were easily soloed and I noticed the LFG system said here was ONLY 1! party dungeon at level 35 and the rest were all level 60. So much for multiplayer..EDIT:So I managed to grind through to 60. God save my soul! The endgame is pretty much a continuation of the leveling process. Daily quests that have you kill 100 mobs just to get some healing potions (which cost a ton if you just buy them at the merchant). You can only do a party dungeon 4 times per week! And you get a lock out if your party leaves at the start of the dungeon if they see your gears sucks. I did the completed the first lvl 60 dungeon only ONCE! The other 3 entrees just got wasted because people left. T_T			"

												So after playing sevral hours of this game i can give it about a 5/101: Lack of early content, Thier isint much to do untill you reach level 60, as there is only 2 party dungeons before that soo your left grinding Single dungeons or doing infinate hunting ground quests over.andover. and over untill your level 602: The PvP Balence is horrible, although they did a wonderfull job balanceing the level difference in the battlefield some classes are just way to strong2.1 Garudian: This is a nice class to PvP With as its not to strong or weak in the battlefield-Balenced2.2 Warrior: I feel like this class is actually a bit weak in the battlefield and doesnt hold a big if any presence-Underpowered2.3 Mage: Shes squishy and kinda annoying to deal with , with all of her slows and can do a bit of ranged damage but is well balanced2.4 Rouge: The rouge Has so many stuns that he can litterarly kill you before your unstunned, -Slightly Overpowered2.5 Archer: Oh ho ho... here comes the worst one of them all ... THE ARCHER is ridiculously strong Most of the time 1 Archer Can hold THIRTY PERCENT of her teams damage in a 15v15 Match She litterarly TRIPPLES The Dps of the other Damage classes and on top of that she has Escapes Knockbacks Sleeps And stuns! High level archers can actually Brawl with melee classes in close range.- OverpoweredThe problems with PvP Wouldent be that bad if the game gave you more things to do on your way to level 60. other then  doing the same quest over and over and over and...*Snore*			"

												If I could give sort of a mixed opinion about this game, I would. It's one thing to say this game is bad, but it's not that great either.For the most part, Echo of Soul plays out like your average tab-target MMO where you go around questing, leveling, etc. What separates this game from its other competitors is its focus on its endgame content, which happens at level 60. The entry barrier for getting to 60 is pretty low and you'll find the path to leveling is pretty simple. However, the moment you hit 60, you'll feel like you're starting at level 1 again. You have to grind your way up the gear ladder just to be able to run party dungeons efficiently, and PVP is not exactly a good option entering level 60 due to a number of powerful players.This is all due to the game's inherent jewel system. The idea of jewels was pretty neat when you're introduced to it around level 15. These jewels enhance your stats and can be combined to form stronger jewels, which can be inserted into sockets on your equipment. While the jewels had a chance to break after a certain point, the game gave you a decent amount of jewels as you leveled, so there was always a steady form of progression in the form of jewels and gear. However, this was all thrown out the window and slows to a halt at level 60, mainly due to the game's separation of jewels into two tiers: dull (used from levels 1-59) and lucid (used at level 60). A fresh player will enter level 60 feeling much weaker than before, as the enemies' power suddenly spikes up as you're forced to trudge through this initial stage of endgame and progression slows down considerably.The biggest problem here is time. As you play, you WILL get everything you need, but that depends on how much time you're willing to invest. Without friends or a nice guild helping you out, you're pretty much stuck grinding some boring dungeons until you can get more these lucid jewels for upgrading your character. The cash shop has a few time-savers that more serious players would consider investing into, from safeguards to prevent jewels from breaking when upgrading and pets that can loot items for you. I do recommend trying to play without spending on these premium items, as they're pretty unnecessary if you can play smart and try to be as self-sufficient as possible.Other than my personal gripe with lucid jewels and the beginning of level 60, the PVE gameplay is pretty good. Questing from 1-59 was a breeze for me and once I managed to gather up some gear at level 60, the party dungeons have been fun to run through thanks to the dungeon mechanics keeping players in check. PVP from 1-59 can be pretty fun and has normalized stats to keep it in check, but I suggest staying away from level 60 PVP unless you manage to gather a lot of lucid jewels.If you're looking for a decent F2P MMO like WoW, EoS might be a good game to check out, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.

												EoS is my first review :)[+] awards for login[+] good navigation[+] help menu[+] nice soundtrack[+] free mounts[+] classpath to choose[+] nice outfits/hats etc.This game gives fun. It's not tiring.[+/-] a lot of work with the professions (alchemy etc.)[+/-]  food system - decrease hunger (mp too) - a large hunger=low attack[+/-] drop costs 1s (in npc stores; in EoS is broker so you can sell it more expensive than 1s)[-] a limited number of slots at broker [-] little space in the warehouse and inventory[-] jewels, which enhance the attack, defense, etc. - you have to invest to have a high plusSummary: 8,5/10I'm sorry for any mistakes. Have a nice game! :)			"

												If this is your first MMORPG well play this.Pros:  PVP is Good, Dungeons are challanging,  Battlefield is fun to play but you get 70k daily XP for playing it chop it down to 35k or 30k?!?! Good Graphics and Optimized for Low End PCs,Leveling is fast but at a good pace for beginners.Cons:Gender Locked Classes,Customisation for characters lack,Alot of quests are go there, kill that, speak to Bob... etc,The game is better at Level 60 not through leveling!!I would give this a 7/10 MMO I would say its too late for its time! Recommend this game if you have never played an MMO!			"

Posted: July 20, 2015
												So Echo of Soul will be my first Review :)Let's start it off with the basics:Classes: There are 5 classes with 2 (3) different roles. There are tanks (Protector and Earthguard), DDs ( Rogue, Mage, Hunter, Berseker and Stormguard) and Supporter (Bard). Yes there is no healer, which gives you the control of your own healthbar. Professions: Haven't looked in to it too much till now but there are primary (resource gathering, alchemy, juwelery) and secondary (soul something and cooking) professions)Control: You use your mouse to target things and move your camera. Your keyboard is for interacting with npcs and using skills. So nothing out of the odinary.Leveling: Leveling is quite easy. You can quick select quests with f, you have a build in questhelper and the first 20-30 Lvls are easily done. The longer you are in the game, the more you must be casious about your skills and need to find a good rotation to progress quickly. Combat: It's a rotation and static based combat system. You cant move while attacking/casting. That being said, the Fights with bosses relies on heavy movement mechanics, which makes things really difficult sometimes. I like that system, it leaves it to you to optimize your dmg output. PvP: 2 PVP maps, 5v5 Arena and Guildbattles at the start of a F2P game? Check! that's actually pretty big and well done.Dungeons: You have lots of solo dungeons (every 10 lvls 1) which gives you the opportunity to equip yourself and have some fun thorugh the leveling process. There are group dungeons too, but mostly for lvl 60 chars. Endgame: This Game has it all: good balanced pvp (no dimishing return right now, i hope they patch that in), lots of dungeon content, tiered equip, lots of dailys and professions to do. It won't get boring!Difficulty: I would say you can compare it easily to Vanilla wow, which was for me the most challenging mmo experience I had so far. Most bosses punishing mistakes quite heavily and you won't get much help through guides because there aren't many out yet. You need to learn everything for yourself and that in an environment which is not forgiving to mistakes. For me it's pretty fun :)New things? when you are ahead in lvl, you can warp yourself to a higher map without the need to walk.Bad things? For not so talented MMO player its pretty hard, very difficult to equip yourself without help in the first tiers. You can be held in Stunlock in PVP forever. Your bags are to small. All the cool looking stuff cost (normal armor looks a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥)Overall: I would recommend trying it out. When you get past the early 2-3 hours (pls don't hear on reviews from people with such short duration of play. They have no experience and just hate for no reason). It isn't for everyone, but it's F2P so trying it out would be the best choice for you.  "

												Game ♥♥♥♥ed old players. A good indication that they will ♥♥♥♥ over current players too in the future. Examples:1. Lvl cap increases. By adding maximum levels, the skill tree has expanded. However, the way the skilltree has expanded is ridiculous and impractical. For those that hasn't played EoS, it runs on a skill tree that allows you to choose 2 perks out of 3 for every 5 levels up until your last level, which you can only choose one from. - Instead of adding new skill columns for lvl 65 and lvl 70, they just inserted some into lvl 30s.  This means that you have lost your final class ability, for most classes, is a significant buff that can decide whether you can do a dungeon at lvl 60 or at lvl 70.2. Pay to win. This game was one of the best games 2 years ago. I played it before it came on Steam. Every one would be on equal playing grounds. You could spend no money on this game and be better than the guy that spent 300 dollars buying custom skins, pets, etc. You could get really OP items by grinding for them day and night. And everyone else who wanted that item has only one way to get it: by grinding for it. Now you can pay to have a mount that gives you the same buff as the mount that took someone over 6 monthes to grind for.3. Toxic Community. Now for a game that has PvP implemented into it, toxicness is understandable. It has always existed in battlefields, Valhalla. This does not mean that the game should get to the point where even Game Sages have quit and you are left with a Report button that has not done anything since the start of the game.There are so much more issues that I can address on this game, but just know now, any time that you spend on this game will become nothing once the developers decided that they want more money.

												just 1 hour into the game now, and already found someone to show me around how to start the questing (tip: talk to Levina on the main court and look at the symbols on the map), completed the 10 first quests and killed the first boss. Must say i am hooked to it. So far, I am having great fun with this, and had no need to spend any money - so winner for me. See you in-game shortly. Awesome game.			"

												Ok, so my time in this game was VERY short lived. I have played MMO's since before WoW was an idea. I may throw some more time into this game, but I highly doubt it.First off, all classes are genderlocked. So no, you can not choose your gender. Honestly, not a big issue with me as I'm more about the gameplay and content. It was just a drawback from the standpoint I love customization and variety in my appearance, which once again, this game does practically does not have.Second, story seems pretty generic. World is in trouble, gods need you, yadada. No biggy, it's hard to find an original premise for stories these days. But the world itself is pretty cool. GFX aren't the best of 2015, but it's a F2P....no complaints for not having billion dollar budget GFX.The controls and camera are what cut my time short in this game honestly. I can deal with lack of variety, a medoicre story, crappy graphics...but holy crap...Q and E do not strafe and the camera has to be manually turned. Your A and D keys to not turn your character, but strafe instead. All turning requires the mouse and often times you turn the camera but your character will keep running in the direction you were originally running (AKA character doesn't turn with the camera). I spent more time trying to move and target enemies than actually fighting...I think the only other MMO I've played that had that kind of control/camera system MIGHT have been Lineage II, but even it wasn' this bad.Combat, pretty generic point-and-click spam your rotation MMO. I personally like those kinda of combat system, but the camera issues really throw a wrench into this game...All-in-all, I haven't dont anything outside of the little noob area (hell, didn't even finish that) but based on my experience here....this game is far from being any big award winners. Not the best, no the worst...but definitely not worth the time if you're looking for a good consistent MMO.I may re-do this review later, but I feel like I will probably never devote enough time to do the game a fully unbiased review.

												Okay, so I really enjoy this game! It's really fun and the graphics are really pretty! There are a couple cons for this game, though. But I'll make a little list!Con:1. Only five classes to choose from, cannot choose your gender for them. 2 male classes and 3 female2. It's like every other MMO, kill and collect3. Not a lot of armor choices when buying them in the game stores (most other armor is given through different quests)4. Chat is broken, it censors words that arn't even bad. (Ex: I was censored when writing ""something"" and character names that have a small resemblence to swear words (such as ""Shizuo"" from Durarara))Other than those few things, I really enjoyed this game! Don't let the cons that I listed stop you from playing. The game is beautiful style-wise and theres quite a bit of customization you can do with your character! Most MMOs just give you four choices of colors for you hair or something like that, but this game has so much more! The community of the game is pretty nice and I haven't had many problems with the other players. I haven't had to level grind at all because the quest lines pretty much go with your current level. If an enemy overpowers you, usually its just because you need to upgrade your armor or repair it. The quests arn't overly time consuming. I never had a quest that made me kill over 10 enemies (most of them are around 3-5 enemies). There is quite a bit to this game and I really enjoy it! I do reccomend that you try it out. Who knows, you might really like it! If your cool with almost any MMO like me, I can assure that you'll like this one.			"

												A nice MMORPG. I played in this game an Archer and it does much fun. Positives: Nice balanced:As a low lvl u get a buff in Arena(pvp)fights.  Easy to play and learn. Nice introduction. Easy navigation. Friendly Community. Negatives: Quests are often the same just at other places. You got spammed with to much missions. At lvl60(maxlvl)there isnt so much to do like before.Just some Dungeons and thats it.All in all i think its a good mmorpg for beginners and have do fun till lvl 60.At lvl60 maybe switch the game.

												Rewrote the review, and changed the rating.First off, this game makes...not always sense.For example, make an egg in this game, all you need is seasoning (which magically turns into an egg apparently)To make a hamburger, all you need is bread. You know what my favourite kind of hamburger is? The one without any kind of meat, or lettuce, or sauce, JUST bread. Yummy.Not to mention you can make three kinds of burgers (BBQ, Bacon ...) and they all need only one ingredient - bread.As a person who loves crafting this is bad. You know what else is bad? Get this:There are three professions in this game, of which you can only learn one, and two hobbies of which you can learn both.Two of the professions need resources you can gather in the wild. Guess what the third profession is. Yep, its Resource gathering.So either you become a resource gatherer and can make nothing out of it but sell things, or you become an alchemist or jeweler and can make nothing because you can't gather resources. If they want to create an active, living market, this is NOT the way to do it, and it somewhat cancels out a certain type of freedom, too, if you want to gather and make your own stuff out of it.However, after playing a bit I have to say that, otherwise, the game is quite solid. The fighting is fun, the graphics are slightly above average but are used well, the game feels fluid despite using the good old tab targeting fighting system, and it constantly rewards you and keeps you engaged. It is still somewhat generic, but I rate games based on how fun they are, and...well, I am having fun.How long that will motivate me? I don't know, but for now, I am motivated to play until the first dungeon (apparently Lvl. 35) and, for an MMO these days, that says a lot for me. Will update this as I go along.Edit 1, 23th June 2015: PVP seems pretty well done. I have seen people saying that melee has an extreme disadvantage, but after playing a few matches, I have seen none of that. Of course, I am nowhere near experienced to really say for certain but it seems pretty fair to me for both melee and ranged, and PVP is kinda fun.Edit 2, 29th June 2015: I played the game more, and rolled a new character. They all feel distinctively different which is certainly a good thing. I still recommend this game.Edit 3, 07th July 2015: I think my final verdict on it is that it is certainly a good and fun way to pass time if you don't look for anything deep. Everyone else should stay away, because its very same-y.			"

Standard MMORPG This game is anchored in the old stylle f2p mmorpg era. If you want to grind your life away to be competive and still have feeling that paying user will roll stomp you this game will be for u.Features in new lightFive classes are standard RPG classes minus healerSpecializations are nothing to write home about Level up in PvE or PvP, well PvP is fun but until you unlock decent skills you will be in disadvantageous position and some specializations are just plain bad at PvP. As for PvE once again nothing more then standard 1600 quests ... heh. 60 unique maps ... party dungeons start from lvl 35 and are mostly well balanced  as for solo dungeons ... some specialization will have bad time in them. PvP is Robust for sure but lack comunication and strategy in random teams can make you quit a match and bufs from cash shop.No dedicated healing classes, creating more fast-paced and strategic combat, well you can say it's true but if your party hit a wall it will hit it hard.As for soul system it is grindy and random so have fun :)In conclusionGame has Potential maybe if it will have time to polish self, it will be better ?Cash shop is not rly that much pay to win but it can give quite advantage in PvP especialy in end game faze it will be pain in a neck.Graphics are standard for this kind of game nothing too bad or good. Game engine is quite old or not pushed that far.For me this MMO is standard 5/10 and I will recomend it only for people that want to go zen on grinding in this game.			"

Product received for free
												Echo of Soul looks like a typical Free to Play MMORPG with tab targeting. Looks easy to level up, quests are easy fetch and kill types, Level cap is 70.  If you have not played other MMORPGs, this game would be a good starter game. Has a Login reward system.  Not much multiplayer content till level 70. Free riding mount and pets.The female bodies look a little odd to me, their chest is too narrow while having a much bigger hip area.  You have a large selection of skin coloring, multiple shades of blue, purple, red black, grey. Able to enlarge head and adjust body height and leg height.  Has facial tatoos and odd eyes selection.  Has gender locked classes.It has PVP, but other players say it is horrible.Venture into solo dungeons and take on hordes of enemies as a one-man (or woman) army. Explore party dungeons with your friends and battle exhilarating bosses with Echo of Soul’s unique combat system, emphasizing cooperative healing. Without the need for a dedicated healer, every party member can get in on the action! You can regenerate health while out of combat.  -  Five customizable classes: Warrior, Archer, Rogue, Guardian, and Sorceress. -  Multiple specializations for each class, dramatically altering their style of play. -  No dedicated healing classes, creating more fast-paced and strategic combat. -  Soul System enables the collection of souls from fallen foes to activate buffs, enhance abilities, or craft useful items.for more info:

I would say the game itself is fun, but the spirit of the game is dragged down by this annoying market place, of spam spam spam. This will increase a large percentage of non-serious players, in otherwise a good game. Too Bad. Thumbs down, and a game which should be a thumbs up.

												A pretty new MMORPG game. I personally love it, it has a good combination between questing/PvE and PvP. There is multiple gamemodes, like dungeon, battlefield and a 15v15 5lane map. So if you want some variety in your RPG's I would definetely recommend this game. And if you like RPG's in general, download this free game.			"

												Echo of Soul is one of those games you pick up when you're bored and want to play some anime styled free2play MMO but have already played the well known games like Mabinogi, Maplestory, Aura Kingdom, Elsword, and the like. It's your typical, run of the mill tab target MMO that doesn't require much thinking. And for that it's great, but man the game does get boring rather quickly. Graphics: They're good; not 10/10, but unless you're a big name developer your game isn't going to have 10/10 graphics anyway, and this is the case of Echo of Soul. Character models look alright, though I wish the archer elf model didn't have such huge ears. This is one of my gripes with MMOs anyway that feature elves; why must they always have huge pointy ears? I blame LOTR and other franchises, but that's neither here nor there. As for the game environment, it's alright. Standard MMO fare, nicely modeled but still a bit rough around the edges, but that's to be expected. I will give props to the user interface and the control system though. The UI is very intuitive and easy to understand while the control system is very familiar; plus, the drop system actually makes sense and doesn't act funky when dealing with multiple mobs (unlike Aion, which is incredibly finicky and bulky).Gameplay: As I have said (and so have others), it's a tab-targeting system. Playing as an elf huntress was rather easy; just click and spam skills at enemies, no need to memorize rotation or worry about cooldown times; just click away. I confess though I am not at end game, so maybe this changes when you reach level 60. That said, gameplay is very, very, very basic at this point and I can see why some people might get turned off and not reach end game. It's just pick up quests from one area->kill the monsters/pick up drops->turn into respective NPC->repeat process. Heck, even the map layounts don't change much and are easy to memorize. It turns into one large area with four small areas connected to the side; complete all the side areas, move onto the next, and you're done. Combine that with the questing process and the combat system and you have yourself a game that is so brainless you can play it half asleep - hell, I've done it. Sound: Nothing fancy; moving on. Music is pretty average for this game as well, but I wasn't expecting anything else. Ultimately the game's averageness is its own undoing. Boring combat, repetitive quests and predictable area mapping makes for a painfully mediocre game. I can't think of a game that is just more ""there"" than this. I also find it hard to recommend. One one hand, not recommending it is not being fair; the game isn't terrible, but recommending it would give it too much credit. Maybe the game is there to sate our hunger for average MMOs, but there are better MMOs out there. But if you played all those MMOs already, there is this.			"

												Its a good game all in all. I haven't played it an exorbtitant amount, but I have had quite a bit of fun with the time I have had. So far the only 2 complaints I have are as follows:1) The sheer number of foreign language speakers on The NA server. Its not that I am against foreign language, but its far past the point where they should have made servers specifically for these other groups, because they aren't exactly a minority group. Its actually starting to cause problems when grouping with other people for dungeons.2) I actually find this one a tad amusing: The censorship system. It censors any words that are specified inappropriate, maybe a little TOO well. Even if the letters are in seperate words, like Four's Excellence, its censors the letters xD As for the pro's to the game, there are quite a few, so I will confine it to 5.1) The music, Oh good grief the music! It is AMAZING, it fits very well, and right off the bat on opening the title menu my first day I felt at home2) The graphics. Now some of you may think ""ok, its got good graphics, so what?"" but I'm not saying, jacking it up all the way to ultra, even at minimum, which I found to be just as manageable as other MMORPG's, the graphics are stellar. So if you are looking to focus on game performance over graphics quality, you aren't sacrificing a whole lot by running minimum.3) The player base seems to be quite friendly thus far. Although not a whole lot of questions have been answered for me, there are still plent of friendly people I have run into. Dont take that to mean this game has no trolls, every mmo does to some extent, but the people who are friendly go above and beyond ^_^4) The skill paths for classes are quite simple, but it still requires a bit of careful planning to get a suitable combination. 5) The main hub for the first large zone has ALOT to do, and is quite large. I didn't do a whole lot of exploring, but there were quite a few vendors.I hope this has helped to some degree, and if you have any questions that this review failed to answer, please feel free to ask in the comments below ^_^			"

												I am a veteran wow player playing vanilla private servers on and off for 7 years and I just want to say as a elitist mmo♥♥♥♥♥that this is the ONLY anime mmo you will find with endgame. PVP is fun, there are 2 bgs and some 5v5 arena (havent done arena yet). The bgs are really cool and this game is still relatively new so they might add another which I think they should consider. I haven't done much PVE yet but I watched some videos of the raids and they seemed like really long fights that actually required tactics, to say the least I was impressed by the videos I saw. (looks like there is legitimate gear progression as well that makes the pve content last a long time).I have played this for about 13 hours at the time of this post and I have to say it has enough unique elements to make it a little different than a few mmos as far as professions and the soul system. (and combat seeing as there is no dedicated healing class).Kind of like gw2 meets fable meets wow but unlike gw2 it actually has a feeling of progression instead of running around having no idea what your doing. There is an npc in the main town that gives you a quest to go to a level appropriate zone if you outlevel the content you were previously on, which can happen if you run dungeons and do a pvp daily after level 15 that gives a level each day basically. (which I was impressed with).I have yet to do a party dungeon but I am leveling a tank and I have done a few solo dungeons (I am only level 24) and they seemed to be pretty solid and I can start to see how the mechanics work and its really exciting. The numbers aren't too big either which is what I like. The damage output is similar to burning crusade wow atleast from what it looks like. I don't think this game can mess up the system they have very easily so it feels like a good enough investment spending my time here.Much better than other Anime Mmos seeing as Aura Kingdom's level grind is insane and doesn't seem to have endgame whats so ever and Mabinogi is out dated and theres no reason to log on besides troll free loot events.I have been around, played a lot of anime mmo's off and on just as a troll for fun and this one impressed me enough to write a review and I haven't even played it that long. iz pretty cool.

												the game looks nice but thats kinda all it has going for it.character creation: a bit limited. 5 classes, though it is early, more might be added but i couldnt choose gender. few hair styles, colors or faces. though the option to change the pattern in the eyes is cool.camera movement/ wasd: cam keeps resetting after i move it to where i want to look while i move. must stop moving to move cam.cam movement/ mouse: clunky. hit boxes on everything are so big you cant move around without accidentally clicking on an enemy thats behind you.battle system: not bad, choose your attack and wait for it to charge up rather than burst everything and wait for cooldown makes it much more involved and strategic. this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off; whoever gets last hit on something if youre not in a party will TAKE THE KILL and the quest points involved with said kill. i attacked every one of the type of enemy i needed to kill to progress a story quest for 20 minutes and didnt get the last hit on any so i couldnt progress.General experience: feels like any other mmo, go here do this, go there do that with nothing to do in the meantime but fight or wait. it doesnt matter how big your world is, unless theres something interesting to do while youre moving from quest to quest its just as if everything was brought to me, only i have to wait a few minutes before i can do anything.only played to lvl 6 so i didnt have much experience but its enough to tell me it doesnt stand out from any other of the dozens of mmos ive played before.

												For me this is one of the better free mmo's currently out there yes there is an aspect of the cash shop but the fun I have had from it so far and the people I have met on it and play with is great. The pvp side of it is pretty good although there arent really any instructions on what you do its pretty straight forward, if you cant figure it out follow the crowd.There are some who arent interested in playing with new starters or even acknowledging your exsistance but then at the same time other mmos are the same even the paid ones. If you are looking for a nice mmo which is pretty easy to get a grasp on and jump right in then you should give it a try.			"

												Let me start by saying. When I read the reviews BEFORE installing the game I was not too excited. Majority of people we're complaining about EoS getting boring fast and not being what they expected. Some claiming to have issues and poor performance. --IN MY PERSONAL OPINION-- Ignore all that. If you're truly an' MMORPG player like myself. You will enjoy Echo of Soul. I have 3.7 hour so far and I'm hooked. I literally close the game for a half hour - 45 minutes at a time due to finger's cramping and what not. Take a break and go right back at it. Thurely enjoying the game so far and I hope to see more of you on EoS soon.			"

												1st things 1st.. the game is ""GENDER LOCKED"", thought gender locking in mmo'ss went out with the ARK.SO! after spending over two weeks of playing this game and getting to level 60, I RAGE QUITED over the fact that once you hit level 60 the game just becomes stupid and fraking annoying. Unless your a wizard at making gold (game currency) in MMO's i'd stay WELL clear of this game. Here's why...All MP/HP pots/scrolls are 1 silver.. but when you hit level 60, you cant use the potions lower than that level, which means you need to buy the lvl 60 pots/scrolls.. these cost like 300 silver+ just for ONE.. trust me, getting 1 gold in the game would take you a good few quests early on, at top level it's NOT so hard.. BUT here's the thing.. you NEED these items at 60 in dng's.. so, no cash.. no pots/scrolls.. no heals.. no parties want you.. you gold is GONE in hours that took you WEEKS to save up.The only thing possible to do is use the gold sellers, but by doing that you will run the risk of having your account/game hacked, so I would NOT recommend doing that.. I would recommend just staying FAR AWAY from this game.The game itself looks amazing at a lot of the places you go too, though the few starter zones/areas look REALLY BAD! and most people would take one look at it and quit within 20mins of playing, I nearly did, im glad i played on though because even though the gold thing is a MAJOR problem.. the game itself is NOT that bad and I can't knock the rest of the game because of MY issues I have making gold in mmo's... unless I cash-shop items and sell them in the auction or whatever.. I stopped doing that a LONG time ago.The gold, hp/mp pot/scroll cost is an issue that Aeria REALLY needs to sort out but are refusing too.. this is the WORSE game in their catalogue of mmos by far, and I know because I've played all the games they offer.. even the mobile phone games. Aeria are WELL KNOWN for scamming their gamers with HIGH COST currency so I really should'nt be suprised at what a mess this game is currently in, especially with a Dev.Team that can't even keep a scheduled maintenance on track.. LOL! 9 hours for a single maintenance that only fixed minor bugs/issues.. THAT happened this week by the way, and all we got from the GM's on the forums shoutbox was them calling us noobs, and saying every hour.. the game should be back online shortly.. LOL! total clueless.			"

												I've been playing this game quite a lot during the closed beta and I have to say I had much fun with my friends. I came here looking for a fun Free-2-Play MMORPG, and I got what I wanted. I would give it a 90% rating in the MMO category. For my group of friends it was kind of a WoW/Lineage 2 revival. Easy to get into it, fun PvP and dungeons, and I especially like the game-design and art style (even though on the tech side the game is not The Witcher III, let's face it ^^ But my laptop could run it pretty smooth in high, it looks sharp).Sure it's not revolutionary and it doesn't have a special feature that stands out, but it becomes more and more attractive and interesting as you play the game. It has all the features I was looking for, different types of PvP, a ton of dungeons to farm gear, cool mounts and pets (if you like lamas you'll love riding them in this game lol), nice crafting systems, a pretty extensive job system and the end-game content seems huge (even though I have done much myself after I hit level 60, I need a bit more time to look into it as I was having some fun in PvP for a while and put the dungeons/questing on the side).It's pretty easy to get into it even for MMORPG beginners, the interface is user friendly, and I found the learning curve well done. I felt I actually needed some time to master some skills and to start feeling powerful, which is a good thing IMO (I don't like hen its too easy). I got crushed my first few times in PvP but now I actually do quite well without spending a single penny and without having amazing skills myself. On the negative side, I would say that there is some grinding involved that can become a bit boring at some point. I don't mind farming personally, but I know some friend wanted to progress a bit faster. Yet, nothing crazy either, still in line with many other MMORPGs, especially those coming from Asia.Regarding the debate ""P2W or not"", it didn't felt Pay-2Win to my eyes, especially in comparison to some other Free-2-Play MMOs. Sure there is a shop, but you can get most stuff via in-game drops, via the magic egg system (cool idea for free players), or by buying in the auction house. I have some friends who spent some cash on the game to buy some mounts and costumes plus some boosts for leveling, but in PvP we were on the same level. So all good from my point of view on that side. Might consider spending if I continue to play for a while, but I don't feel forced to do so...So overall I really like the game and will continue to play for a while. It's perfect for casual MMO players but also interesting for experienced players. Found the game well balanced and not Pay-2-Win so far. A good example of what a F2P MMORPG should be!			"

												I would have to start off by saying that I have not played this game nearly enough to make a really educated review - so take this with a grain of salt.My first feeling when playing this, is the same I get with every MMO these days - nothing will just ever feel as fresh and have this ""wow"" effect on me again, as World of Warcraft once did. At the same time though, the game is decent and fun once you get past the first standard leveling bit.The bosses in the dungeons have some cool mechanics even already early on and the group dynamics are mostly cool. The highly acclaimed ""missing heal class"" is a bit of an overstatement though - instead you just go and shield and redistribute HP, etc. so it is almost like healing classes.PVP is pretty fun when you find the right group to play with - a couple of different game modes you can spend your time with and I would bet that guild play should be a nice thing for end game. The whole enchanting system gives you a purpose for running dungeons to just get the last bit of extra out of your gear. Of course they sell♥♥♥♥♥♥in the shop to get an edge for these things - on the other hand though even if I am willing to spend money, I still have to farm a lot of gold in order to get the enchanting done. So the gap between players should not be that big - especially since the power curve is not as drastic (unless of course you go up against like a +12 and you are +2 with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gear)So give it a try, especially if you have some buddies that will play along with you. You can get quite far without spending money, especially when you join a guild so no real risk there.			"

It's fun to play on your own. If there is any flaw to playing it's that you need to lower the graphics quality because it lags a lot. It's sad because the graphics are beautiful. If you have a computer that can support it with ease, then by all means, play it as it should be played. It's easy on the eyes and  has a very appealing style.			"

												Ive played since day 1 OBT it was going okay until recently with pvp season 2 although it isnt a pvp based game.... however Aeria has stooped extremely low into the 'leech players for money' tactic that they allowed a instant lvl 35 boost for their new character, the warlock. In case you still decide to play level 35 can be achieved in an incredible short time. The economy has become completely broken by the cash shoppers like every other game where f2p is not f2p. Do not pvp in this game if you want your time wasted when a new seaon comes they completely wipe your gear... Anyone who puts money into this game (and tbh even playing it at this point...) is completely wasting their time. Do not fall for this scam...Do not fall for Aeria, they are a waste of what could be a reasonably good development crew.Let's not fail to mention this either...There have been multiple incidents where this have occured and not just with myself but many people who have played the game.Aeria, at least for this game that I know of, uses a SEPERATE login server and game server.Meaning whenever you login to the game of course you have to go through ANOTHER server so when the login server crashes you have 2 options...1) Wait for the servers to be fixed then get on and be told that they will compensate everyone for the login servers being down... one of two things will happen here either you get ONE of these blessings: Edun's, Njord's, and (if the problem was that huge of an occurance) Levina's (+4 Atk 2hours, +4% Def 2hours, Double EXP and Gold for 24 hours <---- rare) 2) IF you are in game then you cannot log out which of course isn't that hard to do EXCEPT when Aeria is fixing their login servers SOMEHOW they screw up the game servers also leaving you to inevitable crash while they fix the problem.After they have this problem occur they undergo a maintenance to ""fix"" the issue i.e. after the ""fix"" is done you can't login because its still broken...That's just trying to get in game and stay in game...The P2W or might as well call it P2P...Now I am completely free to play in the game yet I am still the best Stormguard in the game but... It does not stop people from judging people about their gems. Anyone who knows me in game immediately wants my help with dungeon DPS but when you go into a dungeon and have to tell 4 random morons talking about gems to shut it and watch the DPS meter only for a F2P to come out on top they get livid....EXTREMELY livid. So besides the P2W to just be complete BS for PvE the player base is rather saddening.But PvE is where the chance to ""win"" stops lets go to PvPAt first everything was okay people were learning and figuring things out so you could fight and in that time gather gear to keep yourself balanced with them BUT the new players were matched against the ""skilled"" (P2W theres no skill in opening a wallet) players its like watching a gazelle try to befriend a lion. But... it managed to get remarkable worse..As I stated earlier they released PvP Season 2 (Even the developer himself stated that it wasnt a pvp based game).Before the occurance of Season 2 GM's stated that you should quickly use your pvp currency because they would be wiped. However, they FAILED to mention anything about a PVP GEAR WIPE. So many people F2P and P2W began grinding gear in the last few moments of the first season. Just to have it completely replaced with newer higher level gear.Well you might be thinking now, ""Why's he ♥♥♥♥♥ing about this? It means everyone is on fair ground."" No...no it doesn't allow me to explain.( Keep in mind that all gem scalings are the same and that the next tier of gem only increase the item level that it can be slotted into.)A gem in this case lets use an Onyx a gem that is slotted into a helmet in order to increase the CRIT ACC stat from the helm.Before the math begins lets start with a helm that just has 100 Base Crit Acc a +1 Dull Onyx or Lucid Onyx would both apply this affect:          +1 Crit Acc + 4% Crit Acc (of the base stat so +4) coming out to an added +5 Now this isnt much but the items you would use in pvp have MUCH higher base stats and youre not going to be running around with anything lower than +5Now if you use a +6 you get :       +6 +26% (of base stat)If the item only has a 100 thats a messley 32 stat points big woop...Lets kick it up to the P2W's +11 Lucid jewels (no one has a +12 jewel yet but i will supply the scaling for all jewels anyway)       +11 +91% (of base stat) <--- yea thats right 91% that doubles the 100 stats to 202 but as you increase in gear of course that +11 wont double it but 91% sure about does.Now coming soon there will be a new gem the ""Intermediate gem"" the lucid is consider a low rank gem...   But what happens when the Intermediates come out? Gem wipe....you just spent several thousand of USD to have it thrown away wouldn't you feel smart.I will leave this with a chart of gem scaling of +1 to max +12         +1        +1 +4%        +2        +2 +6%        +3        +3 +9%        +4        +4 +13%        +5        +5 +19%        +6        +6 +26%        +7        +7 +35%        +8        +8 +46%        +9        +9 +59%        +10      +10 +74%        +11      +11 +91%    <--- highest lucid obtained so far by date of review        +12      +12 +110%  <--- highest dull obtainedNote: Dull Gems are no able to be used in items of 64 item level or higher so you must swap to lucid.Someone in +8 gear is able to 1 HIT someone in +5 or +6 and someone in +11's can one hit anyone in +9 or lower and devestate someone in +10As I said the 100 base stat was a mere example main items have stats more that quadruple that of an item that would have any 100 base stat.

												Well here goes nothing! If you're a fan of World of Wacraft and a fan of beautiful scenery, combat and more then this game is for you. At first I was skeptical to play this game since I read from the other reviews that this game just wants your money etc... when in reality that is far from the truth. Unless you want to buy cute outfits, mounts, pets, and etc... then yes you will be wasting money but yet the game already comes with tons of those that are free so unless your a compulsive shopper, you should be fine. Just like any MMORPG, you will be using the number keys to be using your spells/actions to use in combat. You also have jewels/crystals/runes to increase your armour and weapons effectively (which make you badass btw) where you can get from questing, killing monsters, and battlefield. Speaking of battlefield, it really helps. When playing battlefield with other players (PVP) you gain a crap ton of XP, Jewels for your armour and weapons (previously mentioned) and food to keep you sane. When in battlefield you also get special PVP points which you can use in the PVP Battlefield Merchant that gives you exclusive gear towards your character to make them not only look cool but be better in PVP. Leveling up is pretty fast in the game, within 5-7 minutes you'll already be level 7, once you are level 10 you can do dungeons, battlefield, and raids. Now let's get onto the pretty ugly part of the game. The textures. Suck.♥♥♥♥♥ The textures of the game look like they havent been updated since 2006 but yet the Character's, Gear, and spells look up to far with 2016-17. I feel like if they worked on those better, then you can feel a little less cringy. The second part is the FRAME RATE DROP. No matter if you have a expensive gaming computer that can run anything on your computer without lag, this game unfortunately has it SOMETIMES but most of the game is playable. Third reason, it is not a very popular game. Very few people play it (Estimated around 300-400 which is pretty low compared to other games) which if you choose to do Battlefield it can take a good 5-30min for people to actually join which is .... eh.... oh well... Overall, the game is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, I love playing it with friends and meeting new peeps everyday. :D Don't be shy, give it a try!			"

												So about this game.Firstly : ""About the people that complain that it doesn't bring anything new"" - OF COURSE IT DOESN'T BRING ANYTHING NEW BECAUSE - it's free, so there will not be any grand developement on it - but nevertheless it has an unusual allure to it that makes you want to try it.While it's not the next WOW (World of Warcraft) in the making, it definitely needs to be experienced. Many will not play it hardcore BUT it will give you something to do while you wait for the games you want to play.Secondly : NO FREE MULTIPLAYER GAME WILL HAVE SOMETHING NEW TO INTRODUCE - because it's FREE. To have something new to introduce you would have to pay for it, simple as that. Who would bother to give something new without gething something in return, let's be realistic.While it doesn't have anything new to introduce, it does have an interesting story, YES - I'm one of those who actually read the story - , while the graphics are not the NEXT GEN they aren't bad at all, good music,But there is one thing that not many multiplayer games use : IT HAS NO HEALER CLASS - which is awesome because you actually have to think about survival and buffs and worry about your health. So if you want to have an interesting adventure and do some strategic thinking while you're at it PLAY IT. It's FREE for heanve's sake.			"

												I downloaded this game as soon as it became available on steam because I thought it looked interesting and I wanted to play a new mmo rpg. I didnt expect to like the game as much as I do, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic free to play mmo rpg. There is so much to do once you hit 60 (max level) and it continues to be a very enjoyable game. Also, there is absolutely no pay to win aspect which is fantastic seeing as its a F2P RPG. If you can get past the fact that there is gender locking (I know, its 2015 and gender locking shouldn't be a thing in RPG MMOs anymore) it is a very fun game to play. Updates every few weeks to keep the game interesting and I hope they continue to grow and improve the game. Dont get me wrong, there are a number of faults with this game but nothing to make you steer clear of atleast giving this game a try for yourself. Gender Locking is a problem, but they make up for it with decent customization. Balance between classes is a bit off, but you can make up for it with skill. PvP and Dungeons are a ton of fun especially if you are spamming them with guildies/friends. All in all good F2P RPG.			"

												I do not recomend this to anyone looking for some good MMO to play. Combat isn't good, quests are boring, feels like you just pass everything fast, and micro transactions. I would rather shell out money on some other MMO game like ESO (Elder Scrolls Online) or WoW (World of Warcraft) instead of EoS (Echo of Souls) this game for 2 hours straight.    P.S. The llama doesn't look anything like a llama.			"

I have'nt been asked to buy anything the whole time i played it! - Second-- Alot of reviews say some classes are OP. They are wrong. Since the update they are balanced! - Third-- This is a good game!

												Tried this game today. the graphics are nice and from what I could see the game play was decent. That's as far as I got.Right away I notice my FPS was capped at 60, no problem there's a setting that allows you to turn of the limitations. Then I noticed every few seconds my frames would drop from 150+ to the teens and start climbing again. so I started turning down settings. After reaching minimum setting on everything I decided to uninstall. Steady fps is a must and I can not play a game where my fps is reset to almost nothing every few seconds. I do not run top end gaming rig but an Intel i7 4790k, nVidia GTX 770 and 16 gigs of ram should be able to run a Free to Play game at max settings with 0 fps issues.I had high hopes for this game, too bad unsteady fps causing a stuttering effect had to ruin it.

												Now let's start like this, it's a decent MMO if you are looking for classics. The only problem it has is that sometimes can be glitchy, in some rare occasions which isn't that much of a problem to be honest, but it's nothing new. It's the most 'Typical' classic MMO with the rule of grinding quests and simple PVP mechanics. I like the souls system in the game, but that's the only thing that interested me in playing, but then compare the game to all other games that just recently came out or are about to go free to play like Archeage, Black Desert or Albion online, I feel these will be the games worth playing when they go free to play, Archeage has an amazing housing systme, Black Desert will have astonishing graphics and fighting mechanics and then Albion will have a very interested look at MMOs from multiple perspectives, but then when you look at EOS, It's just another MMO like any other. 5/10			"

												This game made me bittersweet, but I will not reccomend it to other players.Simply because. It's a simple go here and get this MMO.  I'll explain why It made me bittersweet.I like pretty games. I liked the outfits, the graphics were good. I even liked the Soul part of the game. It was fairly interesting.But...The quests were the same. I did a dungeon by myself. There was no need to play with other players.The reason it made me bittersweet is because I did like the game concept. The battling was nice, but the battling threw me off because I couldn't move much. ( I was an archer.) The sidestep was literally pointless, I don't know why they bothered to put it there, but I did like the Soul stuff. How you would have wings of color on your back. I thought it was cool. So basicallyPro: Good graphics. Interesting concept with souls.  Pantie shots. >-> The battling was decent. The story was okay. Not the best. Music was decent too.Cons: Sidestepping was pointless. ( I like to move when I'm battling.) The quests were go here and get that. Basically, gathering and killing things.Even though it looks like the pros outweight the cons. The quests are the MAIN part of the game and for that. It sufferered a thumbs down for me.  Sorry Aeria. Not your best game, but it's decent if you're looking for a simple MMO. "

												As a general summary of this game, the whole things is as generic as a generic MMORPG can be. Generic evil entity wants generic fantasy world to end, and generic hero player starts the game while generic war ensues with generic guards fighting generic red demon monsters. Blah blah blah, yadda yadda yadda, skip all the generic dialogue and cutscenes, blah.Look I'm going to break it down really to just the pro's and con's.Pros:- Volume slider available during cutscenes (Actually clever!)- It's 'alright' looking, graphically speaking- Strip to your underwear (Maybe it's a pro, maybe it's a con? I dunno it's up to you, I ain't judgin')- Clothing/Armour is tasteful (A little risque, but not TERA levels of skimpy.)Cons:- Combat is generic, slow, and boring.- Storyline/Plot is generic, borning, and uninteresting.- Voice acting is 'alright' I guess? Certainly by no means amazing, but not the worst I've heard.- Gender locked classes (So much for ""advanced character customization"")- Limited keybindings (Skill/Item/Mount bindings restricted to 1 - =, F1 - F12)- Lots of wasted space (Useless 'between zone' zones filled with useless trash mobs deisgned only to waste your time.)Needless to say that I don't reccommend this game, however that's not to say it's bad, it's just nothing special. Look, if you like generic MMORPG's, give it a shot, but don't expect anything amazing because I guarantee you won't find it. As far as PvP is concerned, I didn't bother to try it simply because I personally don't care for PvP, however if it follows suite with the rest of my experience, it's probably just as generic as you'd expect.

												Great game, with the World Of Warcraft based GUI and average graphics. However what the game lacks in is what most games in whole lack in, that's captivating the player with the starter quests of the game and throwing all you can to that point of the game, leaving the rest of the main quests not exciting like saving women from beasts or searching the shops for a cute plushie. I highly recommend this TPS MMORPG game to patient people. People who can stand killing the same things over and over again, With a slight change in loot collected or loot needed to complete the quest. In the game there are a series of bugs and glitches and simple mistakes that take time out of your gameplay to abondon the quest and re-do it. For example you deleting a quest item on accedent and having to abandon it and collectit back, Although this is a player based thing, we shouldn't be aloud to delete or sell any quest item in the game, also if a bug happens during the main quest when you're half way through it... Believe me i speak from experience that it is plain annoying that you needing to spend an extra twenty muinets going through the quest and completing it again with you knowing how you could've completed the game half an hour prier.Still, i'm not hating on the game for what it is. The game is a average game with a huge helping community, without the mass spam of ingame payments.			"

												Right from the bat, I knew this game was going to be a polarizing one. To begin, classes are gender-specific. If you want to play a female rogue, well tough luck. There isn't a lot of customization in character creation, so you'll find several copies of your character once you're out on the field. The graphics are nice, but it's nothing special.It's fairly easy to level up quickly, but it's also very boring. Quests are the generic ""kill this many creatures,"" ""gather this many items,"" or ""kill creatures to gather this many items that may or may not drop."" The skill tree is not extensive. This might be good for first-time MMORPG players who can better understand the simplified rundown of skillsets. But again, this brings back the con of lack of customization. A serious flaw with this game (in my opinion) is how difficult it is to earn money. This makes professions useless and expensive in the earlier levels.Like many F2P games, there is a cash shop. While the game doesn't shove the fact in your face as much as others, the fact that there are actually quests in the game that requires you to purchase an item from the cash shop just irks me. Also like many F2P games, PVP is horribly unbalanced. Some classes far outlast others in the battleground. Archers are the devil.This is just your average MMORPG. It will keep you entertained for a few hours before you get tired of the redundancy.			"

												I really like MMORPG games. I was actually addicted to WoW a long time ago. I've also played a lot of TERA.. in fact I have 5 or 6 toons on TERA most of them are level 40-50 and one is maxed at 65. I also have a couple toons on Riders of Icarus... one of them is maxed out on there too. Why does this matter in a review of this game??? Because I have no desire to play this game any further than the time I've already put into it. Honestly, this game is kinda boring. I made it to level 10 in like an hour. The fighting style is traditional and not action based like I'd prefer. The graphics maxed out.. are sadly pretty poor for a recent game. Texture resolutions are not anywhere near as high res as they should be for a game this old. On the other hand, the toons look pretty good. Except where the head joins the neck.. I don't like seeing that seam. Maybe it's superficial, but it drives me bonkers.The game play is just meh. Point and click or tab to target enemies like WoW. Kill so many enemies, gather so much stuff, blah blah blah. You can't sheathe your weapon, so you're just running around with it out all the time. Classes are ALL gender locked.. big boo. And your first mount is a... llama.. how original. -_- I played as a Guardian which is a female class witha giant spear. So basically you run around poking bad guys with your spear that is always out while doing your little anime run. There's also this soul power thingymabob that gives you extra powers.. but I didn't fully understand it.. because I was too bored with the game to bother reading all the dialog that explains it. Sure, there is a guy that talks to you when you use the help window, but he is boring too.And now I am bored with writing this review. So in conclusion.. this game is not for you if you like action/adventure type MMORPGs. If you are looking for entertaining games with freedom to do other things than quest.. quest... quest... go check out TERA or Riders of Icarus (just watch out on RoI, because there is a stupid ban glitch and you might get banned for 82 years like I did for no reason).

												This game is great! Just as good an Guild Wars 2 IMO, and tonnes of content! If you don't put any effort in you won't like it. Great graphics (not at first) Great animations and decent character creation. The attacking and Skills are good too. I've played 53 hours so far and i plan to do many more. **Warning** It's NOT a pay to win but you'll definetly want to spend money on it. The missions and quests are not ""confusing"" as people have said, they're just stupid.8/10			"

												EOS is a new cutesy anime style MMORPG with the classic MMO elements but a slight difference. You can relate it to WoW in terms of combat(for some part), nothing is seemingly new for such a new MMO, I will say its very well done for what it is. My long review, I hope this helps any one on edge about playing or not. Also consider it a mini basic things to know of the game.Cash shop? Yes. P2W? I wouldn't say yes or no it this. Everything in game can be purchased with gold through the market from other players, some cash shop items through the ""magic egg system"", and others from events. Basically anything from the cash shop can be gotten with gold,  and at a much, much slower and less probable rate via Magic Lamps(purchased with eggs)PvP? Yes Battlegrounds, Arena,  and its well done to a point. A player over level 10 may join the BG's and its a great way to level. Gems can be used on Equipment to improve your stats as well. Anything over +5 means you will need a Safeguard(use magic eggs, cash shop, Lamps(random), market, to get) to ensure that your gems do not break when you upgrade them, but no guarentee they will upgrade. This system can greatly unbalance PvP but as long as you do your share of the work you will be rewarded, win or lose. I cannot say for that you are guarenteed rewards in arena with a lose though as I have yet to do that. Its a lot of fun but you may also find yourself wanting to bash your head off the wall at some of the players.Guild Battles?Yes! Open world guild pvp makes it a bit harder if you are lower level and new to the game. However avoiding a hostile guild is best until you are familiar and comfortable with the game and your class.Guilds can compete in Valhalaa, where guilds will compete to kill a daily spawn boss for amazing rewards that will benefit your guild. Dungeons? Yes! My favourite part of this game is the level 60 dungeons. The game does start you small, giving you regular and heroic soloable dungeons to do starting from level 10 until 60! This is a great way to learn boss fights and mechanics until you can get to level 60 and begin heroic party dungeons. The game holds your hand though in the fights and will tell you what to do and when to do it, so long as you can read! Epic PvE armor will drop at random during each level 60 party dungeon. There is a weekly limit cap on how many of each specific dungeon you can do, starting at 4. You can increase this with dungeon tickets x 2(bought from market, magic eggs, found in lamps) or reset one of your uses with 1 ticket. You will get 30 gold per dungeon I believe. 10gish per boss. Its great for earning gold and then you can afford to upgrade gems or buy cool things this way!Raids? Coming Soon~Profesions? Yes, you will be able to choose 2 hobbies and 1 profession. The 2 hobbies are Cooking and Soul Processing. Both are important and should always be learned right away. The 3 Professions are Resource Collector, Jeweler, Alchemist. Unfortunately there is no armor, weapon or bag crafting but those come easy enough. I would have loved to see FISHING Q.QCooking: Energy and Satiety play a big role in buffing your attack and HP. Energy is used when you use any skill! Satiety fades slowly with time and will determine your hunger level. If you are full you cannot eat any more food to increase your energy, energy is what specifically increases your attack and HP. You can either use a Digestant(Cash shop item, market item, lamps.) to lower your satiety, or wait it out. Digestants can also be obtained from questing in the highest level questing zone.I feel like I should shut up at some point so maybe now. Overall its a newer game in a old school MMORPG style, great for killing time and probably getting really in to. You will find nothing new here but if you love Anime and MMO's then this just might be your game. At least until Blade & Soul or Black Desert. . .			"

Well the only think i willsay is that i see all the time small thing like the quest system, the quest tracker, the profecions, the pvp system that actually work, i have seen it in other game but its not working at all. Also the free to play platform its free to play, and yes they are some things that i dont like, like the bags are always not enough.  But i understand that the company have to make money some how. I will recommend this game.. You have to try it and see by your self if a company want to make a good game can make it by listen gamers. Thank you for your time read this..			"

												Ok .. First off i would like to say , this game is that one game that some people like and some people dislike . i havent played pvp nor' have i reached that point i believe , but besides the fact , as of now my review is very positive , i play with my friends , and we love it , its fun and a mmo that has alot of potentials and the fact that people are negatively reviewing this game , need to give it a chance , it was recently released and is now on steam , so updates are anticipated and i believe this game will become ""that one."" So this game is 100% worth trying. Subscribe to my youtube channel and expect your favorite games ! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqm6JYSS4QO6-U7IyIj8KuA "

												This is an okay game, not great though. I didn't have to play it long to see that it wants your money, and is buggy. I'm sure the bugs will be cleared up at some point, but I'm being dropped out of the game every ten minutes. I tried other servers to see if the dropping was just the server I was on, but it was all of them. I did like that it gave you mounts, but I wish that we are able to fight on them, or even gather plants or items from them instead of just the 'faster' transport that they allow.  The hot keys are difficult to use and changing them doesn't help much. I also wish that you didn't have to click the target (Even pressing tab doesn't help much) to be able to attack rather than just face and be able to attack.The story is okay for as far as I am able to get (again, keep getting kicked off the game for no reason) so that is a point in their favor.  If you like rpg's then I say try it, it is okay and you'll never know if you'll like it until you try it.			"

												I highly recommend you stay  away form any game from Aeria games.  Yet another stupid company that flat out bans and blocks people for no reason, makes the customer go through hoops to try gain access back and this is not how I feel a company should treat it's customers.  Sorry Aeria your♥♥♥♥♥is banned from my library of games. To elaborate, I have never once in my life needed to use bots, cheats or buy gold illegaly in games or do anything questionable.  Games have their place but they are sure not important enough to do illegal things within them to succeed in the games.  It's not entertainment to me if I have to cheat so. yeah.  never bother with such things. But yet upon wanting to try this game which I don't think would have been all that great anyway but a time killer for a bit, I found my account blocked.  Loking up how to gain access again, a long list of procedures.  I did nothing.  I do not need to prove myself innocent of something I never did.  ♥♥♥♥ you Aeria you are going downhill fast if you keep this kind of mentality.			"

It's kind of sucks, when i am telling friends about the game and inviting them to play, and i can't even log in. It just seems like the game is down more than i am playing, that's pretty bad!Don't get me wrong it's a fun game to play and the players i meet in game are pretty awesome! but even when the server maintainance is done and over some players still can't log in and that pretty much blows! So i recommend the game to some people who have others games to play in the mean time, until EOS servers come back up, but i don't recommend the game to people who are just starting out with the game...specially if they are first time players.

												I usually do not write reviews, but when I saw some of the criticism directd at this game I felt I had to. I have been playing EOS since late in the Beta (got lucky on FB and got a free Betakey) and so far I really like it! Sure it is not the re-invention of the wheel but it gets quite a bit of stuff just right... Want to do PVE? ...Check!Dungeons? ...Check!Gear? ...Check!Professions? ...Check!Want to do PVP?  ...Check!Battlefields? ...Check!Arena?  ...Check!Is all of that perfect? Heck no but it is a nice all around package. Some things should be fixed (stunlock in PVP, addition of Raids...) and then it would even better.Now since this game is F2P the item shop is obviously something that needs to be carefully looked at, but really there is nothing too crazy there, mostly cosmetic stuff (costumes and the like) -  the only thing I did not like was the Enhancement Booster that makes crafting a bit easier, but really it's not by that much and I do not spent on stuff like that anyways...So would I recommend this game? Yes! It is an easy to get into MMO that is more on the casual side (though Dungeons can get a bit tricky due to the absence of a healer)... Give it a try! "

												Played my fair share of these types of games and while it has some things I like, it's pretty bland. I came to this game out of pure boredom. Let us just say, it didn't fix my problem. Classes are gender/race locked, visuals are pretty horrid. While the character models seem decent, the terrain/environment is ugly as ♥♥♥♥. Leveling is generic and boring, though I don't expect any more from an mmo tbh. Quest leveling is hard to escape. You unlock PvP at level 10. You can level via battlegrounds if you like, though it isn't well balanced atm and you're GOING to get wrecked, especially as a Rogue. So far my PvP experience has been rough, with players constantly shouting to do things a certain way and to ""gtfo"". None of this being aimed at me as far as I know but honestly the PvP is pretty easy to grasp. From the modes i've played it's just capping♥♥♥♥♥♥ I've only played for about 4 hours so I can't really say anything about much else. So far, I think most should pass on this, unless you're insanely bored, or don't have a better mmo to play. There are many f2p games out there that are much better.   EDIT: I would also like to point out that the battle system, isn't anything great. It's your same old tab target and stand still system. As I said before, there are MANY other mmo's that do this better.*EDIT: As much as I bash Tera, it is WAY better than this.			"

												love the game you can play solo or with a friend (i go solo).the enemy's are sometimes reused with different names but i don't mind.for dungeons it says a recommend lv so its about your lv but don't go above it by 1-2 lvs because the boss may be hard for you.the main city (ignea) whitch is the first big town or city whatever you call it is pretty bare you don't find very many people considering its so big in size.one problem for me is that the quest are mostly the same ill tell you.1 may be a kill enemy quest or gathering (sometimes both).2 you really have to kill every enemy in the area once for a quest then move on to the next area.3 the quests do sometimes get repetitive kill,gather,maybe a boss once and awhile.that's all i have to say about the game but if your looking for a new RPG MMO to play i would recommend this game.simple controls and great for beginners trying RPG'S			"

												I read so many bad reviews about the game either from the press or just here so it took me so long to hop on and try it. I started playing out of boredom when heavensward didn't seem to cut it for me and i'm so happy i did because i'm glad.This game takes every single good mmorpg system and just delivers it in a very polished and tweaked maner. Small details here and there. It is very standard and very expected. Quest hubs, typical class's with dual specs, instances, etc etc. The hole thing is very common but yet very well done and tweaked to be very enjoyable.I really like this game and so far i didn't find any cons to it yet. I will maybe find some bad things to say about it along the way or at max level, but so far it is the most enjoyable mmo i played since a very long time and i like it.Nothing fancy like wow killer, or super inovation for the sake of inovation, just a very solid mmorpg like they used to make back in the days with some tweaks and flavor that makes the difference.

												Echo of Soul is a very beautiful and charming mmorpg. The story is well written, rich, and offers both humor and an intense fantasy feel. Characters and landscapes alike are total eye candy, detailed and full of depth. Interface and gameplay wise, EoS shares basic features with other mmorpgs, but has its own unique style. Character movements are smooth and well adjusted, and the GUI is very pleasant and easy to navigate. As a diehard fantasy rpg fan, I highly recommend Echo of Soul to other likeminded.			"

To add some context first for my opinion:I played or tried many MMORPGs, few of them for a bit longer time. However, all of them grew boring rather quickly, so I do not particularly like MMOs, mainly because of the slow progression / grind and the very static worlds, as there can be no big changes resulting from your actions, as the next player must have the same content available.I am also not interested in PvP, so I cannot say anything about this here.The playtime recorded by Steam might be rather low, when you read this, but I played the game for a longer time before, as it was released on Aeria Games' own website some time before the Steam release.GAMEPLAYI gave Echo of Soul a fair try, as with those other games. In the end I must say, that I am positively surprised.The PvE balancing and Quest goals are done in a way, that does not halt your progression through the game. The flow feels like Diablo 3 i.e. you keep moving through the game without being forced to stop and grind in one area.They also use the phasing system that games like World of Warcraft used, so that the world around you actually is able to change in response to completed quests. For example, early in the game you arrive at a town, which is on fire and overrun by enemies. After you save it, the world changes and the town is normal again, functioning as a regular in-game hub with merchants and players etc.VISUALSThe graphics and design are nothing new or spectacular, but EOS does look very nice and inviting. In addition it has it's own charm, as you can create quite extravagant characters. You have a variety of unusual hair and skin colors to select from and the size slider has a big range as well. It is not as expansive as some other games, but definitely good enough to not be limiting.CASH SHOPI read in other reviews, that the game feels Pay to Win for them. Looking at the items available on the Cash Shop, I can understand this notion, as some items seem quite powerful. But in all the time I played, I never actually felt compelled to buy anything there, as the game's balancing does not feel, like I would really need any of them. The only thing that really is of interest, are the extended bags, as there is quite some loot to carry around after some time of play. Even the standard mounts, of which you get one very early in the game, are sufficient, so you do not need to buy a better one.TECHNICALI did not encounter any serious lag or other technical issues. The game ran smooth and stable for me. There was only some lags on the release day, a couple of weeks ago, but that is completely normal for an MMO. I read that some people's Antivirus software is giving warnings, but this also happens with many online games, as the Anti-Hack tools can be seen as false positives by those Antivirus tools. I personally did not have this issue.BOTTOM LINEEcho of Soul is nothing new or extravagant. It is competent, solid and the actual gameplay is done in a way that it is entertaining without any grind. It might not be made for the hardcore players or those that want a great PvP game. But if you are looking for a good time in PvE, Echo of Soul is definitely worth a try.TL;DR:Overall I can recommend it. Good PvE, no grind, Cash Shop can be ignored without problems. No lags or other technical issues that I saw. "

												I  don't wanna Judge too much the fact that i only played this game for only an 1Hour. But i did watch a lot of gameplay/ Review. And tbh this game isn't anything out of ordinary and bad.1- Graphics. /ArtThe graphics looks like from 2010 but of course we don't play for the graphics but the game concept itself.2- OriginaltyNothing special at all. Skills/ classes same as always,quest same. I'd say worst even. The start/beginning were lacking so much i had no idea what to do aside from talking to that woman.3- Charater creation.Gender lock. Don't have anything to customize. 4- Gameplay.You play with a freaking mouse lmao. WASD Control, It's not bearable. Those who said this game is fun i don't really get it lmao. I just can't stand the fact that you control the view with a mouse.If you guys really want something special and fun to play, i'd suggest tera or even better wait for Blade and souls or Black desert. I had more fun playing boxhead co-opFrom the experiences i got from mmorpg ( i played tera rising before when it's not in steam )			"

												So, I didn't put alot of time into the game, fair enough, but if I have to put 40+ hours into a game before it is worth playing, there is an issue anyways. Not enough people get that, but that is a different issue entirely.Truth is I didn't have an issue with the graphics, or the cash shop, or the classes, it's the world, too small of zones, too many load screens. there is an area right after you begin that has a forest, and its just a lot of small rooms with a wall of trees surrounding it. The game itself is ok enough, it is very generic and bland, but the constant kill three mobs move to the next room to turn in quest, rinse and repeat is almost insulting.			"

Luckily, my antivirus noticed the games files trying to alter SOMETHINGin win 32 and blocked it. so its been officially flagged as ""not ok"" by my anti virus after crashing. not during install.

												just wanted to share my opinion on this gamei´ve played wow for over 9 years, was a couple of years in a progress hardcore raid guild and played in 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5 with a rating over 2k easily..in my wow years i paused often and played a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of other mmorpgs and to tell you the truth..this is the first after wow that i think i can spent a couple of years with. the graphics is a typical anime-esquee style but not as cheesy as others and after a couple of minutes you get used to it if you never played games with this kind of graphicsit has typical runes and jewel stuff to upgrade your equip and you can awaken your items to shot the ""hidden potential"" which are similar to random enchantments i guessthe quest system is symple and easy to understand with nice direction and distance tips and changing markings on the map when the monster you need to hunt movesbut the most awesome thing about this is the actual combat..as a wow ""veteran"" i loved the challenge in pve, dodging, moving and calculating everything to get the most dps or whatever and this game is one of the few that has this kind of combat systemanother big plus is the soul system which is something fresh and new for me: monsters drop chaos souls which can be purified to one of four different ""soulds"" and those souls act as special skills that ingrease stats for a short period of time and are pretty awesome to kill bosses in solo dungeons (havent tried 5 man dungeons yet) and i must admit that the difficulty of those solo dungeons arent to be underestimated and are really fun and challengingoverall i have to say that this game is ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME and you should try it..i dont know about the p2w part because im not 60 yet and tested the end content but you can get mystical eggs or something which is similar to ap ( the real money currency) but anyway...it is a great mmo and im probably going to play it for a long time and you should test for yourself if you like it or not :D			"

												I played during the CBT and now in OBT - up to lvl 60 with war protector - Lxsd on EU-serversEoS is very polished for a F2P, graphics aren't astonishing but pretty, classes and skills offer a variety of gameplay and builds very satisfying. The UI is very user friendly and compiles a lot of cool features (e.g. inventory manager). Early levels a bit boring, the game really starts around lvl 50. The progression until then is a grinding & quests or PVP battlegrounds.The soul and crafting systems are also interesting and featuring a lot of cooperation aspects (coop refining, complementary jobs). They are maybe too simple and straightforward (small amount of materials, recipes), do not offer a lot of different specs but at least they give useful items.The cash-shop offers a lot of stuff, like mounts, vanity items and boosters. The costumes aren't coming with any statistic, only vanity. Some boosters are available (4% atk/def, 30% pvp marks, +100% xp/gold) - the rest is mostly convenience such as character slots, bags, and other crap. Most items are tradable and available for gold at the AH, so people who don't spend can still access almost every item item that could break the balance - EoS honeypots you to spend some cash but is not P2W imo - i bought a founder's pack to access CBT and get the limited edition mount but always got cash items vs. gold at the AH since then, including safegards. Pros:- Pretty graphics (except for these horrible ground textures :s), interesting lore- Variety of classes & gameplays- Good UI - user friendly- Interesting Crafting system + coop soul refining- All cash items tradable, therefore the AH is full of cheap cash items for Gold- Guild wars and other coop features- High level content & raids - bad♥♥♥♥♥sword for warriorsCons:- Instanced areas and channels (i'm not a fan of this system)- Gender-locked classes- Lack of low level coop dungeons (35/50 - adding a lvl 20 coop dungeon would be cool)- Polished but generic game- Lack of pvp battlegroundsIt's free and it's honestly pretty packed for a F2P, there is far worst crap on Steam atm - definitely worth the try.

												I can't find anything that's special about Echo of Soul except that you can purify souls.

This game is extremely easy and grindy, so I don't recommend it for anyone who wants something unique. Even the classes are the same old same old.Edit: I saw a quest today and to complete it you have to buy a lamp out of the cash shop.

												Echo of Souls is a beatifull made MMORPG with alot to describe but ill only do a shortreview now.It has good graphics, an interesting storyline, multiple well designed pre-set Classes andalot of Quests for the player to do if you believ the info over 1000+ quests for you to enjoy :3The Community is how it first seems based on about 3 languages english, german and afew french playersbut still friendly and not too mature.You have 60 lvl to climb and making your Soulkeeper look awesome on the go with many different typesof armor and weapons.The PvP is sadly nothing for beginners since the matchmaking puts lvl 15 players against lvl 40+ but the game balances that with a little passive that gives players under a specific lvl a hp and attack boost so they can actually fight back.Since the publisher is Aeria games the cash shop is sadly a bit expensive as seen on other aeria games but its not neededsince theres no real dmg buff or anything like that it is mostly just outfits and pets even though you get a free 1week pet at the beginning with a mail. This has been the review and i hope it helped but you guysshould make yourself an experience in the game itself so i recommend it to others who love putting in time tocreate a strong character designed to become a grea Soulkeeper!

												The game is okay feels very old and offers nothing new. If I had to compare it to something it'd be like Dragon Nest or a water down Vindictus clone but that's in terms of feel. The battle is not very action oriented just hit something then press a number and the character does it, not a lot of motions to be done or anything to be said. As for the shop I haven't checked in depth but most of the items seem to be for aesthetics only, nothing really major but nothing really life changing. Overall I recommend as something to do, if you don't like Dragon nest or can't run Vindictus.			"

												If you like playing games like Neverwinter, Terra, WoW or Guild wars, then this game is good for you to have some variation in your games or just to play someting new.The combat system is very convenient and very simular to neverwinter, WoW and GW.Key features of the game which I like are:  -PvP and PvE with lots of dungeons.                                                                      -Crafting and professions.                                                                      -Socketing system.                                                                      -Choosing different skill pathways.Things I like less but are imo not that important: -Lack of character customization.                                                                                - No real healers: only tank, dps or debuffing.I haven't seen anything like pay to win advantages, more paying for unique outfits or pets.Overal, this game is above average for a free to play mmorpg and I can definitely recommend this game for players who want something new or something for variation.

The Gem placement in the armours and solo / party dungeons that give Armour sets is quite an Enjoyable way to get gear. The game itself is very user friendly,  and has a Decent player market.

												Played before it was on steam.(ALOT)This Game in a Nutshell.Good Game ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Graphics ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Fps 52-62 on a high end rig which is atrocious considering the sub par engine and the graphics in general.But the Gameplay is really fluent and just leaves so many opportunities to personalize skills / movement to your advantage.50% of the Skills can be cancelled which exponentially increases your DPS in general but  especially in pvp.PVE Gameplay is decent , story is nothing new  not good ... but not bad either.But the thing when it comes to pvp is the same as in every other , cashers .... cashers everywhere ...BUT FEAR NOT , i haven't paid 0.00€ in my playtime of 970hours (raptr approves) and i♥♥♥♥♥♥on cashers about 80% of the time.The thing is when you can pay for something , you can usually craft it which requires more effort but will be rewarded.Or you trade good drops against the reallife currency , long words short story = play the game and you will be rewarded.Even if they have 10% more damage you can still outsmart them when it comes to mechanics.And if you think the game will be boring after 60 , ye that might be partially true BUT who said you have to stick with 1 character? Level others , change servers , make new accounts . That isn't a big deal and is usually no problem unless you don't enjoy the game.I personally enjoy the game , and of course i do recommend this game to everyone who enjoys MMORPGS and isn't afraid to put an enormous amount of time into it.Aye , forgot 1 thing. That's what happens when you fight a casher with full f2p equip and win.Normal Miss Normal , Crit Crit Crit Crit Crit Crit (RIP) ""HACKING ♥♥♥♥♥♥""  "

												This AMMENDS my original review of Echo of SoulIt's a free-roaming game with quite a few things to do. There are quests from the beginning and it is Massively Multiplayer on it's 3 servers.There is a main story line you can follow and so many side quests!It allows joining with friends, creating guilds (level 20) and raids.I do recommend this game			"

												I fine it really embrassing  and shameful that reviews have been disappearing for steam. When I first looked up EOS I found some extremely detailed reviews on this game, and now they are gone. I wonder why? SInce somehow they grew wings and disappeared I will hit the major points. 1. While this game is gemeric in every sense you can think of.2 Its not necssarrily a horrible game but, certainly if your looking for a mmo with potental to be competive mmo like others. You best look else where (3.) 4 The cash items and the system over all is meant to lore game whales  that will spend money to be gods in the game. I would only recommend this game as a time killer until other, more promising games comes. This game is not it.			"

												I finally got Echo of Soul to work and wasn't too impressed. I only played one class up to level 9 to at least give it a chance, but it didn't hold out.Playing to GameIn order to actually play this game, I downloaded it through Steam, only to have to download it again from the game's actual website. After transfering some files, the game could be played through Steam. If you're interested in checking this game out for yourself, a walkthrough on how to play it through Steam can be found at the following link. Just click on ""Getting EoS to work through Steam"" on the right hand side.http://steamcommunity.com/app/290140#scrollTop=1900Character ""Creation""First, is the classes. I'm not overly fond of classes after some of the other mmo's I've played where you can use any (or most) of the skills, equipment, etc. If you don't care whether a game has classes or not, then go ahead and disregard this one, it's just a personal thing for me.Second, classes are gender locked. Every warrior is a big, muscular dude with a big sword. Every rouge is a lithe dude who looks like a kid. Every mage is a little girl. You can customize their hair, eyes, face, the colors, and some sizes, and that's all free (at least at creation. I don't know if you can change it later or not). To me, this is picking a character to play and customizing their appearance a little.QuestsTo be completely honest, I skipped over the dialouge portion of the quests, so I don't have any story other than cutscenes and bosses. I found the quests to be lackluster. Even the MMO's I do like have some of this, but the quests seemed to be sending me to talk to someone, kill some monster, or get something. In addition, each quest was only one task long. While this does get you to the reward faster, it's not as challenging and, in my opinion, is just too simple. I faced, and defeated, two bosses before I was level 8, and that was solo. (that could possibly be a balancing issue, or it could just be simplicity itself).New, better equipment for your class is also given away as quest rewards. While this is useful in saving money and not having to bother with shops (I didn't even look at those), it further simplifies the game. If you ever have to use a shop, it'd probably be to sell things and clean out your inventory. Everything you need is given to you when you need it.SkillsAgain, I only played one class, and not for very long, so I don't have all of the details on this. What I did notice is that your skills are automatically learned and hotkeyed as you level. This does remove the hassle of picking out skills each level, but it also removes the ability to customize your class and play the way you like. Then again, you could just not use the skills you don't care for, but why have them anyway? I'm fine with getting preset skills in other RPG's, but I prefer to customize my MMO characters, whether it's their appearance, gender, or skills.Cash ShopMany free to play mmo's have this, so I'm not going to complain about it too much. They do have to make money somehow. However, there is at least one quest, albeit optional, where you are to buy something from the cash shop. You are able to abandon the quest, but there'll always be a marker in the second town for a quest you haven't done, because you haven't paid for it.GraphicsThe graphics were good, I won't complain about those. Characters and terrain are beautiful, monsters are appropirately hideous. This is a good 3D environment, with good character models. I experienced no lag at any point while I was playing. (Don't ask what my settings were at, I never checked.) The graphics may actually be the only thing I actually like about this game.ConclusionI wasn't very impressed as the game took too much effort to be able to work for a rather generic, simple mmorpg. There are some elements that are unique, but the overall gameplay reminds me of just about every other mmo I've played without the challenges. I didn't browse any shops, pvp, or anything like that. I had no need to check a shop for new equipment, and I've never been overly fond of pvp. If you'd like to give it a try yourself, the link to get it to work through steam is provided above and again below. Just click ""Getting EoS to work through Steam"" on your right.http://steamcommunity.com/app/290140#scrollTop=1900 "

												To be quite honest this game, after only a few minutes of gameplay, already feels like a lower-quality version of TERA. There are 4 or 5 classes, and your class choice also determines your race, so there's almost no cuztomization. Wanna be a heavily armored warrior? Then you have to play as a human male. My advice: Go play TERA. Better graphics, better classes, better gameplay, better UI, more customization, etc. There's no reason to play this game if you can run TERA.			"

												I would have loved to play this game as it seemed fun. Although I haven't played much of this game and some might say give it a chance, but this camera is just game-breaking aweful. I can't even really move my character. I have looked at all the settings trying to find some way to change this camera but to no avail. If I move my camera and walk forward I would like to still be walking the forward as to the perspective of my character. When I move my camera, using my mouse, in a circle and keep hold of W then I would like to walk in a circle. This happens when you use the arrow keys to move the camera, but then you would not be able to us much else of the keyboard. If I had a MMO mouse then maybe I would be able to do it, but this is just terrible. It's so sad that something like this would be the reason I can't play this game.			"

												I've only been playing for not even a day and yet I'm already enthralled in the game. Probably what sets this apart is the fact that it's fresh, clean, and crisp. It's not some cheap knock-off. The GUI and gameplay is very user friendly so you don't have to spend an hour and a half trying to figure out where the hell is what you're looking for. The beginning of the game is very flowing and doesn't suddenly drop a lot of concepts onto you rapidly like a lot of others do. It is a game that is simple enough for gamers who are new to the MMO to easily get into while still having enough to draw experianced players in. In short, these are the reasons to give it a shot.- It's brand new. Join the fun early and play as new content develops instead of trying to catch up.- It's for friggen free! Who doesn't love free?- The graphics and art is of good quality and yet not too much where it causes lag. Even my ordinary laptop can run it smoothly at 17 FPS.- Character customization. You can add/subtract height in body and legs which allows you to freely control your size as well as your face. Make it look like you if you want.- It has a great GUI that's easy to grasp even for new MMO players.- The community is great. I haven't seen any super ""hard core"" gamers that bash the newer casual players yet. If anything, they're a life saver. If someone of a signifigantly higher level tells you to do something, do it. You'll thank them later. Also because it's a new game, there are loads of new players that you can partner up with right at the beginning.- Minx had recently done a playthrough with the game on Youtube to give you an idea of what it looks like.-The skills have good synergy. They actually put in skills that compliment eachother if you play smart.- Each class branches off into two sub-classes early in the game. A warrior for example can branch early in the game to be either a protector which is a defence-heavy class to tank for friends, or a beserker to go all out and chop enemies into two. Two players of the same class does not nessisarily mean they play in the same way.Note that there are areas specifically designed for you to grind in, and as such is highly recommended. The goblin camp is the first place to grind in and you'll find that soon.One thing I think the developers could've done was make a male and female avatar for each class. Currently, there are five classes; two of which are male and the other three are female. As a man, it was dissapointing to see my favorite playstyle (mage) be only usable with a female avatar. I am sure it is the same way for women who love playing as warriors or rouges. For men who would rather not play as women, we're stuck with either playing as a warrior or a rouge. I'd very much like to see a male and female for each class evenly. Another thing is gaving to set up an Aria account but you'll run into that in the launcher and it's fairly quick and easy. Other than that, it's a great game that's freash out of the gates and just waiting for new content.			"

												I will give a personal experience of this MMO.First off, the graphics, in my opinion, were very good. Animation looked nice, presented well. If I were to give any criticism to the aspect of looks, it would be the UI. A lot of MMO's suffer a clutter of menus, chat boxes, maps, lists, and this one is no real exception. But with a bit of tinkering, you can get your layout a bit less cluttered, so it isn't a real problem.Second, the system. I feel this is an average system. Much of what I saw didn't surprise me, but it worked well enough. It's in fact simpler than a lot of MMO's, when it comes to upgrading equipment, purchasing and selling on the marketplace, etc. You'll get a hang of it quite quickly with the right intelligence.Combat was actually pretty well constructed, however, I do feel that fighting isn't very satisfying. Is it balanced? I feel in both PVP and PVE, the devs constructed it well enough to avoid too much inbalance. BUT, there is a catch that comes later... (see final paragraphs)Third, is it a fun MMO? I would say yes, but only to a point. The quests, as I expected going into this game, repeated themselves. A lot. I mean... a lot. Each time you wish to get to a new exciting area, there's this connecting path that will look the same, and will take you a good half hour to get through. The rewards for questing and adventuring are dull. Very dull. The best you'll get is a choice of either weapon A or weapon B. You get the one tailored to your Class skill tree. Done. Next repeat quest, ahoy! Rinse and repeat.At level 60 (cap) this game changes dramatically. If you were to go into PVP at level 60 with your new shiny level 60 equipment, expect to get MASSACERED. All of a sudden, you feel very weak. You have all these things to do, all the PVE grinding quests, dungeons, hunting grounds, farming, that it's all just too much. This is where I stopped playing.I tried to be a level 60, I tried. I even looked up a guide on HOW TO PLAY A LVL 60. The fact I had to do this, in my opinion, brought my rating for this game to 'eenope'. Frankly, it requires so much devotion of time, so much effort, getting shouted at by other players about doing things wrong. It isn't worth the dungeons, wings, and shiny equipment. Just don't bother. It'll suck the life out of you.In conclusion, this game can be fun, for a time. But I do not recommend it's worth anymore than a test play.			"

												I wanted to like this game: it has nice graphics, plays familiarly, and has a good atmosphere.  The problem is, I can pretty much describe that the same way about a lot of games on the market; EOS really doesn't bring anything new to the genre.  Developers need to stop being ""the World of Warcraft killer"" (especially for those of us who could care less about WOW) and come up with something new and wonderful.			"

												I was very skeptical at first when I started playing the game. I read the mixed reviews and stayed away from the game at first. However, I finally decided to give it a try since I really didn't have any other game to play. I must say that I am thoroughly enjoying the game and will be continuing to play this game for a while. I think it was the Battlefield feature that got me hooked. It is honestly alot of fun!!I also do like the fact that the quests in the game aren't like Super Grinds, basically do a few things in an area and you are onto the next. I have played previous games where some quests requires hours to complete, so far I have been moving throught the quests extremely fast.overall, I am impressed and would recommend this game.			"

												Absolutely not. Controls are pants, you've got your ""AWSD"" like normal... but no Q or E... unlike a ""normal"" mmo A and D do what Q and E normally do and the only way to turn your camara is hold down right mouse and moving it. Thankfully I don't, but seriously... Mouse clickers just can not play this game. you click on npc's with F, then quickly spam F to get your quest and run away so you don't have to hear the voice acting. not hot key options. not a very consistant 30fps on my PC which normally plays FF:XIV at 80+. The graphical options are pants too, for a game thats made for 2015 I find pretty much every other mmo prettier. This does not cut it in the graphic department... or sound effects... or visual effects... or even character customisation. I had the choice of 20(?) aweful hair styles for my gender forced guardian. Honestly I've played it for under 20minites and doing this reveiw was more fun.			"

												Overall the game isn't horrible, but leaves a lot to be desired. The game has no healer class, which leaves end game overcomplicated and bland. The game isn't entirely pay to win, but makes it pretty inconvenient to not spend money. Leveling is super boring, and you will complete well over 1000 quests by the time you hit level 60.

												""Play exactly how you want, when you want!"" Somewhere at level 16 there is a quest that makes you collect bear♥♥♥♥♥♥ This pretty much sums up the whole game for me. There are only two types of quests in the entire game; 1. Kill X number of identical enemies, 2. Collect X number of an item.The story is bland and tedious and player interaction is minimal. The combat is buttonbashing, because the skills have no  specific visuals or effect other than a minor difference in damage output. Also, it's pretty hard to get killed, except for dungeons, so no real challenges there either.BUT, for a free game, it's still pretty polished. The cash shop offers vanity items and temp buffs, so it's not really pay2win. Just try it out, if you're into sub-par casual MMO's.			"

												TL, DR: Best RPG MMO on the current market.Hi guys,I was searching for a long time a 'good old style' MMO RPG since the Guild Wars 1 has been abandoned. All of the others caused disappointment. But this is just as an RPG MMO should be, nothing special, but everything fit.Pros:-good combat system, skill based, so you have to use your brain, but thanks for the popping up Q and E skills it is still dinamic.-a lot of very simple but very good solution, like: you can change the graphics settings just by two clicks (literaly), for example in PVE area you keep it on max, but when you join PVP you can choose a lower setting to eliminate the unnecessary shining things and get extra FPS when needed.-although the questes are quite tipical, but some NPC are really funny, if you read the text of the questes.-graphics is good while it is still running well on older PCs too.-Set for European mind: Odin, Gehenna,... the anime feeling is very small.-good crafting system but you are not forced to craft if you do not want: in this case you can choose the resource gatherer profession and get money on it.-according to my experience it is NOT pay to win.-community is helpful and they tipically can behave on an adult wayCons:-too fast respawn, sometimes you have not even the chance to get the loot and the mob is already there again.-lack of dedicated healer profession-sex locked preofessions, but it is not a big problem, professions generally fit for the sex (male warrior, female sorceress,...)Overall, it's obvious that it has been created by an MMO-experienced team.

												Lijkt veel op Aion maar dan veel beter en mooier, alleen kan je hier niet zweven maar heb je wel al vanaf level 5 of zo een mount.Uitrusting en wapens veranderen dikwijls in je quests dus het is altijd leuk om te questen.Het craften daar ben ik nog niet uit, net als de hobbies maar ja ik ben nog maar level 15.In het begin lijken de zones erg kort met op bijna elke hoek weer een nieuw portaal maar later kom jegrotere zones tegen.De muziek is ook echt mooi.

												This game....Aethestically its pleasing not anime themed. Movement is point and click. The skill system is decently thought out, and is a plus in this game. The combat is pretty fun. You get a mount early on in the game which is nice. A problem with this game is the game progression. Each map there is a little exit portal at the end. If you are targeted by an enemy you are not allowed to leave that section of the map. So for one are there are like 8 sections that you need to progress through and after you go through a portal there is a super fast mini load. As you progress in the game its mainly kill and collect quests. Through quests you do not need to worry about getting new equipment or potions/scrolls to restore health/mana.Another problem is that there are no stores or areas you can buy/sell stuff. All the loot gets accumulated in your inventory and there is nowhere to sell or buy stuff.  This entire time I have been playing there has only been one spot to sell/buy stuff and that was the beginning. More problems incoming(O.O)...the classes are race and genderlocked. I do not think there are multiple races but the classes are genderlocked. I chose a gaurdian class and it was locked to be a female. This game is not really a game I would continuously play. What stopped me from playing more is that there are no towns/merchants to sell my loot. So I have to pick and choose what to keep in my inventory.			"

												The game is great and keeps you going, but what keeps you going is pointless. It's just quest after quest. There honestly isn't a storyline and the classes are gender specific. I recommend the game if you are brain dead and like to go from meaningless to meaningless quest, otherwise, just pass.			"

												Play Dualist. EOS is an average MMORPG. It got the combat good but essentially you will manage with only 2-3 attacks or tactics. You get a fiesta of those attacks, way too much to remember what they do and for what. The missions gets repetitive very fast after level 19-20, and it's missing variety. The main quest gets completely lost after level 20...the game should keep getting the attention of the players with more in-game cutscenes but it completely vanished or became too far apart. You might continue for the leveling but certainly not for the story at that point. Equipments can be upgraded with jewel and runes outside the profession system, which is nice since the profession system feels totally useless and a pain to process. It feels like the profession was done after the main game to some extend...I don't know...I tried it for a good while but couldn't see the point of it so I decided to invest zero time in it. I sell the ingredients and it has zero impact into the game. So not the strongest of system. Another system is the one related to the Souls snatchel. Processing them give you a buff of something. I process the souls because there is a counter of totals of souls but you can completely skip the buff since it's impact in combats is somewhat minimal. It's fun to find dungeons that are solo, but that area of exploration is far and between. You get some pets that gets the items for you (very nice) and a mount that isn't fast enough. I suppose you can buy better (unless Aria games doesn't lock your account because your Paypal email is different then your account email-fix after 3 days). The graphics are fine by me, some better then the others. I say the textures, the characters and water are very nice. The modeling of the levels can be very basic at times, and most of the time you switch from 2-3 small areas, to a larger one. This can be annoying in terms of loading time, but they are not too long. I won't say it's the best game out there but I would give it a 60%.Update: I got a bug that was  kicking me out of the game always at the same location and same place. This happenned after a recent update, search internet, etc... I tried to get support and even post on a forum on steam: Failed all the way. So I keep my review the same way but be warn.			"

You can only buy headwear and so on in the store but NOT some kind of boosts or anything.-Decent graphics -The dungeons are well desinged in my opinion. -There are tons of quests so they can keep you busy for quite a long time(1000+ quests)-It's very friendly to new MMORPG players-I like it that you can control the sound beetwen the storytelling screen.Cons: AERIA GAMES I would rate this game 8/10.

												A lot of the negative reviews I have been reading are all to do with launch issues. Fair enough, this MMORPG will not appeal to everybody but none do (including WoW). This is a F2P game and by no means pay to win. Of course it is possible to level faster and gain weapons/armour sooner if you pay (as I have) but it is just as easy to unlock it. Crafters will be rewarded much more than those who pay and the auction house is a great way of getting some cheap gear.If you are looking for a great, free game to sink a couple of hundred hours into then this is one to try.Also, the only reason that I don't have much game time is because I do not play this game via Steam!

												The game is fun but the gear looks the same at lvl 20 as it does at lvl 5 so thats something they might think about and the only way to get unique gear is by playing PVP and buying the gear with the points you recieve there, i like this game cuz its not a group depended game like most MMORPGs are (you can level upp to 60 all by yourself without needing a group for dungeons or quests). The Game is'nt pay to win at all in my opinion, yes they have in-game stores that require real life money but they only offer mounts, pets and outfits (which dont give any stats) so really the game is pay to look different. Overall i recommend the game and i give it a solid 7/10. Enjoy!			"

												I have to say this has to be one of the best games I've played in a long time. I love it and it isn't as annoying to level up in as compared to games like Lord of the Rings Online. The way it is set up is simple and comfortable to use and in my opinion blows most games away. There are a lot of quests to do and they are pretty simple and short to do compared to quests in games like RuneScape that can take hours even days to complete.Echo of Souls reminds me a lot of the game Rapelz which is a game I played a lot before getting a new computer and was never able to find again. It is easy to get engrossed into this game and hard to walk away from. This MMORPG is definately one I'd recommened to new gamers as well as veteran gamers. The graphics are impressive and the game runs smoothly. The only problem I can see is the fact that the 5 choices of charector tipes are gender locked, but that doesn't really decrease how much I like this game.I'd like to thank the people who made it for bringing such an awesome game into existance.

												Nothing special, it's another generic MMO but totally playable and with unique storyline. >PROS:-Graphics are not bad.-Unique storyline.-Very intuitive for any mmo player (P was for character, I for inventory, K for skills, L for quests, etc like Aion and such.)-Easy to adapt and mess around with the settings.-I've found not much grinding, but i'm still on low levels so I can't really tell.-Rewards for consecutive logins.-Mechanics are just like most MMOs.>CONS:-Quests are dull and repetitive.-Gender-locked classes.-Very anime-like characters (Personal opinion but I believe mmos should fit everyone).-By default you are put on the Highest settings.-Offers no exploration of the surroundings.-Shows you alot of content but you'll be stuck to click and cast an enemy the whole game.I rate this game 6/10 simply because I like the overall aspect and story. It has no innovation whatsoever, looks like any other MMO, nothing special in it, there are better F2P MMOs out there, only check this one out if you dislike grinding and like western lores.			"

I know that its not necessary to do these quests . But you cant just make quest-chain ending up with quests like this . I've played up to level 10 , and it really was pain . The gifting system (Lv.1 gift, 5 , 10 etc etc) is great . Pointless but great. You get ton of useless items you are not going to really use . It just doesnt work as  a game . I know that its just free-to-play . But there is alot of better games f2p than this . Maybe someone does like this game . But i spent some time in it . And i can say its not worth downloading .			"

												This is a great F2P game. The graphics are nice, the gameplay feels fresh, and the world is pretty large.The game isn't an easy walk in the park; with solo-dungeons being nearly impossible at the level they are unlocked (2 lvls above unlock is recomended).While there is a cash store, it doesn't feel as if it intrudes upon the game in a signifigant way compared to other games. Lots of quests keep the player busy, searching for new gear and lands to explore. The PVP is great for a new F2P game, with players being able to enter the battlefield at lvl 10. More content is being developed, and I intend to keep playing this game. A great RPG with professions, lots of gear, wide variety of enemies, numerous dungeons, periodic boss spawns in the open world, guild and guild wars, and battlefields make this a game worth the time to check out. And all of it is FREE!			"

It becomes very annoying to constantly move through those as well. The end game seems to be either pvp arena/battleground or mass spamming the same dungeons within the weeks rotation. This game doesn't have different factions, so you dont meet any ""bad guys"" that you need to take out unless you're in a guild that makes you hostile to some of the other guilds.			"

												I've played this game both before and after steam and am currently still playing it now through steam. The game is easy to play and get a ahang of. You can get pretty decent equips at lvl 10 just by doing the lvl 10 dungeon and getting your armour set. The soul system is very interesting and can help you in many different situations. Its a very fair game to play as in its not really pay to win I would call it play to win.			"

												If you enjoy the normal MMO experience then this is as bland as they come. Its hard to sum it up but ""bland"" seems to be the best fit as it is not as flashy as other MMO'S but on the other hand it is still fun to play...... Beware it does take around 4-6 hours to get to the social area of the game. on the MMO scale I would give it a soolid 6.5/10.			"

												This games is amazing but it has it's pros and cons.Pros:-The game is Free to Play you can get the best gear by just playing so it's not a P2W as some of you state. You can only buy headwear and so on in the store but NOT some kind of boosts or anything.-Decent graphics -The dungeons are well desinged in my opinion. -There are tons of quests so they can keep you busy for quite a long time(1000+ quests)-It's very friendly to new MMORPG players-I like it that you can control the sound beetwen the storytelling screen.Cons: AERIA GAMES I would rate this game 8/10.

												A lot of the negative reviews I have been reading are all to do with launch issues. Fair enough, this MMORPG will not appeal to everybody but none do (including WoW). This is a F2P game and by no means pay to win. Of course it is possible to level faster and gain weapons/armour sooner if you pay (as I have) but it is just as easy to unlock it. Crafters will be rewarded much more than those who pay and the auction house is a great way of getting some cheap gear.If you are looking for a great, free game to sink a couple of hundred hours into then this is one to try.Also, the only reason that I don't have much game time is because I do not play this game via Steam!

												The game is fun but the gear looks the same at lvl 20 as it does at lvl 5 so thats something they might think about and the only way to get unique gear is by playing PVP and buying the gear with the points you recieve there, i like this game cuz its not a group depended game like most MMORPGs are (you can level upp to 60 all by yourself without needing a group for dungeons or quests). The Game is'nt pay to win at all in my opinion, yes they have in-game stores that require real life money but they only offer mounts, pets and outfits (which dont give any stats) so really the game is pay to look different. Overall i recommend the game and i give it a solid 7/10. Enjoy!			"

												As you can see I only have about 10 hours playtime on Echo of Soul. I personally really enjoy this game, though admittedly it's nothing different or unique. However, I do recommend it:Pros+Large and friendly population (And it seems to be growing from what early players have told me)+Rewarding combat and there is a need to roll to dodge attacks being charged up by enemies.+Rewarding 15vs15 PvP from level 10+ (You play pvp with players from level 10 - 60 all in one game. Everyones stats are scaled to level 60 to balance out the gameplay.)+A very large world, especially for a new game, with currently 0 expansions or level cap raises.+Pretty game, the graphics are dated but it's still visually gorgeous.+Levelling isn't too slow or too fast. I reached level 25 in 10 hours. (Remember the level cap is 60)+Group dungeons from level 35+.+Innovative and interesting soul collection system.+Professions+Can choose one of two paths for each class at level 10. (Beserker or Protector Warrior for example)Cons-Rather generic, nothing we haven't seen before. (Though for some reason I enjoy this game a lot more than many similar titles.)-No innovative classes.-Gender locked classes.If you are looking for a fun, polished and rewarding MMORPG with a large, active community, I highly recommend this game.

												This game is what you'd expect out of an MMO. I was just looking for something to play casually while spacing out and this works just fine. I created a few characters just to mess with the character creator and it's not terrible, there are definitely games with a lot more limited character creator. I did notice though not a lot of people take advantage of what flexibility you do have since everyone seems to be pink skinned and white haired. I guess that even when you give people some room for creativity they tend to just all look the same which makes it hard to tell people apart. That's not the game's fault though. It ran perfectly fine on my computer in fact I wish there were higher settings. This game doesn't require a fast computer so mine was definitely overkill. I don't mind the gender lock since I don't care if I'm playing male or female. So far I've found myself leveling up my Rogue more than the others. I would like to find a game that has a really friendly and welcoming community but there never seems to be one. People just play the game and rarely interact and the fact that people would need the game to force them to group up just shows that there's no point in anti-social people playing MMOS. There are so many MMOS out there now-a-days though that the chance of finding enough people that play the same game regularly enough to be able to enjoy coming back and questing together is very unlikely. So as a solo player, the game is nice looking, runs smoothly, very stable and a good time waster. Just make sure you disable any programs running in the background that may be causing the anti-hack program to go off and interrupt your gameplay. It's a simple fix. Just make sure you have nothing running in the background.			"

												I am honestly surprised by this game, while it doesn't exactly shine in graphics or feel the most modern and polished mmo I have played. I find myself enjoying it a lot. Especially the PvP battlefields, they are fast paced generally capture point driven and combat is relatively balanced regardless of your level. (annoying stunlock still occurs, but that's every mmo I've ever played) It's free, there is a cash shop but I've found absolutely no need to actually use it, it's completely voluntary the way it is set up, and lets be honest if you put more than 20 hours into a game you should chip a few bucks the way of the company that provided it. Another feature I like is the ability to solo dungeons, it's doable as pretty much any class and any level. You can get all the gear in the game and never party up if that's the way you want to do things. You can also of course party up, the strangest mechanic there is there is no dedicated healer class in this game. It takes some getting used to. They compensate for that by making potions, revives, and heal scrolls easily and cheaply obtainable at the npc in game shops. I could go on for awhile but despite a lot of complaining and bad reviews I found myself considering this a good game, and will likely give it even more time, and maybe even spend a few bucks on that cash shop just to show my appreciation. Usually these korean cross over mmo's aren't very enjoyable, but this one reminds me of what WoW used to be before they turned it into the lowest common denominator crap that it is now. I highly suggest giving the game a few days and 20-40 levels to make an impression on you. If you can see past it not having the greatest graphics I'm pretty sure you'll find yourself enjoying it. Even though the server populations aren't very high right now, battlefield pvp and dungeon searches usually take only a minute or two and the more the merrier.			"

												First I gotta say that I enjoy the game and like playing it.  Nothing new or special really but that doesn't detract from playing the game for me which is why I recommend it.  The issues I have with the game don't break the game and make it unplayable and are more just annoyances.My only real issues with the game are that your limited on inventory space if you don't want to pay irl cash for the large bags to increase your space.  You can get 5 extra bags that have 6 slots on in them from questing but any more then that and you gotta buy them and you don't really make in game currency all that fast or at least I haven't.My other issue is with the professions.  You can have 2 secondary professions which are cooking and soul expert, but you can only have one of the 3 main professions. So you can get resource gathering which as it sounds you just gather resourses and do nothing with them.  The other two are alchemy and jewel crafting.  Note that the issue is that without resourse gathering you can't get the items you would need for the other two professions.  So you can't work on the crafting professions without help and the gathering one juse leaves you with a bunch of resources you can't do anything with besides sell them since you don't have the inventory or stash space to hold onto them for when you replace the gathering profession with a crafting one.Like I said I still enjoy the game and enjoy playing it but those points just bother me and make the main professions not worth your time to do unless you have a friend who can do the gathering portion for you or you can gather resources for a friend to use.  If not go with the gathering profession and then sell your mats to other users.			"

So far it runs smooth just a little laggy an stuff (probably cause of meh lovely computer) But i'm only lvl 9 so it might get boring after lvl60 as i see ppl saying... but im just waiting for mods (haven't seen any if there is or there might never be no mods)			"

												So after playing to lvl 15 (I know its not that much but it gave me a taste)I have to say that this is a good solid MMORPG, does it do anything exotic or new? well if you consider removing all the annoying SH*T that most ofther MMORPGS have like ""Kill 20 wolves but somehow only loot 3 wolf fangs that you need for a quest"" nah nah nah, in EOS you kill 20 wolves for a quest, they damn right drop 20 sets of teeth for you to pick up (hyperbole but you get the idea). This RPG is great for new and old players alike, the swords are lovingly bigger than Guts ""Dragonslayer"" and the armor is flashy and stylish like in games like TERA. Id give it overall a 7.5/10, it would have scored 9/10 if not for the games one little problem. this is that all the classes are gender bound, meaning you you can only be a male warrior and rogue, while every other class is female. im sure this is great if the devs thought they were going to attract a ton of female gamers and guys that love playing as women (eww but whatever floats your boat) but in most MMORPGS i try and roll a male wizard or something similar, but in this game decided to try out a warrior for the sole reason that its one of the few male classes, which in an age of games giving you huge control over customization and making your character unique seems like a HUGE oversight. but thats just my take on thing.overall 7.5/10			"

												A great, decently paced MMO. Similar gameplay to that of GW2, but slightly more advanced. (At least I think so). A complex battle/talent system to keep anyone entertained. Not to mention an interesting story that drew me in right away. So, I would recommend trying out this game. And remember, if you don't like it you can always uninstall it. Never hurts to try something new out!			"

												It's pretty good.  I wish the classes could be either male or female, but besides that the character design has a good amount of choices.  I really like the levelling system too.  I enjoy having to decide which two abilities I can take and which one I can do without at each ""branch.""  Customization is important and too many games ignore it.  I have only made it to level 48 so far, but the quests are well written and engage you in the history of the world - if you take your time to read them.  9/10 as far as free to play games go :D			"

												A completely standard korean ""F2P"" MMORPG. Only slightly prettier...I have sampled what can be sampled of this oevre and there is nothing spectacular or innovative about this game. I'm not sure how much the game picks itself up towards the end and when you reach the level cap but honestly, what more can there be? utterly generic and inordinately dull. so...why am i still playing? i keep thinking there must be something here and i'm going to find it. i mean, there has to be some good things? the pvp is fun, if you are into pvp, but even the really good mmo's have good pvp, so...i don't know, if you are curious you should at least give it a try, however if you enjoy a deep story and interesting quests...stay faaar away from this title. I'm still recommending it because it is nice looking and i enjoy the art and the music, and as i stated above, i'm still playing it myself in order to find those redeeming features.			"

												i played this game to level 28. I decided i like it and wanted to purchase a mount and some new bags. First mistake i made was wanted to purchase anything in this game. One you can supposely only purchase one item at a time during your first time purchase from them. Ok i can take that no problem right. So i say ""ok, i go ahead and try to at least purchase the mount"".I do transaction and it goes through and i receive a e-mail confirmations how sweet. I was still online with my game on. So thinking i dont see anything added to the game. Then i thinking like most game you must log then relog back in to see the results.Their hence comes the problem i get locked out of my account cant play or reach them. I try to reach their customer service but cant since my account is now block. Which means your password wont work to reach them.I have never ever gone through this purchasing items in any game i played and i played a ton. I have purchased most my games from steam. I feel steam should remove games from this game company. They obviously don't know how to run a company or out to steal from steam customers. If you are already playing this game ""Be very warned do not purchase anything from this company.""I have made contact with the support team. I like to thank them for quick response they have reactivated my account. I did receive the ap points i bought. I bought the item's i wanted and now playing with them. I had about giving up on this game and company. But thier quick action has shown me the do care about their players and will try to fix your problems if you patient enough. I do like the game and hope others do play it. I just wanted to let other players known not to fear buying items and getting temp ban.  If it does happen dont worry send in a ticket and it will be fix they will just have you send in a new password and then log in as normal. It took them one day and thats probably cause it was sunday it happen to me.			"

It's a free to play game, don't expect it to shine and make you lose your life over it like bigger titles, it's simple, straightforward and you know from the start what you have to do. I'd like to say that the PvP is quite entertaining (not just battlefield), ""open world pvp"" is also enjoyable. I never dug much into the PvE aspect of the game, but yeah, it works.Give it a try, it's free after all!			"

I mean really, HOW and why would a person just have so many psychotropic herbs that they can just go 'here have some psychotropic herbs, maan'.

												First look with a friend of mine was very terrible... the game graphics aren't bad but they are deff not the greatest overwall. I absolutely hated this game also we had a bad glitch I think.. when we loaded in it didn't even show our character customizations. The creatures look okay, but it is not an MMO that I would recommend on playing.. it is also very difficult to kite the creatures as a sorceress. If you want a good quality MMO I would suggest Blade and Soul..  graphics are nice, customization is nice, everything about it overwall is pretty good and far better than this game			"

												This game....Aethestically its pleasing not anime themed. Movement is point and click. The skill system is decently thought out, and is a plus in this game. The combat is pretty fun. You get a mount early on in the game which is nice. A problem with this game is the game progression. Each map there is a little exit portal at the end. If you are targeted by an enemy you are not allowed to leave that section of the map. So for one are there are like 8 sections that you need to progress through and after you go through a portal there is a super fast mini load. As you progress in the game its mainly kill and collect quests. Through quests you do not need to worry about getting new equipment or potions/scrolls to restore health/mana.Another problem is that there are no stores or areas you can buy/sell stuff. All the loot gets accumulated in your inventory and there is nowhere to sell or buy stuff.  This entire time I have been playing there has only been one spot to sell/buy stuff and that was the beginning. More problems incoming(O.O)...the classes are race and genderlocked. I do not think there are multiple races but the classes are genderlocked. I chose a gaurdian class and it was locked to be a female. This game is not really a game I would continuously play. What stopped me from playing more is that there are no towns/merchants to sell my loot. So I have to pick and choose what to keep in my inventory.			"

												I've played the game from Founder's Beta before it came to Steam. It's a free to play game, don't expect it to shine and make you lose your life over it like bigger titles, it's simple, straightforward and you know from the start what you have to do. I'd like to say that the PvP is quite entertaining (not just battlefield), ""open world pvp"" is also enjoyable. I never dug much into the PvE aspect of the game, but yeah, it works.Give it a try, it's free after all!			"

												Another Aeria Game but this time, the semi-ordinary 'foreign MMO experience'- also known as only women can be mages and archers and men are the ones that use incredibly large weapons. Not to mention the incredibly weird things like HOW A RESIDENT IN MNEMOS HAS AN 'AMPLE SUPPLY' OF PSYCHOTROPIC HERBS. I mean really, HOW and why would a person just have so many psychotropic herbs that they can just go 'here have some psychotropic herbs, maan'. This is an incredibly weird game but it's also semi-addicting.			"

I tried to fix it but once I unblocked it I encountered an error and just gave up.It doesn't look like a bad game but Steam needs to include a bit of quality control. Hundreds of other users and myself are unable to play due to a serious game breaking issue that has driven many people away from playing this game.			"

												People are trying out this game expecting it to be the next thing that takes this genre to an all new level.It's not. I doubt it was intended to be so too. It's a very generic bare boned MMO with okay mechanics. You may like this game but if you are wanting something that is new to the this genre, then what you're looking at (and probably rating after trying) is the wrong game.I enjoyed my time on it and have not one complaint for it and I don't see any P2W garbage.

												The game's art looks amazing, it looks amazing on high settings too... but it seems like the game is way to heavy on reskined quests (look alike or copy and paste quests) and the game is not really focused on the storyline. I guess you can like it if you love grinding to death to gain 1 level, even though I got to level 25 - 27 in under 3 days with no sleep it just doesn't seem worth my troubles.Again the game looks amazing but I would like to see them put effort in the missions, we are talking about doing the same things over and over: Talk to *Generic NPC*, Save *Generic NPC*, collect stuff for me... blah blah.at least provide us with some sort of difficulty? with our grinding quests...I will recommend this game though..

 For all those not wanting to read through my review... This game is 8/10....  ALSO PLEASE SCROLL ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM TO READ SOME EASY LEVELING TIPS AND MAKIGN MONEY IN GAME  Now anyone who sees this game would easily say that this is a watered-down version of FF14,  however  , I beg to differ.Echo of Soul (EOS) is a game that targets to make its own take on things. Beautiful worlds, great mechanics/ animations, and hours of addicting fun. The game is quite difficult proving that there are no healing roles whatsoever, so keeping a watch on your health bar is an absolute must. This game isn't so hard in the leveling process, as grinding is not really required. You don't rake up xp as much as you do grinding helpless creeps for hours but rather doing quests in a timely manner. This was done in order to make the player feel rewarded for their quests and accomplished for doing something to progress the game.  seriously though, do the quests   NO PAY TO WIN This game doesnt require pay to win at all. It was setup so that the player gets often rewarded for leveling up, questing, earning achievements,a nd also winning in pvp matches and gamemodes. The store only offers ""outfits"" that are costumes for your characters and you can wear on them. These outfits have no effect but change only the outer appearance of what your character is wearing. All the armor can be found in game :) ROLES/GAME The roles/classes each have their own unique abilities and feel to playing that you can easily tell each other apart. However, each class has 2 specific paths in which you can take in order to level your skills, giving the player the freedom to play how they want when they want.Speaking of which, there are jewels that players can ""inlay"" into their equipment that give mighty buffs. Combining these jewels, if you have more than one, will boost the effects given to that jewel if it will be laid into the  specific piece of equipment.  confusing i know, but its easy to understand when you see  In terms of  freedom  the roles are gender locked, so you cant be a body-building girl warriror  sad i know. DUNGEON/PVP This has a great dungeon and pvp aspect in the game that give both high risk and reward. If in any case you may die in a dungeon or in the world you would face a durability loss on equipment and would have to repair. PVP is different however in which you can die however many times you want and get either a consolation prize or a victory prize after the match. This has smart matching so you can do wahetevr you want while you wait.   Now for the tips  I cant stress this enough but just enjoy all the game for what it is. For easy levling do the daily quests for the pvp. You need to play 2 games (win or loss) and there. You get basically a level and lots of money. Money is a bit difficult to aqcuire in the game, but is super easy to buy and sell as everything, and i mean EVERYTHING is 1 silver. (excluding all the rare stuff).From completing the pvp you get either a consoloation jewelery box or a victory jewelery box depending if you lost or won. After open and i suggest you save those jewels to create greater ranking jewels. Selling a +5 dull ruby on the marketplace you can make an easy 75 gold.I think those are good odds considering that 1,000 silver make 1 gold LOLAll in all, a great game worth playing. Enjoy!			"

												Tested this in the beta and found nothing to catch my attention.Tested this again now and it's pretty empty.Not a bad early game, has some good features and they're not too confusing. A very forgiving price range on start level consumables. I'm not playing this because it is largely an empty place - avoid NA server, whaever you do!The one irritating feature is it's aimed at throwing you quickly through the levels. I know that to many, this is an attractive feature. A game that at start feels as if it would actually offer a bit of resistance quickly shows that it's made to be super easy. Still, always neat to see the features of these games...gotto playtest them all, no? A hesitant thumbs up - and go EU, wherever you are.			"

												this game does have a linear feel while having a free roaming feel at the same time. The problem comes when making your character. Unlike other mmorpgs, if you chose one class, then(as far as I know) you have to stick with the gender that was provided with the class. It makes it difficult to choose what you want to be and be the gener you want to be at the same time. Past that though, this can be a good game to play.			"

Posted: December 20, 2015
												I will catalog this review the best I can to get straight to the point in each topic I feel a person should know before they play this game. Overall I want to focus less on my experience on other MMO's I have played and tell you why I continue to play this one.1)Leveling-So as I said in my very brief Intro, I am going to get straight to the point and not fluff anything. Somethings about this game could be better, but most things work very well as are, and ""If its not broken dont fix it"". Leveling in this game is hands down my least fave part of playing. I have 3 level 60 characters(Max Level) and I havn't enjoyed leveling a single one. I still love this game and heres why. This games content is tailored to level 60 characters, and leveling is a very repetative yet still fairly easy process if you just quest. Quest over and over. Doing battlefields will give you experience to level but only will make you level faster than questing if you have close to a 70% win rate. I say rush to max level as fast as you can. 2)Guilds-Many players have a different opinion on who to make friends with (or not make friends with) and why. For many players they join a guild because it's mainly there nationality(Brazil Im talking to you). There are many guilds to choose from, and many guilds choose to fight monsters while many choose to fight players. I prefer to fight players so I picked a pvp guild and I still get to do just as many raids or dungeons as I would have had I not picked a pvp guild. Choose one early in the game to ask questions and make friends. Being in a guild is very rewarding and often helps you learn things the easy way rather than playing the game ""in the dark"".3)Gold becomes a thing of desire once you hit level 60. Gold is not needed in any way before level 60 if its your first character. If its your second character or later it can help you to get better gems which make leveling faster, but the game drops enough of them naturally you wont need to worry about it your first run through. Gold is your vehicle to get what you desire. EVERYTHING in this game that effects combat can be purchased with gold. You will have the fastest access to making gold in level 60 raids and dungeons. Or buy and sell goods on the market place if you study it before hand.4)Gems-Gems are extra items that attach to a players gear to make a player stronger(extra stats). They are a very important part of the game, but often highly over glorified. As a player with 3 level 60's I often play in pvp ""gemless"" and still compete just fine for MVP. This game isn't that hard if you always are trying to learn what you can do better in a given situation. Gems are luxury!!! Now dont ignore them 100%, they can be a great way to make gold, and a great investment into becoming a stronger player. Far too many players blame their gems as the reason they are losing, when more importantly people with very good gems MOST of the time have better gems because they are better players, although I have beaten many players in flat 1v1 situations having worse gems. I have average gems because i refuse to spend money on this game. Hear that? Never spent a single penny. 5)Dungeons-Dungeons before level 60 are very important and let me tell you what to do and what not to do. Before level 60 do the dungeons just to learn the in game mechanics on bosses, becuase the dungeons you see before level 60(or the bosses) you WILL see again. Focus more on improving as a player in dungeons, than the gear. Going through the same dungeon before level 60 is a flat waste of time once you learn the mechanics. Yes it will give you good gear, but I argue your gear would be better if you spend that same time questing into higher levels over farming a dungeon. NOW AT LEVEL 60, the dungeons are good for gear, and will start to bring a lot of gold. They drop gems and become a true test to your understanding of the game. Do not be upset if people lose their tempers with you in a level 60 dungeon. A lot of players are so used to the dungeons you may be new too, that they dont understand why you are still learning the bosses. My best peice of advise, let good friends or guild members take you to your first lv 60 dungeons to help you grow.6)Events-Now this game like many MMO's has holiday events. The events in this game so far are more community builders than actual content events, although some events still bring exciting content into view. I argue this is something that Echo of Soul needs more focus on(Maybe through studying World of Warcraft events) But the EOS team has shown willingness to make this a larger part of the game, and i think much more is to come.7)Reward Drops-Hands Down my least fave part of this game. Most items in this game are worth 1 silver to sell to a vendor. Yes, 1 silver.... Now, I will not focus on that, as much as what Im about to tell you. There is no world rare drop system as in other very fun MMO's. This is something I hope very dearly will enter this game. We need to be able to go into a raid with our friends or guild hoping to get a SPECIAL MOUNT or special item that is ONLY available in that spot. Just by creating a system where some high value items drop very rarely, it creates a passion for players and a great enjoyment. A strong rare drop system allows people to actually feel rewarded for their time OUTSIDE of the personal satisfaction of completing a challenge. I love being challenged as much as the next person, but when you already know you are smart enough to figure them out eventually, a rare drop system keeps it very entertaining and exciting.8)Battleground-I have covered this a small amount already. Overall its just another way to test yourself. If you find yourself blaming your gems because you die, or your weak gear, it has partial truth. As a player who has been in a new players shoes, I still owned the noobs. Some people can mentally handle the learning curve that will come your way, and many run to excuses. Do the best you can and have fun! Try to learn and enjoy. There is 2 battlefields(3rd if you count Valhalla aka-guild war). Dont make excuses, if you arnt doing well ask others how they play your class in pvp.9)PAY TO WIN?-FLAT ANSWER NO! This game is 100% NOT PAY TO WIN. You may ask me why I feel that way, well heres point number 1, I have spent not a single amount of any type of real life currency on this game. I still can get beat, but as an experienced player of this game, I find when i get beat it was a result of my own failure of knowledge. Some players are going to be stronger than you, maybe their class ""counters"" your class. Yes crazy idea I know. When you see a situation like this in battle its best to not fight the 1v1 you think you will lose. I know many good players who wont win a lot of 1v1's. They are viewed as good players because they know when they do and dont have the advantage, and sometimes having your team with greater numbers is what it takes. Dont listen to anyone who says this game is Pay to Win, its a scapegoat and quite frankly, very poor excuse. This game can make your growth faster if you choose to pay, but with that still comes a lot of risk. I know a lot of people who have spent money and not gotten any stronger for it. Think outside of the box and learn the game and the answers will come to you.10)Last Thought-I find this game to be the closest video game to a much loved anime called SAO. Now that has nothing to do with my love of this game. I personally enjoy testing myself, which this game helps me do. And i love the vast majority of the community. Players here can be mean just like anywhere else, but I have made friendships and I enjoy the time I spend playing. This game far surpasses the time I could spend watching TV or playing another video game.			"

												Hands down the BEST MMORPG I have played so far! It has amazing graphics, good gameplay mechanics, missions that will keep you busy, many amazing items, and a crap ton of dungeons. This is the kind of game that will kepp you entertained for HOURS; No, DAYS. As far as I have gotten, it is 100% free to play. You are not required to pay for anything unless you want to. Solid 11/10 fo this game.			"

												Despise the fact that I gave this game a negative rating its not bad, but it isnt good either. The main problem with this game is that its insanely generic. Most modern MMORPG's bring somthing new to the table while this doesnt. Its your average theme park MMO with tab target combat and fetch/kill quests. Other then the character models the game is ugly, the UI is bland and the environments look horrible. The reason I excluded the character models is because they actually look pretty nice and have a stylized design. I havent played much of this game but I've played enough to reilize how bland this game is.			"

												Not terrible, but not good either. The graphics quality and framerate are both pretty low. The game also becomes pretty tedious due to its non-engaging story line. Basically you run around looking for a quest, kill a monster, turn it in, and repeat.  My largest complaint with this game is the movement system. Your viewpoint does not change when you turn left or right making you have to manually do it with your mouse. Also, you can't do this while you're walking or it will just go back to your previous viewpoint when you release your mouse. This makes gameplay pretty annoying.It's free to play though, so there's no harm in checking it out for yourself if you really want to.			"

												I've played a few hours already ang got to about level 20 and I think this is a very good game.  It reminds me a bit of Wow (World of Warcraft) with several things and that is great because I really enjoy that game.Like all games it's not perfect and the worst thing with this game is the lack of variety/ customisation.  There are only a couple of quests at a time, only a few jobs/ hobbies available and you cannot customise your character that much in the form of choosing specific traits to improve like agility or critical strike chance etc. when you level up.Also the matchmaking in PvP isa disaster because there are no level tiers and you can join a PvP match of mostly level 50s while you're only level 15.It may seem that I dislike this game, but I listed the only 2 bad things I have noticed so far while I find everything else quite enjoyable.

As said i've only just started and I am already finding the gameplay clumsy and choppy it weems to be working 30FPS over the standred 60FPS. I will give it a few more hours before I give it a out of 10 score but thus far its not looking good.			"

												Good game, no tedious quests, because the main part of the game is party dungeoing and pvping, guild worldpvp and raids which have pvp features!It's fun so far, sure there are a few cons. One of them is matchmaking on PvP. You can go PvP from level 10! But, be ready to go against 10-55 players. Which means that the team that has most low leved people will loose!Because at lower levels in PvP you have less skills and less damage.Wish it could go like 10-15, 16-21, 22-26 etc etc, but nah, it's all together and it makes really tedious times in PvP, lazy high level players do much less than low leveled players, which is pathetic. So your only hope is leveling up and have fun in PvP and higher levels!You still can be useful in PvP at early levels but 50% of what a high lvl can do, example is that you cannot 1v1 a lvl 25+ as lvl 15. Unless they have half their hp off. :)Overall i reccomend this game, hopefully they will add more options to matchmaking but questing wasn't tiring and im looking forward to the dungeons and pvp raids. It's still fresh and has a way to go.Don't listen to most of the reviews as they complain about the game being from AeriaGames, don't get me wrong, I don't like AeriaGames either but it has the best monitization system from AeriaGames. Nothing is P2W so far. And hope it stays that way. It doesn't take long to level to 60 casually.Be aware, it's like any other mmo out there, there is NO mmorpg that can feel as refreshing as your first ever mmorpg game, if it catches your attention for a while, good. If not, there's nothing to complain about because every mmorpg has done things everyone else did. :)Have fun playing.EU - Yggdrasil, Normie.			"

												This game made me so bored, about 45 minutes into the game, I made an attempt to talk to my family. As I thought that would be a better time. It advertises strength gain via enemy souls, However the only thing the souls are worth in the little amount I played were small buffs that lasted around 15s with a 2m cooldown, I thought that rather than passives, Actual leveling could be replaced by the idea of souls. Making the stuff you kill, strengthen different attributes, which would have probably kept me playing longer honestly. The art style was boring, and the only positive thing I can say for what little I played, Was that it had a decent amount of character customization when creating the characters. Its nothing new, Industry standard i guess.			"

												Terrible game. Feel no passion or love for what was created. Trying to rip off Final Fantasy XIV, and Tera. Quests that require buying things in the cash shop with real money, graphics are terrible. Story cinematic is incredibly bad. It doesn't make any sense what so ever. It's an absolute worst of time. Tera would be a much better game to play. This is a game that should belong on mobile or in a browser.			"

It could use some of the following (Like the devs would read this anyway)deticated areas where diffrent classes spawnMore ClassesDiffrent mounts for diffrent classesand the list will go on. Dont think im stupid, i know it is in open beta but theese things could attract more players quicker. <3 9/10 (9 from some of the small things they left out) "

												To be honest, I don't know why I'm playing this game.It's everything I hate in MMORPG, and I still like to play it.I don't like the way You need to wait for Your skills, andAfter 20 lvls I don't feel that my char got more powerfull at all...But I do like the way You can upgrade Your items,And I know I still need to play a lot to get to know this game more.The only cons is that even tho it's MMORPG game, You can feel MMO only in PVP.When You walk around doing quests You feel that with party there would be no sense,and dungeons seem to be solo too... Shame.Anyway let me still wonder WHY I EVEN PLAY THIS GAME.			"

												So I hate this game. The reasons why are as follows:1. You cannot live up to your own promises regarding your ""Advanced"" Character customization. Especially when you gender lock classes and you are too lazy to do hair physics for the majority of the 11 hairstyles you have available.2. Peers have informed me that this game contains little to no worthwhile content before level 60.For anyone looking for something that might be worth your time, try Arche Age. It might have flaws such as bugs and the economy (and of course the dreaded housing system) plus the quite obvious pay2win aspects including secondary currency and Patron status. But even then, the gameplay is dynamic and the classes are more versatile than any other game I've played. The Character customization is also absolutely STUNNING. It is very very well done with a PLETHORA of different options.Either way, this game is boring and not worth the space on my Harddrive. I reccomend looking somewhere else if you wanted a good MMORPG.			"

												Echo Of soul is one of the better games of this studio. Sadly the servers are pretty dead.Why you ask? the publisher, the ingame store is questionable and honestly while the game is not P2W like their other games this game lacks quality. It is your standard mmo to kill 10 mobs here and there with a few dungeons that require no tactic. In many ways you would not believe this game came out in 2015. But if you enjoy an easy game and want to spend some time killing mobs, getting good looking armor this is your game.In my opinion your better off buying Elder scrolls online, Gw2 when they are on sale for 10 Euro's, if you want a really good free to play experience Wildstar is the way to go, echos of soul could learn a lot from them.

So when i install a mmorpg it usually ends up in uninstalling, another reason is that i have a gaming laptop so i can't have to many games on it.

												I have played this game since early beta and have around 900 hours put into the game. I am currently 6/8  109 pvp items which currently makes the the best geared pvp sorc on any server outside of asia. I love this games pvp. But there is just not much to it. 2 battlegrounds and an arena system. My team got up to 1700 team rating and would spend hours in que just to get 1 match in becuase the developers didnt know how to set up a competent arena mmr system. The PVE is okay but nothing groundbreaking and there is not much to it at the moment. The serious lack of content has unfortunately caused me to steer people away from this game. I may change my stance if the next pvp patch greatly improves the state of things but I am not holding my breath. I currently have about 150 hours into skyforge and am loving the game so far. I would suggest giving that game a try over echo of soul as of september 15th 2015.-Skinnie ( requiem )			"

												This game has gotten better, and from a♥♥♥♥♥♥company like Aeria they actually made this game GOOD. Something you don't see from Aeria, it's crazy! The game is litteraly not as P2W as it used to and the game feels so much better. Though the game is gender locked, that shouldn't be the issue why your not playing Echo Of Soul, the game is fun both solo or with groups while doing dungeons and raids.  I haven't tried the PVP but i heard it's bad, though everyone has their own opinons and i will be trying myself to see if it is actually good or bad.To be honest, i hated it because others did but when i tried it myself i fell in love.  Just a tip, you should always try a game for yourself and don't hate a game just because others hate it, and that goes the same for liking a game, don't like it because others like it you don't have to if you don't want to.    Echo Of Soul is a fun MMORPG for beginners and veterans alike though some fetch quest and genderlock is included, bypassing that it's a decent MMORPG you should try out! ^-^(I won't be giving a number rating on this game, mostly because i feel everyone game doesn't deserve to be determined as good or bad by a few numbers.)

												I didn't know what to expect when I started, but it's seriously fun.I mean nothing really new but that not a bad thing, pretty solid for what's here.I enjoy rogue and archer the most for my playstyle.PVP is actually fun, and not horribly unbalanced.Give it a shot.			"

Short but Honest Review.Quit within the first HOURIt's one of those MMO's that has annoying music and bad mechanics.You click on an enemy once to fight it and there's nothing much else to do. Also who the hell even reads what the NPC's say? I couldn't focus or care for what story the lore had to offer with this dumb atmosphere Echo of Soul has. I can't tell if this game is TRYING to be quirky or bad . If I had to describe it in one word it would be ""Annoying."" It's just an annoying game. Don't play it, it's really not worth your time.

												An absolute travesty that blatantly tries to be Tera and fails miserably. It's got some strange mix of static vs action combat that doesn't work at all, because it's incredibly clunky and slow.The art style looks like Tera. The UI elements look exactly like Tera. The characters look like Tera. Though the graphics have somehow managed to look terribly old. Just play Tera instead, because it's got a lot more to offer, ontop of a much better character creator (without the idiotic gender restrictions on classes) and is also F2P.Yeah you read that right, the very few classes there are, are gender locked.

												Great mmo game put 7 hours in already. simple and easy to understand questing. balacned pvp tho new players will get smacked even tho they buff your hp up to lvl 60 your still useing lower tier non lvl 60 wepons sp just level up first maybe level 30. but im the game really shines in pvm and coop/groups fighting monsters. i love how there is sorta a forced career system to help each other. i am a cook and a gather many people cant cook and many cant gather materials so it falls on you and vise versa its a rock paper thing and i like it.what i dont like is forced gender classes no idea why its like that but other then that solid f2p mmo game takes alot of good stuff from other mmo games and builds theres off it. and yes there is some microtransactions it is f2p afterall but you can pretty much earn anything just by playing. if you like mmo games you really need to give it a try.

												One of the best ways to describe this is:""Imagine if Dragon Nest were less cartoony.""I'll talk a little about what I've seen so far.Character Designs aren't original - in fact, they all look like they've come from other places. The Warrior is straight up Garen from League of Legends, for instance. The sorceress is an Elin from TERA (which is dangerous, since the game already has TERA-style graphics), etc.In the hour plus that I've played so far, I have literally not seen another player speak - ONLY gold sellers.The tutorial isn't so much a ""Here's a crafted situation, not utilize X mechanic to learn it,"" and is actually just ""You've hit the play button, here are all the mechanics up front. Go forth and die.""Now, some of the mechanics are cool, but it's basically all been done before.Which means you can play this game without devoting yourself to yet another F2P P2W MMO by simply opting to instead play an MMO like RIFT or something.Don't get me wrong, the game looks kind of nice, but you won't find anything really unique or special here.I will play for a few more hours to check up on content farther in and promise to edit this review should anything really warrant it, but from what I've seen of beta and now actual time in-game, I wouldn't recommend this. And believe me that I say that assuming you were a close, personal friend of mine.			"

												For those saying it's 'nothing new':- No specific healer class- Gender-locked classes (for now)- Open world GvG- Multi-lane pvp AND arena (unlike some MMO's where there is only one pvp type)- Scenery is breathtaking. turn off HUD and just walk around.- doesn't seem P2W which is a first for Aeria Games(I know this because I have game outside of steam as well)I understand that only a couple of these are ""innovative"", but the rest of these in the combination that it is make up this MMO in a truly great way.

												Not only is this game genderlocked for classes, but it's character locked. I'm so disapointed when mmos that seem good are like this. Warning to those who'd like to play it.I can't see it as a ""best MMO"" if it has genderlock, ever since I started playing mmo's in the early 2000 I've enjoyed countless good mmo's without having an arbitrary pointless restriction on class gender. It really ruins the experience for a lot of people when an mmo restricts what gender one can play with a clas. And this one takes it even further by restricting the type of person you can be, for example, you can only be a burly warrior, not a lean one, or a sexualized little girl and not a tall young adult woman.I do accept a game in which one race has one genderlock on a class for lore purposes, but the way this game does it just makes it worse for a lot of people and diversity without improving ANYTHING.

												How do I explain this game.... This is a grind.... and very boring alone.The first time I played as a warrior with my friends. We got pretty far into the game and pushed through the endless grind of the same thing with different landscapes and we though we were doing pretty good.....Then we got to the capital city..................And we knew we had a long way to go. We made a guild and set of to rid the land of which ever dark power threatened it this time.1 week later we gave up and quit the gameMy second time I tried to continue but I got bored with my character and lost my pet (which I don't know if you get back)I played as a guardian and looked like a♥♥♥♥♥♥I played with koreans and they made me their ♥♥♥♥♥.I sat there and thought about my life decisions.Overall I think this is a good game that can be refined and developed more but you need friends to quench the grind10/10 would waste life again			"

												I am writing this review while playing the game.When I saw the game was like Tera I was really worried but what the heck, could be good.Downloaded game, Launched it, Nothing happend. Went into task manager and force ended launcher, launched it agan and got lunch. Came back and launcher was up. Launcher said was loading patch, I opened warowl's livesteam, took 20 mins to load patch. When I created an account an error about the custom browser came up everytime it changed(more of an annoyance).Game loaded fine, Loaded in windowed mode which was nice. only 1 server and it's not that active. Logged into server and created a character, laggy while switching between characters. The classes are gender AND race locked. This I was confused about but it is a new game so whatever. Created my character, There is no bald hairdo(why????) and very limited to the creation. I know the games creation doesn't matter but some people care about it. Especially hardcore MMO players do. Also the character naming doesn't allow spaces or periods.Loaded character, the opening clip was pretty good. After it ended the first thing I see if login rewards, this is nice. Movement feels like WoW or Swtor, which is hold right click then attack with number keys only. Combat is a big sluggish but I am playing a rogue so it is a given. The UI is a bit in your face which is slightly annoying. The minimap could be smaller aswell as the toobar. Combat like i said is sluggish, after playing for about 20 minutes i've gotten a bit used to it but it is still hard to get used to. playing some more and I can see myself playing this longer if I could get used to the combat.To sum it all up:Pros:Combat system is very much like other popular MMOS but the abilites are strange for me.Does not require a very powerful PC to run.Classes are straight forward.Small game download.Daily rewards.Cons:Character creation is VERY limited.The ingame tutorial does not help very much.Only 1 server.Very much like Tera.UI is too big.If you are a casual MMO player this game would be fun, If you play many MMOS and are competitive in them. I would wait atleast a year to get into it. The game lacks many competitive scenarios and it was only released a few months ago on steam. I give it a 7/10.			"

												Echo of Soul is an MMORPG that I have been stuck on for awhile now. The game is addictive! The game has amazing graphics, cool combat mechanics, beautiful scenery, cool-looking characters and of course a world of wonder and mystery to dive into! I'd say this is by far the best MMORPG that I've ever played! Never played WoW or LoL but I can bet that they are not as good or on par with Echo of Soul. The game is near-perfect! There are a few flaws in the game but nothing fundamentally killing its play value. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who likes good MMORPGs and tactical real-time strategy games.			"

												An honest review:The game is pretty good except that I don't like a few things.1 , no Healing classthey give you scrolls u put on a hot bar and basically anyone can heal with a cool down timer.2 . The chat system sucks. You can't server chat or yell without buying or winning a loud speaker n which you can then server chat or yell and it could be costy if you continue to use em up.3 . You can't run and cast4. Unless you find an active guild with active players as you are leveling , the game feels like a solo player game. 5. Instances....instances everwhere....kinda like guild wars where you have to zone instance from one area to another.... yeah...6. The graphics are pretty solid, I like the graphics.7 . The game is fun to play , the questing is very easy, very easy to navigate from quest to quest. 8 . The character customization is not that great but it's just good enough to make you cteate a unique look.9 . Crafting kinda sucks , its not that great.10 . The game offers nothing better than other MMO's , in fact its just about as basic as you can get with an MMO... but still over 100 hours in and I am still enjoying it even though I hate some things as mentioned above.

I personally dont care if there are some balancing issues or not, i dont mind rerolling if it gets too bad but i usually welcome the challenge. Other than that the game has a nice combination of tolerable  combat, graphics and game play depth to get an MMO veteran hooked.			"

												I used to enjoy this game but then I finally opened my eye's and wished I could get my money back that I wasted on pixels.Playing seems like more of a chore now constant grinding for gear you have to reroll for better stats, if you don't get the stats you want you must purchase pouches from the item mall to reroll again, and again. A guild member spent 180 pouches (equal to $160.20 USD) on once piece of gear and still didn't get the stats he wanted. It's highly gamble based and takes advantage of those with a gambling addiction. if they took away the stat rerolls completely or made it easier to get pouches, the game might survive... but I see no hope for it.

												(this is all based on solo runs, no guild involved because I have no plan to join any)Good point.. Free to play, no monthly sub or anything.Easy to level if you follow quests. Hardly any grind needed and Solo friendly if you are loner like myself *evil grin*Not much there to spend real money. Unless you grind for end game gear (e.g buying Safeguard for gem enchant etc.).. There is absolutely no real cash needed to spend. Also you can buy them with in-game currency too (if someone sell what you need). Costume? you can forget that because nothing looks nice.Bad Point..Tab targetting, skill spamming.. like some MMO. Certain boss makes you move around but most of battle does not need to move around at all.Running errand again and again.. if you quit ""quest based MMO"" just for that, too bad you have to do it again in here. Easy to level but it is slow and tedious.. Eventhough quests helps you level, there are just too many useless quests to my point of view.. Could have cut down some to help speed up the progress.No matter where, gold sellers are present in game and seems like Aeria isn't doing much to stop them (they says update to prevent them is coming but feels like adding words to chat filter isn't going to do much), time will tell I guess.Only 5 classes. Also class is gender locked. Some people might hate for it.Customization is.. too generic. Nothing much to look at. All you can do is pick parts and done with it. Plus characters does not have idle animation, they just stand there like stick. But for unknown reason.. NPC, pet and mount have it.Fantastic illustration but in-game graphics is below average when compare it to TERA and FFXIV even at highest setting. Good for low end system, but looks rough on high end system.Uninspiring music selection. Yawn.Everything gets expensive from Level 60+. Money making till evel 59 is quite limited but once you made to 60, everything you have gathered become garbage and need start stock up from scratch with items that have hefty price tag.Overall..I'd say this game ends when you get to level 60. Getting there might be fun, but everything from 60 is just grind fest for gearing up and too expensive to keep it going.Good enough for slow play but not a nice way to keep players who are made to level cap with current game system. Might be enjoyable for casual play, but not really recommend for long time play.			"

												Really fast leveling even at the higher levels. I just came back after a long hiatus at level 60 (60 used to be the level cap) and I leveled up just doing mob-kill quests. I mean, a lot of people like that you can rush to the endgame, but if you really like your MMOs and want the grind, I do not recommend this.			"

												Don't let my Steam playtime fool you, I've played this game for approximately 80 hours in total, with 2 x lvl 70 toons. Leveling is quick and easy on this game. The quests are varied and don't feel too grindy even though they are the usual 'Run here and fetch this' or 'Kill 5 mobs for drops' but because you're never asked to kill too many mobs per quest, it feels varied and like you're constantly moving on to discover new areas.However, once you hit lvl 70 the game becomes a huge grindfest. You have to grind solo dungeons 30 times a week to get a chance at purple gear. If dungeons aren't your thing, you have the pleasure of killing 150 normal mobs and 50 elite mobs per day to get Chrome tokens to exchange for gear. It gets old really fast.It's ironic that this game is called Echo of Soul because it lacks so much soul and personality. You tab and click/button mash through your skills all the while feeling slightly disconnected from your toon.The only good thing I will say about EOS is that they have done a great job with dungeon bosses. You have to pay attention to mechanics and dodge attacks, making each boss kill feel rewarding in end.I'd only recommend this game for beginner MMO players because it is so easy to pick up and learn to play, but after that, move on to something with more depth that you will truly enjoy.

												(this is all based on solo runs, no guild involved because I have no plan to join any)Good point.. Free to play, no monthly sub or anything.Easy to level if you follow quests. Hardly any grind needed and Solo friendly if you are loner like myself *evil grin*Not much there to spend real money. Unless you grind for end game gear (e.g buying Safeguard for gem enchant etc.).. There is absolutely no real cash needed to spend. Also you can buy them with in-game currency too (if someone sell what you need). Costume? you can forget that because nothing looks nice.Bad Point..Tab targetting, skill spamming.. like some MMO. Certain boss makes you move around but most of battle does not need to move around at all.Running errand again and again.. if you quit ""quest based MMO"" just for that, too bad you have to do it again in here. Easy to level but it is slow and tedious.. Eventhough quests helps you level, there are just too many useless quests to my point of view.. Could have cut down some to help speed up the progress.No matter where, gold sellers are present in game and seems like Aeria isn't doing much to stop them (they says update to prevent them is coming but feels like adding words to chat filter isn't going to do much), time will tell I guess.Only 5 classes. Also class is gender locked. Some people might hate for it.Customization is.. too generic. Nothing much to look at. All you can do is pick parts and done with it. Plus characters does not have idle animation, they just stand there like stick. But for unknown reason.. NPC, pet and mount have it.Fantastic illustration but in-game graphics is below average when compare it to TERA and FFXIV even at highest setting. Good for low end system, but looks rough on high end system.Uninspiring music selection. Yawn.Everything gets expensive from Level 60+. Money making till evel 59 is quite limited but once you made to 60, everything you have gathered become garbage and need start stock up from scratch with items that have hefty price tag.Overall..I'd say this game ends when you get to level 60. Getting there might be fun, but everything from 60 is just grind fest for gearing up and too expensive to keep it going.Good enough for slow play but not a nice way to keep players who are made to level cap with current game system. Might be enjoyable for casual play, but not really recommend for long time play.			"

Also if one does disable there firewall to allow the updater to do its work you will then run into error code 5 wich is...............I have no clue. The moral of the story is dont waste your time like i have. I literally been messing with this for hours and i never got to play. This is the same problem i had months ago when trying to get in the game. So -5 Stars from me sorry Aeria games get your stuff straightened out. I guess World of Warcraft will have another sell on there new expansion. People want to find something new besides wow! Fix your stuff theres 7 or 8 million people looking for a Wow Filler!			"

												Never wrote a review before but had to write one for this game. So if you haven't watched any videos on the game play.. its a quest fest until lvl 60. And theres just too many inconvencies in the game such as not enough bag space and a major FLAW.. why does the game lag so much so often. It even says on the server status whilst logging in that the server is uncrowded. Yes its probably not a deal breaker but it has made my game play less enjoyable and is one of the reasonings I'm quitting. Anyway just going to make a list of sorts now..Pros -PvP is somewhat funMost items such as consumeables can be purchased for cheap in shops until lvl 60Cons - Way too much lag for a renowned company such as AeriaQuest fest to the teeCharacters are gender locked...No fun content until lvl 60 (admittely I haven't even tried any of the content after 60)Way too much inconviences such as storage spaceOverall.. Id probably give this game a 3/10. Honestly though even though the game isn't P2W since you can get enough gold.. It sure gives off that feel considering its Aeria games and they are a money grubbing company to the tee.			"

												This game has many great features ranging from the graphics to the community. The PvP system is ok and the PvE is pretty good. The PvP system could be less random on the gameplay but all players are close to equally balanced when it comes to  fighting a lvl 60 with a lvl 15 though perks of gear and etc. give major boosts to those who can't access them but I suppose thats the point of that aspect. The PvE needs a little more action for mobs to fight back rather then a simple AI. It should be more complex I think as they are easily overpowered at low levels. BUT the big reason why I enjoy this game is because its not only an MMORPG but its diffrent from ones that I've played. "

												An honest review:The game is pretty good except that I don't like a few things.1 , no Healing classthey give you scrolls u put on a hot bar and basically anyone can heal with a cool down timer.2 . The chat system sucks. You can't server chat or yell without buying or winning a loud speaker n which you can then server chat or yell and it could be costy if you continue to use em up.3 . You can't run and cast4. Unless you find an active guild with active players as you are leveling , the game feels like a solo player game. 5. Instances....instances everwhere....kinda like guild wars where you have to zone instance from one area to another.... yeah...6. The graphics are pretty solid, I like the graphics.7 . The game is fun to play , the questing is very easy, very easy to navigate from quest to quest. 8 . The character customization is not that great but it's just good enough to make you cteate a unique look.9 . Crafting kinda sucks , its not that great.10 . The game offers nothing better than other MMO's , in fact its just about as basic as you can get with an MMO... but still over 100 hours in and I am still enjoying it even though I hate some things as mentioned above.

												I usually don't like games like these, but this one has good graphics and the gameplay is fairly easy to understand. It doesn't require a monthly payment which is nice and the quests are basic and easy to get to, along with traveling.Edit: I've played this game for awhile now and I've tried other MMORPGs and this one is still at the top of the list. The combat and movement is easy and simple, even if you're using a mousepad (its quite harder though, but its still optional). Movement with the mouse is very easy and you're able to zoom out to see more around you.There are co-op, single, and multiplayer dungeons.Once you reach level 60 you can buy some bad♥♥♥♥♥armor to get your HP from 2k all the way up to 13k, probably more! I wondered why everyone was kicking my♥♥♥♥♥when I joined in on a battlefield game with 500 HP and noob armor..The quests are easy to complete and don't take much time, it WILL however take a lot of time out of your day when you do quest after quest. The co-op and party quests have labels for a reason. As I said before, traveling is very easy and so is currency. Traveling only costs 1 silver. When you start off, items are usually worth 1 silver. Save up enough silver and you get yourself 1 gold, which you can then use to buy nicer items later on in the game.That's so much to read I know. But in my opinion, its a great game. I'm surprised that it works so well on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer.			"

												Better targeting system than Terra and you can keep better control of the camera without having it go all over the place. I like the variety of character types although  as a female gamer I dont like the gender restrictions on two of them; why cant there be girl Warlocks and bladewielders? Its a fun RPG game  with nice graphics, especially if you have played all the rest and dont want to go back to side scrolling browser games. Game starts out simple enough  and the wardrobe changes when you pick up some kinds of new armor are kind of nice on most character types, the holiday events are fun, and there is a huge world to explore. Ranger or Gaurdian is easiest but if you prefer a challenge try a Mage. Cons: -After about level 25 it can be easy to get lost! After putting about 3 characters though the game to level 50 I finally learned my way around. If you dont follow the NPC's directions carefully it is easy to get turned around and miss a piece of equipment or a storyline, and the in game map and teleportation could use more explanation. They do mark some of your unsolved quests down but you have to tab through the maps to teleport or go back to where you have been.-There are hidden quests like killing all the special bosses you may never know about until an experience player points it out. And the crafting aspect takes a lot of pack space.-Its hard to get decent armor unless you PVP or know someone who can for you in the arena. Otherwise you will spend hours in what I call the monster pits trading tokens for better armor. Without decent armor and weapons and leveling the game will get very frustrating.-After level 50 it can get boring. While there are seeminly limitless settings and tons of levels, killing monsters over and over and keeping track of all the NPCs can give you a headache and get boring.-Lack of good guilds. As with any MMO it is really hard to find a good guild that will last more than a few months and you end up playing alone. There is also a lot of cashing loot that can make play uneaven.Verdict: Nice game to play for a while even if you dont finish it.			"

												I started this in Beta as a founder, and enjoyed it then, just now getting back into it, the game its self is great PVE wise, I havent done any PvP, solo game play is everywhere if thats what you want to do, its easy to learn and follow, and less grindy than most.As I said the game itself is fine, and recommended.However, the company is a different story, I have had to open a ticket, to which they asked for further info, that was 10 days ago, the emails kept bouncing back to me rejected by the server (theirs) so I tried, opening a second ticket, still unread after a week, I jumped on Facebook and tried to get someone to help me with my email rejection, nothing, I tried twitter, and the actual game forum, all nothing, as far as customer service go the company is shocking.Unfortunatley this leaves a bit of a doubt in my mind as to continue playing, I am going to give it a couple more days before I wrtie it off, as I do enjoy the game, not much help if you cannot access your main account though.

												This game has many great features ranging from the graphics to the community. The PvP system is ok and the PvE is pretty good. The PvP system could be less random on the gameplay but all players are close to equally balanced when it comes to  fighting a lvl 60 with a lvl 15 though perks of gear and etc. give major boosts to those who can't access them but I suppose thats the point of that aspect. The PvE needs a little more action for mobs to fight back rather then a simple AI. It should be more complex I think as they are easily overpowered at low levels. BUT the big reason why I enjoy this game is because its not only an MMORPG but its diffrent from ones that I've played. "

												This game is wonderful. Awesome graphics, fun story, and its an MMORPG which adds to the fun. Unfortunately it likes to back out of the game and completely close on its own. If it worked without closing i would recommend it to friends but because of that it has drove me away from playing the game.			"

												(this is all based on solo runs, no guild involved because I have no plan to join any)Good point.. Free to play, no monthly sub or anything.Easy to level if you follow quests. Hardly any grind needed and Solo friendly if you are loner like myself *evil grin*Not much there to spend real money. Unless you grind for end game gear (e.g buying Safeguard for gem enchant etc.).. There is absolutely no real cash needed to spend. Also you can buy them with in-game currency too (if someone sell what you need). Costume? you can forget that because nothing looks nice.Bad Point..Tab targetting, skill spamming.. like some MMO. Certain boss makes you move around but most of battle does not need to move around at all.Running errand again and again.. if you quit ""quest based MMO"" just for that, too bad you have to do it again in here. Easy to level but it is slow and tedious.. Eventhough quests helps you level, there are just too many useless quests to my point of view.. Could have cut down some to help speed up the progress.No matter where, gold sellers are present in game and seems like Aeria isn't doing much to stop them (they says update to prevent them is coming but feels like adding words to chat filter isn't going to do much), time will tell I guess.Only 5 classes. Also class is gender locked. Some people might hate for it.Customization is.. too generic. Nothing much to look at. All you can do is pick parts and done with it. Plus characters does not have idle animation, they just stand there like stick. But for unknown reason.. NPC, pet and mount have it.Fantastic illustration but in-game graphics is below average when compare it to TERA and FFXIV even at highest setting. Good for low end system, but looks rough on high end system.Uninspiring music selection. Yawn.Everything gets expensive from Level 60+. Money making till evel 59 is quite limited but once you made to 60, everything you have gathered become garbage and need start stock up from scratch with items that have hefty price tag.Overall..I'd say this game ends when you get to level 60. Getting there might be fun, but everything from 60 is just grind fest for gearing up and too expensive to keep it going.Good enough for slow play but not a nice way to keep players who are made to level cap with current game system. Might be enjoyable for casual play, but not really recommend for long time play.			"

												Please note my time on steam is in correct, i played this before it came to steam. Echo of Soul, when i first loaded it up I thought i was going to get a nice, pretty anime stylestic MMORPG type game that would be different then the others, NOPE. I was wronged, it was the SAME. EXACT. THING. It feels like World of Warcraft & Guild Wars mushed into one game. **PROS**Free To Play - This is and WAS the only reason why I played it, if this had a price tag on it i wouldn't even play this game, it's not worth it Graphics - They're okay, they look nice, the skills on the magi look nice and cool, melee classes look the same as every other mmorpg out there**CONS**PAY TO WIN BIG TIME!!!!!!! - This game is extremely pay to win, the shop in game offers you gear and other types of upgrades and gemstones for money in real life, No MMORPG should be a F2P P2W type of game, this feels like other games i've played numerous times. Gender Locked Classes?? - I don't know if it's just me, but I'm a guy, And I like to play both female and male characters, and you're genderlocked if you are playing an archer, or a rogue, PvP - PvP is♥♥♥♥♥ literal♥♥♥♥♥ If you're playing a rogue you will win, rogue is the most BROKEN AND ABUSRD CLASS TO PLAY, If you want to level up faster PLAY PVP and PLAY A ROGUE, because you will NOT do anything else as any other class, if a rogue spots you as any other class you will get wrecked harder then you can mash your face on your keyboard, the rogue has 3 to 4 skills that are Crowd Control, why the ***k would you give a class 4 CC skills? And make every other class just absoulute garbage. Leveling up - If you thought World of Warcraft had a grind, be prepared for a grind 3 times longer then that, in WoW you at least get gear to give you 10% bonus EXP per kill and quest, up to a max of 70%, this game you don't get sh!t, you get nothing, the grind is horrendous and you must play PvP to level up the fastest, Over all, just steer clear of this money pit and give your money to guildwars 2 or Blizzard, this game sucks, hard as nuts.
