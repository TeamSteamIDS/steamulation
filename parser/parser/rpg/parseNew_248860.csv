												Extremely recommended. One of the best game I have recently played.Keep reading, or download the Demo and try it for yourself. Yes, there is a DEMO available.GameplayYou see stuff from above like, isometric map perspective: you navigate the lands from one hexagonal tile to another. All the time.This costs points. When it's rainy or dark, it will cost more points.When you reach a city hex, you can loot the location. This, also, will costs you points. Sometimes you will find amazing stuff, and sometimes only scraps of paper. But even those could be useful. Actually, when you start to know the game better, every gôddåmn item is useful!You will find more stuff if you use a crowbar, or have a light source with you. But beware as this will make more noise and attract people towards your location.Looting can also just hurt yourself... like roof collapse. Shït happens right?So you loot, equip yourself with what you find, and stroll around. Until some dude approaches and gets to your hex.CombatThe combat is textual. You won't have the map view anymore. But instead, you'll be presented with an interface showing your dude's and opposition's status, and a list of actions you can execute. Everything you will do, like throwing a punch, will have a narrative text describing what's happening. So it's mostly READING ya hear? No explosions there.But don't be fooled... you can trip on the ground and fall. While on the ground you can try and grab the hostile down, you can crawl back and try to escape, drop your stuff and run like hell, etc. A lot of realistic possibilities here. It is extremely hard. Your first encounter will probably be your last.DiseaseGetting hurt, bleeding, being cold, drinking shït water... these will have consequences. Try to disinfect your wounds, patch'em up and don't let 'em getting infected. Be careful of what you eat too... could be POISONOUS you never know muhahah.Unless you are a doctor, in which case you will have a clear descriptions of your symptoms like, ""Cholera 3; final stage; certain death"", you won't know what illness you just caught... you will have ""stomach cramps"", you'll be like ""vomiting""...So just act as in real life: grabs antibiotics, clean every wounds. Don't take any chances. Ever. Why? Because the game has...PermadeathYep. Die and restart the whole game. No save point, and that is intended. You won't bring stuff with you from your last play. Nope, nothing. It's up to YOU to level up. And this is where I disagree on the game mechanics. I am fine with dying and learning. But ya know the beginning of the game starts to be boring once you know it. And redoing the same stuff is just a waste of time. Hence I created a little tool[tacticalfreak.blogspot.com] to actually still save and, well, cheat. I advise players to die a lot first, and when you feel you are ready, just use my tool.But even if you use it to reload an old save, it won't matter much, because...It's randomThe map is randomly generated. But not when you first start the game, nope. It is randomly generated as soon as you discover a tile. So saving the game and loading an old save will still yield something different :DThis is why I am a little ""against"" the permadeath. Loading an old save is not THAT bad. You will experience a whole different game. I would've liked just... ya know, an auto-save every night or something.Anyway except for a few spots in the map that will never change, all the rest is random. Random but fair. You won't like be in a desert without cities for miles ever. They are spawned correctly.Even if you are a new player, you CAN make it. Yes because in the end, it's just logic.Contrary to Faster Than Light (FTL) where there is NO WAY a new player will make it to the end because the randomization is too... random. In NEO Scavenger, the RNG is just right.Crafting stuffAs I said all the items there are useful. Somehow. Because you can craft and even ""uncraft"" stuff. If someone is giving you stuff, or if you finally found something of value... maybe you can try to ""reverse engineer"" it and discover HOW IT WAS BUILT. How awesome is that uh? Found a bow arrow? But you have no idea how to create one yourself? No problem!There are also a lot of crafting recipes there. And many different combinations will work. Like you could use your crowbar to roast meat when you don't have a wood stick! Doesn't matter, both categorizes as a kinda ""shaft."" So it's extremely smart and flexible. If you are lacking you favorite saucepan to boil water... just think a second... can't anything else, more common, be used as a saucepan? Eh, when I found that out, I literally doubled my lifespan. No shït. Think hard.NarrationIt reminds me of Fallout 1 & 2. You had that little description box in the lower left which would describe what was going on. Here it's a bit the same. With random encounters or special places being very well described. There is a lot of dark humor too. If you are not averse to reading you will like it and also find that it's well written.StoryThere is a story. Your first goal will obviously be to survive, and so, to find something to cover your feet :) But after that painful initial phase, you will meet strange people. You will find places of interest. Or you will find new recipes that... use high tech items you had no idea were in the game.The story is interesting and is closely related to the narrative part of the game: the only way to tell you stuff is through old newspapers and stuff. Those are funny as well...OX news reporting hoaxes ;)AudioEvery single one item has its own sound effect. Which is played when you grab the item from you inventory. That's it. But that's HUGE. There is a little music, but it gets a bit repetitive.ConclusionIf you like Fallout, post-apocalyptic worlds, a good narration, turn by turn mechanics and a pretty realistic game then don't hesitate. It's a masterpiece.You still unsure? --> try the demo and make your own opinion.			"

								Be prepared to die...a LOT!  And with ""permadeath"" that means you will be met with a black screen unceremoniously alerting you to your demise, manner of death and hours you managed to keep this poor guy alive.  Now, don't assume that this is put forth as a criticism because that is the appeal to this survival game.  After succumbing to the countless manners of death you begin to appreciate the fragility of humanity in this post-apocalyptic world.  Every decision begins to weigh on the player as you try to balance all the needs of survival.  I suppose there IS a way to ""win"" the game, though I've never seen it.  For me the appeal is simply the test to see how long you can stay alive while dodging the raiders, bandits, the elements, wild beasts, disease, dehydration, famine - I'm sure you get the point.  Go ahead and eat that rancid hunk of meat you found because the immediate fear of famine out-weighs the ramifications of food poisoning you will have to deal with tomorrow.  This is an early access game so there will be problems.  The only bug I encountered was a turn bug that caused the time to keep clicking by until he just died.  Only happened to me once, but it was frustrating just the same.  The developer is aware of the issue and promises a fix.  There may also need to be a few play-balance adjustments because as I said it is really difficult to get deep into the game.  There are lots of interesting traits to choose when beginning the game, but honestly ""toughness,"" ""melee,"" and ""strength"" are the main ones you have to have or you will not survive the first night to even begin to utilize the other abilities.  Combat is unique and interesting once you figure out the order the text reads out, and how the interface deals with multiple enemies.  This is a flash game with tons of depth.			"

								I've played this game on and off for nearly two years. I've followed it's development since it was first announced, and every time I come back I fall in love again. This game combines the brutality of dwarf fortress, the atmosphere of fallout, and world layout of civ to create a true masterpiece. This game is in a class of it's own.			"

												EDIT 10.9.15:I love this game. One time, I got shot by an arrow. I ducked under cover, then pulled the arrow out. Then I stabbed my assailant to death with it. One time, I was attacked by two dogs immediately after starting a game. I was naked (save for a thin hospital gown) and I had no weapons. As they charged me, I grabbed some shards of glass on the ground, and following a lengthy battle that I ultimately won, I used said shards to skin the dogs' carcasses and then made gloves out of them. Then I died of blood loss.One time, I was attacked in the middle of a stormy night by two mutants trying to steal my shopping cart loaded with supplies. After I brained one of them, the other scattered. I gave chase, and dispatched it following a cross-tile pursuit. However, upon return to my camp, my cart was gone. The mutant corpse, mysteriously absent as well. Using my tracking ability, I followed the thief several tiles down, and discovered it was another mutant, slowly pushing my cart southwest, his deceased comrade most unceremoniously stuffed inside with the rest of the contents. I moved in and caved its skull in with one fell swoop. I felt no pity, no remorse. I really needed those 5 empty bottles.10/10 excellent post apocalyptic hobo simulatorIt's worth noting that there are a lot of mods available that greatly expand the game's potential.			"

								I had a Strong Melee Hacker, with lockpicking, a crowbar strap, and a box cart. None could stand in my way, not even the Detroit Mercs could withstand my maniacal crowbar swinging techniques. I was immortal. I confidently strode through the Michigan wastes knowing that I could never die. I came across some water in an urban location. I was a bit parched and decided to sate my thirst on the water. I didn't need to boil it, I was immortal! I drank the water, and a few hours later my charcter began to develop severe diarrhea as my skin turned a horrific shade of blue. I checked my supplies, I had no antibiotics, I needed to get to the health clinic. I desperately made my way to Detroit. 3 hexes away from gate 11 my character died from Cholera. I lost everything and died because I was too lazy to boil my water. 10/10 would play again.			"

Early Access Review
								I don't normally write serious reviews. I'm one of those undesirable♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that uploads the ""11/10 uninstall function works great"" review, but NEO Scavenger will be my exception. You have no idea how hard it will be for me to not write ""I murdered a naked guy while wearing a clown mask"", but I will get through it, for this amazing game.Let's start with the basics; you're some random guy (avoiding spoilers) that has just woken from cryogenic sleep during the apocalypse somewhere around the city of Detroit. After a friendly interaction with a lovely creature known as a ""Dogman"", you step outside to  experience the outside world of Michigan... and dang, it's cold. Like, ""Oh my God I can't feel my feet and I'm feeling really sleepy"" cold. After a few deaths and several hours of learning the basics (don't eat random berries or mushrooms you find unless  you know they aren't poisonous, that guy with the broken bottle really wants to eat your leg, and yes, it's cold, put some pants on) you really get into this game. As others have said, however, an ungodly amount of time can be spent on this game, and it can never be taken back. In a sense, it's like DayZ. You spend 3 hours finding a weapon, finding your friends wherever they are on the map, and end up faffing around until some gruesome death by either a glitching zombie or a player that only speaks Russian. This, I believe, is another selling point of NEO Scavenger. In the beginning, you get used to dying. After a while, however, you end up living longer and longer, until one life lasts you hours of real life time. Everything is peachy until that one night you decide to sleep in a forest and forget to set up a noise trap or hide, and you're stabbed to death by some plague-ridden nutcase in your sleep. After a day or two of angry avoidance of the game, you decide to give it a second chance, innocently, you pour more hours into it, only to die in a similar manner. It's a beautiful circle of life (death)!With such extensive content already and more updates to come, NEO Scavenger is one of my favorite games of all time. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys hardcore survival games, and/or murdering innocents with his/her bare hands whilst wearing nothing but a Ronald McDonald lookalike mask and a hospital gown. (Damn, I said I wouldn't write that.)			"

												An awesome survival game.Challenging to the newer players, and for myself, with about 60 hours in game, still a struggle to stay alive for long lengths of time.It has multiple playstyles to suit however you'd like to play:   -Want to be a survivalist who uses ranged weaponry to hunt wild animals? Go for it.   -Want to use melee weapons, wreaking havoc upon any foe who walks in your path? Go for it.   -Want to fight for justice, destroying any and all inhumane religious cults that have arisen? Go for it.   -Feel a need to slaughter any human, animal, or whatever the hell you find in the wasteland? Go for it.   -Want to knock people out, steal their shoes, and then leave them barefoot in the middle of a wasteland? Go for it.   -Want to be insane, kill anyone you see, AND become a cannibalistic maniac? I think you know the answer.With multiple in-game skills, the possibilities are endless.  You can be an overweight combat medic, a melee proficient electrician with a high metabolism, a weak and brittle botanist, an athlete with insomnia; There are many different combinations you can choose from.  You just need to find the right kit to suit yourself- with the ability to deal with freezing weather, wild dog attacks, and insane cultists.An awesome game that is definitely worth the money.  The creator of the game is very willing to fix bugs, communicates with the players whenever the chance arises, and listens to any and all feedback.In my book, a definite 10/10			"

												Picked this up on a lark, as I am heavily into survival games lately. I was hesitant due to the low res, pixel graphics, but man am I glad I took a chance on this!What stands out immediately is choice and consequence. You can't have it all. You have to build a character with weaknesses, and weaknesses can just be not having some of the skills you might like to have, or it can be actual weaknesses to give you points to get more benefits.You might take Fragile for example, making you take more damage than normal if you get hit, and you might do this because you really want the points it gives you to take Trapping so you can make fire right away at the start of the game.You might take Strong so you can carry more and Melee so you can close combat better, but this might mean you don't get Ranged skil and therefore cannot make arrows, and have limited range skill with guns and other range weapons.Anyway, you make your choices and take your shot. Into the game you go and immediately your character choices effect your first encounter, in terms of whether you survive, escape, get hurt or kick the♥♥♥♥♥of the first opponent.You survived the fight (maybe) and now you gotta get fire, you gotta get a weapon, you need clothing, you need shelter, you need a supply of food and water, and you need to get these things without attracting too much attention from the local wildlife. How you do this is up to you and there is little to no help from the game. You gotta figure it out, and fast, cause you are getting cold and soon you'll be needing somewhere to sleep.RnG can help you or hurt you here, and at first I was like, well you need some good rolls to start, but later you learn it's more about playing smart, and persistently scavenging until you get what you want.You have to be concerned about the noise you make, the tracks you leave, and even your scent, as you get through those nail biting first turns until you finally get to the point where you are not struggling and can start to carve your way through the world.Now you start to get pleasantly surprised because you find there is depth in the game. Depth in the combat system, depth in the crafting system, and it's challenging because you are gonna die if you are not careful. You might kill that wolf, but you took a scratch that is gonna get infected because you didn't find or craft any clean bandages, and haven't managed to find something to act as a dis-infectant. Left untreated this may progress to septis, and ultimately death.On the other hand, if you are not careful in combat, being tactical, the wolf just may kill you outright.Items decay, so in the long game you need to be able to get a backup supply... and then you start to find that there is actually a story here... WHAT YOU SAY?!?!?!?! I thought I was just enjoying a really great survival game, and BAM... all of a sudden I ran into some story elements and again realize this modest little game is actually filled with depth and fun, and a reason to keep playing, try to live longer, try to figure out just why and how you came to be here, and what you can do to go beyond surviving.There is a reputation system, and good versus evil behaviour. You can save the damsel in distress or throw in your lot with the bandits. It can be dark, really dark. You don't just kill stuff... you murder it... you rip people apart in scenarios where it's either you or them... fight or die... and sometimes you win just to find out later, you lost.If you give Neo Scavanger half a chance, you'll find a real gem here. A game which has been clearly and cleverly thought out to provide many hours of entertainment. I'm about 168 hours in as I write this, and still haven't seen 60% of the map. Lots and lots of fun to be had for a bargain basement price! Seriously.. if you like survival, buy this!			"

												NEO Scavenger is a turn-based, post-apocalyptic, survival roguelike with perma-death. I also now sometimes fondly call it a Procedural Death Michigan. It's mean, immersive, annoyingly addictive and seems to strongly dislike players wearing right boots (left boots are fine).Basically, you scavenge around (and die after the building crumbles on you), fight other people scavenging around (and die valiantly with monkey wrench in hand) or try to talk to them (and die a turn later by drinking a celebratory made-it-through-the-turn sip of poisoned water), try to kill creatures that would like to eat you almost as much as you'd like to eat them (and die hungry), craft items to help you survive (and die warm because your fire alerted every deadly thing around), keep track of your hunger, thirst, diseases and injuries (and die very informed) or try to get to the seemingly last big hub of civilization (and die trying to get there; or trying to get in; or after you get in; or on your way back out).In short this is a game where you try to make it through the day while figuring out what has happened to your hero and the world - and die trying. I really don't want to spoil this too much for you, but rest assured, whether you prefer dying by traumatic brain injury, blood loss, cholera, dehydration or an angry mob, there are enough options there to suit everyone's tastes. And if that doesn't sound fun to you, go away, I don't like you.-----And here's some actual analysisNEO Scavenger is the chess of survival games, if chess came without an instruction manual and forced you to scramble to understand its rules. It's all about making tactically sound moves, about the constant weighing of risk-reward decisions, but without ever feeling certain you made the right choice. Very much like real life in that way. The gameplay mechanics, while seemingly unforgiving, are actually there to remind you that you are not a badass superhero, just an average person thrown into a huge mess. Combined with the deliberate obfuscation of the player stats, this feeling of vulnerability makes the game surprisingly immersive. It's an exercise in role playing and player driven choices based on gut feeling rather than number crunching.Quite realistically for an average Joe, going in situations guns-a-blazing will rarely be rewarded, running away and hiding your tracks from a bunch of stray dogs may. The combat is a constant dirty struggle of trying to get the upper hand while dancing around your opponent, surprisingly complex and rewarding for something delivered with a few buttons and a bit of text. But even with great equipment and a character with decent combat skills, every fight you survive will leave you weakened, hurt, tired and more vulnerable to the next threat that comes along. In that way, the combat, as well as the deeply simulated survival and sickness mechanics, enhance the constant feeling of being exposed and alone, afraid and uncertain in the middle of a hostile world. You are never allowed to feel safe. You are never allowed to hunker down, build a huge base, put fences around it and kill everything that dares come through. Throughout the game, the mechanics drive you to keep moving on, keep surviving day to day, keep doing mundane inventory management, and keep trying not to die. And almost always failing.But dying here isn't always a bad thing. Since you can't really improve your skills, (though you can add to them in a limited way) you need to die to improve, to learn, to realize how to make better choices next time. You even need to die to learn more of the world, simply because you can never uncover everything in one playthrough. Which brings us to the story.Behind the immersive atmosphere and the fun, unforgiving gameplay mechanics, hides an interesting, complex, well-written story and huge amounts of lore and flavour text delivered both in long screens and in tiny bites literally everywhere you look. The story will never beat you over the head with what you should do next (and it's fair to say you should remain doubtful when it seems to do that), so it is perfectly ignorable if you just enjoy the sandbox game. But it's worth getting into, and it's also worth remembering that every time you think you know all the possible answers to a question, there's likely more there to discover, if only you do things slightly differently next time (by having a different build, carrying different items, making different choices, going down a different path, uncovering different information). The mystery of the story is a sprawling, complicated puzzle, one you will not solve easily, even by finishing the game the first few times.If it looks as if I'm ignoring the game's flaws, it's because to be honest I enjoy the game too much to notice them most of the time. That said, the UI could be friendlier to newcomers (which is a polite way to say it's pretty unintuitive); thankfully it's perfectly serviceable once you get used to it. Also, while obfuscating stats is an interesting and perfectly valid design choice, obfuscating some of the less intuitive game mechanics is simply an annoying hurdle to climb over when you first start out. In more technical matters, the cookie-based save system (one of the few elements there to constantly remind you that this is still a flash game) can be a real pain, the game doesn't play well with many commonly used modern resolutions and the process of adding mods is a bit too archaic and involved for most players these days. Even more importantly, there is a very valid argument to be made about how well a perma-death roguelike game with unforgiving mechanics can still make for a deep story-based experience that is more enjoyable than frustrating.But even with all its problems, as you may have gathered I think this is a great game: the perfect flawed little gem, and in my head already a cult classic.

								THIS is the post-apocalyptic hobo life simulator you've all been waiting for. THIS is the game where you scavenge your breakfast, lunch and dinner before scavenging your bed to sleep in the middle of tin cans strung on ropes to trip would-be thieves that would steal your precious squirrel meat so painstakingly caught in the forest. THIS is the game where you scavenge a bow and night vision goggles, craft make-shift arrows and go hobo-night-rambo, looting at night and turning bandits and raiders into pincushions from afar then loot their corpses for boots to sell on the junk market to buy a greasy chicken dinner with the earned money. THIS is the game where you wear a dog-man's pelt as a war trophy as you charge at looters with your meat cleaver and crowbar to steal their junk, then sit on their corpses savouring the handful of gummy bears they had in their pockets. This is Neo Scavenger, and it's the best post-apocalyptic hobo life simulator of all time. Until Neo Scavenger 2 comes out.			"

												I've been playing this game throughout it's development and it quickly became one of my favorite PC games. The game presents you with near limitless ways to approach and handle situations. Food, water, energy, and the environment are all factors that will determine your survival in-game. The combat is slow-paced and challenging, yet rewarding when you manage to win a fight. I can't recommend this game enough. Also, if this game looks interesting to you, try the demo!-Full Release Update: It only got better. Fixes, improvements, more content. Everything you could ask for from a small developer and a shining beacon of what Early Access games should be like.			"

												TL/DR at endGame is hard, but good.Until you find out the game is using 2-5GB of temporary internet files as your ""save data"" and cleaning your computer wipes your save, every time. Devs started with an internet flash game, and ended with an internet flash game. they can't even code the save files into real save files so that long-run gameplay (about a month or two in in-game 'time') doesn't start lagging. seriously, a game that is not server based and has low quality graphics lagging because devs can't code a proper save file. sad too, it had potential.EDIT:The fact that it is a flash save file IS the issue.the file being deleted upon cleaning your computer is just one of the problems that arise from the issue.If you clean your temporary internet files, even through chrome, firefox, or IE, like any halfway tech savy computer user from time to time, your save file WILL be deleted, as the files are stored in your temporary internet files, which is what gets wiped. This is something the devs SHOULD have anticipated, unless they are idiots who never maintain their computersThere is also the fact that the save file for one game gets HUGE because flash is not meant to save long term memory. While I have over 7TB hard drive space on my computer, so a 6GB save file goes practically unnoticed, this is not the case for everyone, and this also creates bigger problems that are not related to how much space you haveThe biggest issue is that the more you play the more the game lags because of this saving method, as flash games are not meant to continuously read and update a save file that big. The lag isn't apparent at first, but play and survive in the game for a few ingame months. you will start to notice stuttering and lag no matter what kind of computer you are running it on, beacuse the issue is with the game itself and flash player. A 2GB plus flash save file is unacceptable and just bad foresight by the devs, not to mention 6GB+ when you've been playing the game for a while.So yes, you could blame google chrome, firefox, CCCleaner, whatever for the save file deletion. But you have to blame the devs for using such a stupid system. For not knowing how or wanting to code a good save system. THEY are the ones who chose to put a decent sized persistant universe into a flash save file. THEY are the ones who decided to give their game a save system that will eventually make your saves unplayable.You can argue all you want, but the devs are the ones who made the decisions that gave thier game a crippling handicap. Maybe the game was never meant to be anything more than an online flash game, and for that game, that would be ok. But to package it as a game on steam when the game has that kind of major flaw? That is entirely dev screwupEDIT 2:To show that this is not the only issue with the game, but the one that overshadows everything else into making me write a negative review, here's some critiques i gave to an idiot who has his head to far in the sand:""The fact that I cannot rely on my save game's integrity, either due to the way the game saves or the lag in a single player game that is a result of that flaw, is a HUGE deal breaker for me, the rest of the game notwithstanding. The fact that it's a rogue-like game amplifies that, as all of my progress is that much harder to replicate. And as for ""lots and lots"" of content, no offense to the devs on this one, but there just isn't. The creatures and NPCs are pretty basic, storyline is minimal, and ""completing"" this game is both unsatisfactory, and ends the game without the option of continuing, There are also many events in the game that can happen either randomly or from you entering an area that can either kill you no matter what, no matter how geared or skilled you are, just because you chose the wrong option, or even better you chose the right option and it still has a chance of instantly killing you, or can kill you due to you not having one specific item that is absolutely useless under any other curcumstances and normally just takes up space in your pack.There's also an event that only happens when you character is asleep and is basically unblockable that leaves your character permanently blind ( a creature literally steals your eyes) and you have to move one hex at a time to the main city (which takes forever, even if you are close), while every creature and most NPCs that see you trying to murder you, and EVEN IF you make it to the city, you have to pay an ungodly amount of money for cybernetic eyes, JUST to resume your normal play.The thing is, I can look past all that, the other shortcomings of the game, and can still get enjoyment from it. If it weren't for the issues with the save files. Which is why I wrote a negative review citing the save files, because as I said, everything else I could look past as part of the challenge, dealing with a buggy and vengeful game that hates you. But the fact that on top of everything else, one of the main things you expect to have no issues with, your save file, has major issues, is a huge irritation to me.""TL/DR: The game has great potential and is fun if you don't intend to play it for long. But if you play to long the game lags, your save file gets deleted when you clean your temp internet files, and the game hates you more than dark souls			"

												“How long can you survive the post-apocalyptic wastelands of NEO Scavenger?” Asks the developer.To be more precise, It’s a game that will make you cherish plastic bags more than anything else.At one time I did carry three plastic bags at once: One in each hand and one put on the shoulder. Inside these an assortment of the finest junk ever seen by man: Empty bottles, cigarette lighter, a t-shirt, twigs, a sauce pan and even more crumpled plastic bags, in case the current ones rip apart. Let me tell you, plastic bags are the superior container for almost anything you might want to carry at some point in the post-apocalypse.

Oh and don’t drink unboiled water – I did and it was a mistake. A few days later while trying to sneak up to a sleeping stranger at night (To rob him, obviously; I needed a pair of new shoes), I got diarrhea. Uncontrollable stomach cramps made me fall down and curl up into a ball. The moaning woke up the stranger who’s been in a very bad mood. I started to bleed from my nose – probably from a virus like cholera I’ve ingested by drinking the water from a pond days earlier. I was indeed particularly thirsty the last few days.The stranger sprinted towards me and a few moments later, without asking questions, he clubbed me to death with the butt of his rifle – not because of my pain, but to conserve ammo. I think it was for the best, I would have died from internal bleeding anyway. My life was over before I even knew it.The interesting part here is that all of this did not feel “unfair”; I made a mistake hours before (drinking contaminated water) and could have prevented it (by boiling the water). Even after the fact, the symptoms of dehydration gave an indication that something was wrong: I could have ingested medicine immediately, but I didn’t.It’s great that games like this are made.			"

Introduction: How long can you survive the post-apocalyptic wastelands of NEO Scavenger? This may be the ongoing question asked of the player by it's developers yet, I guaruntee you will be asking youself this each time you load Neo Scavenger regardless of your experience with it's unforgiving world. Even in it's early access state Neo Scavenger accomplishes what many other developers desperately attempt to attain yet fail to accompllish, an incredibly solid title built in a believable and atmospheric world, all the while laughing in it's large budget competitiors faces because there is yet more to come.Overview: Neo Scavenger is a post apocolypic turn based survival strategy game that honors such classics as Fallout and Wasteland while retaining an identity all it's own. Set in an incredibly atmospheric world, the protagonist has recently emerged from a cryo chamber without a memory as to how he got there, who he is or what state the world is in. Within seconds he recieves the answer to the latter in a very unwelcoming way. You soon realize that you will desperately need to scavenge this unhospitable world if you intend on your survival and will have to leave your moral bindings behind if you're to be successful. While traveling you will be encountered by an assortment of undesirables that intend on their own as well and will achieve this at any cost, whether it be thievery, murder or deception. To assure your own instead, you will need to do the same.During your journey, you'll be presented with decisions that must be made and many times without prior knowledge of what may occurr based on your actions. You will pre-emptively strike what you deem to beGameplay: As stated above Neo Scavenger is a turn based survival strategy game with a wide range of varying elements that will affect each new journey you begin. You will be presented with an attribute screen where you must carefully select each according to your playstyle. Each will directly affect what skills you have available in given situations that will come about so, one must choose wiseley. Once your travels begin you will need to manage multiple aspects in regards to your health such as hydration, hunger, restfulness, health/illness, injuries, environment temperatures, weather and more. The decisions you make will directly affect the protagonist accordingly so, one must manage these elements with confidence or otherwise you'll be swiftly presented with a message that you will assuredly see quite often, the death screen. This will come often and without warning aside from your available character management system. With that being said make sure you obsess about the details because, it's all that stands in the way of you and the grim reaper.Aside from illness, fatigue, hunger and the like, you will of coarse encounter a variety of enemies along your journey that also as stated above intend on your demise. Combat is performed via a turn based system which, issues you an incredible assortment of options depending on your original skill/attribute selection which, I must reaffirm must be choen wisely! The options presented during combat range from hide, melee, , kick downed opponent, headbutt, sneak, ranged, retreat, offer/demand surrender, offer/accept cease fire, attempt to talk and countless other available options that are once again available depending on you attribute selection.Do I need to remind you to choose them wisely once again? I do? O.k check it out, this one's gonna hit home a bit more....Unless you carefully choose your attributes, you may within seconds contract any one of the following unpleasant status illnesses or diseases: Blindness, Blisters, Blue Rot, Cholera, Coughing Blood, Crippled Limb, Defoliant Exposure, Diarrhea, Gastroenteritis, Heat Stroke, Hypothermia, Hypovolemic Shock, Poisoned, Sepsis, Shock, VomitingSound fun? No? Then choose wisely my friends, trust me.You will without a doubt die and die often, yet during each playthrough you will obtain more knowledge in regards to how to survive and future strategies that come of it. Graphics: The graphics of Neo Scavenger serve their purpose. They are in no way revolutionary and aren't intended to be, nor needed to be whatsoever. Yet if there were one weakness of Neo Scavanger this would be it. As mentioned above the graphics serve their purpose but, that in no way means that the options available should be so barron. The options available are as basic as it gets and are as folows: Full screen, windowed, 16:9, 4:3, frame rate limiter, filter and stretch. Pretty uneventful to say the least and due to the graphics engine's limitations they do not scale. So expect the presentation to be a bit lackluster. Yet, once again they serve their purpose and it will not ruin your experience whatsoever. So take this section with a grain of salt because, if you're in the market for a game in this genre, graphics are the least of your worries.Sound: The music and sound effects although they may not present themselves often are perfectly crafted to create a tense and fitting atmosphere. Given the situation, the music will accompany and heighten your feeling of desperation within this incredibly depressing world. With each fade in the music will most definitely add an element that most other games cannot match. Considering so, the developers deserve an award for knowing when less is more and Neo Scavenger is a perfect example of that. The echoing sounds of the barron wilderness accompany the simplistic soundtrack design and add to a believable experience. Story: The story although seemingly simplistic and unoriginal at first is where Neo Scavenger will surprise you at every turn and leave you wanting to know more about our most unlucky protagonist. Although at first sight it may seem minimalistic, you will be proven wrong as you progress further into this world of chaos he so sadly awoke to. The story contained in Neo Scavenger will most assuredly be a driving force behind your desire to continue multiple play sessions to discover more about what happened to this once populated land. As you can see by my vagueness, I am doing my best to protect any insight as to specific story elements which, should serve as a hint that it's most definitely there and is most definitely worthwhile. Trust me when I say, there will be many more than one occasion that will leave you in awe and in horror.   Replay Value: The replay value found in Neo Scavanger is second to none and I am by no means stretching my imagination out of bounds to come to that conclusion. The very fundamentals of Neo Scavanger are built to lure the player back into it's world of dessolation, no matter how many times they've played before. With each play through, you will gain knowledge as to how your next session could possibly last longer and you will most definitely feel an urge to apply it for a ""better"" outcome. What will give you an even more increasing desire to launch it again is that, even after you believe you have mastered it's many facets of gameplay.....you will die and die you will, often and mercilessly. Yet regardless, you will most assuredly return once again to the world of Neo Scavenger and enjoy every gut wrenching second. Final (Early Access BETA) Review Score: 8.3/10Although still in Early Access form, I in no way feel it to be a hinderance to come to a determination that Neo Scavenger should find a place in the library of any gamer looking for a title that will surpass their expectations and leave them in shock that they haven't played it before. The developers at Blue Bottle Games have poured an incredible amount of love and attention into their world of solitude and despair which, I guaruntee will leave you feeling the same. If you're in the market for a survival game, give Neo Scavenger a chance!			"

								Quite possibly one of the best games I have played in the recent months. I got it with a bundle, but NEO Scavenger is honestly worth more than its asking price. It may only be flash, but don't let that deter you. It has one of the most realistic systems I have encountered. The developer is an active member of his own community, and that is very difficult to find these days with titles of this magnitude.I'm not very picky with what I play, but I am picky with what I play often. Since I got it, I have been playing this game every day, dieing every day, and starting anew every day. You die, a lot. But for some reason I always come back to start again, most times directly after the fact. This isn't like Dark Souls difficult, where if you die, you can just load up a save from right before it. No. When you die, you die. You have to start all over again.Each time you start, it is somehow an entirely new experience every time. The maps are randomized, NPC loadouts are randomized, loot and scavenging opportunities are randomized. The only things that don't change are the story, fixed encounters, and your inevitable death in these unforgiving wastes. You can spend hours building up the best loot and getting the best weapons and armor, just to get kicked in the head in your sleep, and have to start all over again. For some reason I have come to enjoy this.The crafting system is remarkable, to say the least. Much more involved than that of Minecraft or Terraria. You are able to use the skills you chose at the start of the game to create new and different items than you could without. Being able to craft items that can possibly save you from a fight with a Dogman or a Blue Frog, keep you fed for a day, or drink clean water, can give you some sense of security. Until you fall asleep and get kicked in the head.This game is not for those that want an easy game, that they can win every opportunity they get. You can be fully armored and have a shotgun in one hand and a crowbar in the other and pulverize the person you're fighting, just to have them throw a rock at you and die of internal bleeding a couple turns later. This game is unforgiving, and even when you're the biggest badass of the wastes... you can still die by eating some berries.I love this game. Plain and simple.			"

Attack of the Barefoot Cannibalistic Showroom DummiesTwo days into my first successful venture into NEO Scavneger, I've resorted to cannibalism. It's not like I really had to - I was taking a nap in a small city when a stranger woke me up. I was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I took his soul away with a crowbar and noticed that I'm a bit hungry. Checked it - yes, not surprising - I can use a shard on the corpse and scavenge myself some tasty human meat. Two hexes later in the woods, I've made myself a nice BBQ and I'm feasting on that human.As I chew on what was just two hexes ago my rival in an unfair fight, I am suddenly overcome with  disgust. I could have just left the corpse there, and move on to hunt a squirrel or pick some non-poisonous berries. Yet I chose to eat that person. And before doing that I looted him of his hoodie which was in a better condition.But karma got to me quick. I was quickly poisoned in some mysterious way and then something wielding a 12-Gauge Shotgun blew me to bits, all my progress and looting down the drain.NEO Scavenger can be really daunting at first; you'll die a lot. But once you pick it up - it's hard to put it down. It's a wonderful selfishness simulator that is fun and engaging, built on a fantastic crafting system which brings out the curious child in you. The ""old"" graphics do not deter from the enjoyment, quite the opposite – they only make it eerier and more atmospheric. The soundtrack is great too and generally it feels like a lot of thought was given to the game. I haven't delved into the lore of the game yet but there are newspapers lying around with bits of info and it seems that there's a bigger story which unfolds as you manage to survive and stay alive. Unfortunately that's not as easy as it sounds, not at all; you can also go great strides (even without turning into a cannibal) and then get blown away by a shotgun or catch a disease. This could hinder the experience for some players who focus on storylines and want to complete the game – take to heart that this will be VERY HARD. This game is hardcore as it gets and it doesn't hold your hand at all.The best advice is to watch let's plays etc and if you do pick up the game, try it for yourself before picking up a guide. You WILL pick up a guide ultimately but try to experience it without any aid at all. It'll produce unique experiences in which you'll end up dead (in your hospital gown usually). Overall this is worth much more than its price tag, a very refreshing entry to the world of roguelike which does it very very right - a sort of improved UnReal World with frightening creatures and a darker theme.

Early Access Review
								NEO Scavenger is a turn-based, roguelike scavenging game. I like it a lot, because it's gritty, fairly in-depth and more realistic than almost every other survival game.NEO Scavenger first asks you to choose your perks/flaws: Botanist, Strong, Myopia, etc. There are no XP and levels, so, mostly, what you see is what you get. After selecting your starting skills, you are thrown into the game barefoot and with only a hospital gown.Your first order of business is finding the basics of survival: shoes (one left and one right!), warm clothes, a lighter, a crowbar for scavenging, a sleeping bag, tools to obtain clean food and water and something to carry all this stuff around. In fact, the very first treasures you'll scavenge are probably disposable plastic grocery bags. They're very fragile, but they're tiny, weigh nothing and will serve as your first backpack. Those bad boys are little life savers, you have to love them! We should probably produce and dump more plastic bags all over the place for fututre survivors, right now. What do you think of that, environmentalists?From then on, you'll also need to find all the other things you need to survive: clean rags for wounds, alcohol for disinfection, antibiotics, painkillers, a firearm with ammo, gloves, a gasmask for polluted areas, crafting tools, binoculars, noisemakers to warn you of intruders during the night, etc. One of the game's main qualities is that the list of things needed to survive effectively is very, very long, but you can also make do with just the essentials.Contemporary technology is surprisingly useless. A found computer might have no battery, then a found battery might have no charge in it, then a charged battery will reveal the computer is password-locked, then you'll hack it (if you picked that skill)... only to discover the computer only contains pictures of cats. On the other hand, a cheap plastic bottle filled with safe drinking water is always a useful commodity. Is that social commentary or what?Weapons are also imporant, but not nearly as much as in most survival games. It's possible to completely avoid all combat with a peace-loving build.Speaking of which, combat is a strange numberless affair, where you choose broad actions (run forward/back, take cover, trip enemy, threaten). The only numeric value is range, which is enormously important depending on your fighting style. What you do get are surprisingly graphic descriptions of your situation: ""You have passed out from unbearable pain"" or ""You have died from acute bleeding to the lungs"". Ouch. As in real life, he who strikes first usually wins. It's also possible to win a fight and die from your injuries not long afterwards. All in all, fights are terrying (as they should be), the results are sometimes unpredictable and fighting fair is always a stupid idea. Did I mention you can be killed in your sleep (and vice-versa)?There's also crafting, there's always crafting. Except here it's realistic. You're not going to craft an assault rifle with rocks in NEO Scavenger. In fact, a good ol'fire is probably the number one recipe. Sorry, no fire by friction if you haven't chosen the Trapper skill at character creation. Making fire without an external source is really not that easy without training. Another essential crafting recipe is: Fire + Water + Receptacle = Boiled (sterile) Water. Don't tell me it's boring until, weakened by diarrhea from drinking dodgy water, you are punched to death by a hobo. By the way, the game doesn't tell you what makes you sick: you only know you messed up somewhere when symptoms start showing up.The game leaves the player with three general survival strategies: use nature's gifts to provide for your needs, scavenge cities for pre-apocalypse technology or... murder every survivor in sight for the contents of their shopping bags, RAWR!The game has a main storyline, but as of right now it's pretty short. And did I tell you THIS GAME HAS NO ZOMBIES? Yay!The game has two main flaws. First, the game could do a better job helping you find points of interest. The map is very large and it's not obvious where the important areas are. The second is almost a praise: I want more of it! I want more items, more weapons, more unique areas, more special encounters, more animals. MOAR! The possibilites of common household items having ingenious survival uses is almost endless. Variety in this game is good, but not great, but things are still being added to the game (and there are mods).While I recommend NEO Scavenger, it is in Early-Access at 99% complete, so it might be worth waiting a bit if you want the best first experience possible. Yet even right now, it's still a pretty great game and an impressive achievement as the work of a single man.In conclusion, I'll quote Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Graham Smith which sums up the game's worth pretty well:""NEO Scavenger is the only survival game that feels like it has anything to do with survival.""

												If the original fallout, dayz, stalker, the original wasteland and FTL somehow managed to procreate and make a new game, that game would be NEO scavenger. A very deep and challenging game where boots are just as much a reason to be happy then finding a gun. This brutal game will kill you many many times. Perma death is the feature that is key in this game. Its probabily the most accurate representation of a post apocolyptic world and a representation on how we all would do in it...That is embarisingly bad. Probabily the best ""survival"" game out there. Alot better then the endless zombie survival games or other rubish. Plus this one has a story told somewhat in the style of dark souls. That is peicing togethere what happened to you. I managed to beat the game 14 hours in. You live, You Fight, You get dysentary then you die a horrible death.			"

								This is my first experience with a 'serious' roguelike, and I have to say that I'm extremely impressed.  The exploratory gameplay is exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time, and the unpredictable nature of events in the game means you'll spend much of your time simply trying to plan ahead for every contingency.  This coupled with the constant threat of permanent death creates a very engaging experience.If I had to point out a flaw, it would be that the interfaces are generally not very streamlined, which can slow down your gameplay a little bit, depending on what you're doing.

												I like turn-based games.  I like survival games.  I like rogue-like games.  So a turn-based, rogue-like survival game?  Sign me up!  Except not for this turn-based, rogue-like survival game please.IMHO rogue-like games like FTL and Don't Starve succeed because they're a streamlined experience, which makes ""dying part of the fun"".  Starting a new game is always exciting and you're confident you can learn from your past mistakes so you'll survive longer this time 'round.This is where NEO falls short.  The dev had a vision and built the game to match that vision.  But if his vision of a post-apocalyptic wasteland does not align with your vision of a post-apocalyptic wasteland, prepare to encounter all sorts of frustratingly illogical, immersion-breaking events.People call FTL brutally hard and overly random, but I ""get it"" - it makes sense to me when I play.  I can learn from past mistakes and play better.  NEO makes no sense to me.  The game design decisions are just weird, the interface is clunky, the graphics are grotesque.  Dying for no clear reason, when things seem to be going swimmingly right up until you die, *may* be realistic (?) in the dev's world, but not mine.You get the same kind of all-of-a-sudden deaths in Don't Starve but it's always clear that ""I shouldn't have attacked that Pig Man just for kicks"" or ""I shouldn't have tried to chop that last tree before lighting my campfire"" or ""I should have abandoned my hunt for gold and hunted berries instead, so I wouldn't starve"".Playing NEO is like being put in a straight-jacket designed by the dev.  ""Play my way or not at all"".  Okay dude - IF your way makes logical sense and there's a clear progression from A-to-B-to-C-to-You Died.   Going A-to-R-to-D-to-You Died does not help me live longer next time!  So ""I shouldn't scavenge that random house the way I've scavenged every other house so far, because I should have known the roof was going to cave in""?  or ""I shouldn't have tried to run away from that particular encounter because I should have known I would trip, fall on my♥♥♥♥♥and not be able to stand up again even though I'm healthy, rested and well-fed""?  How do I avoid either of those situations next time around?  That's two of the dozens of deaths that will leave you scratching your head going ""REALLY?!?"".Forumites will tell you, take this skill, that skill and the other skill and you'll never die.  Okay, but what if I *don't want* to take those three specific skills.  What if I want to build the character *I want to play*?  In that case, prepare for many, many, many frustrating deaths because you're not playing his game the way the Dev wants you to.I don't get some of these other reviews:  ""Dogman killed me while I slept despite the fact that I put down multiple noise traps, Thumb's Up 10/10.""  WTF?  Is that a joke?  It's not helpful.  ""Stabbed a guy three times then kicked him in the head when he was down.  He was hurt, bleeding out and on the edge of unconsciousness but he got up, landed one lucky punch and I was immediately unconscious, Thumb's Up 10/10"".   Troll reviews like that are turning this Reviews tab into a joke.			"

												Day 30: found some pimp and he wanted me to give his ""lady"" some medical attention, I decided to put some dirty rags on the gaping wound. She is probably going to die of an infection, but hey he gave me 500 dollars so who's complaining?Day 40: finally got to a civilized area, I got in line to get in the city but I wasn't allowed in because I didn't have what appears to be a bracelet for cool kids. Right after that some dude with a neat hat told me to follow him, I didn't listen to him because he was boring, when he began looking at me like he wanted an answer I got nervous and shouted ""it's a trap!"", he was impressed of my trap finding skills so he gave me a cool kids bracelet or something. I put it on so I looked cool in front of the people who kicked nerds out of the line to the city, when they saw my watch they let me in. Luckily because I sold my twenty left footed gumboots and some poisonous berries I was able to afford eye surgeryDay 50: I set up three noise traps, one tarp shelter and a sleeping bag somewhere in the forest, also I killed around six Dogmen without being hit. I also learned to make tea.... that's cool right? Anyway I digress, later that day I was stabbed by some cultist from Isis or blue frog, one of those two, so I poured some boiled water onto my open wound and covered it with a clean piece of cloth. Now there is a 0% chance of getting an infectionDay 60: people started running away from me on sight, maybe it has to do with the fact I'm wearing the skin of a Dogman as a vest and squirrels as gloves not to mention I'm carrying a loaded hunting rifle while having one strapped to my back with no ammo. I also have a nifty broad spear that is covered with the blood of my past twenty or so enemies, also I have a sled with extra fire wood in itDay 65: a melon head was no nice as to bring me a shopping cart basket with no wheels! That is now where I'm going keep all 10 of my left footed shoes.I've been proceeding to kill as many evil people as I can, I don't care if they won't bother me I kill them because them because they are on my lawn, I only spare ATN warriors and any other possible neutral that is holding a gun.Day 70: Never taking my talisman off again.... Don't ask why...Day 80: Just remembered I was supposed to talk to that guy with the hat like 39 days ago. Better not go back there, instead I will go explore whatever is north from my baseDay 83: the nearest source of water is 3 hexes away, better drink my own♥♥♥♥♥♥br>Day 84: Note to self the yellow liquid is not♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is an energy drinkDay 85: I was almost starving to death until I came across a true messiah, a looter with tomato sauce sachets it was so nice of him to uhh… die for meDay 86: I just ate four forest hexes worth of edible berries and mushroomsDay 90: I am beginning an investment; from this day forth I swear to sell all of my Dogmen skin to replace my eyes with robotic night vision ones. Or so the people around the city for cool kids said I couldDay 100: Came back to base, I found several guns and some ammo during the scavengingDay 105: I made a sling, time to get some looters ‘stoned’Day 110: Today I was shot by a Bad Mutha who had a pistol. Rocks weren’t working so I killed him with my spear and soaked the wound with alcohol and bandaged it with clean rags. I looted his body to find he had a left footed flip flop, gummy bears and tomato sauce sachets.Day 112: my arms are moderately wounded and bleeding; I was attacked by two Dogmen during the night. Also I now have two more Dogman coats. My injuries are nothing that boiled water, bandages, rest and a little painkiller can’t fix.Day 113: my base is full of Dogman coats. I have either gotta move ‘em over to another hex or take a hike to DMC and sell them allDay 150: I can’t stand living anymore, I need to end this, I have realized this land has no hope, so why should I, tonight I take off the talisman again.END			"

												A hardcore survivalist game. By hardcore, I'm talking perma death, just about everything can kill you easily, and you're kind of lady luck's ♥♥♥♥♥ in regards to how well you can do sometimes. That said, this is a great game. It's a thinking man's title, borderline unfair (I mean that in a begrudging good way),  and it will take you a long time to really master the concept of it. Coupled with a gigantic procedurally generated world and you'll find yourself playing a new set of variables each time, particularly as you can pick a handful of your starting skills before stepping into the frying pan that is NEO Scavenger.Story-wise, it's kind of an end of the world scenario, except more dealing with mutants, mad men, and bandits, rather than zombies. The plot is kind of backseated to the gameplay, however. I found almost all the NPCs to be universally hostile or locked into a constant fight/flight mentality. Don't expect dialogue or too much revealing information- your character wakes up as a corpsicle in a cryo vat and you're basically thrust into an unknown landscape. You have to gather what you need to survive and you need to do it FAST. Freezing to death is very easy and this game does not hold a newcomer's hand whatsoever. You will be hunted, attacked remorselessly, robbed, and yes, you can literally be killed in one round by the wrong person if you're unlucky. As such, this is about SURVIVAL. Not racking up xp and going nuts with a pea shooter.While I like NEO Scavenger, there's some things that are a needless hassle about the gameplay. The interface is extremely clunky for your items, the crafting system is a bit vague (I have a sharp edge like the recipe says... I can't harvest this dog because...?), and the biggest issue to me, is the game saves via Flash cookies, not on Steam.Imagine my disgust when I kept finding my save games erased after every play session. Hours and hours, gone. So I checked my Flash and found I had it enabled to allow cookies to be saved. So something else was deleting them. According to the developers, it could be one's antivirus or any of a number of things. With all due respect, I don't really care to go searching every minute infrastructural maintenance program I have to find out which program is deleting the cookies beyond Flash and what might need an exclusion to NEO- this should have been saved in the Steam Cloud or however many other games here do it without issue. I really REALLY wish the developers would have done something about this instead forcing the player to find a meta solution. Unfortunately, from what I've read, they're not really doing anymore updates and the game is considered completed. :/ Which is a shame, because I loved everything else about this.I would heartily recommend NEO but the issue with saves is not something I can overlook after finding this out several hours in. If the developers would or could somehow make the game save within Steam and not through cookies, I will happily change this to a Recommendation. As of now, I reluctantly can't do that.			"

												As is it is a great TBS Scavenger/survival game. It has the perfect Luck/Skill game and liken to Fallout gameplay. There is nothing more fun then setting up a camp and building up a sustanable inventory. If you like TBS or some form of survival game this is the game for you.Now that the game is offically out I'd say this is the best game I've played in the TBS/survial game tag.			"

								Ooooooh baby!      There are no words to express how amazing this game is. Except you know, amazing! Never in my life have I loved a semi-text based game so much. This game combines grim 2d graphics, immense crafting, and the consequences of your choices into one massive and great post-apocalyptic world simulator. The game has an amazing storyline, and whoever wrote the everything for this game deserves an amazing raise in their job. This is a game where you just have to play it, to see what it is truly capable of.			"

Don't let the semi-clunky user interface and middle-of-the road pixel graphics sway you; NEO Scavenger is an utterly addicting turn-based survival roguelike game that will steal your time.---So I have the wifey take this for a test drive, since I'm lazy and want to lay on the couch. I figure this run would end pretty quick, because I know death is apparently frequent in this game (aka roguelike). I turn around to eat a bag of chocolate, and before I know it the hobo main character is wearing six t-shirts, a hoodie, a hospital gown, a size 7 left shoe, and a size 9 right boot.Wow. That escalated quickly. More like NEO Scavenger: Hobo Simulator 2015Plastic baggies are literally a currency in this world. We had one on our back, one in each hand, and about 6 spare ones stashed in the others. Nuts.Not even to mention the inventory tetris that I just witnessed. Literally level 9,000 sh*t going on here. If you are OCD or have hoarding tendencies, be forewarned.---What was so fun about this game is that you really feel the excitement as you rise up and gather better and better gear. There is alot of strategy and exploration that keeps things fresh. The story elements are present, but are never bothersome.Pros:+Quite addictive.+Very deep and complex interactions. Lots of attention to detail with crafting and how items interact. How clothing functions, etc. Further, there are lots of ways to go about a situation.+Feels fair. We actually got quite far on the first run or so.Cons:-Interface feels clunky at first, but isn't that bad when you get past the learning curve.-Music is almost non-existant. Fine enough with me because bad music is bad.-The combat system leaves something to be desired. Thankfully the game is not centered around it.Yeah totally worth full price - lots of really fun replay value here. "

												You're battered, bruised, bleeding and experiencing the symptons from one of the most deadliest diseases known in this post-apocalyptic landscape. Your sleep was interrupted last night after the rustling of cans awoke you. Barley managing to roll away as a crowbar struck where your head would have been less then a second ago. You catch a brief glimpse of your assailent: raggedand erratic with the souless eyes of a killer. He hits you, the cold metal smashing your arm as you clamber to your feet. Your eyes still adjusting to the darkness, you miss your swing, the cold steel of your meet cleaver slashing the air in front of your attacker. He reponds with a swing of his own, smahing into your ribs... hard, bones cracking under the force.You prepare to dodge, mentally readying yourself, watching for any twitch of movement. It pays off, you notice his legs kneel, powering themselves for a leap. At the last moment you step aside, watching him tackle past you into the rubble. A swift slice to the head lacerates immensly as he trys to make sense of what happens. The next few moments of the battle went fast. Your kicks met either his head or torso repeatedly, denying him any chance of standing upright. A stray slice here with your trusty cleaver made short work of his frrail body.Eventually, your slashes and kicks are wasted energy, the bloody mess becoming an outlet for your rage.During the fight you had noticed an important feature about the mans attire. A paitents gown with a deep blue sash, signifying him as a carrier of the 'Blue Rot' disease.It's too far a walk to the city to be cured at the early, treatable stage. Let alone your wallet wan't fat enough to pay for the bills for the procedure. Your rage doen't subside for what seems an eternity, slicing at the once human-like mess over and over, your rage overcoming you. At some point of time, you must have dropped the cleaver, because now you were punching at the chunky mess that was the mans skull. You had been defeated before, knocked unconcious, left for dead with nothing except for the clothes that merciful scavengers didnt steal from your body. Bullet wounds, lacerations, bruises, concussions, broken ribs and limbs, hunger, dehydration, sleep deprevation and even sickness from wounds left untreated. Every form of pain and punishment had been inflicted onto you. But Everytime you bounced back, fresh with scars from your victories. man and beast fell before you all the same. The wild environment of post-apocolypse detroit had you at the knifes edge at every moment, but every time you pulled a trick from your sleeve.But this time was different. You saved yourself to live another day, but not to live to see the end of the week. Right now the blue rot was creeping though your veins, infecting every pore of your body. Within a few days you wil be dead, no amount of trickery or wit could save you from this situation.Your days are numbered, death is imminent. You don't bother falling back to sleep. Dead men don't need sleep. You wander aimlessly and painfully through the night, leaving your possessions and your killer's corpse behind. At dawnbreak, you feel hungry eyes linger on you. Your hunter had been following you at least an hour but you didn't care, his means to your end would be quicker then suffering pain of blue rot.You let the towering, werewolf-esque creature approach you slowly at a distance. You reach for cleaver, a final battle and a warriors death. But your hand grabs aimlessly at your waist as it dawns on you that your precious weapon of steel was a 4-hour walk behind you, stuck halfway through your attackers leg.You stand still, without purpose, without hope, as the beast charges for you. He leaps at you, claw ready to swipe. You try to dodge, instinct priotising survival rather thant wishing to die but it was too late. The claws enter your skull effortlessly, the pain is incredible, agonising to levels of extreme. It takes one more slice from the beast to end your life and your journey ends.If you made it to the end of this text crawl wondering why i would write something so long, it's because i felt NEOscavenger required more than a simple review like: ""Got shot in head while asleep 420/10""The above story was a more descriptive, but true, experience i had with one of my more longer playthroughs.NEOscavenger is harsh, brutal and if it were human, would probably kill puppies for the heck of it. Every journey with your character, every battle, every scavenge attempt, every time you press that sleep button, can end your playthrough abrubtly and heart-breakenly if you aren't careful enough. Fights can go from one-sided victories or soul-crushing losses within moments. Dehydration seems to kick in when there is no water source for kilometers, and hunger when the only food source was that scavenger you just slaughtered... Traits allow for unique and differing playthroughs. Posiitives and negatives balacing eachother out. A myopic tank, the athletic botanist, the frail ranger, a Medical mechanic. The combat: a turn-based sequence of text describing the events of the battle, are some of the most sweat-inducing fearful moments that i have experienced in gaming. With a bit of imagination, fights in NEOscavenger are brutally intense, every option increasing your chances of winning or dieing.There are no easy victories, no fights won unscarred, no journey left unhindered by some problem, some gnawing concern that would later illicit your demise. My playtime says 20hrs: but if you counted the time i've spent in both the demo, and less than legal copies of the game, i've spent time almost quadruple that.If your looking for a game that expects nothing more then your full attention to stay alive and healthy, and are still somehow not convinced by the plethoria of reviews before mine, look no further then NEOscavenger  "

												From my time playing the early access version: I thought this was just going to be some weird little thing i'd play once and throw in the backlog forever. Two and a half hours later I'm crawling after a concussed blind man who stabbed me in the head with an arrow. I have to get up before him so I can kick him unconscious and dump his pockets onto the ground. He has a beef jerky that I eat immediately. I bandage up my head, pop some painkillers and shuffle my bleeding, bruised, hypothermic self back into the woods in search of water. This game is awesome.			"

												Although NEO Scavenger doesn't have the fancy graphics of titles with huge budgets and numerous developers, it manages to do a lot more with a lot less. Scraping by and surviving in a world in which almost everything and everyone would rather see you dead (and in which death is permanent) may not sound fun on paper, but the game manages to create that addictive just-one-more-turn quality that's a sign of a great game. Thanks to the excellent music and writing, the game also manages to pull off an impressive amount of immersion and atmosphere with the limitations of the isometric, hexagonal world.Unlike a lot of early access games with more staff and so less of an excuse, the developer has been communicative and responsive throughout which I can only think has led to a better game.NEO Scavenger is a testament to what one guy with vision and dedication can do.

								Today I lived for 6 days and 15.8 hours.  I will play again soon. What if I could live for a week or a month?  What if I could make it to the ""glow""?  What if there is actually an end to this game?  I need not guides -- I like grit.  I like randomly dying from cardiac arrest.  I like knowing that I will FREEZE TO DEATH -- if I'm running around outside naked like an idiot.  I like knowing that at the end of the session my decisions mattered.  Sometimes it feels a bit like RNG might be getting me down...but mostly its just challenging.  I keep living long enough to get more tidbits of the story.  I see something new each time I play.  If you want instant gratification...this game might not be for you.  If you want a game where choices matter and death is permanent, try it.			"

See that’s how they get you.  They make a reasonably priced game and the game is well made don’t get me wrong, however that’s where the plot thickens.Before you know it, you pay for the game, load it up and poof… 5 hours gone.  You don’t seem to notice it but you go to work the next day when you get home your soon looking around and wondering how in the world is another 5 hours just… gone.  One moment my wife is yelling at me and 5 hours later she is snoring in the other room but I never noticed.How did they do that and how do I sue?Thank you for a great game. "

												Having followed this game during the end tail of its beta development, I am pleased to say that it's been as much fun in day one as it was on release.  It's not without its frustrations, but these frustrations are part of the rogue-like mechanic (why can't I find a pair of boots, dammit! ...also, I died again).Also, the game is moddable.  So if there's something you want to tweak (within the constraints of the engine), you can learn to do so or see if someone else did so already.There is still a lot about this game I haven't discovered, as I still need to range outside of the ""just survive"" part and delve into the mysteries hinted at here and there.  But overall, it's been an enjoyable ride.  If you didn't pick this up in a Humble Bundle or during Beta, now's a good time to do so!			"

												NEO Scavenger is a really intense survival game. You can make a character based off of different skills and survival tactics. Depending on what you chose, your experience with the game will change. If you take Medical Knowledge, you can tend your wounds faster, or if you take Melee, you will be able to fight better. It's a very brutal and unforgiving game. If you mess up, it could cost you your life. Perma-death is a thing so you really want to be careful.  The descriptions of what you do in combat is very descriptive and really helps with immersion.Pros:- It's very fun- Rewarding if you come across some good gear- Very realistic in the mechanicsCons:- no animations or visuals during combat- Purely text based (could be a good thing if you like that, I do)- near impossible on your first few lives.- UI takes some time to get used toOver all, it's a very brutal, but fun survival game, and I am really glad that I got it. If you enjoy wilderness survival games, this one will not dissapoint you.			"

												A very unique gameplay experience. Here was my first time playing.Day 1:What is this place? Oh interesting. So we have cryo chambers. this game is pretty nic-OH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT*uses the power of nature to kill a lethal creature*cool.*climbs out window and doesnt bleed from chards for some reason*Time to explore.*time passes*ooh, whats this? I'm...shivering?Huh I better find clothes.*time passes*I'm thirsty? better drink this river water.{PLAYER HAS DIAREHHA}WHAT? WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?*time passes*Oh god im freezing to death and now im hungry.*night time*I'll sleep in this abandoned office building.{PLAYER HAS DIED FROM HYPOTHERMIA}Wow.Very tough and will take many tries to actually live long.I think this game is a ""  Don't Starve [www.dontstarvegame.com] "" like game where you try to avoid dying as long as possible. It's going to happen. It's rogue-like and very tough. Whether you die from Hunger, Thirst, Hypothermia, or Diarrhea, this game will still be memorable.PROS AND CONS:----------------------------------------+ Customizable stats. You can be very tough or an electrician, whatever floats your boat.+ Very hard. This game shows no mercy and shoves you right in. (googling crafting tutorials might be smart)+ Crafting. This game is full of unique crafting where you can craft anything from a fire to a wheelbarrow.+ Interacting with others. It feels like it isnt just you out there. The world is bustling with Raiders, Looters, and nice people who you can kill, steal from, or just say hi to.+ Strategical fighting. The first game I've ever seen with a ""Threaten"" option in the middle of combat.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Single Player only. This game would be boring with multiplayer, but I wanted to note this just in case you didnt know.- Loot Spawning. Sometimes you'll find nothing in a locked shed. Sometimes in an empty field you'll find a loaded shotgun. The loot spawns sometimes are unrealistic.- 2D artstyle. I personally am ok with the 2D, but it must be noted you are buying a 2D game.- Unusual death. Sometimes you will be well fed, well quenched, and well slept, but die in your sleep from a monster.I overall would give this game an 8/10.			"

												When I originally bought this game several years ago, it was on a random whim during a sale.  I played it for about 15 minutes, and was so turned off by the way it looks and the unintuitive interface that I pretty much immediately uninstalled it.  This was a big mistake.I recently re-installed it, determined to give it another shot, and what I discovered, underneath the (genuinely off-putting) flash game look and feel, is a game of truly staggering complexity and compelling depth.NEO Scavenger is a game in which you can wrap a rag around your face when exploring buildings to avoid inhaling toxic mold, pry open the lock on a storage shed with your crowbar, find an empty soup can and a left shoe, and pump your fists into the air in triumph IRL because now you won't have to worry about getting blistered feet, and you can boil the water you've been finding to make it safe for consumption.  Now, if only you had some pants...Similarly, no other game has ever filled me with such joy and sheer relief at finding an adult-sized backpack.  Such an item enables you to carry enough wood and water that you don't have to keep stopping every few spaces to make camp, and you can make much better time on foot towards that mysterious glow in the East!One game, I was attacked by a feral dog, who I beat to death with my bare hands, falling down into the mud and becoming exhausted.  Using a shard of glass, I skinned the beast after it died from internal hemmorhaging brought on by my pummeling.  I took its meat and cooked it over a fire, overjoyed that I'd figured out how to do so.  Delicious, life-giving dog meat.  I used its hide to wrap around the glass shards and make a crude shiv, not knowing what else to do with it.  I was then set upon by a bandit who'd heard my struggles with the dog, to whom I surrendered, knowing I stood no chance.  He left me naked and near death from hypothermia.  I ran into the woods and quickly built a fire as night fell, plotting my revenge, sleeping fitfully on the ground.  When dawn broke, I went to the nearest building and by sheer chance, found some clothing and a crowbar.  I went in search of the bandit who took my dog meat, only to find him dead near some other buildings.  The wastes are cruel indeed.If you miss Wasteland 1, if you think Fallout 2 really badly needed detailed wound dressing and immune system mechanics, this is the game for you.  It would be really nice if you could choose to play as a woman, but privately I suspect that the creator didn't want to deal with modeling pregnancy or the menstrual cycle.  Can't say as I blame him.			"

												Hands down one of the best games out there.It's like a single-player Rust roguelike set in a Fallout style post-apocalyptic wasteland with a dash of dwarf fortress adventure mode.Outstanding but not overbearing or mandatory story. You can just ignore it and survive, or you can persue it and enjoy the eerie and compelling narrative.Incredible, constantly changing and progressing combat. Tons of variables including fatigue, damage type, range, and even intimidation make sure that the combat stays complex, deep into the game. The graphics might look off-putting at first, but they're exactly where they need to be. After five minutes of play, you're completely immersed.Salvaging is wonderful. Do I explore the crumbling apartment building? It might collapse. I could use a torch so I can see better and maybe not hurt myself, but then it's more likely that something angry will see the light and come for me.I can't give it enough praise. I don't play single players games, but I LOVE playing this and comparing stories with my friends.The only bad thing I can say about this game is that the crafting system is a bit clunky, and a lot of things aren't explained as well as they could be. This is however quickly remedied with the wiki.9 out of 10.  "

								How I LOVE this game!It has the extensiveness of a great exploration and scavenging game, but it actually has a -goal-, including stories, quests and npc's but without revealing everything in the first 5 minutes of playing. In fact, after almost 18 hours of playing I get the feeling I'm only scratching the surface of finding out what's really going on - who I am and what I am supposed to be doing. The guidance you get is intuitive but directions are given sparingly. There are loads of stats kept, you get an idea of that when you die - everything you achieved is being summed up, giving you hints of events that have been set in motion.Gonna start another round right NOW			"

												This is a truly excellent game, and I'm glad to see it's getting some press, although not as much as it deserves.I knew nothing about this game going in. I got it as part of a Humble Bundle and figured it was worth a try. I think I played it for about 5 hours straight that first time. It's probably the greatest random find I've had.You have various perks and handicaps that you select to build your character, so you can choose to have excellent vision and mechanical skill but be a weak, feeble insomniac. After you create your character, you wake up in a hospital, with no idea what's going on and why the world has gone to hell around you. Immediately, you have to deal with a dogman who's charging down the hallway towards you. Your traits will affect how you can deal with it. Afterwards, you venture into the outside world. It is bleak and largely empty. You'll set off, with nothing but the hospital gown on your back. You can forage for food and water, but you should really make sure that the food's fresh. Do you know what berries are poisonous? Can you trust that water? Explore a little further and you'll see some ruined buildings. Scavenge in them and you might find some actual clothes to keep you warm, maybe some preserved foodstuffs or a cell phone. Be careful, though, and try not to make too much noise.You see someone on the horizon. You wonder whether they can explain what happened, but then you notice the rough spear that they're wielding. They charge at you, and you try to run. You can't get away fast enough, so you try to fight them off with a broken bottle you've picked up. You take the spear in the shoulder, and you stagger with the pain, but you get in an incredibly lucky thrust with the bottle and your opponent goes down. You shred some of your clothes and wrap the makeshift bandages around your wounds, but it's too late--infection has taken hold. In your last conscious moments you watch night fall, and you see a glow in the distance. It may be an illusion created by your feverish mind, but it almost looks like city lights...Each playthrough is memorable in this game, even the ones where you freeze to death the first night. If you survive in this strange new world, you can find people and locations that will help you find out background about this world. There is a story here, but you have to go searching for it. Even if you don't find all the backstory, you still have a tale of desperate survival that's incredibly compelling. I heartily recommend the game to anyone who's interested in survival games.			"

												I don't think this is a bad a game per se, I think it is a game that suffers from poor design choices that make it a lot less fun than it could be with just a little more thought and understanding of what makes a game fun. The basic premise is promising - post-apocalyptic survivor wakes up with nothing and is left to fend for themselves.Unfortunately, you are totally at the mercy of the RNG in this game, meaning that one bad result = game over. Given how almost all mechanics apart from crafting in the game are RNG-based, that means a lot of die rolls and a lot of potential for that one unlucky roll to come up. This is particularly evident in combat, where one lucky roll/critical hit means game over. You can mitigate this somewhat by trying to avoid combat. But you will not be entirely able to avoid combat and retreating is, you guessed it, RNG-based. Now of course, RNG-based games always feature bad luck - it's what the R stands for after all. What separates the wheat from the chaff (and where NEO Scavenger desperately falls short) is whether you can recover from ""bad luck"", i.e. to what extent you are at the mercy of factors outside of your control. Good games always give the player a sense of control over their own destiny – even if the RNG is brutal. When I play something like nethack and die, I normally think, ""had I done XYZ differently, I might have survived "". NEO Scavenger is far too unforgiving in this respect. A single hit can one-shot you. An unlucky stumble in combat can mean game over. However much you can hedge your bets, the nature of a RNG means that at some point you will be unlucky. When I die in NEO Scavenger I think, “had the RNG been kinder, I might have survived”. That's a bad sign.This is a real shame, because the combat in itself is interesting and tactical enough to be engaging initially. But a few games in, and combat no longer interests me. Why not just throw a die at the start and see if I get one-shotted and save me the hassle of trying to be tactical/retreat? This sums up my core problem with NEO Scavenger: it feels like the game is a single dice throw that simply determines how and when you will die; not whether you will die. And that's why it’s not fun.Other ways to die include dying of hypothermia (= the RNG didn’t spawn enough clothes in the first ~10 turns), infected wounds (=the RNG didn’t spawn a fire-proof canister for boiling water; or alcohol) etc. It’s essentially a glorified version of Snakes & Ladders or Ludo, games determined purely by luck of the dice. There are a number of other obvious flaws that would be forgivable if the game itself was fun: Flash is a terrible choice of platform, there are several bugs still in the game (e.g. the act of changing, not wearing, footwear gives you blisters; visual glitches) and the interface (particularly crafting) is clunky to say the least. But none of this would matter if the core game was actually fun.			"

												Great game if you like scavenging and inventory management because you'll be able to loot lots of stuff and then put that stuff in many different pockets. Do you want to keep that precious rock in your pants? You could keep it in your training hoodie. Or maybe in a shopping bag. Ok, shopping bag it is. But how do you want to hold that shopping bag? In your hand? Other hand? Maybe on your shoulder?Oh, and you'll die a lot so don't get attached to that shopping bag.			"

												NEO Scavenger is a deep and thoughtful turn-based survival/exploration game with an addictive, ruthless roguelike play style.  You will awaken, helpless and practically naked, in a hostile world.  You will scrounge through ruins for scraps you can cobble together into gear (with one of the best crafting systems I've seen anywhere).  You will encounter hostile inhabitants, maybe kill them, probably die anyway of festering wounds.  Then, you'll play again. "

								I purchased this game after playing the free demo and reading off a note on Darkwood's page from a developer stating its awesomeness. I was not let down. On the surface it looks a little confusing, but even in alpha state there's a lot of depth, a huge crafting list, very few bugs and a fun, immersive atmosphere. Your choices feel extremely important all the way through, and the realism of some of the crafting and health mechanics is wonderful.If you like survival games, are tired of zombies and enjoy being more tactical, this turn-based apocalyptic survival sim will become one of your favorites.

This game is hard but it being hard makes the game more fun. I would love to see this game become local multiplayer. As this game continues to evolve I will support it all the way.

												NEO Scavenger is something of an oddity among survival games, in that it is extremely good. It's an intriguing mashup of genres - take The Road crossed with The Mist with a little dash of Blade Runner and throw in a sprinkling of cryptozoology and Unsolved Mysteries and you've got NEO Scavenger in a nutshell. It works extremely well despite this hodgepodge of influences, and the world at no point feels contrived or artificial.In any case, I'm getting ahead of myself: at the beginning of the game, none of this concerns you. Waking up in a deserted cryo-facility three-quarters naked and knowing nothing but your name, your most immediate priority is survival. You have several routes to achieve this, but all of them involve the same basic points: eat, drink, sleep, stay warm, don't get sick and don't get wounded, and if you do get wounded, take care of yourself promptly. You accomplish this basic survival through two main methods. The first is scavenging, which involves travelling across the hex-based overworld map, choosing a tile to scavenge, and then choosing a specific location within that tile to scour, and at last choosing what abilities and items you'll use in the process. The yields are seldom all that great, but this is the game where you will feel exuberantly grateful for plastic shopping bags, worn flip flops, plastic bottles and old pots - where an intact shopping cart by comparison is an unimaginable score. Most of these things you use in crafting, in which you turn things you find into marginally more useful things.If it sounds easy, believe me when I say it's not. Comestibles are scarce, and there's only so much nutrition you can get out of 50-year-old bags of chips and snack cakes. The pressing threat of starvation can lower you to the point where you're wandering across the land eating every little thing that seems the least bit edible to buy a few more hours of life, a threatening prospect when your character lacks the botanical skill to identify poisonous foodstuffs.What to do when you run into a stray feral dog thus becomes a no-brainer. When pressed enough, you might even contemplate the unthinkable. Encounters with both animals, people and other things are both somewhat rare and appropriately tense. You most often can't judge a person's intentions by sight alone, and trying to talk things out can leave you extremely vulnerable if they turn out hostile. In some cases, if you stumble onto a face-to-face encounter with someone, you may not even try to talk, given that even that moment of hesitation would be enough for them to stick a meat cleaver in your skull.The combat in this game is a little bit of an odd duck. It's a bit similar to the original Wasteland, turn based, highly abstracted and without a tactical map - every enemy has a number representing their distance from you, and you have a number of options - advance or fall back, charge or run away. If your target is within range of your weapon, you can attack, and you can pull various special maneuvers or defensive moves depending on the circumstances. It can get a bit mechanical if you know what you're doing and are fairly well kitted, but when you're more down on your luck it can be fairly exciting in an 'oh god please let me live through this' sort of way, as playing it safe can become less justified if it means prolonging an encounter where every moment threatens death. Altogether though, the combat lacks dilemmas, in that there is almost always an objectively optimal action to take in each given situation. Not that it doesn't still have interesting situations - enemies with guns are an interesting example, as you have to weigh the possibility that they're bluffing with that of them actually having bullets and plan accordingly, and this is after all a game where you can win the fight but die slowly and painfully in your camp of an infected cut, huddled up in a sweaty sleeping bag and shivering with fever.Death, I should mention, comes easy and takes many forms, if that wasn't already clear. If a scavenger stumbled onto your camp while you sleep, there's little you can do. Even if you manage to wake in time, you might be better off running blindly rather than risking a fight in the dark. But you don't need to fight to die. Cholera, food poisoning, diarrhea, infection, hypothermia, exposure to chemicals, yet more exotic diseases - there's plenty of ways to die and none of them are pleasant. One of my bigger problems with the game plays into this - there's certain encounters where you're given choices that can kill you instantly. On one hand, this makes every choice feel grave. On the other, it's kind of a cheap shot, and you can suffer immense penalties from consequences you had no way of foreseeing.One of the things that I found immensely interesting as a possible consequence of the above is how the wasteland comes to warp your sense of morality. Whereas in other games you might be inclined to do good because you think you're a good person, here, the stress of constantly looming starvation, predation by other humans and the ease with which death comes can make you rather disinclined to stick your neck out for others. Even if you throw a good deed or two out now and then, putting yourself in harm's way for someone else's benefit is not something that the world encourages. If you find yourself in a state of pressing enough need, you might even find reason to screw an innocent over for your own benefit. Once you're put in that situation, you kind of start to sympathize with all the people trying to kill you for your stuff. At the very least, you can't really blame them any more, not when they're in the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation as you. In that way, the game is an excellent illustration of how irrelevant morality becomes when survival is at stake, and the horror that results from that.The game does have story, I should mention, and even a vague sort of plot. The writing is very good, the world building is great and the atmosphere is amazing. I should warn you that this game is incredibly bleak - it's not the sort of wacky post-apocalyptic amusement park of the more recent Fallout games, or even the relative optimism of the originals and FONV - it is a world of misery, starvation, murder, cannibalism, despair, negligence, scarcity and extinction. It isn't actively malicious, the depiction of suffering is not gratuitous - the world is callously indifferent, and this comes across in the writing marvelously. The world doesn't center around the protagonist, and for most purposes you're just another wasteland ragman whom nobody gives a hoot about. Some locations and encounters could have used a little more fleshing out - in one particular instance I imagined that my character could have the opportunity to finally get some answers about the state of things in the world, but to my disappointment I couldn't even ask about even the littlest point of interest. Incidentally, I found that the odd bits of old newspaper offering scattered details about the world's backstory far more interesting than the plot involving the protagonist's past.In that vein, one of my bigger problems was a relative lack of content. There's plenty for the price, but a few more locations, conversations, quests, NPCs, cryptids to encounter and supernatural horrors would have done wonders for a relatively small investment. In the course of my first successful playthrough, I've seen just about everything there is from one point of view. There's still time to start new playthroughs and see how things turn out for different choices and to explore bits of missed content, but overall there's still less than I'd have liked, in an ideal world.Ultimately though, NEO Scavenger was one of my favourite video game experiences of recent memory. It's engaging and atmospheric, and weaves gameplay and narrative seamlessly together. More games should try to be like NEO Scavenger.			"

												Best survival game ever.1st life: tried to make a feral dog my companion then died2nd life: couldn’t find any food other than berries and mushrooms then died.3rd life: ran into a fellow surviver. He wasn't so nice, then died.4th life: Mellon Heads are mean… Then died.5th life: Hiding behind cover didn’t work,then died.6th life: couldn’t find cloths or fire to keep warm and died.7th life: it didn’t stop raining so i got hypothermia and died8th life: i tied to beat the crap out of a bad mutha but kept missing due to loss of blood and died.9th life: some guy with a crow bar tried to attack me. After beating the crap out of him he ran so i tackled him and kicked him in the head till he died. I then cut him up into little tiny pieces, took his crowbar and moved on. 2 mellow heads found me, i beat them with the crow bar, cut them up, put them in a shopping cart i found, cooked them and ate them. Got in another fight, crushed his head, cut him up, and kept his meat around for later. Some guy with a .308 rifle heard me looting and followed my tracks. He shot me in the gut while i ran at him. I ducked behind some cover and bandaged up before moved up from cover to cover until i could stab him with a pointy stick. I killed the guy with the gun and survived the gunshot wound only to later die from it getting infected.Long story short, get a melee skill. You'll need it. You'll die a lot but eventually you'll get lucky, kill someone, and eat their corpse for survival. This game is really hardcore survival so prepare to cry a little bit. Just keep strong, never loose hope, have fun and just maybe you'll survive.Cons:-Theres lots of BAD random encounters that you want to try your luck on but DONT. If something even SEEMS like a bad idea. Thats because it is and you WILL DIE.-i wish is was a mobile app so i could play it all day.			"

												Let me just say this at the outset: even though I've put more than 50 hours into NEO Scavenger, I still haven't beaten the game. Not because it's dense (it is), not because it requires you to wrestle with brutal RNG (it does), and not because it can kill you whenever it darn well pleases even after hours of scavenging and gearing up (it can--and it will). I haven't beaten this game simply because I haven't felt the need.There is a story here: after picking your traits (ranging from combat and technical expertise to wilderness lore) and weaknesses (like nearsightedness and physical fragility) you wake up in a cryogenic facility in a world struck by a mysterious apocalypse. At first you have nothing but your name, a hospital gown, and a mysterious amulet. But with a lot of scavenging and a lot more luck, you can find and craft the gear necessary to fend off the raiders, disease-ridden cultists, and horrifying creatures that roam the wilds as you search for your identity and uncover the secrets of the world.The game is broken up into two sections: the hex-based overworld and text-based encounters. On the overworld, you move from hex to hex to get from Point A to Point B, stopping at urban hexes to scavenge for items and wilderness hexes to scavenge/hunt for food. When you enter the same hex as an NPC, you initiate an encounter in which you can choose to offer a ceasefire and go your separate ways, or engage in combat (the more likely event). Scavenging, combat, and most story events are presented in a choose-your-own-adventure-style: the situation is explained to you in detail and you can decide from a number of options (others being open or closed to you depending on your traits and equipment). Most choices you make are basically dice rolls. In combat, for example, dodging and attacking requires you to roll your luck against your opponent. Actions that are unlocked by specific traits or items (for example, luring an enemy into a trap with your trapping skill) are always successful. But because of the nature of the game, it doesn't always matter how careful and prepared you are: you can and will be one-shotted by powerful enemies. Even average enemies can kill you if they sneak up on you in your sleep, or get lucky with a good strike, or if you fall during combat and can't manage to get up. And if you die, that's it. You have to start from the beginning.So with that said, if you get this game and want to beat it, prepare to be frustrated. Prepare to lose a lot of important rolls. Prepare to get a game over based on trial and error in which a single choice leads to your death without any warning or indication beforehand. And if none of these things bother you, then prepare for a lot of reading and a lot of experimentation just to find out how to craft a decent starting weapon or light a fire.If, however, you're like me and don't care about finishing the game, then you will find a surprisingly satisfying survival simulation with brutal combat and a crafting system that will make you feel like a genius. It's perfectly possible to ignore the main quest, set up camp somewhere, and live day by day off the land and your luck. In fact, I'd suggest you do this for your first few playthroughs--even if you ultimately want to beat the game--because you'll learn what works and what doesn't.Here's the bottom line: NEO Scavenger is a dense game that doesn't have much in the way of flash. But it's got a lot of depth and surprising complexity. It's a game that relies a lot on luck; you can fight and kill a giant man-wolf-beast with a spear, then die the next day because of some bad water. But this can be mitigated to some extent by knowledge, which you will only gain from playing--and dying--a lot.			"

												This game is *almost* good, but like many roguelikes I've seen come around, the devs ultimately seemed more concerned with making the game hard than making the game fun. Most interactions with this game are like this:Player: Oh boy, I found a gun!NEO Scavenger: But you didn't find any clothes in the first two turns, so I'm going to have to kill you.or:Player: Oh boy, clothes *and* guns!NEO Scavenger: Guess what? Disease time! Have fun dying from something completely out of your control!I understand the need for realism, but there's a point where that has to bow to gameplay and NEO Scavenger just often kills the player out of nowhere and pisses away a few hours of progress. Oh yeah, this game is permadeath-only, which already alienates everyone who actually likes not losing hours of progress due to unfair BS. There should be challenges, yes, but the player should never be put in a unwinnable situation if they themselves weren't the ones who put themselves in it. I'd be a bit more forgiving if this game HAD A PROPER SAVE SYSTEM, but since it doesn't, I can't forgive it for destroying several playthroughs simply because I rolled a bad number.			"

								NEO Scavenger has that ""special game"" feeling.  By that I mean, a game where the possibilities seem limitless, and you're carried away into a new world on adventure.  The last game to do this for me was Crusader Kings 2.It is also an example of classic ""simple to learn, hard to master"" design. Most of the systems (combat, crafting, movement, line of sight etc.) are very straightforward, and easy to grasp.  But put them all together, and almost everything you do is a meaningful choice that will continue to affect you throughout the game.Also, my favourite contemporary novel is The Road, by Cormac Mccarthy, and this is as close as you are going to get to experiencing that chill when someone asks:  ""What are you eating?""

												NEO Scavenger is a kind of game where you need to keep an eye on everything, your wounds, your diseases, your equipment, hunger, thirst. It might give you a feeling the game is just another boring survival, but this is something that is worth checking out. It's half text based, but it has inventory managing and all that stuff a cool RPG game should have. In NEO Scavenger you don't level up or train, you are the human you always been, and no matter if you are unarmed, or have a full equipment including a shotgun, someone might come at night and butcher you in your sleep just because you forgot to set up that noise trap. It's a 100% survival game.			"

												Alright, look. I love the game. I do, really. It's awesome, it's fun, it's addictive, and honestly it could teach people a few things about surviving in such a situation that they can't depend on society anymore. Almost all the techniques in the game are solid survival techniques that could very well save your life in the real world. But after a series of deaths before I could even get enough supplies to make the journey east (which I understand is a roguelike feature, but bear with me.), I felt the need to write this review. One word, ladies and gentlemen: Yezinka. There's only one of them in the game world, and it wanders the map until it encounters your player. When it does, it hovers around in the hexes around you, and waits for you to inevitably have to sleep. You can't kill it by jumping it during the day because it can manage to sprint somewhere around 12 paces per move, while you can manage at best 4. It's also very difficult to hit with ranged weaponry (never got to try melee). Now here's the lemon in the wound: When you go to sleep, it immediately beelines for you, and steals your eyes. You can do NOTHING about it. You get around two turns, which is enough to stand up and start to look for it, and suddenly your eyes are gone. You can't do anything to recover them unless you've happened to encounter this late in the game and are near the city, and have been hoarding enough cash for cybersurgery. I say you need to be near the city because the condition ""No Eyes"" seems to flag you and every single enemy creature on the map drops what they're doing and attempts to kill you. I made a valiant effort and managed to kill two bandits and a dog before I was just overwhelmed with going into a new battle every turn (every other turn very VERY occasionally). Maybe if I were given a chance to pack up the things I had and try to luck my way to the city and sell everything I had for a single eye, I wouldn't have such a problem with this. Maybe if I were allowed to live for a bit and get a balancing attribute after a few turns that mitigated the fact that I can't see anymore, that'd be fine too. But as it is, if luck allows this broken monstrosity to seek you out without being killed by other wild animals or lucky NPCs, you are screwed, and there's no preparation at all that you can attempt to save yourself. I cannot in good conscience recommend any game that has a chance of giving the player such an enormous middle finger. But if you can get past that and you think it's not something that will bother you, then buy this game. The Yezinka is an enormous infected zit on the face of an otherwise outstanding game.			"

												This game is an excellent example of post-apocolyptic, open world Survival games. It combines elements of survival, combat strategy, crafting, perma-death, inventory management, rpg, and a real sense of danger just lurking around every hex -- mostly in that order, I'd say. It's also turn-based rogue-like with the map changing slightly each time you begin a new journey. Do not let the modest graphics fool you -- they will be the least of your concerns, I assure you. The combat system is actually rather realistic! Based on the character ablities and flaws you choose from the beginning, the combat system allows you to pick from quite a few options such as Charging your opponent, Headbutting, Tackling them to the ground, franticly retreating, sneaking, taking cover, sneaking behind cover, Offer to Talk, Melee combat, kick while down, shooting a ranged weapon -- too many to name, here. Choose wisely, or face the consequenses. I really enjoy the combat aspect of this game, but I imagine there are lots of players who would perhaps prefer stealth over Strength, and trade-based ablilities such as Botanist or Hacking over Athletisism. You can choose from flaws (Examples: bad metabolism, fatiques faster) as well, which allow you pick another ability or two to boost your luck. And it is almost always luck. I'm currently playing a character with the traits Strong, Melee, Athletic, Botany, and for my flaw -Metabolism.I have no idea who I am, but I appear to be a hulking, savage vegetarian. It's been 14 days, and I've killed at least 24 people -- I'm losing count, and can no longer remember any of their faces. I've been alerting many opportunists while  scavenging with a pickaxe and a lighter, but in turn, I've killed most all of those who couldn't escape. I'm hunting. Am I even human, anymore? At least I haven't resorted to cannibalism... yet.. and I'm sick with infection somehow. I found a couple of white pills, but without any knowledge of what they are, I fear the result. I've made a temporary home in a high-rise for at least 4 days now, only venturing outside to eat berries and mushrooms, and to gather water while I wait out whatever has me sick. Hopefully, I can make it through just one more night.....I have yet to finish the RPG portion of this game, but so far the stories and context are both quite fun to read.I played quite a bit before it was released, and it's also available in your browser! I only wish it was multiplayer compatable!!!			"

												One of those games where you (inevitably) die and then immediately ask yourself, 'Ok what can I do this next time around to avoid that?'  It's not about your 'progress' as much as it is about the single experience.Maybe this time I'll find a car, maybe I'll become a warlord, maybe I won't find shoes and will freeze to death after 5 turns....I actually was able to get some decent progress after a very short period of time, but then realized that neglecting hypothermia just isn't a viable strategy, so I died.  Despite the odds of survival, I'm looking forward to playing well into the evening.			"

												Hey smartass, if you think Fallout 4 is too easy, why not come and try your hand at some NEO Scavenger? After feral dogs jump up and rip your face off with their teeth for the fifth time, I bet you'll appreciate having a robot butler to care for you, you big cosseted ghost town lover!Yeah, you think you're hot♥♥♥♥♥♥because you dunked a few Fat Mans into a Super Mutant's face? You're nothing. You have never been in a post-apocalyptic wasteland until you're running around, frantically searching for clothes in abandoned buildings to keep from freezing to death. You haven't lived because you haven't frantically searched for a soup pan to boil water with, because you know all the water laying around is an invitation to kill you. You haven't really survived because you know that the world knows about fifteen different ways to snuff your life out, and is cold and indifferent about everyone one of those ways because that's how hardcore and brutal planet Earth is. You haven't known the true terror of conflict as another one of your kind stalks you with a hunting rifle for all the batteries and water bottles you have.You like being in constant danger? Good, because that's how the game masks its short length. From the very start, half of the game's goal is just living long enough to reach the Megacity of Detroit. It's a short walk, but it's a short walk fraught with danger that will kill people dead (especially if you decide you're too good for guns and try to go for a Melee-only character). It's an open world and there's all sorts of fun secrets to find. If you live long enough to get there, that is.But if you do, you'll suddenly realize just how cramped it all seems. And yet, it feels a bit unreasonable to ask for more, because the journey to finding the secret is a bunch of little experiences in and of itself.Also the random encounter roleplaying sequences do a great job illustrating how depressingly hostile the world is, but also rarely try to kill you outright. And I understand why they're there - even the hardest of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the wasteland will go down easy - but VERY SUDDENLY losing a character I've grown to love after playing for thirty hours carting♥♥♥♥♥♥back and forth to the DMC because I chose poorly really rubs me the wrong way. I'm not saying this is entirely a bad thing (I was choosing rather carelessly), but a little forewarning to sudden death is appreciated.Anyway! If you want to play Super Hardcore mode in NEO Scavenger, take your dumb little talisman off and see how hard the game gets. Then you can complain about it to me in the comment section, you lily-livered aluminium can collector.			"

												NEO Scavenger is not without its faults. The crafting system is tedious to sort through and use repeatedly, and the game doesn't always give you a fair shake- I remember one run specifically in which my character froze to death before he could find clothes, another where he was killed instantaneously by an assailant he never saw, and for the love of God, NEVER, EVER TAKE OFF THE AMULET YOU START WITH. Just... DON'T do it.That being said, I can recommend NEO Scavenger regardless because, even in spite of some debatably fair play, I'm still coming back to it, because I don't want it to beat me. That feeling is the hallmark of all true roguelikes.			"

Player has begun transformation into a Wendingo.NEO Scavenger is a turn based isometric roguelite survival sandbox role-playing game. In the at first bare feet of Philip Kindred, dazing panicked out of a cryogenic facility, the plotline tasks the player, in addition to surviving, with finding their forgotten past and any background on the Michigan wasteland. The menus are unintuitive and a bit of a mess to navigate effectively, but eventually it becomes more or less second nature. Remarkably detailed sprites represent everything in the game world, including your ""paper doll"" character avatar. There's really not much else to say about the graphics: it's not a super high tech 3D game. The screenshots should give an idea of how it will look like.On the sound front, the effects are equally simple: crunchy footsteps when moving on the map, cracking and popping firewood when you get a campfire going. The little slurp sound when consuming water is especially satisfying when you're heavily dehydrated, even if it may only buy you some time in the end. Music is ominous when it does trigger.You start the game by choosing your character's desired positive skills and negative traits - aside from Unstoppable and Elusive reputations and one surgery, you gain no more skills or traits throughout the game, so choose wisely what you'll stick with on your playthrough. Your character then wakes from a cryo pod, with an imposing and lethal dogman approaching his location. Your abilities and any found items can provide additional responses to encounters and combat, even some which may not be immediately apparent.Once having escaped from or dealt with the dogman, you're pressured into finding means of regulating your temperature, quenching your hunger and thirst, and any other bodily ailments. Scavenging is a big part of the game, but even bigger is smart scavenging. Moving on the map leaves trails, which get more intense if you decide to run, if you're suffering from certain ailments or if you're pure and simply bleeding. Searching for loot in promissing places is always a tradeoff between the chance of winning something, the risk of being stuck or hurt by collapsing structures, and of making a big enough racket that you get spotted.Combat is a difficult affair; it's less about striking with the biggest stick than it is about dancing around your enemy and exploiting any vulnerable states while covering your own flank, and exploiting the environment whenever possible. In general, fallen combat entities are at the greatest risk, as they can't do anything but crawl, roll dodge and get up. For a pleasant change from the norm, melee weapons have their own ranges: a crowbar will reach further than your own two fists. Firearms, of course, are even deadlier, but they use hard to find, expensive munition, and are cumbersome to store.Once combat is resolved, the surviving party needs to tend to their wounds. A fairly in-depth medical system presents itself with bruises and cuts, which may bleed, and demand different types of care. Pain accumulates from multiple wounds or a couple severe ones, like crippled limbs, and too much pain will interfere negatively with all of your activities, culminating in passing out (usually a death sentence in combat). Blood loss remains a concern both in and outside of combat, as penalties to your physical prowess and temperature regulation pile up if you run low, but using dirty rags to bandage wounds is generally a bad idea. In the longer term, immune system strength determines how easily you're able to fight back against things like cholera and infected wounds. The standard survival needs appear too, and they, too, negatively affect your actions if you go too hungry, thirsty, tired, carry too much load, and are too hot/cold.The game does seem to have an unintrusive overarching plotline, with the first player nudge appearing in the first night: the distant lights, promise and opportunities of the Detroit Mega City. Trudging through marshes and ruined suburbs and high rises, popping pills to keep the pain of fighting under control, setting noise makers when camping to stand a chance at catching trespassers before they do you in, going cannibalistic, random encounters with unfavourable actions and outcomes, are all just some of the things you'll face on your journey to survive in Michigan.While permadeath remains a staple of modern, indie survival games, it is a bit of a shame to lose the progress of a highly developed plotline to seemingly random deaths. I guess that's what makes this game that little bit more special than the droves of survival sandbox games coming out in recent years: a sense of purpose.It is a good game with great replayability. Definitely recommended with a small sale.			"

												If you're looking for an intense, unforgiving turn-based isometric strategy surivival game with perma-death I recommend you give this a try, although I do recommend picking it up when it's on sale, $15,- seems a bit of a steep price in my opinion.You start off the game by creating your character, selecting strenghts and weaknesses, after which the proverbial♥♥♥♥♥♥immediately hits the fan.You find yourself just awoken from cryo-sleep in a facility when you notice a strange-looking beast approaching you. You can deal with this using strenghts you've previously selected, after taking care of the wolf-like creature you start to wonder where you are, or who you are, you remember next to nothing, and as you set foot outside the facility you notice everything has changed, buildings are in poor condition, and there are no signs of life to be found.You must scavenge for survival, your first order of business is protecting yourself from the elements, finding clothes is your #1 priority. After getting yourself warmed up and safe from hypothermia, you should probably find a way of protecting yourself, and scavenging for weapons can be a tedious task, but the excitement you get from finding a mint-condition rifle or shotgun is more than worth it, I won't spoil any more of the game, but I will say this: it's extremely unforgiving and I myself have never survived for more than 25 days, unraveling quite a portion of the story, but not close to all of it.TL;DRNEO Scavenger is an unforgiving and exciting survival game, and I'd definitely recommend it if you're a fan of the genre, but you will die. A LOT.Happy scavenging ;)			"

												You can die of diarrhea11/10 would diarrhea againWell, I did not expect 232 people to find my review helpful. That probably means I need to improve it. I mean, diarrhea is only one of the many things in this game. NEO Scavenger is a pretty tough survival game. Unlike most other survival games, this one is more strategic, and isn't first/third/ResidentEvil camera. It's like a hex-turn-based board game. When you begin a new game in NEO Scavenger, you're greeted with a page. Basically, you can pick traits to help you in your adventure (Botany lets you see if a certain mushroom is safe to eat, Lockpicking lets you break into locked buildings, etc.). There's also Flaws. Things like Insomniac will make sleeping more difficulty, and Metabolism will require you to eat more. Of course, some Flaws have positives. Metabolism, for instance, slightly increases healing. It's possible to encounter friendly NPC's, or ones that want to punch you until you recieve a concussion and die. Of course, there's a way to protect yourself from hostile NPC's (or you just want to kill friendly NPC's). There's a variety of weapons. It could be a Butcher Knife, a Shotgun, a bunch of pebbles (for the daring), and a Crowbar. There's obviously more, but those are a few.Speaking of NPC's, there's strange critters roaming around the world of NEO Scavenger. Ever wanted to encounter a DogMan? Or this creepy humanoid-like thing that wants eyes? It's in this game, and the latter is pretty creepy.NEO Scavenger has random encounters. You can encounter things like: a broken-down car with a sleeping bed inside, a tank with people inside, a dog, or some other stuff (that can be a little screwed up). There's also some set locations in the game. The game is randomized, but there are a few areas that are always there. For example, a large city, and a strange house. There's a few more, but you can look for those (or just Google them).NEO Scavenger has a looting feature. You can scavenge abandoned houses, buildings, and more. You might find worthless junk (like the almighty pebbles), or you might find a backpack, or even a gun! There's also left/right shoes. The quest for shoes begins begins as soon as you begin. Walking barefoot is no fun, and neither is freezing! Finding shoes and warm clothing is important at the beginning. You game will be cut short if you don't find these items ASAP.Well, there's probably a bunch of other stuff I may have forgotten to mention, but if I remember, I will surely add it in.Do get this game. There's also a demo, so try that out, too.			"

												Could not stop playing Neo Scavenger for weeks after picking it up. Can't recommend it highly enough. Aside from having solid gameplay/balance, it also checks off some of these important boxes for a survival game:-frequent painful death (took me a dozen playthroughs to survive past a few days)-lots of clutter to collect, most of which has use based on your strategy-meaningful loadout variety (very different strategies/experience based on initial skill choices)-compelling story progression; you'll get a bit further each time before dying or making an irreversible poor choice-does a good job of setting an ominous dystopian post-apocalyptic wasteland cyperpunk toneIn terms of critique, I have to admit it does feel a bit sparse in terms of core content. Not only does the excellent foundation beg for an expansion of material (you could say that about any quality game), but certain items, mechanics, and gameplay elements clearly feel unfinished. The main story line is short as well, but feels much longer than it is because of how hard it is to progess through it without dying. Luckily there is a small but active modding community that has done some impressive things to expand the game in terms of content as well as mechanics. Anyway, Neo Scavenger isn’t perfect but as one of the few games I’ve ever purchased at full price, I’m comfortable saying its worth it.  "

								There are so many reasons to buy this. I'm not going to bang on too much. I will say that it's games like these (and Prison Architect, Kerbal Space Program, Papers Please etc) that restore my faith in game development. You don't need AAA budgets and staff to make a game that will grip people and make them want to play. You just need gameplay, care and attention and immersion. That's what this game brings to the table, in spades. You're alone in the wilderness. You'll die, a lot, but it'll feel like winning. In every game you'll see something new, try things a little differently, last a little longer sometimes, die within hours at other times. Nothing is ever bland. The graphics, though basic by standards today, detract from the experience not a jot. You know those games where you buy them in a sale and never play them, only to try on a rainy Sunday and realise you've been playing it all week? This is such a gem. £7 is a steal. There's nothing more you need to know. Buy it now.			"

												Very fun game. Honestly, there isn't really much I would recommend that the developers change, they were very thorough in making this game. Certainly nothing game-breaking (so far). Bugs are non-existant as far as I can tell.* Lot's of fun for the file size. It has a sense of brutality without relying on gore to get the message across. I recommend when you play this game that you do *not* look anything up first. The game is intuitive, and a great deal  of fun can be had by messing up. This is a great game for just getting on and having fun. If I had to think of a downside, it would be difficult but I would say there are two. The first would be that it is simple, and those that want fancy 3d graphics or a complex game should look to a different genre altogether. Second would be replayability. It has a good story, but there is something disappointing about each part of the story fleshed out: that's one fewer mystery for later. Of course, you can say that about any story-oriented game. Again, I would say that the keyword here is intuitive. Easy to pick up the mechanics, more difficult to use them effectively, but overally the difficulty is anywhere from mild to moderate. This isn't an 'easy' game per-se, but it certainly isn't hard. It is a game where risk and reward are both quite high in most encounters. A small slip up can cost you dearly, a well timed strike can earn you incredibly useful loot, so long as you have the space to carry it all. By far the most scarce resource in the game is space. You can't carry everything you find in the beginning, so deciding what is most valuable can be a very tough decision.All of the above serve to make it the ideal rogue-like game IMO.*EDIT: About the bugs, I should mention that there is a minor graphics bug where items will appear partly off-screen, and cannot be selected from boxes. This is uncommon, however, and easily fixed by switching between fullscreen and minimized (you can end in whatever screen you prefer). Probably not worth mentioning except that I had said ""Bugs are non-existant as far as I can tell.""EDIT 2: One other critisism: This game does not offer difficulty settings at this time. Initially, it seems difficult. After a few hours, it does seem slightly easy. Hopefully that will change in time, but with a sense of ease often comes recklessness (at least in my case), counteracting any potential for this game to become boring. It still remains a very fun game, and I look forward to updates.			"

												This is a good game let me tell you why as I recall the last moments of my last life:I had kept this character alive and well for a good 15ish days when suddenly in the middle of nowhere he began vomiting. I was worried but I had some Antacids on me so I swallowed them and kept going unknowing of what was happening. about a day later I saw I had a disease called 'blue rot' it was stage three. Having no clue of what this was and fearing for my characters life I looked it up on the wiki. Turns out naturally I only had a 30% change to survive it but If I found a certain NPC in a certain place (I wont tell you here) Then I could be cured and immunized. the problem was that in 72 hours there was a 70% chance I would be dead. Panicked by this I began to search the map frantically to the point where I was running through a forest at night when something approached me... I searched and searched but couldn't find anything due to the low light conditions I was stuck in. Then suddenly I was slashed in the stomach by what was revealed to be a dogman (think of a werewolf with no human form.) Startled I took my equipped crowbar and smacked it in the face stunning him. This didn't come without a cost however as the dogman swung again causing my leg to start bleeding profusely. I saw that the beast was stunned took my opportunity and ran while I could through sheer luck I lost it.  Wearily I continued my search for this illusive NPC well into my second sleepless night when I saw them. My dogman problem had tripled. Three dogmen 20m away. I didn't want to use it but I saw no other option. I took out the only item of value I had (a pistol with a full mag) from my bag and began to shoot knowing that running was out of the question due to their speed. 6/7 of the shots hit the pack but they were starting to close the distance. I took my bow from by back dropping the pistol and began to unload all five of my arrows into them. One of the dogmen had collapsed due to the pain I had inflicted but that still left two. There was now only 5m between me and them, my two sleepless night had left me on the verge of collapsing and even if I somehow survived this the blue rot would likely kill me. I wanted to die a hero at least. I dropped everything but my trusty crowbar. I braced for impact then swung with all my might at their leader. I was immediately slashed, battered and bruised but I had nearly got the leader at least. It was then that my sleepless nights  combined with effectively a marathon got the better of me. My battered body unable to continue collapsed of sleep deprivation and there unconscious I was torn to pieces and devoured by dogmen.This was only of of the epic moments of this life. From this game I have so many stories I could tell from wandering out of the cryo chamber for the first time to reveal the ruined world I was surrounded in to hunting a deer for an entire day with a single spear to turn its skin into a bag of which I hauled around the best cuts of meat I could get from it. This game is an experience and I recommend trying unless you don't like to read because to become really immersed then you need to read all the text they present to you.			"

												""...solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.""Such is life in the ""state of nature"" described in Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes. NEO Scavenger illustrates this state more accurately than most survival games. Here you are not completely alone with wildlife in a sandbox like in The Long Dark (actually my personal favourite); but you're also not stranded on an island with mutant cannibals like in The Forest. Instead, you find yourself competing for resources with other survivors, some of them in desperate conditions like you are at first, and others thriving in the desolation and lawlessness. Once you manage to grasp the basics of survival, after several ""nasty, brutish, short"" attempts resulting in horrible deaths, you will also thrive in this chaos.This is a game built upon brutal trial and error, and the errors will often cost you all the progress you've made, with all the cool loot you've scavenged. But each death makes you stronger, smarter, more adapted: you live, you die, you live again. And it's this very brutality that makes it so rewarding. Even when you are several days in, thriving in the chaos like a badass, you can still get seriously sick and die abruptly, no matter how much you try to avoid the inevitable. But you soldier on. I did, and somehow I made it to the ending, which, according to this Reddit post, is very hard to reach even after several tries. Here[dumptext.com] (MASSIVE SPOILERS) is my ending log, just in case anyone wants to check or compare.It also stands apart as an RPG as much as a survival game. Openly influenced by classic tabletop RPGs with creative problem solving through skills, it feels somewhat like playing the original Fallout for the first time once again (and that also means dealing with clunky UI and mechanics). The encounters with characters and factions often have branching storylines and different, sometimes irreversible outcomes. The writing is a bit too purple sometimes, but that's a genre thing, and considering that it's a one-man development team, it's still better than the writing in many AAA games.The UI can be quite irritating at first, so I can only advise that you pick up on the hotkeys ASAP and get used to them, it'll make life easier and counterbalance the addictivity of the scavenging mechanic, the real rough core of the game, which manages to keep you busy for hours and hours while you search for that one left boot in good condition or whatever. Realism isn't a defining factor exactly, but it's well-balanced so that it plays like a challenge, but also not complete scarcity. There is loot aplenty once you learn how to optimise the scavenging.I've put 109 hours into it according to Steam, but since it is a game that you can just leave in the background while you browse, I didn't spend every hour playing it in a frenzy. This is a game that walks the fine line between casual and hardcore in a fascinating way. It's a background game that can hook your attention for hours in between other things that might hook your attention. And I believe it has immense replay value beyond the seemingly endless cycle of scavenging and dying. I intend to try another character build at some point and see how the story will develop.The universe created by the dev has potential to develop into a franchise and evolve into bigger, more complex gameplay mechanics, and I don't mean necessarily in first-person, though that could be interesting. As a launching effort, NEO Scav is a brilliant little game, a real diamond in the rough of clunky UI and mechanics. Yet it could be much more than that.			"

Early Access Review
								After a particularly long 4-hour session (of multiple deaths) and many other playthroughs, I'm going to give a review of this game, and it's pretty harsh.Neo Scavenger is a game that has possiblity emanating from its mechanics. The writing is beautiful and manages to capture most any scenario that you're put into. Generally, it prides itself on being a survival, inventory-managing (think Deus Ex) roguelike that is incredibly unforgiving. Maybe a little too unforgiving.Generally, when I lose a roguelike or a game in general, it'd be nice to have some idea of what I was doing /wrong/. I don't have that sense while playing Neo Scavenger. Most every playthrough, I think I am playing at the top of my game, as best as possible. Enemies can randomly hit you in the head with their fist and instantly kill you, even if you're geared up to the max. Unless you get ridiculously lucky, the cold of the environment WILL kill you. Eating the wrong things WILL kill you. If you got unlucky and didn't find a town, the cold or wolves or zombies or bandits WILL kill you.It has stopped being fun to play. The UI is there. The mechanics are all there. The combat is thrilling. The art is there, the writing is there, and dammit I want this game to be so much more than it actually is. If you really want a hyper-realistic survival game, especially one as complicated as this one, then I can recommend it wholeheartedly. But if you're looking for an enjoyable, frantic gaming experience (as so many other survival games hope to achieve), Neo Scavenger unfortunately is far, far too luck-based to give any sense of accomplishment.In addition, over the 5 months I stopped playing, the ""skill ceiling"" or ""endgame"" has gotten no higher or larger as far as I can tell. A legendary melee weapon (the crowbar) is handed out basically for free, the warmest clothing can be found in nearly every building, and one corpse's food can sustain you forever, as can the numerous woods, rivers etc. If you don't start out with certain skills (botany comes to mind) then you'll be stuck relying on finding towns to survive. and you CAN'T get new skills aside from the implants that I've never seen.Overall, I think that with a bit of patching Neo Scavenger could be a great, renowned game. It's not that it needs polish; it needs content, and it needs a difficulty that scales directly with how skilled you are, and skill should /matter/ more than it does.			"

												A hardcore RPG that doesn't give you any real direction after it kicks you unceremoniously into its world to find the your story on your own, if you can survive long enough.  This game combines a hardcore sandbox survival game and a story of your character trying to find out who they are, and why they are here into one of the best gaming experiences I've encountered in a very long time.  Expect to die and restart several times while first playing NEO Scavenger, there is no reloading, only learning from your last playthrough's mistakes.			"

This happens once, you think oh well try again.  After the tenth time you finally get jack of the game and move on.If developers are going to create a game with Perma-death, the golden rule is the only person who can kill the character is the player and their choices. Not glitches and bugs.Sorry but I'm moving on.			"

												An absolute masterpeice. If you enjoy a post appocolyptic scavanging and survival game with semi-randomly genorated areas,  this is the game for you.A chilling and brutal game of survival . Remember: Do what it takes. Kill your fellow man if need be. Or be the nice guy, see how long you last. There is a plot, but it's entierly optional. I would say more about it, but I try and keep my reviews spoiler free.  This game is not for those who want a casual survival like minecraft. This is for those who want a survival game. One step wrong and you will find yourself with a broken leg and cut Realisticly difficult and challenging, this game keeps me coming back for more every time. Each time I get a bit stronger, a little bit wiser. The music convays the mood and atmosphere perfectly. an eeriee sense of despiration .Overall I give this gem a 9/10. Absolutely reccomended for any who want a more intense survival.			"

												NEO Scavenger has to be one of my all time favorite games. Even when it was back in early access. The first time I tried it out, I played for six hours straight. That's a long time for me. I was just so in love with it.There is a storyline to follow, but you don't have to watch the story unfold with each playthrough, because NEO Scavenger doesn't hold your hand...at all. Whether you want to find more information about your life and what has happened to the world is up to you. Personally, I just like to see how long I can survive in this messed up wasteland.This game does have a steep learning curve, but once you figure things out, you'll be set to survive for weeks. And while some say the graphics are too unbearable to live with, I don't mind them. I think they are part of the charm that sucked me into the game in the first place.To be sure that this game is for you, check out the demo before you spend your fifteen bucks. That's what it's there for, right?			"

								Okay, Take the classic Fallout games and Combine them with Dungeons and Dragons.Now you have NEO Scavenger.NEO Scavenger is an overall fantastic game.If you enjoyed the classic Fallout games or if you enjoy playing tabletop RPGs such as DnD this game may appeal to you.NOTE: This review is based solely on my opinion, Do not be angry with me if you do not agree with my opinions.Pros- Retro Graphics to deliver a sense of Nostalgia. (Some people love em others hate em.) - Advanced Character Creation (Very similar to Project Zomboid) Traits and Flaws system makes endless character potentialTraits can help you survive, Such as using a skill to make fires from scratch- Complete Open WorldMove Spaces much like a tabletop RPG- Entriguing Lore- Awesome Choice-Based Turn Combat- Choices in Encounters allow for Interesting Outcomes- Good Inventory System, As well as Injury.- Fresh Scavenging SystemUse Skills + Items to increase items found, Random events while scavenging (Roof Collapse)Cons- Cruel Learning Curve (Not Necessarialy bad, Personally I like it.)- Relatively Short Storyline (Still in Progress)- Somewhat Linear StartWould be nice to be able to create your own character and spawn at a random location- Esscentials are difficult to findOverall I would say this game is a solid 9/10,This game is worth buying if you areA: A fan of older Fallout gamesB: A fan of Tabletop RPGsC: BothD: A Bad Mutha			"

												One of the best roguelike experiences I've encountered, everything about this game is lovable and enjoyable, though in the beginning it can be very unforgiving. After you start you (or at least I did) will die many times from freezing without knowing what to do about it. Later you realise what you should do (or google it) and you get into the game a lot. There is quite a lot to explore, although the game could have a lot more content than it's having. However considering that it's not a big project and not many people are working on it, it's understandable.Still, the price is quite high for what you get. It has a lot of replayability to a certain point, but after you reach that point and explore it all, there is nothing more to do. Updates bring something new quite often, but it's not really enough to keep you playing. I would advise buying it on at least 70% sale, or in a bundle or something. 8/10 Would join blue frogs			"

												NEO Scavenger is an extremely difficult game at first. It doesn't hold your hand and you have to really think about the attirbutes to give to your character before the start of the game. Anything can kill you, even the smallest mistake. I accidentally clicked on the wrong type of berry and poisoned myself. There was nothing I could do as my character just got sicker and sicker. With all that said, it is an extremely rewarding game once you figure out a plan to survive. Each time you last a little longer in the game feels like a vitory and the story in the background is very interesting as well. I recommend reading the newspapers. Not all of the ariticles are important but it does make the world feel a little more alive and gives you clues on what could have happened to the character you play.			"

Or beaten to death by a badmutha with a sauce pan, or Stared down by a mellon head, Or killed by a Robor in an arena, or starve to death or freeze to death, or die of food poisoning, or bleed to death from blistered feet or am shot to death from some thing i didnt even see, or have all of my limbs crippled. The game just does not get old. I just dont get it. I should HATE this kind of game. BUT I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!Seriously. See past the Graphics.This game will hook you.Would die again 42/10 "

ATMOSPHERE:You (a random guy) wake up from a cryogenic sleep chamber, and have no recollection of anything. Not even who you are. Your goal is to make it to ""The Glow"" or Detroit Mega City as you may learn to call it both. Your goal is to make it here, exploring along the way, better equipping yourself with the task of finding out who you are. This is how I would imagine a post-apocalyptic Detroit happening.Constantly being bombarded by the ruthless Dogmen, and Bad Muthas, a Detroit street gang of brutal, thuggish cannibals who will NOT hesitate to attack you on sight. Also strangers and looters equipped with scoped hunting rifles, and Detroit Mega City Guards with rifles, shotguns, and full SWAT-type gear ready to exterminate you.You will be excited as ever to just find a pair of old plastic shopping bags and a shard of glass or a broken bottle to arm yourself with. Every little space in your inventory counts, so space management is almost as important to your survival as dealing with combat scenarios with a cool, calm, level head.GAMEPLAY:You will need to scavenge for loot while maintaining low visibility, otherwise if you think you're tough enough you can brazenly move into an abandoned building, scavenge it loudly and roughly, and hope someone or something doesn't hear or see you. The choices you make for every little situation in this game need to be approached with clear thinking, and taking into account repercussions of your actions is seriously encouraged for this experience.You will have random encounters within the story line and others along your travels.You may succomb to diseases from exposure to sick people, bad weather (hypothermia and pneumonia), food poisoning, and even BREATHING toxic fumes over time.You will wake up to people stealing your supplies and food or attempting to bash your skull in with a stone. Then be forced to make the decision to flee in complete terror, sneak up on the thief in the dark and take them by surprise, or just stand up from your sleep and attack them in a raging fury.If you can get past the clunky UI and lack of animation or intimate graphical control, this game is a dirty gem just waiting to be appreciated by the next ""arachaeologist"" who finds it. I never pictured myself enjoying a game that's 60% text-based, but I quickly fell in love with this game. Here, you can learn quickly from past mistakes and keep pushing forward. If you ever thought it was hard to survive in other ""survival"" games, this is FAR more unforgiving but also more rewarding to experience. True-to-life combat system that allows your simplest mistakes to be exploted by your enemy, possibly resulting in your death or serious injury.OVERALL RATING OUT OF 10:9.5/10Even if you hate text-based games, or games with hexes (I certainly did), you may find yourself immersed and deeply invested into this game. I highly recommend this for anyone who appreciates post-apocalyptic roleplaying games and/or heavy survival. Even at full retail price this is a worthwhile purchase. The game has a few flaws, but all are so minor and outweighed greatly by what good there is in the game that you quickly forget they exist or have trouble noticing them to begin with. Very reminiscent of the first game of the Fallout series, more so than the second, but this game has its own unique flavour.			"

												A game you could easily get addicted to. You'll get lucky and find 4000 worth of equipment. You'll get unlucky and get instantly killed by a cannibal with nothing but an empty water bottle. There is some background story, several skills and different ways of surviving, and even more ways to thrive. Fair word of warning, the game is flash-based, so it's easy for it to overload flash, which could corropt your save or just make the game lag after a long time of surviving.			"

												I was surviving for a week. Had a scoped rifle with some ammo hanging on my shoulder, a broad spear in my hand, I was in some army shoes, a nice pair of cargo pants, a hoodie with 3 layers of stuff underneath which was perfect for the weather. Had drinkable water for days, even more food, a full medkit, more stuff in my travois. Had an impressive kill-streak behind me.I was walking towards a town when I heard a rumble of a car's engine from somewhere in the town. It was there for a brief moment and then it faded. I was not far from ""Zom-Zom"".Feeling sleepy. I set up a camp with a fire in a small house, place some noise-traps around.Just killed 2 dogs on my way here. Poor creatures. But they didnt die in vain. I skinned them. Roasted their meat.Ate a chunk. Mmm... Wonder how it was before. I chuckled, ironically, because I can't remember a thing. But it doesn't matter now. Not here. The only things that matter here are skills and luck. And I had plenty. For now.Tomorrow I am going to scavenge the area around ""Zom-Zom"" and finally deсide whether I want to go in or not.It was late in the night. Had no watch to prove it to myself, but I had no need in that. I found a spot to lie down. Closed my eyes. I faded out quickly which is a rare thing to encounter being insomniac.Then someone slit my throat with a glass shiv while I was sleeping.10/10 Would die again.			"

												The main problem with NEO Scavenger is, sadly, the scavenging. While there's a decent bit of good writing to be found,  you'll probably never discover it unless you edit the game files or get incredibly lucky with your scavenging rewards, as health, weariness and thirst tick down with absurd speeds, areas get tapped out of resources in no-time(meaning that setting up a camp, which is necessary unless you get ridiculously lucky finding backpacks, etc. is useless) and all your items decay with ridiculous rapidity, too. You'll never really get to actually PLAY the game, is the thing, you'll be stuck doing nothing but grinding berries, cured meat and boiled water(which you can only get if you're lucky enough to find a saucepan), and then when you finally get enough of it to start moving somewhere... your backpack falls apart and you have to leave it all behind.But, okay, let's say you're good at management and overcome that hurdle. Then you may find one of the twenty or so locations you can interact with beyond scavenging(in a map of thousands of hexes, and only a few of them look any different from the surrounding generic town hexes)... and whatever you do roughly has a 50% chance of instakilling you or losing you all your carried stuff.So now, good luck, you can do all your grinding again! Hope you're lucky enough to find a saucepan early on this time around, too, or you may as well just restart.The combat also boasts a lot of choices to make, but it boils down to either: Have a ranged weapon, keep distance, shoot shoot shoot, or have melee weapon, close distance, beat beat beat. A few of the other options might occasionally be tempting if the game gave any indication of how likely they were to succeed or not(say, percentages or odds or something) rather than just vaguely suggesting a ""high"" or ""low"" chance(what's high? 50+%? 75+%? 95+%?).Long story short: Needs more obvious mechanics, needs less busywork to pad out playtime, needs to make consequences of choices more predictable/obvious OR it needs some sort of save function. It feels like someone played FTL and A Dark Room and wanted to copy them without understanding them.			"

This game involves being strategic and being able to manage your inventory to survive the wasteland detroit. You will die alot until you learn how to stay alive with the massive amount of game mechanics which have been handed to you. Blue bottle games have given us a fantastic RPG with strategy elements to make the game challenging. I would recommended to anyone who doesnt care about fantastic graphics but are here for a unique and brilliant experience which this game can provided to you. For the orignal price it is a steal and is perfect for anyone who wants just a game to play while bored.			"

												Download the free demo and use the neo scavenger wiki at wikia to look up information. If you enjoy the demo then you'll definitely enjoy the full game. If you enjoy scavenging and survival games then this is a great one for you. I would love to see more content and a clearer plot, but I've gotten an easy 80 hours out of learning how to survive and eventually thrive in the harsh world.This is much closer to a roguelike (not the rogue-lite garbage that is out now) in a survival setting than anything else I've played. You'll gradually learn what works and what doesn't work over the course of multiple play throughs and the rules are FAIR not just RNG. Strong + Melee + Broad spear = win until you learn the game. I also pick Hiding + Insomnia to round out my build, but that's just preference. Insomnia is a manageable negative trait.			"

								I went into this game hesitantly after doing some research on it and I haven't regretted it.  I'm a huge fan of survival/apocalypse type games and, although I'm not too keen on permadeaths and rogue-likes, in this game, it doesn't bother me as much.  NEO Scavenger is challenging and requires a lot of conservative thought if you hope to survive as every decision, every chioce and every action you make, matters.As of writing this, the game is still in Early Access but it is definitely playable.  My only gripe is that combat is extremely stressful (well, for me it is) and I can't help but feel that the AI cheats.  Even when I do my utmost best to hide and cover my tracks to try and avoid combat it's almost as if the enemies are psychic and always find me regardless.In my opinion it feels more like a simulation than a game, in that, sometimes I'm not having fun.  Situations will arise where I second and third-guess every move I make and wonder if the next turn will be my last.  Sometimes I'm under so much duress I need to take a break to let my adrenaline subside.  Not that this is a bad thing, mind you.  I suppose I just get too immersed. NEO Scavenger is a great game and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the hardcore survival genre.			"

												Lovin' this game. It's a true hardcore survival sim with great replayability, emergent gameplay and storytelling, and numerous subsystems to keep you on your toes. You'll die again and again from dogmen, hypothermia, cholera, and frog cultists, just to name a few, but everytime it's a learning experience. There's also several solid mods available that add a huge variety of new items, locations and new ways to bite the dust!			"

												I think there are only slightly more redeeming qualities to this game than there are bad ones, so this is only a ""recommend"" because ""meh"" wasn't really a choice.The game is very tedious. One thing that survival games tend to forget is that survival is a very tedious business, and they compress the timeframe a bit for emphasis of that particular aspect, but that just tends to make it even more tedious. This tends to detract from exploration or story-telling: you can't care about those things if the only priority you can possibly have is just making it to the next day. NEO Scavenger seems like it has a very rich and detailed story behind it and a setting that has the potential to be deeply immersive, but none of that matters if you simply die within the first week most of the time. It doesn't help that the game is somewhat obtuse about a lot of extremely important mechanics, such as the combat system, or health, or that drinking unfiltered water pretty much guarantees that you get cholera or are poisoned. Sure, that last one is pretty obvious in retrospect, but what that implies is that a decent portion of the time you have is going to be spent sterilizing all your water, and hoarding water, etc., which is just about as fun as it sounds. Item durability is also a terrible system. I don't think it was ever fun or strictly necessary in any game in which it was ever implemented. Yes, on some level, it intuitively makes sense, but it's overly simplistic in its implementation and just keeps forcing you to obsessively hunt for more junk.The skill system is interesting at face value, but your choices are limited from the start, and since they're fixed this drastically limits the options available to you (particularly at the start of the game) and you are always made painfully aware of it whenever you craft or interact with anything. It doesn't help that some are incredibly useless or situational.Permadeath is a good thing, I guess, but it also discourages the player from taking risks. There is always an element of risk in everything, but if you're dealing with an unknown and don't know how to assess the risk, you will eventually come to the conclusion that chancing it isn't worth it in most situations, which, again, runs counter to the player's natural drive for exploration. If you're gonna have permadeath in a game, that's great and all, but you gotta throw the player a bit more of a bone here.I think this game certainly has potential so I'm not gonna trash it utterly. But it is a very very lukewarm recommend at best, at least for now.			"

												This game is way more complex, detailed, and downright fun than I expected it to be. Some of the negative reviews I read complained about how the random nature of some of the game elements can screw you over, regardless of how well you've prepared-- while I have had this happen to me (more than once), I think that it's just a reality of this style of game, and careful planning can lessen the risk. I think my biggest complaint would be that there do still seem to be some kinks in the system: for instance, I just lost my most recent game because I got locked in the combat screen until I died, AFTER I had already killed the enemy. That said, this game is overall interesting and really well conceived; if you like tile-based adventure games, this one is definitely for you.			"

												As of the recommendation, I've played about 10 hours, plus 4 in the demo, although the two are acceptably different experiences. Came nowhere near to advancing the story out of all my playthroughs, reaching the ""glow,"" but the game's fun to gamble a try each time. Sometimes I'll find a good pair of boots. If I'm lucky, they'll be a match and a left and a right foot boot. Sometimes I've just died in the first day from getting eaten alive by a pack of feral dogs that tracked me down.The ultimate goal is staying alive while you're dragged along on the storyline. You may even get an obscure hint or two about the story at the beginning based on what skill you picked for the playthrough. But all along the way, remember; you'll never ""win"" a fight, you've just survived it.			"

												It feels like I've still just scratched the surface but it has been a pretty unique survival roguelike experience that introduces a mix of new mechanics that work together quite well.  + character attributes: it's not like a typical roguelike where you have you basic generic stats and grind xp. You pick out traits to help define your character (melee, ranged, mechanic, athletic, strong etc) and can pick weaknesses as well which let you get more points on good traits as a tradeoff and allow you to try to balance unique builds. These attributes influence completely what sort of actions you'll have available to you, how you handle conflicts, crafting, trying to find shelter, heat, food and so on. They define and influence your decisions way beyond the normal str,int,con type character building.+ crafting : there is quite a complex crafting system in place that is entirely based on resources available and the traits you picked. If you find just the right ingredients in the early game to make a decent weapon or clothes you'll have a much easier time, otherwise you'll want to avoid conflicts and scavange more. +(mostly) combat : deciding whether to fight, and how to fight is very important here.. not because you fight all the time but because the stakes are high and a few bad streaks could see you left bleeding in a field far from your shelter. I like this change to slightly more realistic combat. There's no visible health bar, it's all about waiting till you get a chance to strike, wounding your opponent, and then kicking while they are down. Not particularly heroic but if you make a mistake that leaves you vulnerable and they get a hit in, they'll do the same to you. It comes down primarily to trying to get in range for your weapon, stay out of range from theirs, and defend yourself until you have an opportunity. For example, if you have a melee weapon you can try to rush them but you risk falling on your butt at which point you'd be an open target, or you can advance normally but they'll be able to back away. - combat balance: My con with this is that your weapons make all the difference and with the random nature and limited weapon types, you can either be useless in combat or feel like there was no risk. In my first play through I believe I hit a guy with a pocket knife like 20 times until he ran away after punching me and then I bled to death. In my second playthrough I tied a knife to a stick to make a spear, with a range of 3 is the longest melee weapon. And then proceeded to kill everyone that didn't have a gun without a scratch because they couldn't get near me without getting stabbed. And those with guns I could sneak on fairly easy and then once I hit them they were too wounded to fight back. It went from combat being impossible to being 'meh'.			"

Even UnReal, which is now my second favorited, does not trump this game. Beyond its amazing survival elements this games story is very mysterious and intriguing, something that most survival games have no part of. Look at The Long Dark or The Woods, while they are slated to have stories there is none at this current moment. NEO Scavenger delivers everything I could have ever wantd out of a game and I would say the only thing that would make it better is a reboot in a 3D engine. This game is amazing and I could even see it being made into a very sucesful move.			"

												I have been thinking for a while whether this game should get a thumbs up or a thumbs down from me. In the end, I'm going with a reluctant thumbs up, though I'd recommend waiting for a sale.NEO Scavenger is a post-apocalyptic roguelike survivalist game that is also often dubbed a hobo simulator. For good reason: you start the game waking up in a facility with nothing but a hospital gown, a wrist strap and a strange talisman. Once you start playing and get to look at your inventory screen, you will notice that you do not actually have any inventory space. This game does not give you an abstract bag to store your items in. You can carry whatever you carry around in your hand - if you want more, you will need to scavenge a cardboard box or a plastic shopping bag to carry your stuff in (the former you have to carry in your hand, the latter can be used as a backpack). If you are good enough at scavenging, you may eventually be able to find something better, such as a children's backpack - a legit travelling backpack is a luxury you'll have to search a lot for, and either way, even these backpacks will be extremely limiting, so you do have to carefully pick and choose what to carry with you. Eventually, you can get a much bigger inventory by finding an abandoned shopping cart or other similar vehicle you can lug your items around in, but that makes it harder to run away if you get into trouble (unless you ditch the cart and just run for your life).Anyway, there are strict inventory constraints and you also have to deal with rapid wear and tear on your equipment - some shoddy stuff (hand-crafted weapons, sandals) might fall apart after just a short period of use. You also have to deal with finding food and water - and beyond that, you have to make sure the food is edible, the water is not contaminated, and beyond that, to find a same place to sleep, to find a pair of shoes (that don't give you blisters when you walk in them), and to survive all the encounters out there. All this makes for a very gritty and tough survivalist game and this is actually the strong point of NEO Scavenger. The 'feel' is really good and the challenges of this game are rather unique - not many games have you struggle for basic necessities like this one. Death is permanent - no reloads.There are three major weak points, though, which you should be aware of. One of them would not be enough to spoil the game, but the three of them together do, or at least get close to doing so... it is up to you to decide if they are big enough red flags for you.First: NEO Scavenger's survivalism is based around an extensive crafting system. You need to craft in order to ensure your water is not infected (drinking all the water you find makes things much harder, though it's actually possible to survive with the constant diarrhea and other illnesses you get from doing so if you are lucky enough), to light fires for warmth and cooking, to craft primitive weapons and more. The crafting system is quite cumbersome, though, which is a major problem when it is so necessary to use it. It is hard to get into at first, hard to understand all the different options you have, and the interface is a bit unwieldy in general.Second: The developers originally started programming this game in Flash, which (according to their own admission, even) turned out to be a pretty bad idea, but they never rebuilt it in a more suitable environment. This means that the game has a few quirks and a few very nasty bugs. Saves seem to have a tendency to get corrupted every now and then, and while there is an autosave option, that introduces other problems in turn (I had my minimap data get wiped while autosave was on).[Note: apparently some autosave bugs were just recently fixed a few days after writing this review. So there's that.]Third: despite being a roguelike, this game lacks something most roguelikes have, which is extensive replayability. Unlike in most RLs, there is no leveling or character development - your guy doesn't get any stronger or weaker throughout the game (aside from illnesses/injuries and other temporary buffs/debuffs), so the progression in the game stems solely from you exploring newer areas and finding stronger enemies. There is also only one start (no races/classes, no different starting scenarios) so if you've completed the game once, you've seen it all... aside from any optional areas you might have missed the first time around. Further, quite a few of the challenges in the game don't even stem from poor scavenging strategy or combat - sometimes you just get a brief ""choose your own adventure"" segment where you have to click on various options and hope that you aren't instakilled. Common sense and caution can generally get you through these encounters, but still, this doesn't help replayability. Further, though it takes a while to learn how to survive early on, the game is not actually that hard later on once you're set and since it is easy to just run away from the majority of foes (plus there's little reason to fight them when you can't get XP or essential loot from them - you can get everything you need from just scavenging), you just need to learn what options to click (or not to click) in the choose-your-own-adventure segments and you know how to win.Well, NEO Scavenger is a good hobo simulator, but not a very good roguelike. So I guess that whether you should buy the game depends on whether you're looking for the former or the latter. It's a fun little game with an interesting story (and you'll have some interesting stories of your own to tell on the forum after you play), but it just isn't something that will keep you occupied for hundreds of hours, replaying it again and again. Its hobo simulator aspect is good enough for me to barely justify a recommendation, however.			"

												If Neo Scavenger were never updated again, I’d still revisit every once in a while. Where else can I feel the guilt of stripping the trousers from a dead man and then the delight of finding a cigarette lighter and a few twigs in the pockets? It’s a world of many mucky wonders.			"

												I think my most memorable moment in this game came from late in the game (right next to the end I later found out) where my character had an oppourtunity for a good life in the post apocalypse, and I selected the option that would put me on that path. Only to have him suffer the worst possible death, one without my control. And while this could be considered cheap, in the moment of personal heartbreak that followed was the most I have been affected by a game in my memory. Sure the game has its faults here and there, but any game that can do that to me deserves to be played.			"

								I don't even know where to start trying to convince you that Neo Scavenger is the best game I've played since FTL. Is it that I've played for 24 hours in about 3 days? Is it that it's basically a turn based Fallout 3 except that you count your bullets in twos not two hundreds - (if you're even lucky enough to find a gun that is...)? Could it be that if you survive (which you probably wont) you will be introduced to a completely awesome setting change that has blown my mind?The answer is yes, yes, and yes. Try the demo. Buy the game. This♥♥♥♥♥♥is ♥♥♥♥ing solid 10/10 video game pleasure.			"

												I recommend this game with some reservations. I commend the developer's brutal commitment to total realism that make this game an extremely tough experience. the intriguing game world, and attention to detail. The game truly does make you thankful for objects as trivial as a shirt or even a worn out shoe. That being said, the game is hard enough that sometimes it feels as if it is unfair. On many occasions I would sit down for a session and be having fun until a single dog or man with a gun kills me and ruins hours of progress. The permadeath system creates a feeling that you've wasted your time whenever you die from something you can't avoid. I feel as if a progression system, saved games, or a checkpoint, perhaps at the end of each day, could go a long way to combat these issues. If you are looking for a turely brutal survival experience with immense attention to detail, this may be the game for you, provided you are able to deal with some of my previously mentioned grievances. The game has a few major flaws but has enough redeeming qualities for me to give it a recommendation.			"

												Ever play a game that made you want to throw your computer out the window, and then 5 minutes later want to play another round?...that's NEO Scavenger.If you frustrate too easily, if you don't like random difficulty spikes, if you can't have fun when the game isn't ""fair"" all the time, if you don't like to lose... this might not be the game for you.You'll have the deck stacked against you right from the start most of the time. Just making it a day or two might seem impossible. Then you'll have that run of luck and manage to gather a small fortune, and even come to think of yourself as neigh invincible, only to succumb to some kind of horrible infection because you forgot to wear an air filter and accidentally inhaled some spores.This game is not fair. It wasn't meant to be fair. That's part of the beauty.There's a small but awesome modding community for this game, as well... and they've managed to add quite a bit of additional content to the game. Definitely worth checking out after you've played the base game for a while and want an expanded experience.			"

												I'm gonna keep this shortThis game is pretty dope, it's a really atmospheric and simple game, yet complex. Whenever you make a mistake you either get killed and learn what you did was wrong, or you spam click, survive, and ignore it. One of my only issues with the game is that the A.I. Is a bit unrealistic, for example, I found an unconscious man and waited for him to wake up, wondering if I'd be able to help him, but the second he woke up he charged me and I had to kill him. In an actual situation like this a normal person would try talking first or possibly surrendering. Another issue is when while your sleeping in a shelter with a noise trap enemies practically spawn standing on your chest with a shotgun in your mouth. That about does it with my complaints, but all in all it's a very fun and addicting game, I'm having a hard time putting it down.			"

												NEO Scavenger is a rather simple, yet in-depth post-apocalyptic strategy RPG game(woah lots of adjectives). You start off in a Cryo Facility and find yourself roaming a world ravaged by an unknown apocalpyse. The game is turn-based so you have enough time to carefully plan your next move, or end up perishing. The game offers lots of choices as to how you're going to proceed. Fight or Flight? Eat or not? Explore or abandon? The RPG elements are great and there is a lot of detail in the overall health system(pain, blood, temperature...), lots of possible customization, all of it affecting your player(having a rough air filter just might save you from an allergic reaction, or the inhalation of toxic spores). The game takes time to master and lots of luck as well, even after 10 hours I still find new things around the game(randomly generated map, but still unable to scavenge all of it), and still find the dumbest ways to die.10/10, slipped and fell, died whilst unconscious. (jk) PROTIP: Start with Medic and Botanist Perks.>I'd give it a 10/10>Pros: Leaves you to imagine most of it, great customization, detailed health and inventory system, replayability, hard and challenging, lots of points of interest, many more great things!>Cons: Sometimes you won't be able to really understand something until it kills you.

												I will try to keep it brief and describe my games in a very brief manner. Each number, represents a different game from the start.1. I came out of the building, felt disoriented and not sure what to do. Something nasty came to me and attacked. I tried to defend myself but I bled out after the series of injuries.2. This time I had time to wander some more, I found some mushrooms, berries, sharpened a big stick and waited for trouble... but I froze to death.3. Shortly after I came out, the feral dog sneaked on me and attacked. I was fighing furiously with my punches, until I damaged his brain with concussions. I would have never thought that reading about the combat could be so exciting: bruises, cuts, bites, concussions, bleedings... all those details were amazing. My brain did the rest, imaging myself fighting for life with this dog. When he dropped dead, I patched up my wounds, took some painkillers and gutted him, took 2 small pieces of raw meat into my small medkit and moved along to find some clothes before I freeze to death again. I went to the city and scavenged it. I found plenty of goody goodies: crowbar with strap, binoculars with strap too!, cardboard box, cargo pants (with pockets!=more slots, yea!), T-shirt and some straps. Now, I am afraid to go out, because I don't want to loose all my treasure :( . T-shirt, cargo pants, hospistal gown on top of it all, holding crowbar in one hand and cardboard box with my treasure in the other one... time to move on. I go to the next building, I must be lucky, plenty of other  goods but I have no space to take it... First dillemma: break bottle and use it to make small campfire or leave it as a container for water later on? To hell with it... I might not live so long and I need warmth. OMFG! I had not enough points and had to end the turn, now the sun is gone... After a while it came out again, now I sit in front of a campfire, eating a cooked dog meat and think what to do next. The fire is not big enough, I move to the forest for more wood, some stranger attacks me, I try to talk to with him, he's confused but still charges at me... Time to cave his head in with the brand new crowbar. WTF!? He is some kind of a boxer! He keeps punching me and avoiding my crowbar! I cough up with blood and have got internal bleeding! After a short fight, I pass out and this guy is checking for loot on me... I wake up, beaten drastically, he retreated. MOTHERF**ER stole my cardboard box with goodies!!! I was on my way back to the camp when I have found an old car and a sleeping bag in it. Resting in the filhty but warm sleeping bag in abandoned IT office building, curing my heavy injuries, a mysterious horror creature woke me up. I had to run away, leaving my sleeping bag behind... After a while of running away, I had to go back, the cold rain has started to rain and it was a night... I know that my end is near but I keep sneaking in the dark trying to get into my warm sleeping bag... I just hope it is not sleeping in it... LMAO I threatened it with my crowbar and it ran away!!! I can't believe it!@ Sleeping, resting and healing in my precious filthy sleeping bag. After many hours, something is creeping on me once again. It's dark and we do not see each other yet, I will run away, I need some water anyways. It was a feral dog, I took some bites and I am bleeding but the dog is dead. I rest some more, take a bottle and go to look for some water, I find a small lake, drink a lot and take some with me, in a small plastic bottle.NO SAVE DATA FOUND... great... just f*cking great... Game is made in flash, so when I was cleaning my pc with ccleaner, it must have deleted some macromedia old cookies and my save file... how f*ucking hard can it be, to make seperate none-flash savegame file!?4. Tracked and killed by Merga Wraith5. - Chopped a poor fellow to death with a meat cleaver... He refused to fall back. No regrets.- WTF!? I met three bandits cooking something (I was hungry), there was also a terrified woman with a little baby in her arms. I had not a lot of options, but I think I have picked the wrong one! They have cracked her skull with a crowbar!!! "" What happens next is not worth mentioning, apart from feed. You can't remember how long it's been since you have eaten that well."" WTF HAVE I DONE!?- apart from all that, I am doing incredibly well. Got two shoes, nice clothes, meat cleaver to defend myself, made a campfire and cleaned some dirt rags for future needs. The only thing that bothers me is the guy with a rifle wandering around me somewhere.- ok he tried to kill me when I went to sleep! He shot at me! I took cover and now he offers to talk! Oh, no buddy I am coming to get your with my meat cleaver now! He keeps shooting and missing because I use covers, soon brand new rifle with a scope will be mine! Lmao, I chopped him to death! xD			"

								""Do not get caught with your pants down. Pants? You start the game with no pants at all!""Oh dear...The game offers a good demo - http://bluebottlegames.com/main/node/21 so there's no cost to trying it out. The UI is bad, but the lure of trying again, and trying to learn and make progress is there, and it is strong. You will almost certainly not be impressed the first time you play it, but give it a second or third chance. It plays differently and presents a very interesting and realistic, though grim and unfair world to explore.I have enjoyed a lot of games that focus on sneaking and hiding but few made simple hiding as desperate or exciting as NEO Scavenger. You try desperatly to cover your tracks and hide before you end your turn. But that slows your progress... Hunger, thirst and the bitter cold force you to take risks. Plus you need stuff to survive, but unfortunatly for you, so do other drifters and vagabonds.Combat is unbelivably intense. UI clunkiness robs us of the full experience at least the first few times, then it becomes less about the menus and more about your, so far well going game, about to be ruined by a stranger. Even a weaker oponent can cause harm, wounds, and can alert other threats and lead them to you. There is no time pressure of any kind during combat, yet it allways feels dangerous or even desperate. You have to have some degree of faith that your choices will play out in your favor. They usually lead to your death until you learn more about the game. It's very much about survival, staying safe, luring other threats into traps or each other... and scavenging. Remains, food, parts. You're allways scavenging and the overall aim is to set yourself up for survival.First impressions count for a lot, and this game is Early Access which hurts it somewhat, esp. the lack of variety in a game where you die and start over so much. NEO Scavenger attempts to offer a niche gameplay experience, a bit like FTL or Papers, Please, where gameplay and style are different enough to make it something unique. Unfortunatly, it's current Early Access status makes it clumsier and less satisfying to play, and promises such as ""This isn't even my final form!"" usually end up dissapointing. However, this could be a very good game and trying the demo wont cost you a thing.Recommended for fans of turn based combat, realism, crafting, survival, adventures, Fallout, and games where graphics take a back seat to gameplay, strategy and athmosphere.

												I love this game, if you want something aimed at being realistic and difficult to stay alive in, this is probably for you... I haven't gotten to the DMC yet, my deaths have been mostly because of infections, or unclean water, if you can boil water, you should. Every battle could kill you, I neerly died today, found a Dogman and Stranger who had a gun and crowbar. they fought a bit, then the dogman came to greet me, I didn't have enough Ammunition to kill it, so I shot while running away, It stumbled and fell a few times, and I got away. Then went after the stranger, got shot and I had emptied my ammo on the dogman, so we fought melee untill I realised my next move would knock me out, and be my death, so I ran at range 10, and  got away, found shelter, and promptly slept, didn't get attacked in the night, and didn't find either the dogman or stranger again. Later got sick from unclean water and died, because I decided to try and boil some water, so it wouldn't happen again.			"

												So I really, really wanted to like this game, because the amount of potential in this game is absolutely tremendous. The interplay between different systems and the really neat environment and design decisions should have made a great game.It didn't. There's not enough content for this game to shine, and because there's so little content the problems it has are made starkly apparent. Permadeath is not an inherently good or bad decision, but what it does in a game like NEO Scavenger is force the player through the same few bits of content over and over again. That content has an optimized solution, which means the first 5-10 minutes of every play-through are doing the exact same thing, every time, with no reason or reward from deviating from it. And then you end up at one of the pieces of game content that you _did_ play before, with functionally identical choices. And then you die, fairly or unfairly (and this game _loves_ unfair deaths; there are a number of places where you can die in a narrative scene because you didn't tag a skill!), and you get to do it again.A simulation game has to hide its brain to be deeply rewarding. This doesn't, and the narrative and the neat bits do not carry it through. Buy it for a couple bucks and play it once or twice, but at list price it is emphatically not worth your money because it will not respect your time.			"

Posted: November 24, 2016
												neo scavenger is a game that comes out of the blue in the steam indie market. Some games are good, because you remember the time you met that NPC that you felt engaged, and connected too, and of how believable they were, and because of the epic landscape that makes you feel like you were living an alternate reality then a program installed onto your computer. And then there are some that have unecesary and game breaking mechanics that is more of a nusciance and a story that fells like it was put together with no thought and imagination making the experience into an endurance test. so where does Neo scavenger come in, it is a role playing, post apocalyptic survival game with a top down perspective on a map that closly resembles to a board game. The game in my opinion is one of the most emmersive games i have played for awhile and i have considerably played enough to know the positives and negatives and heres why:positivesif you watched the trailer of the game, you would have noticed that it has still images and is text based, thats because it is. It is a turn based game simmilar to the rpg genre but unlike most turn based rpgs, your actions are in sync with the npcs. whenever you talk to someone in a confrontation you could be at risk at being shot with a range weapon because, when were about to talk, that person blasted your head off because it was their intention. you can sneak up to npcs and kill them but the problem is that you dont know who your sneaking up to. you could end up killing a harmless scavenger then a raider makeing confrontations even harder. the game does a great job at making confrontations meaningful and difficult to handle without felling cheap and half fasted.you woundering what the story is about like what most games have, well NEO scavenger has a story which is unique and enagaging. The world has many factions that has changed the world in their own ways, but it more happens in the background and what you do have little to no affect on them. Because you cant be a force of nature saviour or villian, it is because you are human. You do not have any special superhuman skills that games secretly slip into your character and instead make random events and point of locations intense. you instead have to think through things because if you don't your going to die, alot. Did i mention that when you die, you die for good and that you have to restart the game. This is the level of detail simmilar to darksouls, only more soulcrushing as the world is belevable and you are quickly reminded your human because you tried to play hero against a healthy dogman.The survival mechanic has been thrown around recently in alot of indie games because game developers impiment this, but end up copy pasting and being bland because they forgot what makes survival fun. The developers have managed to make the survival genre good in their game as it makes you feel like your recovering from wounds and actually hunting and cooking food. Whenever you attempt to patch yourself up or feed yourself you have to do it manually and organically, you have to think whats right and wrong theres no indicator except for the multiple bars on the right that can be summed up as your health bar. Even fighting feels visceral and brutal. The game uses text to explain what part of the body you hit on an npc and that npc can be   also knocked out through pain (the same can happen to you).negativesThe game has its annoying nitpics that i have witnessed throughout the game like, why do i have an imaginary pocket for my cash and, why can i reload my gun and patch myself up in ONE TURN like im the flash (whenever you acsess your inventory the npc can now have a prolonged turn because you were busy BUT ONLY THIS as you can manage your inventory for as long as you want and the npc can't do anything about it). There are the problems with the limitations of the flash engine as sometimes your save file could be deleted (this only happened to me twice).skills can be a mixed bag. You can be a tough, melee botanist but end up dying because you didnt have the athletic attribute that can help you outrun the dogman or a feble, frail survivor thats good at hacking, electronics, mechanics with eagle eye and tracking but died to a good punch to the face from a raider skilled in melee. I managed to stop this with a mod called big bad cheater which give you a defect called mega human that gives you all the traits and still make you feel human without turning you into a god. Go to the blue bottle site and search it up, instaling is dificult so go to youtube to get help.conclusionI remeber having fond moments with i fight i had with a crazed, infected man with a loaded bow, got shot, pulled the arrows out which caused him to beg for mercy after what he witnessed, and killing him with multiple hatchet blows because he would have killed someone or infected them with a disease simmilar to the plague (the hatchet is not in the game it is a mod called Mighty Mini Mod of Doom which adds more equipment and an extended story line. It also works with Big bad cheater, i highly reccomend it). Neo scavenger is a game that may not be for everyone so in summary do you want:*be emmersed in a believable world*feel more of a human than a walking tank*get into fights with bloody detail, simmilar to manhunt*organicly complete tasks and naturally survive with a permadeath system*actually care about your actionsif this interests you, buy it you will never experience anything like this. The developers have done a great job at making a game true to their genre and i hope that they make games in the future with this much thought and imagination put into them like this simply made but absorbing game.

								I dont have any gripes about this game other than the fact it swallowed my whole afternoon. The games great, has a good story line and keeps you thinking and on your toes. I would like the story artwork to be a little better (still pictures when you read passages) but i feel like thats the theme they are going for. Hardly a complaint.For $10 i say clear your afternoon, sit around with a bowl of spaghetti and a mate and make a game of it.Really enjoying it.			"

												Made it ALL the way to day 6 before making the fatal error of flanking a ""sleeping dogman"". It was then I realized how tense I became throughout that whole altercation (mainly because I knew I ♥♥♥♥ed up).11/10 Would forget to breathe during Dogman fight again.Seriously though, an amazing game. My only request (if I may) is, because of the low survival rate, perhaps randomizing the beginning a lot more; allow more stat customization.			"

												This is an excellent game!!! dont give too much about the graphics (they will have their charme later anyway) and you will find a jewel among post apocalyptic-steampunk-survival games. You start out in a laboratory and dont know who or what you are and must find it out. In a tile round based system you will have to find clothes, food, water and weapons to survive in the wilderness. This is actually the only game i like which is turn based and i hope the story will be updated as there could be more story driven content so far. The Game however is great (immersive), logical (crafting recipes) and makes you wanna explore the whole world within. 9,8/10  BRAVO			"

												I wanted to like it.  Biggest problem is the interface.  If only the interface was half  as good as Sword of the Stars: The Pit.  Because there is a great crafting and exploration and combat game hidden behind the Choose-yer-own-adventure style interface.  And it's roguelike permadeath with simplistic graphics.  I nearly deleted it once before, and then I found myself wanting to play it again because I seem to have a masochistic streak.  But after losing two 4-5 hour games, for basically no good reason, it's too brutal to play for me.  Maybe if it had a better interface.  I found the setting intriguing, I'll read up on their wiki... but it's not a game for me.   Too annoyed after the last game.  Deleting....			"

It's pretty different and honestly super engrossing and fantastic.			"

								At first the amount of things happening in NEO Scavenger was overwhelming, but with time and practice I learned how to play, slowly understanding the wasteland. This game is fun, punishing, and definitely unforgiving. I really enjoy the Hex tiles that makes up the world map, the combat is rather deep, and it's a game that rewards thinking outside what you'd initially expect. This game is deep and smart and will make you sweat buckets as you carefully navigate perils.Definitely a must play if this kind of micromanaging is your kind of jam~			"

												If you like Fallout and you like survival games, Neo Scavenger is the game for you. It's one of the best RPGs I've played in a long time, with tons of exploration, meaningful choices with actual consequences, and tons of different ways to approach any problem. Most challenges are easily overcome if you're prepared, but the same challenges can still easily kill you if you rush in, and in most cases you only get one chance. Enemy threats are easily distinguishable on the world map, with all NPCs shown wearing the equipment they're carrying, which lets you guess at their faction, disposition, and danger level. Also, you get to kick a dogman's♥♥♥♥♥with your bare hands.Pros:- Exploration- Meaningful consequences to choices- Lots of interactions and events- Great art- Traits used often and in useful waysCons:- Somewhat limited variety crafting system- Crafting slows down noticeably when carrying lots of items, and may break sometimes- You -will- spend a lot of time playing inventory tetris- Be warned, this is a permadeath game (for those who this is a con)			"

												You think everything is going well, you think you're safe in this world. But then you go to sleep and a dogman rips you to peices. 10/10 would be ripped to peices again.But to be more serious the game is well made and the permadeath feature makes the game force you to learn from past mistakes, dying of hypothermia, getting shot to death by a bad mutha. All things that can be avoided. You live and learn in this game. The game may be basic but offers a wide array of replay to anyone. Dont like to bash people over the head with a club then avoid mele and pick ranged or the other way arround. The play style is up to you.So yes, i recommend this game, even more so if you get it on sale.			"

								Ok, to start out I want to say I love this game and any criticisms is because I want it to be better ok? Good! So in Neo Scavenger you are basically given one of two goals: A-Survive Or B-Story based playthroughs. to tell you the average life expectancy of any character is really not a for sure answer just because of the learning curve, this game takes micro-managing to quite a substantial level and unless you keep up with it you're gonna bleed out of your eyes and you won't notice because you didn't read the red text! Another great thing about this game is the combat system, rather than having a ""Health Bar"" it has more of a...""How much♥♥♥♥♥♥can you Eat Before you die"" bar, now what I mean by this is you can take hits to the face with a Crowbar and still have a chance of survival, even though at that point you'd probably be ""earing♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; thus the name! Genius! There is of course the as always Eating, Drinking, sleeping bars, but this game is kind of speacial due to it's tempature and pain bars, tempature is pretty self-explanatory so I'm going to stick to the ""Pain"" bar. It basically shows how badly your player is feeling so for example if he fell down he'd probably have a bum knee and that produces a bruise and minor pain, but if some dude rushes you with a cleaver and starts hacking into your stomach with it, he's gonna feel a little differently, And to wrap it up let's talk about the less than wanted things of about the game. Because of it's damage system and the random number generators you can sometimes get killed pretty ridiculously, for example I was killed once with a stick because he hit me in the head hard enough...Now while I like the damage system beacuse of it's complexity, that has to be fixed and I believe they are working on bugs like that, secondly the random number generator can be a real♥♥♥♥♥sometimes and even when you are supposed to be getting loot because you have a full loot chance bar you get nothing, I believe the developer is also looking into this. I really love this game and even though there are some rough patches I really hope the devolper can sand them down and hopefully bring this game to full potential! (Modding is involved in the game I did not cover it though because Steam doesn't have a Mod Page for it. Oh and by the way sorry for how long it is, there's just so much greatness in the game that giving it half a sentance didn't sit well with me.)			"

								A brutally hard survival game. If you are feeling a masochist, pick this.Jokes aside, although the only control you have on you caracter is on the inventory management and choosing which actions to perform, I can assure you that this is one of the most complex survival games available in Steam. Due to it's level of difficulty, I suggest you play this on short bursts (as on the first playthroughts you won't last that long anyway :P )PROS:-Excellent atmosphere that absorves you into it's post-apocaliptyc setting.-The sound is great, from the realistic effects to the music.-Every choice has a consequence, even a choice as deceptevly simple as drinking a bottle of water that you just found-I would dare to say that the depth of the game's survival mechanics are unparalelled.-There is an actual main storyline to this game shall you choose to follow it.CONS:-It is a very difficult game. I have 6+ hours on this game by the time I am writing this, and I still take a beating every time. I tottaly understand if many people are put off by it.-The learning curve: I will be honest. This game has TONS of trial and error. Only after the first 5 playthroughs(about 2 hours of playing), you will be able to understand why you have died. From there, the game gets more satisfying, but adding to the complex interface and the fact that the game almost begs you to seek vital information (such as important crafting recipes) to the game's wiki page.Having said that, if you are looking for a challenge, you certainly have one here. If I were to call this game by other name, it would be Bear Grylls Simulator.			"

								Fantastic game, and gives you a real challenge. Considering there can only be one save file, and that when you die, your save file is deleted (permanent death), it keeps you on edge. When I end up dying after weeks of in-game survival, amassing a collection of fantastic gear, I don't feel angry or frustrated, so much as I feel optimism for the next try in this wasteland. It feels like every time I play, I learn something new. It will take a long time before the game begins to feel monotonous or annoying. I'm already over 35 hours in, and I look forward to more :)			"

												NEO Scavenger was on my wishlist for a long time, $15 seemed steep for a graphics/text game, let alone a rogue-like. Well, I got drunk one night and impulsively hit 'buy'. So now I have it, and I like it enough to give a review, which I don't usually do.NEO is brutal. This isn't the type of game where you play the ultra-altruistic ""Hero"" that saves everybody and looks good doing it. You'll live a lot longer if you take the attitude of ""desperate homeless guy that doesn't want to get involved in your♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. When you die, it's over. No going back to a previous save. You just start over from scratch.The learning curve is a little bit steep, but so rewarding once you get there. My first several hours I went through at least half a dozen deaths. I learned to avoid fights. To clean my wounds before bandaging them. I learned to not ever eat yellow berries. I rage quit twice. I came back twice.Now, I've got a rifle (with ELEVEN bullets!), a warm coat and enough clean water to last me a week. I'm unstoppable, king of all there is in this wasteland. Except that I'm not. I still run away from everything that moves, I only camp in secluded buildings, diligently cover my tracks behind me and always keep an eye over my shoulder.And that's how it should be. I survived for this long because I learned how to live in the wasteland. I didn't get a bunch of XP from slaughtering hundreds of enemies and then suddenly become immune to a bullet to the brainpan.That's what I love about this game. The ""XP"" is your own damn brain. Learning how to craft the things you need. How to avoid those looters in the distance. Knowing that I've gotten as far as I have by not making mistakes. NEO has an outrageous amount of complexity that you would never know exists until you go looking for it. If you're on the fence, just buy it. Well worth the money spent.One last tip: If you're new, take botany. Makes the game a little more forgiving since you won't really have to worry about food & drink. "

												This is an awesome hex-based/turn-based post-apoc rpg that I added somewhat casually to my wishlist and found myself thoroughly hooked on once I played it. The game is VERY reminscent, genre aside, of Darklands, in that you have several text roleplay adventures that can be encountered either randomly or in permanent places whilst roaming a decently-sized over map (I actually wanna play that too now!). You can also encounter enemies (and you'll sure as hell encounter them), gather in forests, loot in buildings, and just overall scavenge your way to your next safe haven... or unknown!The game is very fun and fufils that thrill/gamble factor with almost every action you take, as it is very luck-based with a few ways to bend it in your favor. It can be a little aggrivating on occasion (what game isn't?), but once you master what to look out for and keep in the early stages of the game, it seems pretty much clear sailing. Contrary to some of the frustrated negative reviews regarding permadeath, there is only a handful of situations where a player will die outside of usual combat, and most can be avoided by using your head and your wits. (spoiler example:  choosing to label yourself ""stock"" at a warehouse club which clears caters for some sort of human trafficking, i mean really :P  )All-in-all I would recommend this game to anyone who is comfortable with the genre tags; this gaming style is considered fairly dated by today's standards but it absolutely holds up, well and truly making up for it in storyline and gritty mortal desperation!

												This game is really, really good.  It's got an interesting story, but you can ignore it and carve out your own tale if you so choose.However, I feel there are two problems with this game:Firstly, the world seems pretty much dead.  Except for one story location, there doesn't seem to be anyone anywhere except hostile bandits and looters who are willing to not murder you on sight if you agree to not murder them on sight.  In my opinion, the world should feel just a little bit more alive.Secondly, the game is TOO brutal.  I get that it's a roguelike and roguelikes are supposed to be tough, but there's a lot of things that, quite frankly, are full of♥♥♥♥♥♥I once stabbed a guy with a long, pointed tree branch made into a spear.  According to the game text, I viciously stabbed his upper stomach, and according to the in-game status text, he was bleeding heavily, in shock, and on the ground.  Somehow he managed to knock me out in one punch, steal my spear and backpack, and run away before I woke up, got an infection and died.Several times I've started a brand new game just to not find any early game drops and freeze to death within a minute.  No hyperbole, I died within a single minute of starting a new game thanks to the RNG.  Other times I'll be walking around the game world and suddenly I've got diiarhea and I'm vomiting and my stomach hurts and I'm dead.Don't get me wrong, this game is loads of fun to play and you should definitely give it a try if you like roguelikes and randomly-generated game worlds, but there's a lot of things that make me scream and swear at the game when I really shouldn't be.Overall, I would indeed recommend this game.  7.8/10			"

												TLDR:  A good turn based survival game with neat setting and mechanics.NEO Scavenger is a turn-based survival game whose difficulty I'd call 'tough but fair' once you get the  hang of the mechanics.  You play as Philip Kindred, a man who has lost most of his memories after being rudely awakened from his cryogenic-sleep pod in the near future.  The game is set in post-apocalyptic Michigan, with a mix of supernatural/horror and sci-fi elements.  Overall it reminds me of Fallout 1 and 2 in terms of tone and atmosphere.Something you should definitely be aware of before buying: Permadeath!  There is only one save slot in NEO Scavenger and when you die the game deletes the savegame, forcing you to start over.  However you can get around this fairly simply by manually backing up your savegame files after you save, so even players who don't like permadeath should still be able to enjoy NEO Scavenger if they save often and remember to back up those save files.  (I believe there is also a mod that adds multiple save slots, or that automatically backs up your save game, or something like that.  I never tried it out myself, so I can't comment on it.)NEO Scavenger is a text heavy game, and there is no narrator or voice acting.  Talking with friendly NPCs and fighting hostile ones both involve plenty of text.  Not that the game doesn't have a good UI too, but the lore and details of the game are all conveyed through text.Speaking of which, the story of the game is told rather subtly, which I like but some people might not.  You'll have to search for clues to who you are and what's going on in the world.  Talking to NPCs, investigating strange locations, even simply finding and reading ancient newspaper article could tell you something important about the world of NEO Scavenger.  My point is you are going to have to really explore the game to uncover the plot.There is an end to the story after which you cannot keep playing, but the game is pretty clear that going to that area is a fairly big deal and you are never forced to do so.One of my favorite ways NEO Scavenger tells you about the world (and lets you tell the game what sort of person 'your' Philip Kindred is) is through random events.  These events will pop up occasionally as you explore the map, present you with a situation/problem, and a number of choices to deal with said situation/problem.  They're a bit like a single-page Choose-Your-Own-Adventure games.  Though sometimes a bad choice can get you eaten, so keep what I said about backing up your saves in mind if you dislike permadeath.  I've found several dozen of them so far and the choices and their outcomes are generally very satisfying.  There was one that actually let me ask for more information before deciding whether to help a slightly suspicious person, which is something I've often lamented a lack of in other games.There's also a small modding scene, despite the lack of Steam Workshop support (flash and steam don't work well together apparently).  Check out the forums of the Blue Bottle Games website or Nexus mods for those.Finally, I just want to mention that the actual total hours I've played this game are at least twice of what Steam says it is.  This is because I bought the game through the developers website and generally play the version I downloaded there.  Speaking of which. if you do decide you want to buy the full game, you can get NEO Scavenger DRM free on Good Old Games, or directly through the Blue Bottle Games website.			"

												In light of the fact that this game is done being developed, I've decided to rewrite my review.A fantastic game in which you have to survive in a world that isn't so much out to kill you as it just doesn't care that you exist. You don't get superpowers, crazy damage resistence, favorable loot spawns or anything like that, you are just another person scrounging a living off the wasteland that used to be Michigan. I'd give it a 10/10And in case that doesn't convince you, there's a demo you can try out to get an idea of what the game is like. Don't waste your time reading more reviews, go get started!			"

								Definently one of the gems of Early Access.A cruel survival game, the developers eye for details is very noticeable in the world, characters, items as well as the crafting system. With an atmosphere reminding of a great title like Fallout you can't go wrong.It took me several attempts before I was able to survive more than a few days, the learning curve might seem steep but you need to be able to learn from your mistakes and work through that. Some times it can just be dumb luck, or bad luck, sometimes you learn a lesson (don't eat the wrong berries!)Fight against the elements, your own needs, and the countless bandits & beasts that roam the wasteland.As with all Early Access titles, beware that the game is under early development and can become subject to radical changes, re-balancing and wipes. I have yet to find any game-breaking bugs (or many other bugs for that matter) even tho I'm playing the latest beta version.Will be very interesting to see the final product, best of luck to you Daniel :)			"

												Brilliant game with a real feeling of fear and post apocalyptic gameplay. The problem with the game is that it is ridiculously chance derived and geared towards grinding. Yes I understand it is a ""rogue like game"" but it takes the worst elements of rogue like and runs under them with a banner off a cliff. Practically the only way to play this game for more then a few minutes is by save scumming through it but even with that its so tedious and repetitive that the novelty  behind this game wears off fast. The story-line is almost nonexistent and is stringed out like a carrot on a stick. Its sad because I want to like this game. It has all of the essential qualities of being an amazing game and had the developers spent a little more time working on it then this would have been one of my favorite games. Sadly they didn't spend the extra time and this is just kind of a mediocre game that has some cool ideas behind it that aren't fully developed.			"

												As a game, this is an admirable failure.  As an artistic experience, it succeeds, but not in a way that makes for a playable video game.  The bottom line, however, is that you almost certainly should not play it.The writing is excellent, and not just by video game standards.  The dev could write good sci-fi fiction.The game has permadeath.  The core game loop is good, but clunky.  Progress is punishing.  It takes 10 real life minutes to make a bunch of arrows, which aren't particularly effective, but they're what you get.  I recommend the sling.  Even taking all precautions, you can die instantly because a dogman or blue frog pops up at close proximity or in your sleep and kills you in one round.  You realize that there's nothing you could have done, and often there's nothing you can learn from to prevent it in the future.  Because getting a character into survival state, which allows exploring the story, takes several hours, the clunkiness becomes an insane ping-pong of clicks (left screen, right screen, ten ping-pong clicks to sleep; seven to scavenge a single building; repeat until you die or quit, then repeat some more).  I view this as an artistic statement about life that, like the sudden and unpreventable deaths, cannot be understood until wearily experienced.The problem is that the game breaks into choose-your-own-adventure encounters that are both the reason to play the game and what breaks it.  A majority of the options in these encounters will instantly end your game.  Single encounters will have branching choices, the majority of which will end your game.  They cannot be predicted.  Because of their branching nature and the immense real life time to get to the point where you see them, you cannot realistically finish the game.  Further, the game hard-limits your exploration; you get X number of choices, then time's up.  The internet is full of gnashing and wailing, true believers who spent over 100 hours on the game begging the dev to release the text files of the end-game, which he basically did by telling people what to search for in the XML files.If you do buy it, some guy made a batch file that acts as a save-game manager.  Get it.			"

												I don't know, maybe this game gets as good as I keep seeing people say it is after you survive a little while and get some gear, but that's the thing: I can't. Every game I played started and ended the same way: I wandered around, scavenged for items, found nothing or barely anything (one game I found some pants; another, a multitool; every other game I would find a single shoe), then got attacked and killed. No matter if I tried to run or hide, I would eventually get attacked by an enemy and die. I couldn't fight, because I found no weapons. I was constantly getting sick, because I found no clothes. I'm all for games being tough, but when literally all I'm finding everywhere I go is dirty rags and plastic shopping bags, it's not fun. Maybe I'm doing something wrong and should look up strategies on how to survive, but I think games should have a minimum amount of playability without having to use outside resources, and this one doesn't, so I can't recommend it. I'm sad about that, because I followed it through Early Access and waited to play until release, really looking forward to it, but there's not holding your hand and there's not giving you any direction at all, and this game falls into the latter category for me. Your experience may vary.			"

								NEO Scavenger gives you an indepth survival experience without the system becoming too cumbersome. It's definetely a ""One More Try"" kind of game and each session feels completely different from the last. That being said, this is not a game for anyone looking for a comfy and cozy experience; NEO Scavenger can be brutal.The turn based approach is unique with regards to survival games, but it works here as you're given ample time to make the best choices possible. This is a good thing as the game can be very intense at times, especially when you're sick, injured or pursued by dog men.Props for the developer for inserting quite a bit of Michigan/Northern Indiana cryptozoology and myths (I'm been obsessed with  ""melonheads"" since reading through Weird Michigan on my way back from my honeymoon).

												Really adictive gameplay, love how it's an post-apocalyptic survival game with out Zombies. Not a lot of though games on the market, now if you could have followers and make your own settlement kinda thing along with a way to regain equipment lost from the last Charactor making a new mode called Sandbox or something would be cool. I've probably have been killed by a pack of dogs then anything else in this game to be honest. While on the topic of dogs, while hiding inside of a building for i.e the cryo cell 17(or what ever its called) something with High levels of everything you would need to stay safe/hidden from the outside world/elements. Animals shouldnt beable to get to you they don't have hands to open doors or at lest have it so you can border your self off from people cuze sleeping is the second deadlist thing in this game to do. With all that said i would give this game an 8.5-10. keep up the good work!			"

								(EDIT: Fixed a terrible typo that changed the meaning of one sentence into the very opposite.)Even during its beta stage NEO Scavenger feels like a completed and a released game. It can be intense (provided you have the imagination), it can be (actually it WILL be) evil and it can be forgiving (for a brief second before you run into a pack of dogmen who rip you apart).NEO is also ridiculously cheap for it's value. Of course, I'm not trying to encourage a higher price, I'm just thanking Daniel for his reasonable pricing. (Take that Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes)I can't recommend this enough. After getting the game I sunk a ridiculous amount of time into it in a single weekend. I recommend starting off completely blind. No wikis. No gameplay videos. Just jump in. After dying horribly a few times, you can begin checking a few things out from the wiki. OH and I URGE you to read all the messages at the bottom of the screen during combat (you can click the box to expand). Then just let your imagination fly and get all the horribly violent moments carved deep into your brains. If your imagination is anything like mine, you're gonna find this game to be one of the most ruthlessly violent games you've played and it doesn't even graphically show you any of the scenes.Now, I understand this is not a game for everyone. If you don't enjoy reading a lot of text, that is not a reason to stay away. You don't have to read any of it. But if you don't enjoy slow paced, the original Fallout-like games with survival and tension, you might as well stay away. But if you know someone who likes that kind of stuff, please, tell them about NEO Scavenger.			"

								I had already recommended the game but I felt that it should be changed. Here we go! Review 2.0BUY IT NOW!PROS...- More in-depth than any other post-apocolypse (if that's how you spell it XD) survival games I have ever played.- Kinda funny predicaments (again, can't spell) like hopelessly running from a ""Mega Wraith"" (you'll understand once you see it) until you pass out and get your head LITTERALLY CRUSHED by it- Story is not nessecary. Really, you can just jump in, not read anything and still have a good time. Great for when you don't have a lot of time to spend- Addicting. Beacuse you die so much *see CONS* you constantly have that Flappy-Bird-ish ""The next life will be better"" mentalityCONS...- More expensive than I would like but maybe thats just me- Still in early access so there are occasional bugs (which I still haven't found) and some item combos that arent there.- Really hard. Since it's randomly generated, it takes a whole lot of luck to not die beofore you can even - Too much cussing in the main story. Remember that this is an indie game so there aren't the same standards as some other titles. BUT REALLY! I warn you that there is a sence were every 3 words (yes I counted) they drop the F-bomb.Overall, it's a great game and deserves to be played. At least try the demo to get a taste of what the core of it really is.30phil1 wrote a review30phil1 posted the review30phil1 played NEO Scavenger30phil1's head was crushed by Mega Wraith's grasp30phil1 died of trumatic brain injury*End Turn*			"

								To state it simply as I can, there is no way that I can do enough to recommend NEO Scavenger as highly as it deserves.  In the Kentucky Derby of the rather numerous games (a few of which have or are solid enough to merit at least some serious note) in this generally broad set of the Post-Apocalyptic/Survival genre of the current/modern PC scene, NEO Scavenger is a Thoroughbred Champion of the most uncomplicated sort.  The thundering hooves of the race set the pace out of the gate, nearly beating a tattoo on your ribs from within the moment you find yourself thawed and unceremoniously deposited into a world that appears to not only have been blasted and scarred by the now typical arsenal of Post-Apocalyptica, but also one haunted by Werewolf-like monsters -among a number of others-  that are both imminently fatal, but also understated in a way that for my own part recalls the same sort of creeping, crawling, truly psychological horror upon my initial encounters with some of Lovecraft's more authentically gripping horrors.  With a pedigree of the caliber that NEO Scavenger boasts for itself in my ever so discerning gaming tastes, the more atypical or ""monstrous and supernatural"" of the associations piercing my own memory and stretching all the way back to 1931 and the horror that rose from Y'ha-nthlei to consume and squat over Innsmouth as the Dagon's Deep Ones.  The second major thread is likely more easily expected and certainly open to being related to by a (vastly) wider audience in the sense of the overall and yet still growing popularity of the genre, this association springs forward over (the next two and three) centuries, bathed in the near incandescence of the white washed mediocrity of the just shy of unending faux 1950s Apple Pie-Americana and all consuming oceans of nuclear fire and equally inescapable Fallout.  In contrast to the almost stark bleakness that Lovecraft instilled in me at times - without being overtly apocalyptic; whereas Fallout inspired and from time to time continues to inspire the notion that humanity might well resist and rise again on the dark side of whatever Great Catastrophe it happens to be this time.  And it is certainly a blend of these personal, half-imagined (and again, doubly personalized) inspirations and senses of direction for my gaming imagination that are invoked upon finding my way out into NEO Scavenger's wide-open Michigan, a great American state that it would seem will take a little more than a single puny Apocalypse to wipe off the map altogether.I imagine that aside from being a logical decision for a one-man marching band, along with/and cost-effective from the angle of overhead and production costs, the old-school vibe and streamlined everything go a great ways in the direction of encouraging the individual player to engage the game in a way that other, more modern examples do not and cannot allow for.  Specifically, there aren't so many details, so many aspects of the experience predetermined by hard-coded and visualized default automatically and inescapably included in the Scavenging experience from the mouse click on.The Crafting System is a standout aspect of the Gameplay Mechanics for NEO Scavenger, which speaks to a bit of that aforementioned logic - it being pretty pointless to spend an entire game scavenging for junk that doesn't, or can't be combined with something to do or become anything useful.  The type and variety of that junk you'll be so happily scavenging is at a fair balance at the moment - though more melee and/or ranged (re: improvised DMRs/battle rifles) weapons of any stripe and variety, as well as pretty much any new items at all will always make me happy.  The combat system is similarly uncomplicated and crisp, though perhaps taking a game session or two for many of the more fast-paced FPS-twitchy gamers of the here and now.It's these invitations to the individual imagination that - along with the perfectly applied Game Mechanics- are the most easy and obvious examples of the true genius you can find here.  Or, to restate it again in final summary, there's so much about NEO Scavenger that will allow the gamer to become as immersed in and rewarded by their experience as the breadth, depth and staying power of their imagination will allow.

								Although the graphics can be out right disgusting and the learning curve in the game is at an all time high. With countless early game deaths due to hypothermia or a nasty encounter. If you are willing to stick around to find that right strategy, this one has quickly become an addictive addition to my collection. I wholeheartedly suggest to the fans of survival games to give this one a try at the very least the demo. For the faint of heart or quick tempered steer clear. This title is full of conditions that will have even the heartiest adventure tripping over your own two feet.(in some cases quite literally) But if you are looking for a new challenge to this genre you will make a happy new find in this game.

This has a pretty steep learning curve, but the challenges of simply surviving bring with it the really rewaring feeling of surving another day. Because it's turn based, you can walk away from this game without worrying about anything going wrong. As a father of two young kids, that's perfect! This is absolutely a game worth buying, particularly if you're a fan of the ""survival"" genre.			"

								This game is incredble. I recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a dialog-based survival game! From the moment you awake from cryo sleep the first thing you will realize that it has lots of protential to be a great game. So i recommend you help the developers make this into the best dialog-based survival game in 2014!!!!P.S: Don't forget getting into combat knowing that this NPC has better loot then you. So you do the impossible. You dodge the incoming blow from his monkey wrench,then you do a few blows to his stomach. Thus making the NPC fall and have a fructured rib and coughing blood. Then you finish him with 5 kicks to the face while the NPC is on the ground. Also giving him a concussion and eventullay dieing from blood loss. After doing the impossible you can loot the NPC's cloth,weapons,antibiotic,etc.Now, your that OP guy that no NPC wnats to mess with :DGoodbye!!!			"

								I let my curiosity draw me into a lit-up warehouse pumping industrial tunes and full of ragged and sick looking stragglers. I survived an arena battle put on by some deprvied sickos. I may or may not have eaten human meat. I encountered two bandits and managed to cripple one badly with a crowbar. I was eventually tackled and beaten to death by his flashlight-weilding sidekick. I survived just under 2 days. Amazing game. If you have a love for rogue-likes and ""story making"" games then you should support NEO Scavenger. It can only get better from here.			"

								+ Versatile crafting system where recipes are discovered either by random tinkering or by little ""scraps of paper"" found in the world.+ Multiple skills which have an important impact on playstyle. Whether combat is even worth it or not depends a lot on your skills - avoidance is very often the better option.+ Crafting is actually very important and useful.+ Very few, if any, items which act as a be-all-end-all.+ Except for early hypothermia, if you die, it was most likely a bad decision on your part. Often, the connection between cause and effect is extremely convoluted and indirect.+ Multiple survival factors which have to be controlled in unique ways.+ Interesting combat system that doesn't make the player the automatic most likely victor.- Player has frozen to death.

If you are on the fence about purchasing the game try the demo, it's loads of fun, but it is amazing how many more features the full version has, making it the same core game yet feel like the second edition to this game. I look forward to see what this game will have in store for us in the future!			"

								So, basically you have lost all your memory after waking up from Cryo Sleep, in an abandoned Cryo Facility in an extremely cold Michigan.You then start looting stuff, most importantly clothes for warmth before the night falls and you freeze to death, then food, and then a weapon to have atleast small chances of winning a fight you might get into.The game has a very good story line, not gonna spoil it.What I like on this game the most, is that it's simple and complex at the same time.That means it's mainly hex 'n' text based, you will not encounter any animations besides rain and snow (if you make it that far, that is.)And you can simply just go around loot stuff and use them against people and for you.But you can also do alot more, like for smallest examples, boil river / lake / marsh water to sterilize it instead of directly drinking it and risking infections and illnesses.Or you could take a branch and sharpen it with a knife, or add sharp objects into it to make it a broad spear.The combat also, pretty simple yet complex.You CAN win a fight by simply repeatedly pushing the attack button, but you can also win a fight by playing much more tactically, luring people into traps, using the environment to your help etc, and win that fight even better without any injuries.You can either follow the storyline, finding out who you are / were, or you can just do open world play and survive in the harsh environment.It might look like a simple game at first, but I promise you that there's A WHOLE LOT MORE into this.The crafting system is VERY deep, and you can craft QUITE alot, I'm playing it since a long time (before steam release) and still haven't had every single crafted item in the game.It has a wiki with alot of hints and tips about everything in the game.Also, for modders:It has modding support, VERY easy at that.To add just about anything, that is encounters, items, combat moves etc.. you just have to add some new lines into the .xml file, and the forum includes alot of documentation on how to do that.I do recommend this game because it's simply awesome and has a very long and big replayability rate.Also, did I mention the map gets randomized every time you play (besides the story hexes) ?

								Although the graphics can be out right disgusting and the learning curve in the game is at an all time high. With countless early game deaths due to hypothermia or a nasty encounter. If you are willing to stick around to find that right strategy, this one has quickly become an addictive addition to my collection. I wholeheartedly suggest to the fans of survival games to give this one a try at the very least the demo. For the faint of heart or quick tempered steer clear. This title is full of conditions that will have even the heartiest adventure tripping over your own two feet.(in some cases quite literally) But if you are looking for a new challenge to this genre you will make a happy new find in this game.

												Really adictive gameplay, love how it's an post-apocalyptic survival game with out Zombies. Not a lot of though games on the market, now if you could have followers and make your own settlement kinda thing along with a way to regain equipment lost from the last Charactor making a new mode called Sandbox or something would be cool. I've probably have been killed by a pack of dogs then anything else in this game to be honest. While on the topic of dogs, while hiding inside of a building for i.e the cryo cell 17(or what ever its called) something with High levels of everything you would need to stay safe/hidden from the outside world/elements. Animals shouldnt beable to get to you they don't have hands to open doors or at lest have it so you can border your self off from people cuze sleeping is the second deadlist thing in this game to do. With all that said i would give this game an 8.5-10. keep up the good work!			"

								Half roguelike, half text adventure RPG/adventure game, NEO Scavenger is definitely something new.  I picked it up after watching a couple of YouTube videos, planned on playing for a few minutes, and found myself trying to beat a bandit to death with a rock while I coughed up blood.  Limping away from the fight, I died moments later from acute blood loss.It's a brutal but phenomenal game.  It relies heavily on your own imagination which, in my opinion, makes it that much more powerful.  It is one of the only games that captures the bleakness and terror of the situation.  One moment you're strutting along with a shotgun in hand, a smile on your face, and the next, you're panicking because you drank contaminated water.  You're sick, coughing, vomiting, and it's all over.  Phenomental, wonderful game and a great replayable experience.  Just be prepared to lose because it is a *difficult* game.			"

												NEO scavenger is, without a doubt, the best surprise I've got through Humble Bundle. What at first seemed a little interesting survival game turned out to be a massive and addictive experience, with the most detailed survival mechanics you've ever seen (except maybe Project Zomboid).In NEO Scavenger, death is considered a sure thing, the question is how long you will last for. Survive the cold, survive the wounds. Survive the infection, survive the unboiled water you were forced to drink because you had no way to make a fire. Survive the blisters you got because you hadn't found boots yet, while a dogman chases you. Survive the poisoning you got eating unidentified mushrooms. And worst of all, survive the people (NPCs) who want what you've managed to gather.The world has unique lore, setting a post-apocalyptic world with paranormal phenomenons happening left and right, but extremely well presented, gradually giving you the information, which is spread through conversations, pieces of newspapers and others.The atmosphere is similar(ly angsty) to those of Dark Souls, or EVE online, but more personal and centered around the desperate situation your character wakes up into, like Spec Ops: The Line.The combat is quite simple and brutal: He who connects the first hit usually wins. This enforces a visceral and all-or-nothing mindset, with no place for holding resources back, and a ""shoot first, ask questions later"" policy that makes you question your own acts as a player.Both combat and map gameplay are turn-based, and reward thinking carefully about your next move, since the game works with permanent iron man mode (dying deletes the save file) to ensure that you're adequately kept on your toes.Overall, this is the best survival game I've ever played, and definitely the best one-man-made game out there: 10/10			"

								This title gives you tons of liberty in crafting, and doesn't frustrate you when you have to start over again and again. Turn-based adds intensity, especially when you're thirsty and water is a few hexes away from reach. Combat leaves you with total control over your end of the situation, and crafting can be augmented by one of your abilities that you choose at the start of the game. There's so much to explore, and I haven't really been in the same situation twice (after start game squence). It's not, ""how do I beat this?"" and more ""how long will I survive?"" With different situations, tons of options, and choice the way you survive, Neo Scavenger is fun to play over and over again.			"

Every time I would die, with a fully loaded character and everything, I got mad and started over. Some might say there isn't a lot in regards to the game, and I can see why they say that. There aren't a whole lot of places, but enough for me to keep my simple mind occupied.If you want to add more to the game, you can always download mods to enhance your experience.I highly reccomend this game and wish there was a bigger fanbase.

								Ok so this game is ... addictive. A nice post apocalyptic setup with one of the most detailed crafting systems I've ever seen. Also the game makes real use of the character skills, just like in old school RPG's - ain't got melee skill? Well, ain't gonna craft the best melee weapons, for example. As it is some kind of rouge like, there's no saving to be safe, it's just go for it and hope that you won't mess up, which leads to some pretty frustrating moments but also is part of the addictive character of the game. Closed the game more then one time during my 15 ingame hours but came back every time to start a new character. The combat system is kind of strange in the first few tries but as soon as you get the hang of it, it is really fun. It works turn based and you choose your actions as the enemies choose theirs, after that the outcome is shown in a textfield with lots of pretty brutal stuff, from arrows to the knee to wolffangs to your face. The graphic is not up to date, instead it is real outdated but this game is not about graphics, it's about imagination. Many encounters contain lots and lots of written text (remember Fallout 1/2 or Baldurs Gate conversations? - you won't find those conversations but massive ambient text). Features: - nice ambient text- great crafting system, starting from making glas shards out of bottles over crafting armor from hides and furs to upgrade weapons with scopes for example- huge bunch of neat items with degeneration- deep skillsystem with skills giving options on encounters (but skills are chosen on character creation and can't be trained)- big range of enemies starting from cannibal gangs over strange mutants up to paramilitary townguards (if you decide to attack them) - extensive character needs, from hunger and thirst over induced pain to warmth (yes, you can freeze and expect to do so often in the beginning)-rouge like: saving only by leaving the game, a dead character stays dead but a nice little statistic when died shows some of the players accomplishments - one of the most stable early access games I've ever played with a range of features and stuff that outruns some released games by far - big, randomly created (open) world with some points of interest - devs active on steam forumIf you like challenging games which are more about ambient then shiny graphics, show those devs some love and give it a try (there's also a demo which I highly recommend to play to be sure this kind of game suites you).

								I'm 27 hours in and I'm still learning a few things about this game. There's a lot of depth and possibilities.The decision of drinking water or not might kill you a day later in the game as you die of an infection. Some enemies have guns but no ammution, so picking up a fight might either be deadly or immensively rewarding. Dogmen can hunt you down in the night while you're getting some well deserved rest and kill you in a few moves. Othertimes you desperately search for a dogman to rescue you from starvation (They drop a lot of tasty meat). Resorting to cannibalism at one point in the game might result in an impossible to satisfy desire for human flesh later on.All the choices have consequences, many not immediately clear. This feels a bit arbritrary at first, but once you get to know the machanics you can use this to your advantage (there's a wiki that serves as a decent entry point, explaining most mechanics and providing a few tips, just make sure not to spoiler yourself). You can shoot enemys and then run away to loot their corpses later when they died of bloodloss. Or you can sneak up to sleeping enemies and hit them unconscious with a monkey wrench before they know what's going on.There's no leveling up, no new skills to get (there's actually a way to get a few additional skills, but you don't get them regularily). Your chances of winning a fight mostly depend on your equipment, sometimes you find a loaded gun on your first day and othertimes you're desperately searching for a way to cook your water.The art of being succesfull in NEO Scavanger lies in making the right decisions. If you have tough luck and don't get the gear you need or you're bleeding all over the place, you stay away from fights for a while. There's definitively a considerable learning curve, if you enjoy games with depth then this one is worth a look.The interface is not always intuitive and needs some getting used to, but then again that might very well change until the game leaves beta.I expected this to just be another casual game I spend a few hours on, but it really stands out and is loads of fun. It's very hard, but thats the way I like my games.			"

												NEO Scavenger is a great survival game/roguelike set in a post apocalyptic Michigan setting with supernatural and cyperpunk elements. Emphasis on those elements taking a back seat to survival with perma-death.You will die a lot. Engaging in combat can be very fatal, but it works both ways. The more you get hit, the worst you get, but the same applies to the other ""guy"".Perhapes the most harrowing aspects after you figure out how to survive and thrive in the harsh overworld is the special and random encounters, which are a seperate game in themselves. They can result in instant death based on your choices, so you have to choose wisely. As a word of advice, don't take risks! (You are not superman!)			"

I want to carry around every scrap of junk I find. I think it comes from the old point and click adventure games where every item had a use, so you had to find every item for that moment where you need it.That will get you killed fast in this game. Take what you need, set priorities, and for survival's sake, stop picking up every bloody rock and twig!  This is a no nonsense survival game with a quaint, homebrew feel and a ruthless approach to killing off your next character in some new and intresting way.			"

												Ah, this game returns me to the good 'ol days of dugeon master. A very nice, but at some times intense, text-based open world RPG is always a good way too kill time. I found myself trapped in this game for a few hours, trying every combination of character traits and items and shelters until I found the combination that best suited me. The game also includes a deeply satisfying narrative and atmosphere, one which lacks in many more complex games. In a simpler sense:Pros:+Unique, although simple, graphics+Satisfying narrative+Immersive and well-thought out atmosphere+Interesting and innovative game mechanics+Nice UI+In-depth interaction and self-interaction mechanics+Very interesting health system+Easy to learn, hard to master+Overall very nice feel and well-polished gameCons:-Lack of items (which is especially discouraging for an open-world survival game)-Lack of enemies-Narrative and discovery dwindles as the game progresses-Single storyline with little variationOverall:4/5. I really enjoyed this one. It has it's problems, but all in all it was very fun to play. "

								If there is one of all the games i own that i can recommend, it's this one. Gonna assume you know the basics of it already from other sources, but if you're here to see if it's worth the price, the answer is YES. It's not only the best survival game on the market at this time, with a kickass story and setting to back up it's mechanics. But the sheer breadth of choices and the complexity of it's systems also makes it a generator of some amazing stories. Many a time are the retelling of the fates of some of my characters as entertaining as the time i spent playing them.			"

								NEO Scavenger is the best roguelike to grace steam in some time. It's not about grinding, leveling up or anything like that. It's far more of a roguelike survival simulation. Only unlike Waywards island sim this game is more akin to the movie The Road or th S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. It's desperateand meaningful combat involves you sneaking around, pulling people down, parrying, stabbing, swinging and doing everything you can to win. While a win feels great, the person you're facing is often in the same shoes as you. As for graphics everything is nicely drawn. Icons are easy to see and understand, the world is big but easy to navigate, the hand drawn figures range from average to awesome. It's not the best looking game but it's got a gritty atmosphere about it and it works great with the music.As for the sim part, this game just shines. Plastic bags will rip and you'll lose items, certain items can't be put into shopping carts because of the wholes in the frame, you'll be dumping pills out of small pill containers and putting them into larger ones so you can carry more. For a turn based game played on a hex grid, this is game can really get to you. I definitely suggest picking it up.			"

												NEO Scavenger is a great roguelike survival RPG. Playing it, you really get the impression that the experience of surviving (or not surviving, probably) in a post-apocalyptic future would be this difficult. I recommend it with a few warnings:- It's a Flash game. That fact annoyed me for some reason when I learned it. Probably because there's no animation and it feels kind of ""cheap."" It creates the impression of a big, hex-based board game. Also, I'm not sure if it's because of the Flash-based game engine, but I lost all of my ""map"" progress when the game failed to save properly once.- The pixelated, retro-style graphics work, but they don't cover up the fact that the game is rather ugly--and not because of the apocalyptic setting.- There is some groan-inducing writing. Most of the writing is nice, though. It's not anything that detracts from the experience.- The game is random to a fault sometimes. You're going to come across things that can instantly kill you. Or they'll come across you while you're sleeping. It's not fun to lose hours of progress when a thug caves in your head with a monkey wrench because you picked a poor campsite...or RNGesus didn't give you his blessing.- Despite the game's randnomness, certain events never change. When you die, you're going to have to redo certain key events to be able to have a decent chance of advancing to the real progression. This can become monotonous after a few new games.- There are no save slots. This is unconditionally an ironman-mode game. That wouldn't be a problem if there wasn't the occasional corrupted save file.If you're interested in the genre and you understand that this is a game you might never complete because it's just so damned unforgiving, you can get a lot of fulfilling hours out of this.

								If you ever wanted a game that blends Oregon Trail and Fallout but with total emphasis on player response-ability (yes I mean response-ability) then go try the demo of this game right now. Although brutal from the start (I survived 3 hours my first playthrough), the more you play this game and the more time you devote to figuring out what skills/items/reactions will help you survive depending on the given situation (Hint: run) the more satisfying it is when you reach the point of gun-toting, berry-eating, sleeping-bag-sleeping, Dogman slaying badass, ONLY to die of diarrhea (RIP colon). And in the total stupor of ""how did... that... why?"" begin another playthrough and start the whole brutal endeavor all over again- BUT this time ready to defeat the mutated Detroit Diarrhea of the future with the knowledge gleaned from your frothy death (Hint #2: boil your damn water). Excellent! Fine! Stupendous! Here we go again! Thanks to procedurally generated environments, the game feels fresh every time you restart it. New buildings to scavenge, new bandits to hoot and holler at, and the realization that the best weapon of all in this game isn't your .308 rifle with 2 bullets, but simply the knowhow to just run the hell away and live another night. I will recommend this game to anyone I give a damn about and use it as a litmus to test to see if I'll get a hold of them when the world goes to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Thanks for making this and keep making great games!

												This game can be frustrating at first, the first few (many) lives you play will often end in the same ways: freezing, beaten to death while you're half naked, more freezing. It takes patience, practice, and more than a little luck to get off to a good start. You learn what skills you should select, what risks you should take, and where all of the good stuff can be found.This is a fun game, it just takes a little getting used to.			"

								Hobo Simulator: Year Unknown, never thought id love finding an empty grocery bag...On a serious note:NeoScavenger's gameplay weighs heavy on inventory management and making the best of ALL of your surroundings, while trying to use your skills/perks. The decisions you make will make or break your adventure. You will die, you will learn from your mistakes and normally make it further each time you play. The post-apoc story is reminiscent of fallout but feels more like the movie ""Escape from LA"". This is a true rougue-like in nature, but its also a hardcore survival game with an immersive and rewarding crafting system. I find it quite addictive.			"

								4/5 Easily one of the most impressive survival games I've played to date. A lot of people might say something along the lines of "".. but the graphics aren't great at all.."" and thats okay. But what this game lacks in graphics, it more than makes up for in the mechanics and detail.  It will suck you in, probably even make you mad a little bit, but thats the beauty of it! NEO Scavanger tests your wits and your patience. Your cunning and intellect. Crafting is a huge part of the game. You have to gather supplies and build shelter and weapons, tools and clothes, hunt deer and trap squirrels. Wasteland raiders and looters roam the countryside, so watch out! You can get inflicted with a crap ton of bad status ailments such as Hypothermia, Sephis, infections, concussions, starvation, dehydration, poison, internal bleeding, and much... MUCH more! It is very challenging and makes you think about EVERY move before you make it!Look... even if you know you don't want to spend the money to buy it (which is still only $10), it is at least worth DLing the demo. That's what I did... and now I'm hooked. Good Gaming,Yeticlone			"

								A fresh take on the old rouge-like with great new game play systems that integrate seamlessly into the genre we know and love.The exploratory gameplay is engaging and nerve-wracking at the same time, and the unpredictable nature of events in the game means you'll spend much of your time simply trying to plan ahead for every contingency. This coupled with the constant threat of permanent death creates a very engaging experience. You never quite know what will happen once you step out of the Cryo Facility.  It truly defines survival, a lot of times on fresh starts I'd freeze to death on the first night since I couldn't find proper clothing, now that's realistic. There's a lot of potential here and I can't wait to see what the devs do with it.			"

								This game is like a drug, the well known syndrome of ""one more turn"". There is always something to discover, something to scare you or something to kill you. After countless deaths by ghosts, dogmen, cannibals and once because of very bad diarrhea, I still come back to the game, trying out different skill combination. The semi-random layout of the map (random scavange locations + fixed special locations), there is always an insentive to explore and see the world. Random encounters make every venture to a city that much more interessting. The slow pace of the game is perfect for people who want to take it slow, or like me, need time to actually figure out what they want to do. Combat is also refreshingly slow, gives you time to think over your moves and select the best option at the given moment (will you headbutt your opponent or dodge his next attack, hoping he will be vulnerable to counter attack).I hope the game evolves in the same way, presenting us with more dangerous creatures that stalk you in the night and more unique places that make you sit for a moment and carefully choose your next action, because permadeath is never that far away.

This game's exterior is rather simple, but once you get in and start playing, you will no doubt be in awe of the depth of its mechanics. The amount of freedom in the choices you can make, and how they affect you living or dying (sometimes terribly...) is unprecedented. Almost everything you could think of doing in order to survive in a post-apocalyptic world is in some way built into this game. and it not even finished yet!

You drag a shopping cart filled with junk through a desolate wasteland, desperately scrounge for a meal, and the apex of your day is finding a shoe in working condition for the correct foot. You'll be lucky to wake up tomorrow and even luckier to still have your things.The game features an incredibly in depth health system, which makes you vulnerable to blisters, infections, blood loss, diarrhea, allergies, hypothermia, dehydration, starvation...and other awful experiences I haven't had the pleasure to face yet. Combat is possible, but very very risky and the odds must be considered carefully. There is some kind of plot, but I haven't progressed enough to fully grasp it. There are, however, occasional side quests and the writing is consistently very good. Try it out. I don't like survival games, generally, but this one took a hold of me.			"

								A pretty outstanding game.It's a hexagonbase survival strategy game, that stresses on finding equipment to endure the elements, finding food, water, and medicine to survive. In a post apocalyptic world, it's you and you alone that must brave the outside world where anything could be your enemy.It's a scavanger game, you loot anything you are able to and keep anything useful, anything from nuts and bolts to nightvision goggles and assault rifles. Eventually you will have a character that you have put a bit of time and effort into creating, this is where the game gets fun.I really enjoy this game. It just recently came out a few months ago, I believe, and the dev is already coming out with patches, and helpful fixes towards the game. So, there's always new stuff to look forward to.If you play scavanging games, and you enjoy the satisfaction of trying to survive as long as you can.Then, I suggest you give this title a try.It even has a demo; if you are still unsure.

You drag a shopping cart filled with junk through a desolate wasteland, desperately scrounge for a meal, and the apex of your day is finding a shoe in working condition for the correct foot. You'll be lucky to wake up tomorrow and even luckier to still have your things.The game features an incredibly in depth health system, which makes you vulnerable to blisters, infections, blood loss, diarrhea, allergies, hypothermia, dehydration, starvation...and other awful experiences I haven't had the pleasure to face yet. Combat is possible, but very very risky and the odds must be considered carefully. There is some kind of plot, but I haven't progressed enough to fully grasp it. There are, however, occasional side quests and the writing is consistently very good. Try it out. I don't like survival games, generally, but this one took a hold of me.			"

								One of the best survival games I have played; where it's a dog eats dog world. Hunger sets in if you don't consume food, you can die from dehydration, freeze to death, bleed to death, die from infection and poison; the odds are stacked against you. However, the same goes for everyone else in Neo Scavenger, as well. It isn't like other games, where they severly penalize you but the conditions does not effect the enemy. Far from it, scavengers you find along the way can bleed to their demise and freeze and perish in the cold if they have no clothing, just like the way you can in the given conditions.If you pick this game up, be prepared to scream at times, and die countless more. Each death comes with learning to play better, and the learning curve is extremely steep. This game is literally based on Marxism, and it truly is a brutal, unforgiving atmosphere. Do not underestimate the enemy, and if you encounter two or more at once, do not be frugal. It's better to use that ammunition and live another day, than die and start over. Gear up and learn how to survive; and good luck.			"

												I really, really wanted to like this game.  I enjoy roguelikes (I love Nethack) and survival games as a genre, but I can't recommend this one.In the end, it's too easy to die without any foreknowledge, making the game feel a lot like playing roulette.  In my most recent game, I walked into a hex that appeared unoccupied, but in fact hid a dogman who killed me before I even spotted him.  I'm used to dying frequently playing games like Nethack, but I always feel like it's my fault, or that there was something I could have done to prevent my most recent death.  I do not have this feeling when playing Neo Scavenger.The UI is also very cumbersome (e.g., trying to navigate the craft menus, or trying to move things around in your inventory between vehicles and a box, etc.), coupled with tons of annoying fiddling in order to play even near-optimally (like always making/lighting torches when you scavenge, or trying to put on the 3 best shirts you have found), means that most of the time you're fighting the UI instead of making interesting decisions.  The simple fact that you can't tell whether water in a bottle is purified or not without dumping it out exemplifies what I mean.  Instead of looking for a bottle [water (purified)], you just have to dump out all your bottles until you find one containing purified water, take a drink, then put all the water back in the bottles.  It's madness.			"

												Day one.I wake up in a cryogenic facility, Instantly approached by a hulking monster. Remembering my knowledge and previous work in a garden, I decide to smash plants against my skin to scare the monster away. It works. I proceede to leave, Gathering pebbles and bark for my future domination of the world.Day two.I find out that bark does not protect me from hypothermia, And decide to scavange for clothes instead. Finding a shoe and a t-shirt, I dress. From rags to riches, They always say.Day three. I am approached by a random man wearing a hoodie with a glass bottle. Thinking he is bringing me a gift, I attempt to speak with him, Only to have my head wildly bashed in with said bottle, The last words going through my head being; ""I wonder if my shoe fell apart.""----All sillyness aside, Neo Scavanger is an amazing game. It includes the perfect mixture of roguelike mechanics, Mixed with a interesting if sparse text based story. The complexity of the game itself is astounding, Considering that it's a flash. The only cons i could point out would be the fact that it is currently out of any major development, Though it is majorly bug free and full of content, As well as major modability in its current form. All in all, Worth the money.			"

												Man I totally understand the love I see for this game but I just can't get behind it. I enjoyed this game and have alot of respect for roguelike game that manages to tell an intersting and detailed story. Ultimately the reason I have to give this the thumbs down is because of the terrible user interface and menu system that just flat out needs to be better.The game is a challenging one unfortunetly most of the challenge I faced was figuring out to navigate the complete mess of a menu system. Now once you get the menu system down the experience is much improved. I was reminded of how awful the menu system was after I had to put the game down for a few weeks and came back to find I had forgotten some of the ins and outs of the game and I just can't bring myself to try it again.I can handle bad graphics and some game play flaws but there are just too many here for me to ignore. There's some stuff to like here but overall its just not worth the price tag. 4/10			"

												This is an interesting game concept and nicely fleshed out lore (as far as i can tell) and i would very much like to see a more developed version in future.I do not regret having bought this title and see my small money as contribution to the developers further endeavours, but after some hours the gameplay feels to poor and unrewarding to keep on playing. Do not get me wrong, i like hard games, but this one feels of balance. Needless to say that combat mechanics are very outdated, but interaction with NPCs in general feel stale and lifeless and there is no good way to interact in a meaningful way - only stomping other peoples heads or getting stomped...I am aware that this game was developed by one single man, so hats off to you Sir. Hope we will see more of your work, but i will pass on this from now on...Bottom line: If you want to try it out, go ahead, but do not expect your experience to be particularly rewarding.			"

								I haven't reviewed anything on Steam yet, but I had to review NEO Scavenger because this game deserves so much praise. It completely caught me by surprise and is a great example of Early Access done right. I paid the $9.99 awhile ago and I felt it was completely worth it, and after the frequent updates and improvements, it definitely continues to be worth the money. While I do think the UI needs to be cleaned up a little and the story could be fleshed out more, NEO Scavenger is still a great game. From the crafting that is more than just there because a ton of games are including it, to the way it draws you in for one more turn, and then another, and then maybe another hour goes by, I couldn't say enough good things. There are some flaws and it isn't for everyone, but check out the demo and support a developer that does Early Access right. I've so far put nearly 30 hours into NEO Scavenger and I'll definitely be adding to that number as time goes on			"

								     You can look around the review pages for this game and see a sea of ""recommend"" posts, thats for good reason, and I will get to that. First however, I would like to try and define what NEO Scavenger is, though that may be difficult.      NEO Scav is a survival game in its simplest form but the title of ""Survival"" doesn't do it justice. I would like to define it as a ""Turn based RPG"", but that too doesn't quite fit the bill. ""Sandbox""? no, not that either . Now I'm not saying that all of these traits and aspects are not included in NEO Scav, but each one does not define it well alone. The only thing I can think to do is paste all of them together (using medium string and a sharp edge) making it a Sandbox Survival Turn Based Role Playing Game (a SSTBRPG), now all we have to do is throw a H in front of that acronym for ""Hardcore"" and its shaping up to be a decent genre description, a bit of a mouthful though.      Not that (H)SSTBRPG's really exist (that I know of aside from a few indie titles scattered about the web) as a gaming norm, just kind of an acronym I made up on the spot, but the idea isn't a norm. Why is that? The only answer I could think of was that it is too much of a risk for large companies to make a game like that, one that would truly test a person's ability to survive in the wilderness  and deal with day to day threats like hunger, thirst, sleep, and warmth. I don't know if that's true or not, and looking at the amount of people who play games like NEO Scav, I can't see how that theory could hold together. I'm getting off track. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     NEO Scavenger is created (to my knowledge) by one person, Daniel Fedor. That alone when looking at the game is an amazing feat, especially considering how in depth NEO Scav truly is. Whether its crafting or just scavenging there is plenty of things for you to make or find.      The first day is the hardest, you wake up in an odd place with something scratching at the door (I won't go into detail as, well... Spoilers) , but you immediately have to escape. Using skills to selected at the start, a set of four with the ability to add more at the cost of negative traits, you venture out into the world.      You walk out into the sunlight of the world, its dawn,  its cold, and you don't have much in the way of clothing save a hospital gown. Immediately you're struck with a problem, find clothing or die of hypothermia. This is what kills most new survivors, and it took me a while (and a few protagonist deaths) to find my rhythm. This first day is brutal, but once it's over, a whole new day begins.       Now you're warm-ish, but the previous days exertions have caused you to grow quite thirsty. You see that there's a water source nearby, a river, but you don't know if the water is safe to drink. You have no method of checking if its ""infected"" or if its ""sterile"" but  you don't have the luxury of waiting. This is something that kills off a lot of the players that make it past day one. Let's say you were lucky, and now you're no longer thirsty, and you didn't manage to acquire some form of disease or infection, now what.      By this time you're starting to feel a little hungry, while scavenging you manage to find a couple of mushrooms and some berries, but without the proper skill (which you can choose at the start of the game, it's called ""Botany"") you can't tell if these are poisonous or not.  You pick them up all the same, if it comes to it, you might have to take the chance.      But whats that on the horizon, it looks like another scavenger is none too pleased with you stealing his supplies (or for any myriad of other reasons), and now he wants you dead. You can't escape, you have to fight. You pick up a large nearby stick and prepare to defend yourself.      The fight is frantic, messy, and results in both parties getting pretty bruised up, but eventually the other scavenger retreats from battle, leaving you to treat your wounds...     The point is that NEO Scavenger is relentless in its urge to kill you, but it's not like you can't combat this. You can cover you're tracks so that enemies have a harder time following you, you can hide in urban areas and ambush scavengers to steal their stuff, you can apply bandages to your wounds and take pain pills to deal with blood loss and manage the amount of pain your character is in. All the while traveling for some far off goal. And there is SO much more, and even more to be added I'm sure. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------     In short try the demo, it's a pretty accurate but  slimmed down version of how the game plays out, if you like it, buy it... you can't go wrong. The creator is pretty active in the forums, discussing current game bugs and ideas with the community, both here on steam, as well as on his site at Blue Bottle Games.  Take care, good luck surviving, and hopefully this was helpful. P.Kindred XIII "

Its turn based and you control your character, explore, scavange and stuff like that, where every turn it gives you a new situation or just something. The gameplay mechanics with the menu could be better, but it is in early alpha so Im pretty sure it wil get better.

								Neo scavanger Is a awsome game period, Dont let the screen shots or videos fool you this game is great its crazy in depth and the plot is tried and true, the game is so amazing that I could cut down a tree limb and combine it with a tarp I had found to make a lean to, or take a pot and fire to boil my water to make it safe to drink, These are just a small sample of the variety of things you can create, it almost feels like if you can think it you can do it, Very few games other than project zomboid (also an amazing game) seem to be able to give you this sense of depth, The game is played by reading text and moving your character in a grid overworld kinda like final fantasy tactics, I will admit from screenshots I said this game will suck and its not for me....Boy was I wrong just get the demo play it and Im sure you will buy it, This is the only game I have ever played that I killed a man just for his left boot, This game is hard it wants you to die, but each time you do you learn from it and the next time you will go a little farther this style of gameplay is very rewarding do yourself a favor and pick up neo scavanger, In its current early access state I give it a 9/10 amazing.

								With more than 30 hours of gametime, I can happily say that this game is awesome. Only a few games have ever really left me wanting to play a little more, and this is one of them.That being said though, this game is brutal. One minute you are killing Bad Muthas left and right and the next moment your clawed to death by a Dogman, or shot by a high powered rifle. This game never lets you have it easy, and even if you think that you can survive forever, think again. I personally tried to fight the Detroit Megacity Gaurds, it didn't end well. I also took off the bronze talisman, just to see why I had it, that didn't end to well, either.This game is one of the best survival games I've ever played, and I will continue to play this game long into the future.

								This game is genuinely superb. There are many, many ways in which you can approach the simple task you are given - survive, and all of them are satysfying yet challenging. All the traits you get to choose while creating your character are massively useful and impactful and you can only take a few, heavily influencing how you play. What's more, the game is suprisingly fair for a rougelike - i've been killed without any chance at defending or escaping only once, while sleeping in some town ruins (which is obviously not a smart idea as these are heavily contested by looters and scavengers and i should have expected something like that to happen). The combat system is very entertaining and has some neat depth to it, at least when you are fighting on even ground. If you assault a random, starving unarmed guy with a spear there won't be any challenge, but with the same spear you can try to take on mutants, soldiers, and hunting-rifle wielding manhunters if you have the right traits and choose your moves wisely. Or you can lure those guys into some other guys, have them fight, and then move in to scavenge their stuff. Or just run and try to avoid them. Your life often depends on decisions like that, and it's quite brilliant.			"

Warning: This is a mostly text based.This game is amazing. You truly feel lost and scared in this unforgiving world.The story is quite mysterious and completely nonlinear so you could find the end before you even know whats happening.Theres not much music witch fits well with the feeling of loneliness but the sounds for when you move items is nice.The AI is great as well, each type of creature reacts to the player differantly and act even more differant depending on how healthy they are or for humanoid creatures what equipment they have.

								You can, and you will die a hundered different ways. I spent hours just wandering through wilderness, trying to find something to warm myself, then I died because of unfiltered water. Another character was a survivalist, not a computer engineer type like the last one, so this time I had plenty of warmth, clean water(because I found cooking pot), food(human meat), and overall was a pretty badass. Died because of insatiable hunger for human meat. PROSRich and deep game with content gradually incoming from devs, really nice post-apo rpg sim, that is a nice retro in post-apo genre.CONSWell... it's early access, so you know what that means. If you're not fan of post-apo, original Fallout games seemed too complicated and old-fashioned, but Fallout 3 was a nice fps for you... I have bad news for ya. If you however want to support devs, so they can continue with this game, and you don't mind that you're buying half empty bottle(with a hope that it will refill later), go for it. Hours of fun, depth not seen in a long time, overall must have for fans of the genre.			"

								Loving this game at the moment, a refreshing change from the usual RPG / survival / strategy games that are around at the moment.  Good feel to it, nice pixel artwork and really like the text-based element it has.  Challenging at first, but once you get into it you pick up on how to play it without dying within 10 days - even then, I wouldn't take this game lightly, it will find a way to kill your character off!  Good luck out there wastelanders!			"

								A solid good game, the style RPGs used to be, before all that skill-tree stuff. Combat is amazing, blow by blow, no numeral damage, just serious wounds. I found myself bashing a guy's limbs with a big rock until I finally hitted his head and he felt unconsciously to the floor. I then proceeded to smash his face in and steal his corpse.Examples aside, this game is passed on post-apocalyptical world, it is focused on scavenging and exploring, and although I haven't progressed much on the storyline I found the game to be just the kind of hardcore I was looking for.If you are into SURVIVAL, TURN-BASED, SCAVENGING and don't care about graphics, this game is worth checking out!

The menus can be quite clunkly at first, and reading is REQUIRED in order for this game to make sense. Again, must re-enforse the fact that the game has quite clunky controls and can be a pain to play at times. Otherwise fabtastic game, from a lone dev who is putting a lot of work into this!			"

												Pretty much everything there is to say about this game has been said, though I'd like to throw in my two cents as well as address a couple issues I've seen people comment on in some of the reviews. First of all, the game is out of Early Access and is feature complete(to my knowledge), and does have an end-game scenario. It's just not that easy to do. 195 hours in the game and I have yet to ""beat"" it. Ususally for me the story comes second to the survival gameplay. The story is unique and interesting from what I've uncovered(and read about), though some things can take a long time to complete, and usually I'll die before I come close to completing my objective.This brings me to my second point. The game is hard, yes, but it's not as impossible as some people make it out to be. Jumping right in to the game with no prior knowledge, like I did, will be tough. You'll die quite often until you start to make some sense of the mechanics and gameplay. You will also get unlucky at times and be woken from a dead sleep by a creature which can mess you up bad. But, like I said, it's not impossible. You just need to try new skill combinations and ways of going through the world. Taking the strong/tough perks will allow you to wreck NPCs that you come across, but when you're faced with a life or death story scenario, you may not be as well equipped to deal with dangers as you may have thought. At the time of writing this, I've been playing a no-combat-skills build. I've taken Hacking, Medic, Botany, Lockpicking, Eagle Eye, Tracking, Athletic and Electrician, along with Fragile and Insomniac for the extra points. I've been playing this character for three or four real life days now, and I've gone through at least thirty in-game days. Without dying. Playing like this forces you to reconsider everything you've been doing. Before, I'd walk right up to that feral dog and turn it in to a pin cushion with my bow. Now though, I'm fragile and unskilled at any combat. All I have for protection is a war club, which, in my hands, is about as deadly as a shoe. If I even see a feral dog, I'm headed in a new direction. I've also found out that running away  is ♥♥♥♥ing useful! . I may not be able to kill that guy and eat his body, but I'm alive for another day. And I didn't even need his man meat. I've got the botany skill and can just forage around some forests and fill up on berries. In this current game, I've also not used any noise traps when I sleep, because I don't have the room. I get burdened easy, and only carry a couple small backpacks. Still, I have yet to die. You just need to think a little before commiting to an action. Before I try to get some rest, I hide and wait for a few turns to see if anyone's in the area. If no one has wandered into my camp, I sleep. And since I have insomnia, I usually wake up before anything gets too close to me. I know there's a terrible and unfortunate death waiting for me in the future, but until then I'll keep scouring this wasteland, looking for the RFID spoofing software I need in order to advance a story encounter I have yet to complete.This game isn't for everyone, but for me, it's definitely in my top 5. It's easy enough to pick up and play for 30 minutes of down time, or I can spend hours in the game, completely immersed and elated when I find a text file worth nearly $2000 in a laptop that's been sitting in a building for years, and which would have been useless to me were it not for the hacking trait. If you're undecided, just play the demo or watch some videos. There's quite a bit of content missing from the demo, but you'll get the gist of things and be able to make a more informed decision on whether or not this is your type of game. To anyone buying this game, I sincerely hope you like it, as it's like no other game I've played before, and absolutely one of my favorites. Thanks for the amazing game Daniel, and I am looking forward to your next endeavor.			"

								With more than 30 hours of gametime, I can happily say that this game is awesome. Only a few games have ever really left me wanting to play a little more, and this is one of them.That being said though, this game is brutal. One minute you are killing Bad Muthas left and right and the next moment your clawed to death by a Dogman, or shot by a high powered rifle. This game never lets you have it easy, and even if you think that you can survive forever, think again. I personally tried to fight the Detroit Megacity Gaurds, it didn't end well. I also took off the bronze talisman, just to see why I had it, that didn't end to well, either.This game is one of the best survival games I've ever played, and I will continue to play this game long into the future. If you want to buy this game, you should.			"

								Neo scavanger Is a awsome game period, Dont let the screen shots or videos fool you this game is great its crazy in depth and the plot is tried and true, the game is so amazing that I could cut down a tree limb and combine it with a tarp I had found to make a lean to, or take a pot and fire to boil my water to make it safe to drink, These are just a small sample of the variety of things you can create, it almost feels like if you can think it you can do it, Very few games other than project zomboid (also an amazing game) seem to be able to give you this sense of depth, The game is played by reading text and moving your character in a grid overworld kinda like final fantasy tactics, I will admit from screenshots I said this game will suck and its not for me....Boy was I wrong just get the demo play it and Im sure you will buy it, This is the only game I have ever played that I killed a man just for his left boot, This game is hard it wants you to die, but each time you do you learn from it and the next time you will go a little farther this style of gameplay is very rewarding do yourself a favor and pick up neo scavanger, In its current early access state I give it a 9/10 amazing.

								I haven't reviewed anything on Steam yet, but I had to review NEO Scavenger because this game deserves so much praise. It completely caught me by surprise and is a great example of Early Access done right. I paid the $9.99 awhile ago and I felt it was completely worth it, and after the frequent updates and improvements, it definitely continues to be worth the money. While I do think the UI needs to be cleaned up a little and the story could be fleshed out more, NEO Scavenger is still a great game. From the crafting that is more than just there because a ton of games are including it, to the way it draws you in for one more turn, and then another, and then maybe another hour goes by, I couldn't say enough good things. There are some flaws and it isn't for everyone, but check out the demo and support a developer that does Early Access right. I've so far put nearly 30 hours into NEO Scavenger and I'll definitely be adding to that number as time goes on			"

								Everything I want in a game of this style. It has an extremely detailed items/storage system, and the turn-based survival aspects  are executed almost flawlessly. It is an unforgiving game, and takes some getting used to in order to survive more than a day or two! However, once you start to understand how things work, it's a lot of fun to go further and further every time. My only complaints would probably be the crafting menu, which has too limited a space to display all items sometimes, and the seriously OP behavior of Wolf-Man packs and their leaders, which can take more damage than any other NPC I've encountered so far. Other than that though, it's pretty much my favorite survival game that isn't DayZ.			"

												This game is amazingly good. But it is also HARD AS SH**. Never been able to survive longer than 2 weeks. Whether its the dogman ripping me to shreds as soon as I leave the lab, the shot to the gut by some random whack job, or dying of an infection at the DMC, this game is the most realistic post-apocalyptic, textually detailed game I have ever played. I love this game and its realism. I just honestly wish you could save the game and re-load when you die, so that after I spend a week and a half boiling water and selling it, to buy decent gear to go out into the wastes, I can proceed without a random Wolfman coming out of nowhere and ripping me to shreds, having to restart the entire game.

								A fantastic game, a true retro feel. If you are looking for something with graphics this isnt the game. If you are looking to kill a bandit with a sharpend stick to loot him for a boot a crummy tshirt and a quarter full lighter then this is your game. The perma death system makes you take fewer risks (you know, actually trying to survive) The skill system is pretty good, though at the time of this review isnt fully implemented. The only thing i have against this game is if you use a cleaner like CC cleaner it will wipe your saved game. SO keep that in mind, you dont want to wipe your flash cache when playing this one. 9/10, would play again...if i wernt still keeping it in a window while i work.Update 8/30/14 The game has been updated to have more enemies, more items, more story. Every addition is very cool. I've never seen an unfinished game that added things so quickly and so smoothly. They are really on adding content. This is fast becoming one of my favorite games of all time. Best 10 bucks i ever spent.			"

								This game makes time vanish at an alarming rate. Either it's really good, or I keep being abducted by aliens while playing it.Seriously, this is some enthraling sandbox gameplay, right here. The simple, old school graphics allow for a level of complexity you can't get in your Elder Scrolls or your Far Cries.Right now, for example, I'm doing great, except that I've been sloppy about hiding tracks around my camp site, and scumbags are gathering around me. They won't atack, probably because I've killed a couple of them in one on one fights, but they aren't going away, and I don't think I can take them all down if they decide to come at me in a group. I'll probably have to relocate under cover of darkness.Amazing stuff. And it isn't even finshed, yet!			"

								It is not often you find a roguelike where all the tables are even from the start. Where the skill of you, the player, makes all the difference, and not simply how much time you have spent making your character stronger. That won't happen in this game. On top of all of that, and no matter how much gear you find, how good a weapon you have, how sharp your skills have become. There will always be something that can kill you.As day breaks, I spot hiding in the nearby woods, a creature that is both man and beast. To my luck, I find the target unawares, at rest. Creeping in closer, spear in hand, I get in close, so close, hoping that the beast will not notice. The rain works in my favor here, and before the beast has a chance to act, I pull back and plunge my spear deep into the creatures eye socket. Your life, can end just as easily.After the battle, I take out my trusty pocketknife and get to work, pulling the flesh from the bone, and using my skills to keep the pelt in one piece. Trophy in hand, I sling the pelt over my shoulders. Both as proof of my skills in combat, but also, I will not freeze. Not tonight.			"

Early Access Review
								NEO Scavenger now has my full recommendation.This game has some deep tactical roots to it. A turned based rogue-like where you start off in the most startling position of weakness I could possibly imagine. “Scavenger” is the name of the game but this key aspect and function serves as a means to an end, and that end is survival. You wake up in a cryogenic facility with nothing of use but a hospital gown, medical bracelet. You're soon attacked by a supernatural creature, setting the tone for the brutal reality of survival, which seems to be the biggest note of the game. Notice I didn’t mention any shoes or memories. You’re barefoot and it’s autumn. No way to go through life in my humble opinion. I guess there’s a story about finding your identity or finding out what happened to the world.Sounds interesting, right? Like “28 Days Later” meets “DayZ”. I couldn’t tell you, because basically I’ve spent my hours just trying to survive against... get ready for it... Starvation. Food is scarce. I once savored a small packet of crackers for sustenance. I recently died trying to hunt a dangerous creature in what felt like a very realistic and thought out exchange in combat.Hydration. Water is not as scarce, but takes up storage space and the effects of dehydration can onset quickly leaving you weaker to take on the rigors of survival and ultimately lead to death.Hypothermia. It always seems cold and rainy. One play-through I traveled west for 12 hours and died of hypothermia desperately trying to find some degree of shelter or warmth.Brain damage and severe blood loss. Some people seem to be opportunists in this new and horrifying setting, attacking you on sight. You can try to reason with them or beat them to death or submission. Either way combat has to be dealt with or avoided one way or another. There are also inhumane beasts, such as the dogman who(that?) recently severed an artery in my leg, taking a fluke victory in what was described to me as brutal combat. The turned based combat plays out very interestingly, giving you often unique choices based on your surroundings, tools and skill set. In addition to normal attacks with your weaponry you often have different tactical options in a fight, like a trip or a head-butt. Leaving your opponent stunned and vulnerable is a key to winning conflicts and staying healthy. Wounds need attention and in a very animalistic way you need to learn that just because you can best a being in mortal combat it doesn’t necessarily mean he can be your prey.  The spoils of war are all well and good but damn well better be worth the cost of an open wound or wounded limb.Luckily there seems to be a wide array of technology, pharmaceuticals and med-kits to be found in your mysterious surroundings, everything seems to have something more to it. There's a vast world of crafting, trapping and other skills I've only touched the surface of. Hacking with a laptop can be far more effective than hacking with a cleaver.  Storage plays as big of a roll as anything I have mentioned thus far. I really enjoy the vast inventory options and the various challenges that arrive. The tools available to you in moving your life supporting cargo are just as varied. Plastic bags can be used as a light and spacious backpack but they quickly deteriorate under such use, a true backpack can handle much more rigors. Sleds can be used to drag your sleeping bag and other supplies but is outclassed by a modified shopping cart as a vehicle.Light sources can play a big part in safe scavenging, night time or not. Lighters run out of butane though, and flashlights need batteries. You often consume some of your items durability upon use as you scavenge for that rare useful weapon and equally sparse ammunition. There are some hiccups in this surprisingly immersive experience, like a lack of a local leaderboard and tracking or rating of your statistics and progress. The game doesn’t seem to integrate with windows well on start-up, but this is easily fixable in the settings. The aural potential of this game seems unrealized and the atmospheric tune that plays throughout doesn’t do enough for me. The lack of sound just about the only thing holding me back from having a more immersed experience.The slightly crude graphics and the fact that it is a Java game may be off putting to some, but those willing to look past the amateur feel will be rewarded with a view into this game’s deep, brutal, intelligent soul. The sense and reality of a true, terrifying post-apocalyptic survival setting seems fully represented. Made by Blue Bottle Games, which from what I can tell is just one dude, this frisky indie title feels like a true labor of love towards the bleak reality of our impending doom. 8.5/10			"

												Highly recommend this game, it is a great survival game as well as it keeps its self interesting with tons of unique events, a couple of very unique locations which your very actions there can lead to profit, horrific injury or even sudden and terrible death, every action you make counts, no way to boil water? take a risk at drinking unidentified water and see if you die or not, hungry as hell nothing to eat? resort to canniblism to much and you go insane, as well as you'll have a faction hunting you down, get to confident? well a couple of dogmen will fix that! This game is great no two playthroughs are the same, each one presents different struggles for you to power through, or die trying, you may spend many days trying to find a pot or can to boil water with to die from waterborne diseases, you may end up being horrificly injured and try to do your best to survive it and end up barely surviving after weeks of hard work, this game is hard and punishing, it will abliterate you just like a real appocalypse will, definetely recomend this game			"

								First and foremost, do not take my above playtime as my experience, I've bought it on Desura and the Website, and I wanted a third save and to give an additional amount of money to the devs. (Why can't I just give you money?!) Anyhow, this is Neo Scavenger in a nutshell:      Cold. How long has it been since I've been warm. A day? Ten? I don't know any more, time seems so eternal out here, and I've lost track of it. I don't know anything but pain, fear, and cold these days... and hunger. I tried building a campfire a while back, and that damned Bandit left me bleeding and scarred. I went looking for some medical equipment later that night, an an apartment collapsed on me. I'm weak and tired, but I'm too afraid to sleep... But I can afford to close my eyes a bit, right?...     ""Give up all your f***ing gear if you want to live!"" Before I'm even fully aware, I'm staring into the muzzle of a revolver. I panic and begin to scream, and he whacks me across the face with the revolver's butt.     ""What? You f***ing deaf? Hand it all over!"" I'm not deaf, but I'm not stupid either. If I hand over all this gear, I might live a while longer, but I'd still die. Slower and even more painfully than if he shot me. Besides, he might even be bluffing? Before he knows what's happening, I slam a heavy punch into his chest, knocking the wind out of his lungs and freezing him for a moment. Not one to waste, I use that moment. I grab a heavy-looking stone on the ground and begin to pummel him. In the dark, I see nothing but a vague grey shape. I slam the stone into his stomach, and he screams in pain. I pummel him even further, and further... Long after he dies, I'm still hitting him with the stone. My arms are aching and my head is pulsing, but I keep hitting the battered corpse. Finally, I relent. More out of exhaustion and pain rather than any sense of logic.     Then, I sleep. Fitfully and weakly at first, but soon enough, my fatigue catches up to me, and I rest. When I wake up, the full realization of what I'd done caught up to me. The ""bandit"" was a starving emaciated skeletal husk, and his revolver was a rusted abomination that was more likely to explode rather than fire. I begin to suck in a hitching, weak breath as I sob. That could have been me, and it probably would be before long...     It's been a while since I killed that man, but the heavy black weight of it hangs heavily on my shoulders. I hate my own existence, and have long considered suicide... If this isn't hell, then what is it? Just as I begin to slip the bottle of sedatives out of my pocket, I see a man approaching me. I haven't seen another sould in so long... and I feel genuine joy and excitement at the prospect of talking to someone... Maybe even make a friend? I begin to rush towards him, hands in the air to signify my friendliness. Before I know what happens, I am knocked aside the head, and looted.     This is Neo Scavenger, and though your adventure may not last as long, or be as miserly, you will experience the highs and lows of survival. You will wonder: ""Why? Why did it have to end this way?"" And you will face many hard choices.     Do both your practical intellect and your inner masochist a favour, and buy this game. It's well worth it's price.			"

								This game is amazing. Despite it still being developed this game has (and still is) blowing me away. Although It doesn't have a full developed story and they're still developing it it's great. Combat gives you tons of options. The environment is pretty immersive with the day and night cycle and player health maintaining etc. And when you Do get to see other major areas like cities the scenes of people eating and watching performers put a huge smile on my face. Not to mention the potential for it. Shoutout to BlueBottleGames for a great first game.QUICK VERSION-Great Turn Based Combat-Great Graphics that remind you of a modernized 8-bit still (you know what I mean)-Amazing Scenes-A MUST buy for 10$ (or less on sales)			"

												First off i would like to say that at the time of me righting this i have only played about 6 hours.Anyway the first thing about this game is it will take you a while to either survive longer than 2 or three moves. I had a little bit of an advantage as i watched a playthrough. This game is the more realistic pst apocalyptic survival game as you have to look out for everything. Get cut and put a dirty bandage on it? Probaly dead. Fall asleep without a noise trap? Your probally dead.  This game is going to confuse people and it still confuses me. But as i play more and more of this game. i become better and begin to know what to do and how. I really enjoy this game and i thin you will if you put time into it.			"

								Prepare yourself for a brutal game. This is a detailed, post apocolyptic survival game. I've only got 6 hours in it, but I plan to play, and inevitably die, a lot more. There is a goal to work towards, and combined with various encounters, you'll be busy with more than just surviving. Long story short, this is the toughest survival game you'll play in quite some time. I was struck with pangs of remorse as I wailed on a downed bandit, made all the worse by the other feeling... deep within my gut... the joy of finally killing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and looting his corpse!			"

								This game makes time vanish at an alarming rate. Either it's really good, or I keep being abducted by aliens while playing it.Seriously, this is some enthraling sandbox gameplay, right here. The simple, old school graphics allow for a level of complexity you can't get in your Elder Scrolls or your Far Cries.Right now, for example, I'm doing great, except that I've been sloppy about hiding tracks around my camp site, and scumbags are gathering around me. They won't atack, probably because I've killed a couple of them in one on one fights, but they aren't going away, and I don't think I can take them all down if they decide to come at me in a group. I'll probably have to relocate under cover of darkness.Amazing stuff. And it isn't even finshed, yet!			"

Early Access Review
								NEO Scavenger now has my full recommendation.This game has some deep tactical roots to it. A turned based rogue-like where you start off in the most startling position of weakness I could possibly imagine. “Scavenger” is the name of the game but this key aspect and function serves as a means to an end, and that end is survival. You wake up in a cryogenic facility with nothing of use but a hospital gown, medical bracelet. You're soon attacked by a supernatural creature, setting the tone for the brutal reality of survival, which seems to be the biggest note of the game. Notice I didn’t mention any shoes or memories. You’re barefoot and it’s autumn. No way to go through life in my humble opinion. I guess there’s a story about finding your identity or finding out what happened to the world.Sounds interesting, right? Like “28 Days Later” meets “DayZ”. I couldn’t tell you, because basically I’ve spent my hours just trying to survive against... get ready for it... Starvation. Food is scarce. I once savored a small packet of crackers for sustenance. I recently died trying to hunt a dangerous creature in what felt like a very realistic and thought out exchange in combat.Hydration. Water is not as scarce, but takes up storage space and the effects of dehydration can onset quickly leaving you weaker to take on the rigors of survival and ultimately lead to death.Hypothermia. It always seems cold and rainy. One play-through I traveled west for 12 hours and died of hypothermia desperately trying to find some degree of shelter or warmth.Brain damage and severe blood loss. Some people seem to be opportunists in this new and horrifying setting, attacking you on sight. You can try to reason with them or beat them to death or submission. Either way combat has to be dealt with or avoided one way or another. There are also inhumane beasts, such as the dogman who(that?) recently severed an artery in my leg, taking a fluke victory in what was described to me as brutal combat. The turned based combat plays out very interestingly, giving you often unique choices based on your surroundings, tools and skill set. In addition to normal attacks with your weaponry you often have different tactical options in a fight, like a trip or a head-butt. Leaving your opponent stunned and vulnerable is a key to winning conflicts and staying healthy. Wounds need attention and in a very animalistic way you need to learn that just because you can best a being in mortal combat it doesn’t necessarily mean he can be your prey.  The spoils of war are all well and good but damn well better be worth the cost of an open wound or wounded limb.Luckily there seems to be a wide array of technology, pharmaceuticals and med-kits to be found in your mysterious surroundings, everything seems to have something more to it. There's a vast world of crafting, trapping and other skills I've only touched the surface of. Hacking with a laptop can be far more effective than hacking with a cleaver.  Storage plays as big of a roll as anything I have mentioned thus far. I really enjoy the vast inventory options and the various challenges that arrive. The tools available to you in moving your life supporting cargo are just as varied. Plastic bags can be used as a light and spacious backpack but they quickly deteriorate under such use, a true backpack can handle much more rigors. Sleds can be used to drag your sleeping bag and other supplies but is outclassed by a modified shopping cart as a vehicle.Light sources can play a big part in safe scavenging, night time or not. Lighters run out of butane though, and flashlights need batteries. You often consume some of your items durability upon use as you scavenge for that rare useful weapon and equally sparse ammunition. There are some hiccups in this surprisingly immersive experience, like a lack of a local leaderboard and tracking or rating of your statistics and progress. The game doesn’t seem to integrate with windows well on start-up, but this is easily fixable in the settings. The aural potential of this game seems unrealized and the atmospheric tune that plays throughout doesn’t do enough for me. The lack of sound just about the only thing holding me back from having a more immersed experience.The slightly crude graphics and the fact that it is a Java game may be off putting to some, but those willing to look past the amateur feel will be rewarded with a view into this game’s deep, brutal, intelligent soul. The sense and reality of a true, terrifying post-apocalyptic survival setting seems fully represented. Made by Blue Bottle Games, which from what I can tell is just one dude, this frisky indie title feels like a true labor of love towards the bleak reality of our impending doom. 8.5/10			"

								If you like hardcore RPGs and value gameplay over graphics, you should definitely give this a try. Very fun and extremely addictive. It reminds me quite a bit of the original Fallout games, although it plays quite differently. There are some bugs and balance issues, but for an under-dev game that's apparently being created by one man, it's fairly polished.NOTE: Try to demo to get a feeling for the gameplay, but note that the demo lacks a lot of features and has a number of bugs that are already fixed in the paid early release version.

												Let me start off by saying i love this game! OK now that is out of the way let me say a couple of things this game is not your friend at all nor will it ever want to be try to be or anything the whole game is rng in a nutshell. my best example i was playing and i drank unpurified water well i didnt think it bothered me that badly well my character contracts Cholera after i last that ordeal i end up gaining another sickness after that and die very shortly after ending my run in which i had my weapon my backpack my gun and my way around the wastes all gone because i learned that dirty water will screw you in the long run. I would not suggest this game if your the kind of person who like to know whats going to happen and when it will happen this game will spit in your face and make you think differently about your a approach to it each time.

												This is the most realistic survival game I have ever played, and due to the current stance of the industry I doubt anything will beat it for a very long time.The game mechanics are ridiculously realistic. Seriously, sometimes I die within the first 2 minutes of playing. Each and every single move you take could be your last, and this is not a game that becomes easy over time as you learn how to play it. This is a true survival game unlike any other.The mechanics are very balanced, and you have to do many things to survive. The crafting and inventory system is very nice, as it allows for a lot of customisation. Do not let the graphics of this game fool you, as the gameplay is what matters here. I personally really like the art style and retro feel to the game anyway.If you really want to know how much time the developer spent on making this game, here is an example: If you try and put minature items such as pebbles into a shopping cart, it won't work because in real life the pebbles would fall through the wire framing of the cart. Despite this being a very minor and insignificant example, it goes to show you how much the developer cares about the game.			"

								You can, and you will die a hundered different ways. I spent hours just wandering through wilderness, trying to find something to warm myself, then I died because of unfiltered water. Another character was a survivalist, not a computer engineer type like the last one, so this time I had plenty of warmth, clean water(because I found cooking pot), food(human meat), and overall was a pretty badass. Died because of insatiable hunger for human meat. PROSRich and deep game with content gradually incoming from devs, really nice post-apo rpg sim, that is a nice retro in post-apo genre.CONSWell... it's early access, so you know what that means. If you're not fan of post-apo, original Fallout games seemed too complicated and old-fashioned, but Fallout 3 was a nice fps for you... I have bad news for ya. If you however want to support devs, so they can continue with this game, and you don't mind that you're buying half empty bottle(with a hope that it will refill later), go for it. Hours of fun, depth not seen in a long time, overall must have for fans of the genre.			"

								A solid good game, the style RPGs used to be, before all that skill-tree stuff. Combat is amazing, blow by blow, no numeral damage, just serious wounds. I found myself bashing a guy's limbs with a big rock until I finally hitted his head and he felt unconsciously to the floor. I then proceeded to smash his face in and steal his corpse.Examples aside, this game is passed on post-apocalyptical world, it is focused on scavenging and exploring, and although I haven't progressed much on the storyline I found the game to be just the kind of hardcore I was looking for.If you are into SURVIVAL, TURN-BASED, SCAVENGING and don't care about graphics, this game is worth checking out!

								This is to classic Fallout what FTL is to those old school space exploration games: it captures the spirit of exploration and survival, and trims it down to a bare bones, super replayable text/simple graphics adventure. While I wish there was more plot to explore, it is early access and more of that is probably coming. The mechanics are fun to play with, the music goes a really long way to selling the mood, and the minimalist visual and mechanic design makes you rely on your imagination in such a manner that, if you're willing to go with it, has a greater sense of place and verisimilitude than the most fancy of graphical productions, (not unlike reading a book). The general lack of plot means I won't be playing as long as classic Fallouts and whatnot, but what time I have spent with this has been super enjoyable. Give it a shot.			"

Early Access Review
								This game intrigued me the minute I saw it.  I would always play Zork in a huddle with friends, but I was always the only one to beat it.  This led me to be fully engrossed in text based games for years to come.  NEO Scavenger takes text heavy elements that remind me of Zork.  These come into play during the small, but quite enjoyable narrative that the player builds into their game.  The exploration and post-apocalyptic atmosphere also brought back memories of Fallout, but much more serious.  This is by no means a bad thing though because players want a very realistic experience, full of imagery, when playing a text heavy game.  This realism is also extremely prevalent during combat with so many options to choose from depending on skills, gear, etc.  However skills and gear can also heavily limit combat.  This helps the player get a feeling for their character better when role-playing a smart, but incredibly weak character.  This game gets a 9/10 from me because even though it's in my list of personal favorites, it has some faults that limit the game.  These are noticeable if too many mistakes are made on a run, lack of devotion causing boredom, or the always prevalent difficulty curve of rogue-likes.  However, I would recommend this to anyone, regardless of these minor issues, due to the shear number of appealing qualities this game holds that a vast majority of gamers, looking for a new flavored splash of adventure in their games, can enjoy.

One minute you're riding high, cart full of goods and a shot gun with *at least* three shells, next thing you know someone hit you in the head with a spear and you're bleeding out.It really makes you think twice about how you're going to play out each encounter, and there are real consquences for bad decisions.

								I stumbled across this game while searching through for survival games. I took a look at the screenshots, and wasn't drawn to this game at all, however I saw there was a demo, and so decided to give it a go. To my surprise, I loved it almost instantly. It's different, something unexpected in this day and age of games. After playing the demo for 20 minutes I knew I wanted to buy it, and so I did. It's a very reasonable price, in my eyes, for what you get in the game, I could easily spend hours on this game at once. The main challenge? Surviving for longer than you did the time before. The map is sort of half randomised, the main places of interest always in the same place, but forests, hills, towns, all completely random, so there's always something slightly different at the start of the game.Yes it's in early access, and maybe there'll be some more added to the storyline, maybe some more items, but for me it feels almost finished already, all full package, and I would totally reccommend at least trying the demo for this game. Give it a chance, even if you think you won't like it.			"

								This game is unlike any I have played in the last two decades. I recommend it to anyone who wants a turn-based hex RPG. Set in a post-apocolyptic Lovecraftian Michigan, your character emerges from a crygenic vat to step into a race against time. You can die from dehydration, starvation, disease  and hypothermia, in addition to wounds inflicted by the various denizens surrounding the Motor City's wastelands. This hard setting is further amplified by the decision not to include a leveling system. Each time you play, you learn more about the game mechanics and possibilities. You can augment your character with four of a dozen advantages, as well as about six disadvantages. Thes combination of these influence your play style, as some opportunities only present themselves to those with a given trait. For those who love to play first-person shooter ""RPG"" as murder hobos, this is not the game for you. It is more reminiscent of games from the late 1980s and early 1990s in that it tells its story in a piecemeal fashion with only one Rouge-like save option. While you can engage in combat, you will frequently die. Stealth, scavanging and crafting reveal much more of the story, and further contribute to the desperation as you try to unravel not only how you came to be cycled out of the cryogenics tank, but also what happened to create this near-future landscape. Expect to die a lot. And enjoy it.			"

I formyself however can absolutley recommend this game with no doubts.			"

								That game is now in my favorite games ever played.It's one of those rare games that you get a feeling of accomplishment when you get some valuable loot and manage to keep it for a long period of time. Even if you die and have to start back from the cryo lab and the beginning is always the same, it's really easy to have a completly different experience while you play. You will never encounter the same enemy during your first travel to one place and you will really need luck to survive some obstacles (for example, someone steal all your stuff while you sleep, including your clothes. The amount luck you'll need to survive that is really really big).You know that you've progressed in this game when you look back at the main event that happened during your journey. From when you left that cryo lab with only a hospital gown with you and when you just killed 5 dogman with your rifle and your compound bow.Speaking of combat, this is one of the games where you feel more cruel when you kill someone than in a FPS game, and you dont even see it happen! It's just click and hope to read something that is good for you! Even if you are not reading a book each time you use an attack, you'll feel very cruel when you'll read that he died by lung bleeding, so you basically caused him to drown in his own blood.Anyway, go buy this game now! Its really worth it!15/10 "

												This game is great!  Paid for itself the first day.  Ultimate replayability, the crafting system is excellent, no lack of challenge and great stories.  I feel like this should be the alpha version of this game as there is soooo much potential here.  Stirke a deal with sid meyer's if you can, but either way this game needs to be much bigger and available everywhere. Needs more spawn locations, add animated battle sequences (though I wouldn't mess too much with the battle system you've got), more craftables (this suggestion will never change, you can never have too many craftables), online maps, more gangs, recruit a crew and start your own gang and the obvious one, upgradeable and interchangeable skills.  I realize this game has just recently released and not a moment too soon.  Despite my long list of suggested improvements for future patches/releases, this game is a solid WIN!  (though I did manage to sneak past most of the story line and beat the game by wandering to the north, so you might want to address that too).  I highly recommend to everyone who enjoys turn-base, post-apocalyptic and/or crafting survival, styles. I would buy it as a phone app too.  Keep up the good work guys and gals!  and never forget about us mac gamers.  We know we're a pain to accomodate, but we need the mac for work (most of us) and I lose out on money to sacrifice disk space to run games, but that's our level of dedication.			"

												EDIT. 1,626.7 Hours. 'nuff said?51 hours so far and still going strong, at 6.99GPB it's great value for money. Very close to the finished product but even in early access this game is very engaging and addictive. Can't wait for it to get polished off. The Dev seems like a great guy and an enthusiast so I imagine even when it's ready for a full release content will be continually added. It's a 9/10 in early access, I can only imagine the finished game will be 10/10.EDITNow released, and it is a 10/10The hours you will spend enjoying this game are well worth the slightly higher price tag.I'm still playing it even now.

												A more realistic/hardcore approach of survival game, where finding cloths to keep you from dying in cold weather is kind of a challenge.Good1. No infodumping at start, as you explore more locations/nps, you are more into the story.2. Open world, all you the instruction you get is 'oh there is light there (in a wasteland), let's go there then'. Yet you can choose your own path and not go else where instead.Neutral1. No hand holding, again, you don't get any instruction. But you will die a lot at start.Meh1. Control, instead of instantly preforming the action as you click, you need to pick options from the left panel to right then confirm. (you can Tips1.

												a fantastic and thoroughly challenging adventure game/exploration RPG hybrid unlike any one thing you'll've experienced before. NEO Scavenger's mechanics are constantly intriguing, but more than anything, it shines with the world it presents and the judicious exposition thereof. while it certainly fits in the post-apocalyptic genre, it's a stranger catastrophe that's befallen this world than the usual nuclear or ecological disasters we see; the rules of the universe seem to be in drift. setting is dripped out in tantalizing paragraphs fished up out of scraps of newspapers from before and during whatever disaster it was that set things askew. the frustrations of a challenging narrative roguelike make things that much more intense: unlike a Stone Soup or a Binding of Isaac that can more or less be set aside at any point, NEO Scavenger demands the exploration of its mysteries, keeping the player coming back in the face of annihilation because of the raw power of the strangeness of the world that it depicts.highly recommended.

												Note: I bought and played mostly on the GOG version of the game, hence why I have less than 2 hours in Steam. I probably logged over 100 hours.Anyways...What this game does right is giving you lots of options when it comes to survival. Too often survival games feel limited, like things you should be able to do easily in a real life situation just aren't available in game. A couple examples that come to mind:- Need to boil something but don't have a cooking pot? Use a tin can!- Need to make fire but don't have a lighter? Rub two sticks together or use sunlight and a piece of glass!- Need a container to carry items but don't have a backpack? Use a plastic shopping bag!- Need bandages? Rip clothes, get rags. Need clean bandages? Boil rags.- Need string? Rip rags.Nice features include:- 'Building' your camp: pick an abandoned building with the appliances you need, place traps, leave a sleeping bag... Not a whole lot of options but you do feel like you have your own personal secure spot you can come back to.- An engaging storyline that makes you want to find out about what happened to the world and yourself. An interesting lore as well.- Lots of crafting options to get the stuff you need to survive.- Skills that give you special abilities- Pretty good learning curve: you'll have to keep trying at first until you learn the basics. Then you'll manage to survive fairly well, and you'll still have many more things to learn and discover. There's lots of stuff you'll have to figure out on your own (or you can use the wiki).- Overall, enough content to keep you engaged for many hours.- Low hardware requirements. Will probably run on that $200 laptop you bought to take notes in class (check the specs to be sure though).Cons:- The game is text-based with a graphical interface. Nothing is animated, few things are drawn, most is just described through text. The combat system especially takes some getting used too as well. It's very playable and some people like that style, but for some people it's a deal-breaker. So be warned.- Only one save/permadeath (although you can easily circumvent that).- Not being able to pick all skills can make the game feel limited, forcing you to play again to explore other things (you can mod the game to get all skills though).- The randomness can be harsh sometimes and force you to restart many times before you'll get lucky, have a good start and actually get somewhere.- Many random encounters don't have a ""good"" resolution to them, sometimes making you feel like the game just ties your hands excessively and won't let you try hard enough, or making you feel like your skills are useless. Some encounters can actually punish you severely, with no way for you to predict that your decisions will lead to a really bad outcome. This is in deep contrast with the rest of the game where you have so many options to accomplish what you want to do.Overall I recommend it to people who enjoy the survival genre, have the patience to fail, learn and try again repeatedly, and who can overlook the game sometimes throwing you in tough situations without you being able to do anything about it. People who aren't so hardcore can just mod the game a bit to make it easier and can circumvent the one save/permadeath feature.			"

								NEO Scavenger is a rogue-like survival game that was originally made in Flash.You control a character with amnesia or a version of memory loss, it is your job to make sure you survive in the vast post-apocalyptic landscape filled with mutants and raiders. The game involves turn-based combat and crafting which both give the game that unique gameplay style that makes it stand out amongst other titles. (May not sound like it, but it really is different)The game is hard, I really do mean hard. The rogue-like genre means that when you die or lose in game you will need to restart from the beginning, it also means that each map is procedurally generated and so there will never be the same items or NPC's in a single location. With the difficulty aside the game is really fun with a lot of replayability, there is no real storyline yet but it will be soon implemented according to the dev.At the time of writing this review it is still in the beta stage of development and also in Early Access, from what I have seen and played it is one of the few Early Access games that haven't disappointed me.

This game may not be deep enough to provide more than 30 hours of play, but it is well worth the price and it is certainly one of the most memorable experiences I've had with a survival game. The permadeath can be cirumvented for those who don't find that to be their niche, but regardless of how you play, you will truly feel like an inhabitant of the wasteland. Only STALKER has given this vibe up until now, great game, totally recommend it.			"

								Neo Scavenger.Where to begin...A game set in a post apocalyptic wasteland where everything is out to kill you however unlike most apocalyptic games it is set in the pen/paper style of dungeons and dragons.In addition it is by far one of the most realistic survival games out there including dirty water,medical illnesses and poisoned food.If you like hardcore games, apocalyptic games and other along those lines this is the game for you and if it isn't then at least check out the demo!!!

								Really great game. VERY addictive, so if you don't have much time to play games this may not be for you. Even in early access this game is very polished and I have yet to encounter a single bug. The choices you make during character creation significantly impact the way you play, and the threat of death from a variety of sources is omnipresent. Although the game is fairly complex, it's also pretty easy to get into because everything works as one would expect it to. For instance, I didn't need a guide or anything to figure out how to craft a campfire on my first attempt. That's not to say this game is easy, far from it: you are pretty much guaranteed to die a few times pretty quickly until you get the hang of things, but deaths in this game don't feel cheap or frustrating and I've never had a death that I didn't learn something from. Pretty much everything in this game is solid; the only thing I could say I want is more content because I have so loved what I have experienced that I want more.			"

								Very engrossing survival game where it actually feels like you struggle to survive. You have to watch what you eat and drink, make sure you’re clothed properly, and as the title suggest, scavenge the world for supplies and materials. Every time you play it's different, and it can come down to skill and some luck. There are interesting skills that provide you with a variety of crafting options that may otherwise be unavailable, or perks such as the ability to find more loot, get better information on your medical state, or craft certain items. Pretty good story (although I haven't gotten very far because I die a lot :D) Highly recommend to anyone who is into more hardcore survival games. The interface seemed strange at first, but after a few tries the combat and exploration became very engrossing, which I was not expecting from the screenshots. Highly recommended!			"

												I strongly recommend playing this game. Despite the lack of luscious graphics, the imagry you create in your head while playing NEO Scavenger will stay with you for a long time. Once your character dies (which will happen many many times) you will have to start over, but it will only make you more invested in the wellbeing of your next incarnation. There is a compelling story, but it's something you will have to pry out of it over several playthroughs to get some kind of coherence to it all.			"

												Few games manage to create an atmosphere that's as creepy and demoralizingly nerve-racking as Neo-Scavenger. This is a scary game at bottom, but not ""thrill-horror""; things don't jump out at you. No, it has that horror of, ""Oh god... I know what's coming for me... I can see it a few miles off in the distance... and I can't do anything about it... I might as well keep pushing along and hope I can hide when it catches up."" That kind of horror.The music does a great job of adding to this atmosphere as well. Good music is hard to come by in games these days. Usually you find bland formless soundtracks, or stuff that just ""gets the job done"", but in Neo-Scavenger the music is an essential part of the experience.This is a very good adventure game with unique gameplay and a very original setting.

												This game is amazingly good. But it is also HARD AS SH**. Never been able to survive longer than 2 weeks. Whether its the dogman ripping me to shreds as soon as I leave the lab, the shot to the gut by some random whack job, or dying of an infection at the DMC, this game is the most realistic post-apocalyptic, textually detailed game I have ever played. I love this game and its realism. I just honestly wish you could save the game and re-load when you die, so that after I spend a week and a half boiling water and selling it, to buy decent gear to go out into the wastes, I can proceed without a random Wolfman coming out of nowhere and ripping me to shreds, having to restart the entire game.

								I have spent years looking for a true survivor game, one that didn't have a core around zombies or a nuclear wasteland, and starting out with nothing but basic cloths and skills. You have to scavenge, craft, and use your wits to survive. There has only been one game that has ever done it right, and this is it Neo Scavenger.Neo, is and has been my favorite indie game for the last several years, it's difficulty is brutal but not unfairly so, you need to think and use your skills to survive, as a single fight you were sure to win, could end in a second as your attacker trips you and kick your head in. This is not a game around fighting to live, it's a game about making the right choice at that moment just to live another day. Even if you die, you want to jump right back in, so pick up a copy today. No really, right now, this game is worth every penny of $10, and guess what? It's not even done yet. This game has my 100% backing and support.Look forward to:Amazing atmosphereCrafting is expansive and rewardingYour skills will define how you will surviveendless hours of addicting and amazing gameplayDifficult until you get used to how things works in this world.

								Now I can't say much about the end game bits (If there even is an End game this game seems to last forever) but what I can say about this new update today, is it is WHOLEFULY welcomed. This update makes it so much better, gives a better balance to the beginning skills and some thing alittle bit less noticable is the beginning area is now dotted with more cities and towns which really increase your chances of finding some cloths or a backpack which are damnedfully welcomed. Now these changes do make the game slightly easier but hell this was probably the hardest game I own in my library. Now it's only the hardest game I own still. Lemme say how hard this bloody game is, it's harder than probably all the Darksoul bosses put in to one fight. I mean the environment will kill you, if a Bad Motha doesn't beat your brains out while you sleep, or the infamous shadow that just makes you explode basically. Even for a early access game I must be honest I feel like I'm getting a full game that is complete. I rarely find bugs, or any imbalaces. The Dev does a AAA job of keeping up with the community and the game. I've had a few early access games and by far this Dev really takes care of this game, like all devs should. So if you're a fan of Hexagon RPG, Survival, Mystery, Action, Adventure, Strategy, Turnbased Fun... or even one of those applies to you, I'd highly recommend getting this game. For $10 you honestly cannot go wrong with this game. 10/10 Would get stoned to death again.			"

												The game does do a post-apoplectic where its a struggle to gather things to survive. It seems a little lacking in depth as some things are binary yes/no coded like if you don't take the melee skill at the start you will never make better spears and by never I mean never because as far as I know you will never get new skills. The combat system is well done. Given the time and money budget I think the game does well for where it sits in the market. I did overall prefer going to historical based Unreal World (not yet on steam).  Neo Scavenger is light enough on drive space I still have it on somewhere and can poke at it from time to time.			"

Early Access Review
								(Disclaimer: English is not my native language, expect some typos and grammar errors.)Oh my.... Where do I start?I came to find this game thanks to ''James Recommends'' from Extra Credits. So I knew that, based on his review, this game was going to be good. But... when I played it, I realized that my expectatives of ''Good'' were an utter underestimation. The game wasn't ''Good'', it was ''DAMN EPIC!!''.For a game with less than 100MB of size, this game stands WAAAAAY HIGHER than many Million Dollars AAA titles when it comes to survival; not even Fallout:New Vegas or State of Decay can hold a candle to NS when it comes to TRUE SURVIVAL. Which, when combined with Rogue-like makes for a WHOLE NEW GAME every time you play it; one in which you can never know if you'll succeed or fail until either of them shows up (Like when I found the Crowbar, some Binoculars and a Sauce Pan on the first town and I thought I was winning, only to freeze to death because I never found any shoes or clothes).Unlike in those games where you charge into a group of enemies with just a knife and an angry roar, knowing that if you die, you can just hit the Load Save button, in this game, you gotta think out real carefully each of your moves. Just as you would do if you were in the player's shoes (or bare feet). This makes the game feel extremely real and complex. ''Do you sneak up on that scavenger to kill him while he's asleep to steal his shoes and his gun? You already know that almost every gun you see lacks ammo, but what if this one's loaded? What if you trip on something and wake him up? You could end up losing all you've gathered so far, and there's a high chance you won't encounter most of that stuff again.''That's the feeling you get. And that's not something I've been able to feel with any AAA titles.Just a warning, tho; be prepared to die a thousand times, even right after the start. More than once I stepped into the first area just to be torn to shreds by a Feral Dog.My only critics to this game are the following:-Crafting Instructions are just too vague.The crafting system's utterly complex, but the instructions and recipes are even worse. You can't just figure out what do they say or what do they require until you go read the wiki. Perhaps if the items had some sort of Status Screen that told you what properties do they have, it'd be much easier to do this, as just figuring it out can take THOUSANDS of tries.-The Full Map is too hard to understand.At simple glance it looks just like a 300% Zoom on a SNES-era Sprite. You can't even tell what's what and even those places that are marked, it's hard to make out WHERE is the mark, as all you see is a big word. (Dunno if the iSlab or Smarphone's GPS Apps make it look better. Never gotten any of those.). I know this must be hard to do with a randomized map, but right now, there's just no real purpose to use the Full Map other than locating the Glow.-The Full Bottles' colors are confusing.Whiskey are orange-colored when full of whiskey, but also when full of water. Same goes for the Corn-a-Colas which are yellow. This can lead to a lot of confusion at the time of picking up stuff or even drinking. More than once I've been carrying around whiskey bottles filled with both water and whiskey and I've accidentaly drank Whiskey because I thought it was water and got drunk, which often led to death. This issue can be easily fixed with a couple palette swaps, so I hope it's fixed by the time the game leaves Early Access.-MOAR STUFF!No, seriously, this game needs more stuff, it's already cool enough as it is, but it could be even cooler. The current Item Pool is just too small for such a neigh-infinite world of random possiblities, so it's a bit sad that, once you manage to get some clothes and shoes to stay alive, they're almost always THE SAME. (Your shoes, the Hoodie, three shirts, some Cargo Pants and a Backpack if you're lucky are what you always end up wearing.). A game this big should have at least twelve variants of every piece of cloth or shoes.Aside from those, I have no other complains. This game has the markings of an Indie Masterpiece, and so far, it hasn't let me down. So I hope it has become even more of a Masterpiece by the time it leaves Early Access.			"

Obviously, this raises a big flag about the difficulty of the game. I enjoy realism and brutal challenge in games though, so I investigated and tried the demo on their website. I loved it. It's basically a classic rogue-like, but takes place in post-apocalyptic michigan.I've died from the coldI've died from infectionI've died from lootersI've died from thirstI've only played for a few hours and already chalked up an impressive range of tragic ends.

								A nice premise - old style hex adventure, but with the usual apocalyse scenario.Its far from easy, for example anyone thinking of rushing headlong against mobs the moment you start should think again or you will die, and it will happen often. Sneak around scavenging for clothing, weapons... craft those bits of junk into something useable. Then go out again - you'll still get killed, but perhaps less often. This is a game of learning and trial & error. You will learn as you die. And you will learn as you survive. Its something of a slow burner. You WILL come back to it after a period of frustration. It'll sit there somewhere in your mind, suggesting you have another go - maybe this time...Permadeath has to be in the game or would essentially ruin the story, and essentially this is the driving force - this game can be replayed with different information based on your skillset - perhaps some things that would be hidden would be revealed.I feel some things that need improving - crafting for example is good, but would be best if it remembered every combination you'd come up with from previous games (rather like the old son of in the old rogue type games. This has some previous recipes but not many, and trying to remember them all yourself is absurd.Also something that (I think) needs changing to a degree is the way loot is calculated - many times you can obtain a hoard from scavenging with almost no chance to gain anything, but then you can repeatedly find nothing when you have a good chance. Certain skills improve or reduce this, but I think too much in some cases.Basically here is a potentially good game, which needs many more refinements before it can really be considered complete.I enjoy this sort of game, but I really wonder if I'm actually anything better than totally rubbish at them. The fact is that despite any faults - any time you have what you deem to be a completely unfair death or when you were just starting to do well for once then along comes... a big nasty monster... at least you have the knowledge of what doesnt work next time, or a different skill to pick - maybe you'll endure the early multitude of deaths and finish the game - perhaps I really am rubbish at it, maybe it (the game) needs balancing, or maybe it always will be just a tad too hard.In conclusion:I'd play it more if I didnt die as often, if I got to see slightly more of the story.All too often you go through the initial stages then die in a low level battle. Perhaps if you were just left sometimes with your stuff robbed - at least you had a little chance...7/10 (with potential to be 9/10)**SPOILER ALERT**Leave the talisman alone.			"

								This game is a bit of a hard sell at first. The user interface is not exactly intuitive, and the graphics are nice but a bit retro.If you overcome these initial scepticisms though, what you'll find is a game that is a mixture of ""A dark room"" (minus the initial set-up phase), ""Minecraft"" (minus the blocky 3d graphics) and any Rougelike (so expect to die frequently).The basic setup is always the same: you wake up in some kind of cryo-lab, and the world outside has turned into a post-apocalyptic dystopia similar to ""The Walking Dead"" or ""28 Days Later"".You have to find out about your own past and uncover the secret of what happened to the world.You walk around the landscape on hex-grids, scavenging the woods or the remains of long-gone cities for clothes, food, water and weapons, while avoiding (at least initially) other NPCs or animals, most of which want to see you dead. You can craft things together with recipes you find scattered around randomly, and from time to time you find pieces of newspapers which tell you a bit about what has happened.The environment is highly dynamic, you have different weather patterns which impact your sight (when you find a scope or binoculars, you can even increase your visible range), and many other scavengers are roaming the area on their own (one nice example: I once found a corpse, looted it and moved his stuff into my hideout, just to find him chopped to bits of meat when I came back the next day... and of course the killer was not far off and killed me a few minutes later...)The story unfolds bit by bit (you have to survive the first night to even get an idea on where you should be moving), and even though I not yet come very far in the story yet (did I mention it is very easy to die in this game?) it is a game I will keep on coming back for ""just one more try...""The only downside (IMHO) is that there is no way of saving the game (except for the ""save&quit"" function), so every death is permanent. And since it's written in Flash there's no easy way of getting the save data out for bakup purposes. But that just shows that it's a real Roguelike at heart...			"

								This game is an awesome mix of survival, scavenger, skyrim, and a turn based combat game. The map is huge, consisting of hexagons which may or may not have item already on the ground, indicated by a box. The looking glass indicated scavenging. The tent indicates your camp sites, and finally the red feet indicate whether someone or you have been there recently.This game is not for the faint of heart. In the beginning, you die frequently and most often by things you wouldn't normally expect. There are NPC who are homicidal and roaming the wilds looking to 'scavenge' off your newly dead body. At first I could only last a few hours, and then I quickly learned the skills necessary to survive longer. My average now is 3 to 5 days. The skill/flaw system can be a little frustrating, and there aren't many of either. It could definitely use more of both to allow a better customization of the characters skills and flaws.On top of that, there is not a way to customize the characters name, gender, or gender-based clothing, at least none that I have discovered. This is truly a survive or die game. Weather, injuries, cold, hunger, thirst, disease, poison, and combat can all kill you. There are also random hex's that have NPC run stores in which you can trade things for money or for other items. The only city I have found as of yet is Detroit.The one resounding issue I have with this game is once you are dead... you are dead. There is no way to save unless you want to dink around in your computers files to rig up some kind save system. While the character is still alive, you can save and come back to your one save, but after death it disappears and you have to start over. I don't see a point in that system, but then again.. I didn't make the game. I think this game has some real potential. It can be frustrating, and seem difficult but failing has helped me learn how to survive longer and pick the skills necessary to survive. There are little things that I think could be corrected like in-game items, or the way in which skills are used. My favorite skills to use would be Trapping, Botany, Medic, Hiding, Tracking, Electrician, Mechanic, and a few others. I'd like to see a sewing skill and possibly the ability to take/train an animal companion. I know if I were trying to survive, I would try to find a dog to help protect my stuff, and me while sleeping.I am concerned though that the developers are making the game significantly harder, so I think the option to choose a skill level from safe - ultimate survivor could be used to allow many different people with varied experiences with games like this could play casually or have a challenge. I like being able to play through a game and then go back through it collecting all of the little dodads and whatnot. In conclusion, I love the basis of this game. I think a few things that need to be changed are the save games, a few additional items in game, a few additional skills and a few changes to how the skills work, a better skill/flaw menu, addition of companions, as well as a difficulty setting.A bug that I think I have found would be while wearing different shoes, or a single shoe still gives the negative effects of being barefoot. However if the two shoes are the same, the effect goes away.Great game, my fiance and I are addicted to it. Keep up the good work!			"

								This game is utterly amazing.  Don't be put off by the mildly ugly graphics.  You will forget them in no time.  What makes this game mind blowing is that it is a rogue-ish game with permadeath, yet it doesn't feel like it.  Sure, the first few times you play you are going to measure your lifespan in hours, but once you get the hang of it you realize that survival is all up to you and completely possible for very long periods of time.  I am writting this after burning a solid 6 hours on this game in a single sitting.  In that entire time I had thrills, upsets, and close calls, but never died.  This is a rougalike game to be sure, but don't let that cause you to run screaming.The survival aspects of this game are absolutely awesome.  You find yourself searching for food and water, planning ahead, and deciding when it is worth a risky encounter.  There is no ""I am a bad guy"" badge on people.  See a fellow stranger in the distance?  It is up to you if you want to use surprise to take out a possible threat, or wave and see if he is friendly and wants to talk.  Do you risk a fire to boil water, knowing it might attract a threat?  When it gets dark, do you stumble blindly looking for a good camp, or take a risky spot in the open and hope for the best?  What do you do when you wake up to find a melon head stolen your weapon and backpack; grab a stick and give chase, stalk them, what?  There are always so many options, and that doesn't even get into the tactical turn based combat!The combat, while simple on its face is complex and interesting.  Planning is rewarded, but so is on the spot craftiness.   The the game never demands a split second decision, so you have time to ponder your move and roll the dice.  It lets you do so many crafty things and it tends to behave as you would expect.  For instance, imagine you come accross some scary looking person who looks like they want to eat you, and have a host of options.  Do you sneak in close and try and stab him with your trust spear, hoping that this game awesome wound system will let you stun and cripple the guy before he realizes you are there?  Do you try and slip away before he sees  you?  Maybe you decide to bluff and at a distance try pointing your rifle (with no bullets in it) at him, trying to scare him off, if he charges anyways, flip that rifle around and show him the butt of it.  You can jump out of concleament and egg him on, hoping in the rush to get  to you he gives you a solid opening to land the first blow.  Perhaps you get out your old butchers cleaver and start the fight by charging him over onto the ground, and hacking him apart before he can get up.  Hey, he might not even a bad guy, you can always just wave from a distance offering friendly chat and see what he does.This game is so unassuming, but it is solildly on my top 5 for 2014, and for the value for the price, it is easily #1.  It says ""early access"", but as far as I can tell, this is a full game.  This game is an absolute gem.  The worst thing about this game is that there are so many things that might scare people off from what is an awesome experience; perm death, ugly graphics, early access, a slightly obscure interface (until you get the hang of it), and a strange theme.  Don't let any of these things scare you off.  This game is amazing!  I can't even imagine what it will be once it is out of early access.  Don't wait for a sale, buy it now.			"

								I've sunk at least 50 hours into this game (I used to play the demo a lot...I was broke!) and I can honestly say that this is one of the best work-in-progress games I have ever played. That's not to say that this game is flawless. The games combat system is designed to be extremely punishing. Therefore adding a risk vs. reward element into most things you can do. However, even when equipped with the best gear, it often comes down to random luck. I've flat out shot people in the head, had them survive, stay concious and then shoot through my helmet and kill me. Other times, I've shot people in the leg and had them die. It honestly feels like I'm playing turn-based Call Of Duty when using guns. The melee system is even worse. It doesn't really matter what weapon you have or what armor you're wearing if you face a dogman (or any other creature for that matter) and attempt to melee it you're screwed.Also, this game being in a post-apocalyptic setting, you have to scavenge for resources (food, water, clothing, armor, etc.). While normally I would be all for this type of mechanic, especially considering the setting, the speed you run through your resources is ridiculous and, at times, can make the game extremely boring as you get stuck in an endless cycle of, find city, scavenge city, use resources found in city, repeat. While this isn't always true, it is for a large majority of the time. However, the story elements that are slowly being implemented are making this game much more dynamic and the resource system is becoming less and less of an issue.Where this game shines and puts it head and shoulders about the competition is its realism. Most games shy away from the possibilities of what a post-apocalyptic society could become, but not NEO Scavenger. From the arena, to the gated city of Detroit, this game feels extremely realistic in its setting, something many other games can't claim.If this game was released today, I'd give it a 6/10. But for an early access game, easily a 8/10.			"

High replay value with the options to customize your traits, and randomization of maps, and good events, crafting, and locations. I also like the fact the game is kind of hardcore...it makes sense if you're trying to survive.Just a few notes on the game1. The game has a high learning curve. But don't worry it can be mastered2. You will die...I think I died from hypothermia in 5 turns one game3. You will die againI would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a challenge and the survivalist genre "

												The game does do a post-apoplectic where its a struggle to gather things to survive. It seems a little lacking in depth as some things are binary yes/no coded like if you don't take the melee skill at the start you will never make better spears and by never I mean never because as far as I know you will never get new skills. The combat system is well done. Given the time and money budget I think the game does well for where it sits in the market. I did overall prefer going to historical based Unreal World (not yet on steam).  Neo Scavenger is light enough on drive space I still have it on somewhere and can poke at it from time to time.			"

Still amazes me that a small team like this can beat a game with a $100 million budget like Infinate.I just hope that they keep up on improving this game and make it into a true classic.

												Yeah it's hardish.. perma death with limited resources and an environment that can kill you easily (hypothermia, stavation, thirst)...all good stuff for an RPG in theory... but ultimately it's needlessly repeative in combat coupled with constant random encounters day and night that will probably kill you, mix with perma death and it makes a frustrating and somewhat boaring game due to so much ""try 'n die"". To give you an idea of the game, I survived a few  days finally and ran into a guy who  I traded the medalion your character has for a rifle (fair trade and no warning about the risk) and apparently  that means I get a MergaWriaththat follows me until it kills me... yeah that sort of thing in a game is♥♥♥♥♥♥poor design and serves no purpose other than the kill player so they keep the medallion until the end game. But without a wiki to tell I should not have traded it, I would not know this until the second or third time I got the MergaWriath...Is it worth the purchase price ($5) I paid? Well I've played it for a couple of hours so it was cheaper than a movie......But probably less enjoyable, I doubt I'll play it much due to the frustration levels it does bring to the RPG genre.It is aimed at hard core rpg gamers who like to die a lot and often for reasons beyond their control....

								Rocks fall- you die. You might just love it.NEO Scavenger is a (deep breath) post-apocalyptic cyberpunky survival/slightly horror game with a little bit of cthulu for flavor, set in a ruined Michigan Detroit area. The turn-based gameplay relies on the simple facade of hex map world over deep woodcraft, medical, and combat mechanics and events, along with a healthy dose of random (often fatal) chance.			"

NEO Scavenger is a turn-based survival RPG released by Blue Bottle Games in late 2014. The player roams a post-apocalyptic Michigan, simply trying to survive. The game is tile-based, with a complex combat system that is entirely described through text.  The combat system is one that sticks out. It's somewhat reminiscent of the original Wasteland, but instead of a hit point system, damage is actually done to the combantants.The commands are a little more complex than a lot of systems, if you're knocked down, for instance, you can either get up, roll away, or grab the enemy by the ankles and pull 'em down. Most combat is completely optional too, you can sneak away, talk your way out of it, or simply avoid it in general.Plenty of skills and flaws are selectable from the start, and more skills are able to be obtained later in the game. This encourages trial and error, which is more acceptable in this, considering the survival mechanics, as opposed to a more traditional RPG with cutscenes and dungeons you have to go through in the beginning. Speaking of survival mechanics, they're fantastic; this game is the survival game I've been waiting for. Food and water can be obtained in a myriad of ways. The crafting system is really general, so materials can usually be substituted for others, as opposed to needing very specific things.The quite clear flaw to all this (at least to some people) is almost unavoidable, and it's that it's not a casual-friendly experience. It's not extremely hard to get into, but a lack of experience and foresight is bound to get you killed on occasion. The randomness of your start also might decide your fate more-so than your skill, depending on the direction you go, but this was either pretty easy to bounce back from, or simply rare.ProsSurvival mechanics are pretty lifelike and full of depth.Combat is complex, and completely option if you decide you don't want to.Easy to pick up and play, but still a pretty deep and lengthy game if you aren't as bad as I am.ConsNot casual-friendly, although if you put a little time, thought, and elbow grease in it, you shouldn't have too many problems.Random map can screw you over early game on occasion. Final Thoughts:If you like survival games, or late-eighties CRPGs like Wasteland, than you'll find a pretty polished combination that's certain to pull quite a few hours out of you.Rating: 9/10This review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.

												Now im gonna tell you just how good this game is, at first i was a bit sceptical and thought hmmm probably not the game for me but i saw it had a demo. I decided to play it. Hooked instantly. I just couldn't stop playing, i played the demo (not even the full game just the demo) for about 60 hours. Thats when i decided this is the game for me. Bought it and was honestly one of the best decisions i made, a must buy.     10/10 would scavenge again			"

												Attend the tale of Phillip Kindred, who died as he lived: partially clothed, dragging a sled, and fighting off an infection.NEO Scavenger is mean. It's unfair. It's cruel. It's grisly. The odds are stacked against you and odds are you won't make it a week. It's also one of the most fun procedural RPGs I've ever played.It's certainly not perfect. The UI is clunky at best and deeply confusing at worst (remind me to tell you about the time I accidentally ate spoiled human flesh) and the story, while it starts strong, peters out to an ending that hints at a design cycle that ended with exhaustion rather than completion.Still, NEO Scavenger is otherwise a remarkable and very well thought-out foray into a mythical, post-collapse Michigan with tons of interesting worldbuilding details and enough entertainment value to last you for a long, long time.

								It's hard to stop hitting the retry button on this game. While there's no hand-holding in this survivalist/sci-fi RPG, every loss gives you a bit of knowledge about how to survive better on the next playtrough. While most everything about the game is minimalist (lofi-graphics and text/icon turn-based combat), the game's approach to describing characters and events forces you to assess your decisions not based on a sheet of numbers or a cookie-cutter game sprite, but on what you know about your capabilities, and what you can see of the problem(s) you face. It's a great aesthetic that forces you to be your character instead of just playing them. It's a great game, and getting better.			"

								Hoplessly addicted, thats what I am. There are several indie gems out there but I have to admit that this one is the best I've played. Why? Probably because it reminds me so much of the original Wasteland and does well to hold me over till the I get the money for the second. You play as a man with no real memory of who he is and wakes up in a post apocalyptic world, except it doesn't use the cliched desert wasteland or zombie infested urban feista. No, it sets itself apart by creating its own twisted world. In the game you move along a hex map and scavange for supplies. These supplies range from balls of twine and floss to civilian grade weapons and military grade technology. You are able to craft a varity of things out of seemingly usless items. My favorite being the sled (plastic sled + medium length twine, rope, floss, etc.) which allows me to carry more things BUT i am unable to run making combat difficult. Combat takes a bit getting use to but not for very long. It's turn based where you select what you do and you do it then your opponent takes their turn. Simple and when combined with your imagination, downright enjoyable. Even in early acess this game is so well polished I would believe it to be complete, though I'm glade it isn't because I would love to see more and more items and craftable objects. This is a must for fans of classic RPGs, Fallout(original), Wasteland, The Road(both book and movie), and Fallen Paragon(a book I highly recommend find it on Amazon).			"

								If you like survival games this game is for you!The game is a post-apocalyptic survival, and it's HARD, but in a good way you never get the feeling that the game is cheating. The combat is turn based and very satisfying, also every fight might be your last, especially if you rush in without thinking, after all it's a survival not an action game. And I love the way injuries work, it's been a while since I've seen this in a game.The graphic is minimal and almost all the action is told by text so if you don't like reading you will not enjoy it. However I really like the artwork.All in all if you are a hardcore survival fan I recommend this game, you won't be disapointed. There is a free demo on the official page of the developer, so you can check it out before you decide.FAIR WARNING: The game is still in beta so expect some bugs. So far the developer is actively working on the game fixing bugs and adding content, so that's good :)Keep it up!			"

								Having played this game for almost two years, it's pretty good, the gameplay has somewhat of a leaning curve, the isometric view is good as all the events (which there are plenty of even now) is also good, it has a large variety of skills, which really change the way you play the game.Replayability is really high in a game like this and this is no exception, you will most definitely die the first times, in fact always, but that's the joy of the game, trying different setups for your character. From having medical skills to have the skills to make your own jacket of animal skin.Try the demo, you won't regret it if you like this genre.			"

												This game can be really brutal, and it can also be pretty easy. it can be really easy and then suddenly really brutal.I think the worst thing about the game is its reliance on random number generation, you can end up being railroaded through bad luck which is really dis-empowering as a player, you end up feeling like you get screwed over by bad luck more than through your own bad choices.The game is still good though and really sells its atmosphere well. the games not relly my cup of tea but I still enjoyed a few hours of play.Not sure its worth the price tag, there are better games for cheaper on steam though.

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. If you liked Fallout 1 and 2, and you like survival and roguelike games, I think you'll love this. It's dark, creepy, atmospheric, insanely detailed and can be morbid beyond belief. Don't judge the screenshots - buy this game. Note: I played this off steam, that's why my game time is low. I probably hit triple digits in reality.Had some of my most memorable gaming experiences with NEO Scavenger while it was in Alpha, and weirdly enough it wasn't even anything dramatic, just stalking deer and making jerky, exploring and braving the elements with my prized and carefully assembled ""kit"" of equipment, feeling like a badass survivor in a totally harsh and unforgiving world. In another playthrough, some truly weird♥♥♥♥♥♥went down in an abandoned insane assylum turned cultist haven: At the door, I gave up my prized kit in exchange for a hospital gown, got involved in some crazy masochistic, self-flagellating religious nonsense and cultist court intrigues, left on strange and uncertain terms, and then got shot outside the gates (left me absolutely speechless, like, WTF just happened?)Quests go weird. Enemies can be unpredictable. Strange things can happen. Emergent gameplay up the whazoo.This game offers so much all at once... The detail in it is enough to sattisfy your worst OCD compulsions, because this game has the most detailed inventory management of probably any game ever made (plastic bags that you can crumple up and put in pockets, pill boxes you can stock with individual pills, batteries that you can stock and charge with individual electric cells, etc.) It also has a really detailed and fairly simple to use crafting system, with absolutely tons of stuff. Just ridiculous amount of stuff, much more available through mods.The atmosphere and tone is almost uniquely morbid. This is not necessary or recommended, but hypothetically you can kill someone with a sharpened stick, then carry their body to the woods, carve up the body into steaks and make canibal pemmican. That is outrageous, and disturbing, and just knowing the game lets you do that (though I think discourages it somehow), that in itself gives the game a uniquely dark tone (something about the graphic of the enemy's courpse, lying crumpled on its side, taking up your entire inventory and overburderning you, man that image got like burned in my mind I think). There are randomly generated scripted events and RPG/Adventure type of quests, choices, storylines. And the writing is actually good, I would even say excellent. These are optional though, so you can kind of ""sandbox"" it if you want. Anyway, I've sunk weeks into this game and enjoyed it tremendously, back when it wasn't even complete.Cons: - None, really. - After countless hours, combat can get a little repetetive.- Of course, the interface is pretty clunky and strange in some respects, so while on the one hand I absolutely adore this game just as it is, I also hope that one day it gets some kind of over-haul or redesign/relaunch.TL;DR: The game developer is a genius and this is clearly a labor of love. I buy very few games, but this is one I was almost giddy to pay for.			"

												Bought this game from the Blue Bottle website several month ago and have enjoyed it since. Connecting to steam recently, and thought I would promote it. If you are looking for a gritty, post-apoc simulator, this is one of the best. All aspects of your character, such as thirst, food, and even tempature. It can be difficult or easy depending on the starting traits, which alows you to scale how hard it is for you. Since I originally bought the game, there have been a steady flow of updates and new builds, so it is not a game that drops and leaves. The story, world, and enemies are ever changing and interesting. +Great Simulator+Scalable Difficulty+Amazing story and settingThe game certainly is not for everyone. It is akin to older text based adventure games, and the original Fallout games. If you need visual feedback or fidelity, you may want to go elsewhere. However, if you are ready for a real look at surviving the end of the world. NEO Scavanger is simply amazing.			"

								With the ability to download a demo, this developer has shown that they understand and care about their customers. Too many early access games ask you to fork out money on the promise that there will be more to come. Neo Scavenger reminds me of fun, hour-wasting, indie games I used to play on CD-ROMs that came free with gaming magazines. It currently plays as a complete game, with some minor bugs, and has a great early nineties retro art style that I love. Would recommend supporting this developer and this game.			"

								Cheesy game play? Not really at all. Graphics and interface are not 'high speed' but the game is about choices, and not letting yourself get beat down. 11 hours I made it. Oh joy! Very inventory management intensive. If you want to keep something better figure out how to fit it in whatever you may have at hand. Pretty cool crafting so far to. I made a shiv and a spear pretty quick. I also figured out to sacrifice a sleeping man to escape a death right at the start. This is not a forgiving game either. I got knocked down and then beaten to death by two guys and was not able to get up and defend myself. Ouch. Pretty neat little distraction here.


So it ended pretty quick in NEO

												Two eyes flickered open and heavy breaths followed as she awoke from the nightmare. Her body shot upward from the sleeping bag. She felt her grip on it loosen as she began to calm down. Her eyes adjusted to the dim lighting of the shed.  She listened to her racing heart and the rain on the shed’s metal roof.For a moment, a mere moment, the girl felt relaxed by the noise. Rain was soothing. The unbroken rhythm of each drop.But the ease was lost when she heard a grumbling noise from the pit of her stomach. Her eyes traveled to her stomach. She placed her hands on her stomach, and tried to remember a time where she felt full. As proof, she wore a protruding ribcage.Her attention was then drawn to the door of the shed. She could go out and search for food, risk death for food. Or stay here safe from the outside world and risk starvation.Another grumble from her stomach made up her mind. The young girl found the dagger behind her dirty pillow. She gazed at it’s worn appearance for a moment. A dagger was not much but she had not much else.With as must courage as she could muster, she slid out of the sleeping bag and crept slowly out of the shed. With one last look at the place she considered home, a dusty area with only one hole for light to penetrate through and a small space, she turned away from the shed.Her eyes looked around the forest and felt goosebumps as rain tickled her skin.        The air was coated in a thick fog and the air was stale. What little left of trees stood, but various scraps decorated the ground.        At the age of fifteen, she had been on her own since she was five. Well that what she could remember at least. Whatever happened to the world, she could not recall. The only thing she could recall was her name, or what she had been called at the time. Merida.    Merida shivered feeling the rain soak into her clothes, or what little there was of her clothes.    The scrawny young girl moved away from the shed. She crept through the forest, feeling her muscles tense. A few snarls, growls and footsteps reminded her that she was not alone in the woods. It was dangerous here.      A few moments of walking and she heard something. A bush rustled. Her eyes darted to the bush and she stopped suddenly. She moved quickly behind a log across from the bush. A small rabbit wandered out of the bush. It's ears twitched for a moment. Luckily, it seemed to not have noticed Merida's presence. The rabbit sniffed at the ground for a moment and turned it's back to the log.      Hunger outranked patience, and Merida suddenly leaped forward towards the rabbit. She aimed her dagger for the creature, but missed. The rabbit, startled, begin to ran. Merida eagerly chased the rabbit farther. Her legs ached as she forced herself to continue.  It wasn't until a while, when Merida managed to chase it to the outskirts of the forest. Caught up in the chase, she had not noticed where she was until she tripped on a tin can. She fell down the hill and into the heaps of scraps.      The dagger in her hand had slipped from her grasp. It fell along with her.      With a sudden stop downward, she caught a glimpse of the rabbit running through the scrapyard. Her eyes wandered around, and she felt fear gnaw at her. She had never been here before. She had never left the forest before.      Merida tried to catch her breath. Her small body was not strong enough for the run. Pain engulfed her right leg. She noticed a red liquid spilling from her leg. A large cut rested on her knee. Various scratches decorated her body as well.      She guessed the fall into the scraps had managed to give her the mark, along with the blade of the dagger. Tears threatened to seep out her eyes but she dare not cry.      The girl struggled to stand. But her leg was badly injured and the weight of body was too much.      So she crawled forward. After a few attempts, the girl gave up. The pain in her leg was unbearable.      There she lay, amongst the scraps, with a still empty belly, a damaged body and lost hopes.      'There's no one, no one here to help me..', she thought to herself in despair.      With that, she shut her eyes, and awaited death. She knew she was not dying at the moment; but without shelter, food, and with her wound, she didn't think she'd last a night.***      Night was present when she heard the noise of the beasts. Creatures of all variety were known to come out at night time. Her eyes tried to make out her surroundings in the darkness.      The night brought cold air to her. She shivered, and wished for her shed. At least it was shelter there.      Merida heard something rustle near the scraps. She shook in a terrified motion as the sound came closer. Clomp. Clomp. It almost sounded like footsteps. Merida tried to move her legs, but they felt numb.    She struggled to move, anything to avoid what ever it was.    The noise drew closer. All she could manage to do was hold her breath. A light as well, a red glow, was now close to her. She tried to avoid looking towards whatever it was, in fear that it would see her glancing.    The noise was now there near her. And the glow surrounded her. She close her eyes in fear. Suddenly, something cold and metallic touched her. She opened her eyes slowly, and saw two glowing eyes looking at her. The glow showed a mechanical being made of metal, gears and scraps.      And that was when she drifted into darkness.			"

I'd say it's a non-traditional rogue-like rather than a rogue-lite, because you really only gain a little knowledge from each time you play.The game's definitely worth a try, and I felt the price was right on the money for what you get.

												It's a great game and worth the 5€ purchase BUT the downside is not having some kind of a checkpoint mechanic. The game is pretty long and hard, but by design choice (roguelike) there's permadeath. As you die you will see yourself doing the same things troughout the game, and it becomes a bit repetitive after 20 times.You can hack trough the save games though and if you're not a hardcore player you might just have to do it to see the ending of the game.

												This game is for extreme hardcore strategists or masochists. If you are the one, then go ahead and buy it. My experience in this game didn't give me a lot of satisfaction nor fun. You just die, no matter what you do, no matter where you go. You will freeze to death or be killed by... anything. There is no rollback and you get permadeath. There are close to none information about your character and chances of succes of the actions you make. There is a weird combat system: even with a ""strong"", ""melee"" and ""tough"" perks you die, eventually. 50% of desicions you make is the Luck based, plus another 50% is the Curiosity, combined together will lead you to death.The concept is very good, but the implementation is still needs a lot of work.Combining with the other issues I would wait for improved version.

												One of the mistakes people make when first playing this game is assuming it is unrelentingly hard just because you die a lot; it isn't. It just doesn't have a tutorial, and is very strict. You'll die, but those deaths are not random; they are because of some mistake you made. Learn from it. Don't die that way next time. And don't forget your skills; if you die of poisoning try to figure out why and not do it again. Maybe it had something to do with those mushrooms you ate? or that rancid swamp water you drank? Did you die of Sepsis? Then maybe try keeping your wounds clean instead of rubbing dirt in them.Once you get into the swing of things, it isn't hard to survive, and luck starts to be a fairly minor factor. This can take a bit of learning; even poring over the wiki isn't going to totally familiarize yourself with the mechanics, but it is a good idea to use the wiki for craftables. Not necessary, but helpful.One last bit of advice: there's no 100% completion for this game, so keep in mind you do not have to complete every challenge you come across. In fact, you shouldn't try; no character can handle all challenges. Pick your battles, and don't be afraid to run away, even if you are a full combat character. Most of all, the game is turn based. Take your time, think things through, and use your skills.			"

												PLAY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!! The best survival game out there, very immersive and you actually feel like a 'Wastelander'. This game is all about dying and living. The first couple times you play are challenging but you start to pick things up. How to make fires so you don't freeze to death, boil water, make meat last longer, make clean rags, what to do and what not to do when you engage other people, etc. After that the game is quite enjoyable. Each time you die you learn what you did wrong and survive even longer. Who knows, maybe you'll live long enough to see the snow ;D			"

								This game is a great survival RPG for anyone who wants an unforgiving, challenging, and heavily replayable game. The gameplay is very enjoyable, and I find it interesting how realistic this game is. The developers really have put in time to make sure that true human necessities are represented, such as food, a warm place to sleep, something to drink, and a means of protecting yourself. You're almost guaranteed to not do well on your first playthrough, but that's one of the best things about the game. As you keep playing, you learn more and more about what you need to do and what to look for & avoid, and you constantly get better at it. If you've played Don't Starve, you'll see similar gameplay aspects in NEO Scavenger.If you're a fan of the original Fallout games, if you like survival games, or if you like truly tough games that take time and effort to succeed at, you'll surely enjoy this game.

								An amazing game, reminds me very much of Fallout 1 and 2, only MUCH more forgiving. Still, that doesn't take away from this game's playabilitiy - in fact, my fondest memories are that of my first character. who died something like 6 hours into the game from hypothermia. The crafting system is great, if in need of a bit of refinement. Combat is fun, and sometimes a little bit scary. The environment is what REALLY takes the cake though, I haven't played a 2D game that's ever given me the willies so bad. Definitely a solid 8/10 in my book, and I only see it getting better!			"

								The game is still very raw, but awesome already. If you are into survival stuff or/and a big Fallout fan, you must try this game out. Demo would be enough, though I found out that the full game differs in balance a bit. You won't be able to make a big progress using in-game info only, so prepare to browse external wiki a lot.Combat system is just awesome leaving you with a dire impressions of a martial combat to death, I can't think of anything exciting like that in recent turn-based games. You will feel the force of each crowbar punch landing on your enemies' breaking their limbs. I'm not being sadistic here, but that's what you expect from a post apocalyptic role play survival game. Lack of sex is a big disappointing here though, it would give the game a perfect touch.NEO Scavenger's mechanic is purely brilliant, but the main hardcorish problem to me is that story line is rather linear (though it gives you options to complete quests depending on your perks from time to time), once you've made ""a wrong"" decision you'll be punished with no option to progress at all, making you literally start the game over from the very beginning. It forces you to constantly peak into forums and wiki, leaving you with no free will options at all.I strongly recommend to buy this game to support its developer.			"

Then maybe try keeping your wounds clean instead of rubbing dirt in them.Once you get into the swing of things, it isn't hard to survive, and luck starts to be a fairly minor factor. This can take a bit of learning; even poring over the wiki isn't going to totally familiarize yourself with the mechanics, but it is a good idea to use the wiki for craftables. Not necessary, but helpful.One last bit of advice: there's no 100% completion for this game, so keep in mind you do not have to complete every challenge you come across. In fact, you shouldn't try; no character can handle all challenges. Pick your battles, and don't be afraid to run away, even if you are a full combat character. Most of all, the game is turn based. Take your time, think things through, and use your skills.			"

								This game is a lot of fun. You can approach it in very different ways and it has rewarding replay value.  My complaint is that the Learning Curve is STEEP (which is fine) but once you get a solid rhythm going and understand the fundamentals well enough, the game quickly comes to an 'end' of produced content. Fortunately, you already know to expect an incomplete game, since it obviously says ""Early Access"".			"

												NEO scavenger is a tough as nails survival game that will make you hate it so much you'll either kick it off a window or end up loving it.It's a turn based tabletop-RPG-of-sorts that starts you waking up in a cryo facility in the middle of the post apocalyptic ruins of Detroit. It is sorta RPG because despite having almost no character progression to it you'll pick up a bunch of traits at the start and both skill checks and inventory management will be paramount to your survival, and sorta tabletop because you'll move across hexes using said abilities and items to gather, fight and resolve the situations you'll find yourself in.The graphics are reminiscent of the DOS games of the early 90s and the sound design is minimalistic but effective.The player model will reflect equipment changes and every item has it's own art, and hexes have varied art that will let you know what to expect from each. Everything is functional, but the real star of NEO scavenger is it's gameplay and game design, and its biggest make or break factor.The most important part of the game is undoubtedly the RNG, since it dictates how successful you'll be when scavenging, what you'll get, how combat will go, or whether you'll catch one of the many incredibly deadly diseases that plague the wasteland. There are some things that the player can do to nudge said rng one side or the other trough their abilities and gear, but make no mistake: take a whiff of blue rot or drink from the wrong water and you're pretty much done for, without being able to do much else about it.The beginning of the game is the toughest and most frustrating part of it, because you'll start out virtually naked and extremely vulnerable, to the point that an idiot with a frying pan will be able to do you in. Avoiding confrontation is without a doubt the most effective way to play the game, but the implacable entropy will eventually force you into taking risks be it food or gear. Combat can be equally frustrating since being in the wrong place at the wrong time can earn you being 1 shotted by a hick with a rifle, although I gotta admit when that happens to you killing an enemy with just one bullet feels badass and satisfying as hell.When you finally reach Detroit Megacity things get substantially easier. You'll be able to scavenge the surrounding areas and sell the loot for money, and you'll basically be doing scavenging trips while way better equipped and with better fallbacks. You'll be given missions regularly that will take you to stupidly dangerous places so you'll have to still stay on your toes. But having access to DMC is a far cry from scuttling around in a hospital garb praying to make it without ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself to death due to cholera or freezing to death inside an abandoned building. You'll likely have to retry the first weeks over and over again, but once you manage to get a character rolling it gives you a great sense of accomplishment. Of course the game includes a full compliment of biological needs to take care of, but ironically those are one of the easiest parts of the game with the right perk or once you get some of the very early gear.In closing NEO scavenger is a very long, hard and replayable game that you'll either hate until you love it or just plain hate it. Regardless, it's cheap and if you like survival and a challenge you shouldn't be afraid to pick it up. 7/10.			"

												This game is one that won't leave you unsatisfied as it is brutally hard, and when you die you rarely get upset and think; ""I could have done that instead"" or ""maybe that wasn't a good idea, I should avoid doing it again"" (only time I've gotten upset is when I die fighting a bad medusa gang member, almost dieing, then getting killed by a stray dog)1. The game is terrible when it comes to forgiving mistakes, which makes it brutally fun as you either get punished or punish others for making a bad move like attacking you without weapons while you have a large knife and the strong skill. It can also destroy you if you make a bad move and give you no chance to save yourself2. The npcs seem player like, some either hunting you down and causing trouble just because they can, others thanking you for not trying to stab them while on their way to go do something. Some ignore you too. Great realism to how some people see, like they would act in an event like this3. It's a hard game, both to learn and play when you at least think you have the ropes down, a pocketknife, and a yellow canary lighter in your jean pockets since your grocery bag is full of more grocery bags and food. And don't think ""oh it must be the bad kind of hard because you need to learn stuff yourself and everything is brutal"" since it's a fun game and the only time the game isn't hard is maybe the first few moves when absolutely nothing can move yet and get you. It's a good kind of hard that makes you feel warm with the feels for your characters health and well being as he try's to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ happened and why he can't remember♥♥♥♥♥♥4. Even when you think you got things going well it can still go bad. The run I was the most equipped on was ended by a dogman who was hungry for human flesh, mine to be specific after he killed an npc and ditched the body. This keeps you on your toes as you sneak from building to building hopping to find a crowbar or bow or at least a lighter while the building doesn't give away under your feet and you fall to your doom or fall down some stairs and hit your head, breaking your neck and dieing right away.I live the game, also a great tip is don't take your necklace off, no gear, no matter how strong, is worth taking it off. If you need it that badly then make room for it. Keep your yellow canary lighter close by and what ever odd tool turned melee weapon and named ""mr head basher"" or ""stabby stabby craby"" or ""I dunno what the hell to name this"" ready to bash/Stab what ever wanders close enough at night, even a deer or bunny			"

												Incredible story telling, challenging- possibly even brutal or too much for some. I can't get enough of it. The game writer does such an amazing job of describing the setting and situation during evens and NPC interactions. Certain parts of the story send shivers up my spine- I feel as though im almost reading post-apocalypse book at times. Very very well done. Please consider creating a mobile (android/ios) version of this game in the future, it seems it would work very well even with only touch.Overall, very brutal for beginners and has a steep learning curve- but the story and interactions with the mutants and NPCs are very very well written- I was completely hooked on this game after my interaction at Zom Zoms.

								I received a key through the official site over a year ago (hence the low Steam ""play time"") and am really enjoying my experience.  I'm still a bit fuzzy on the crafting (I still haven't figured out how to make a campfire, LOL), but it's fun going around and beating up bandits with crowbars and the like to steal their stuff.  I'm a big fan of the survival genre in general, though I don't often see a turn-based survival game done this well.  It also has a choose your own adventure vibe at times with your traits and perks modding the available outcomes.  Well worth the ten bucks, in my opinion.

												So I found myself writing this huge post about how I recomend this game, and how I got it back before 2015, but then steam said I had to play the game for atleast 5 minutes. So I open the game, then come back here. I made the unfortunate mistake of pasting it back here while the game was loading, so I lost the whole thing, and have to start over.I don't feel like re-writing all of it, and I don't honestly remember what I said. So here's the summary:I got this back when Desura was still an option for getting games.I played it until I was so tired I nearly had to make another pot of coffee, which says a lot since I was on my third, and I'm still thinking about making it.My first death happened almost 10 minutes later. I had a good backpack, a rifle, a crowbar, perhaps I even had a few hundred kills to my name. How did I die? A looter with a monkey wrench... Yup.But thats one of the reasons I love this game. Every time I play this game I find a new way to end my run. So far I think I've been killed by random people around the map more than anything else... Anyhow, about a year and a month or so later we could starting modding, and oh boy did people mod it fast. I loved the game, and I love the mods.Now I'm not saying this is a game for everyone. Infact, I would suggest doing quite a bit of research before buying it (Like, say, getting the demo!). A lot of people say this game has a big learning curve, it's not actually that big, but it could be hard for first time players to get a hand on what's going on. Now, the game also has permadeath, which many people have complained about in the past. So again, do a little research before buying, but I guess that goes for all games... er, um... I'm gonna stop typing now.Thanks for reading!			"

												Tons of Depth.Don't let the grid sway you. One of the best survival games to date. Think of it as a singleplayer survival board game. Just get off the graphics and stop being a pixel Nazi. First playthough I got eaten by a bunch of canabals who ran a bar. Second playthough I ran around naked until I froze to death.third... yeah.. its embarrasing. Fifteenth playthrough I actually survived long enough to get int othe meat of story which is actually pretty interesting.Recommended for anyone who wants a casual survival game. Interesting crafting, entertaining combat text. Add a decent story and you have great little title. My only complaint is the UI could be a little more intuitive. Somethings are a bit confusing.

Really Dev..in 2016?  Flash saves?  Worth the 4 bucks or so i paid for it but no future for this game so on to something else.			"

												I'm writing this just because last review is negative and it's awfully long, so many people will just see the negative vote and skip the game, and that's not fair.THIS IS A GREAT ROGUELIKE GAME.You will have to face countless problems, challanges and foes. The game has a huge variety of items and recipes you will have to use during the game. Surviving it's not easy and requires practice. The first games you will freeze to death or starve within the first few turns.IF YOU DON'T LIKE ROGUELIKE GAMES, DON'T BUYOf course, it's a roguelike game. If you don't like the genre, don't buy this game because, guess what? It will have all roguelike characteristics!It's gonna be repetitive and frustrating and you will have to do the same things over and over again.CONCLUSIONThis said, there is absolutely no reason to give this game a negative vote. As a ROGUELIKE, it is absolutely prefect. "

								I received a key through the official site over a year ago (hence the low Steam ""play time"") and am really enjoying my experience.  I'm still a bit fuzzy on the crafting (I still haven't figured out how to make a campfire, LOL), but it's fun going around and beating up bandits with crowbars and the like to steal their stuff.  I'm a big fan of the survival genre in general, though I don't often see a turn-based survival game done this well.  It also has a choose your own adventure vibe at times with your traits and perks modding the available outcomes.  Well worth the ten bucks, in my opinion.

												The game is flash-tier but still pretty good. It's innawoods simulator, minus the slavshit.Brutal survivalism and inventory management - I like how it takes cold, sleep, pain, and disease in ways that most so-called survival games overlook. This makes for a realistic and engaging but utterly merciless game. There is no save scumming in this game. Ironmode only. Too hard? Just give up, casual, and go back to Minecraft.If you want to play it on easy mode, get Strong, Melee, Botany, and Trapper. Get Myopia and Fast Metabolism as negative traits. Make a cloak out of the Dogman and get to Detroit, then make tannin tea from the forests near the sprawl and sell it until you can get into DMC, get eye implants, then as much equipment as you think you need to get going; this will compensate for your disadvantages. Still, never get cocky - one false step and it's over; I've died multiple times from being careless even when I had a full set of nanomachine healing thingies and plentiful supplies.			"

								This game, although early access, is very unique and brilliant. The game so far has a near-perfect balance of turn based strategy, luck, and exploration to fill all the great parts of a roguelike, while maintaining an atmosphere of tense nervousness, or relief after finding what you need to be immersive. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys roguelike games and exploration.			"

												Incredible story telling, challenging- possibly even brutal or too much for some. I can't get enough of it. The game writer does such an amazing job of describing the setting and situation during evens and NPC interactions. Certain parts of the story send shivers up my spine- I feel as though im almost reading post-apocalypse book at times. Very very well done. Please consider creating a mobile (android/ios) version of this game in the future, it seems it would work very well even with only touch.Overall, very brutal for beginners and has a steep learning curve- but the story and interactions with the mutants and NPCs are very very well written- I was completely hooked on this game after my interaction at Zom Zoms. Love the retro feel by the way. Mad props to this developer.			"

												This game is one that won't leave you unsatisfied as it is brutally hard, and when you die you rarely get upset and think; ""I could have done that instead"" or ""maybe that wasn't a good idea, I should avoid doing it again"" (only time I've gotten upset is when I die fighting a bad medusa gang member, almost dieing, then getting killed by a stray dog)1. The game is terrible when it comes to forgiving mistakes, which makes it brutally fun as you either get punished or punish others for making a bad move like attacking you without weapons while you have a large knife and the strong skill. It can also destroy you if you make a bad move and give you no chance to save yourself2. The npcs seem player like, some either hunting you down and causing trouble just because they can, others thanking you for not trying to stab them while on their way to go do something. Some ignore you too. Great realism to how some people see, like they would act in an event like this3. It's a hard game, both to learn and play when you at least think you have the ropes down, a pocketknife, and a yellow canary lighter in your jean pockets since your grocery bag is full of more grocery bags and food. And don't think ""oh it must be the bad kind of hard because you need to learn stuff yourself and everything is brutal"" since it's a fun game and the only time the game isn't hard is maybe the first few moves when absolutely nothing can move yet and get you. It's a good kind of hard that makes you feel warm with the feels for your characters health and well being as he try's to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ happened and why he can't remember♥♥♥♥♥♥4. Even when you think you got things going well it can still go bad. The run I was the most equipped on was ended by a dogman who was hungry for human flesh, mine to be specific after he killed an npc and ditched the body. This keeps you on your toes as you sneak from building to building hopping to find a crowbar or bow or at least a lighter while the building doesn't give away under your feet and you fall to your doom or fall down some stairs and hit your head, breaking your neck and dieing right away.I live the game, also a great tip is don't take your necklace off, no gear, no matter how strong, is worth taking it off. If you need it that badly then make room for it. Keep your yellow canary lighter close by and what ever odd tool turned melee weapon and named ""mr head basher"" or ""stabby stabby craby"" or ""I dunno what the hell to name this"" ready to bash/Stab what ever wanders close enough at night, even a deer or bunny			"

												While I really like the concept and everything:1) The menus are clunky.  This whole game revolves around those menus, so the game is clunky.2) Of the 10 tries or so, my character continually froze to death even if I had layered a shirt over a hoodie with pants and boots and slept in sheltered areas.3) The combat is awkward and does not feel engaging.4) Finding something to store my items was extremely difficult, so normally I'd only have a shiv or something.5) Crafting is strange and it's not clear what you can/should build.  You learn more about what you can make the more you play, and sometimes you even find recipes, but finding those items again by the time you need them seems somewhat unlikely.I feel like this could be spruced up and be far more exciting, but as it currently stands I cannot recommend it.

												It looks so good! It sounded like the survival game I'd been wanting for YEARS! But after scavenging only 2 abandoned towns I was shot at and constantly stunned until I died. I was Tough and had clothes on, not sure if that improves my defense or not, and I was behind cover. Infact getting behind cover was the one single action I was able to pull off.In my many playthroughs since I have never been able to find another frying pan or torch, and things were even harder. Finding a lighter is so damn hard that I usually starve to death. Or if I just try waiting it out and eating mushrooms in forests, I end up dying of sickness. This isn't a game about surviving, it's a game about taking a while to die. 2 days is my usual record.This game relies so incredibly heavily on luck that it just isn't fun. But survival is all about strategy, so this works out horribly. I've tried building a great shelter, but died of sickness. Tried never staying in one spot, but got mauled. There are only ways to lose and no ways to win. Also with the very small amount of recipes available, you'd think the game would give you hints on when you need just 1 more item to make something. Dragging the skills into the crafting table is just really monotonous. It should be doing this itself! It's the Minecraft crafting table all over again, with no user-friendliness.And the skills, they were a selling point for me, but now that I've gotten to play it I only pick the same skills each time. They are just not at all balanced. This is what I'd expect from a game still in beta. I thought I'd be avoiding these huge flaws in a finished game. Incredibly dissapointing. I've tried other survival roguelikes and they were pretty bad too in there own ways.Starting to wonder if this genre combo simply can never work.UPDATE: Same day I post this, a wonderful person tells me about a free game in beta called Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. It's got more content than I can handle! And despite it's wonky controls, it has a very clear crafting system, and loads of methods for getting materials. It's also far more immersive with you actually exploring the areas yourself. Just hope you don't need graphics, because that's the game's only flaw. To play it like Neo Scavenger, just turn zombies off and NPCs on. And finally, when you die in it, you learn from it. You play better next time. Something I sadly can't say about Neo Scavenger, where it's difficulty is based on a dice roll.			"

I purchased this game because I saw my brother play it one day, and it looked like a good game to pass the time, maybe when I was downloading something or needed something to do while I was about to go somewhere. So I paid for the game, and launched it, and found it extremely difficult to play. It took me maybe 2 hours to figure out where to go, what to do, and how to survive. But once I did, it began opening new windows in the world of NEO Scavenger. I got really far, then one day while fighting a DMC Guard, was fatally shot in the chest and killed. I thought to myself, ""No big deal, I'll just do it again."" So I did. And I died of a disease called The Blue Rot. I continued playing. Died of a bandit. Continued playing...and playing...and playing....Eventually I went upstairs and I found out that I had been playing the game for 3 hours, but what seemed to be only 30 minutes to me. In other words, the ten dollars I spent on this game lasted a whole long while.PROS OF THIS GAME-Time consuming, and very, very fun.-Don't need a super computer to run it.-Download time is literally 3 minutes.-There generally is no raging at your monitor included with this game.-The creativity put into this game is flippin' amazing.-Totally worth the ten dollars.CONS OF THIS GAME-Mild glitches can interrupt gameplay (NOTE THAT IT IS IN EARLY ACCESS)-If you're someone who doesn't have a lot of time on their hands, don't buy this.-This game sucks the life essence out of you and your friends.-Updates generally come rather slowly.Anyway, this game is great and you need to buy it.

												A devloper once told me, ""UI (User Interface) is like a joke; If you have to explain it, then it isn't that good.""This game fits into that category with poor UI as only one of many design flaws. Don't waste your time and money.* Unweildy Menu NavigationThe game plays in a window by default, which in and of itself isn't a bad thing. The problem comes when trying to back out of a menu just to end up closing the entire game instead (and losing any progress in the process). The menus themselves, such as inventory, crafting and the map are not very intuitve and require a lot of trial-and-error to figure them out. Saving a game is unweildy, too, because there is only one option; ""Save & Quit"" from the main menu. * Lack of Information and DirectionVery little information is given for each item beyond ""condition"" which is how well in a state of repair an item is. For example, when tying to compare weapons, stats such as range and damage are inaccesable to the player; You have to guess which weapons may or may not be better! Same goes for clothing; There are no stats beyond condtion that tell a player how well protected they are. Lack of stats and lack of other useful information leaves the player in the dark. Trial and error helps, but the game is so inconsitant that trial and error will only get you so far.* Nearly Impossible Early GameI like a challange, but this game has too many variables. The map, encounters and looting are all random, which could be a good thing. However, the game starts you out with next to nothing and already suffering from exposure to cold weather. When you need some basic supplies just to survive, and the only way to get those supplies is by a series of lucky random events, then the game becomes more about luck-of-the-draw and less about any real strategy.* Bad Combat EncountersOn top of just trying to survive the elements, there are things out there that want to kill you, and you have next to nothing to fight back with! Your choices are fight with a poorly-designed combat mechanism or try to run and ineveitably get overrun anyway. Even if you win the fight, it's likely you will succumb to the injuries sustained in combat, because you don't have the supplies you need to properly treat yourself.So on top on the bad, unhelpful UI design are a series of random events that will kill you rather quickly, because you never get a chance to get what you need to survive. This game is NOT fun, but rather frustrating, to have to start over and over again and get nowhere in the process. Don't waste your time - Go find a better game.			"

												The info:In NEO Scavenger you will be fighting not only the vicious denizens of a post apocalyptic world; but nature itself.Between the cold, hunger and baddies you will have a hard time surviving.Finding something as simple as a potato chip bag seems like an accomplishment in this game as you will always be struggling to find ways to carry all the loot you find and and tools you need.Every item in the game has a health and when that health runs out, it's gone forever and just like in real life if you find a old shopping bag it might have a hole or two in it so there is always the chance that loot you find will already be near useless. Having to decide whether to go on with a sword that has 1% use left in it verses the completely fine stick just laying there will become a easy choice. But figuring out if the small pocket knife is better to take with you because it takes up less space or if it's worth losing that extra storage to a base ball bat is a much harder to decide.Every choice in NEO Scavenger could mean regret or death in the next few turns or happiness and success.  Some things to note before buying:If you like not being able to save your progress then this game is fore you. The only option you have is to 'save' game; which acquaints to going back to the start screen or quitting the game and being able to pick up where you left off however you soon realize it's not really saving anything the first time you die your save is gone. When you die you have to start over again with nothing . . .from the beginning. For me I really get depressed when I worked really hard to get what I got only to die because it was cold or because I drank some bad water.The good:ChallengingTons of content to seehigh replay valueThe bad:The random nature of  encounters and item generation is very unforgiving at times and often ends with your character being killed after only a few turns.A limited (small) set of starting skills to choose from.

												Day One- Hospital GownDay Two- Ate some MushroomsDay Three- Hallucinated a Dog ManDay Four- Wearing His Skin to Intimidate OthersBest case against long term use of Psychedelics (Some of the bad reviews talk about how saving is an issue and it is so here's a note on saving your game and your rear as this is permadeath baby. It is also probably the hardest game to stay alive even when you are well set up)Search for ""where is neo scavenger saved"" and find the save folder. This thread tells you where.https://steamcommunity.com/app/248860/discussions/2/648811852284474523/?l=hungarianThen grab the save file called nsSGv1.sol and COPY it to another folder or your desktop and then paste it in to the neoscavenger folder and try to continue your game. It might disappear and you have to load it again but always keep a copy in another folder so if it vanishes you still have it) Then when you make progress and want to save grab it and overwrite the copy in your extra folder.)

								Game is a fantasticly brutal survival sim. One character I had managed to take down a military (ATN?) guy with a crowbar, which gave me rad body armor, guns and a pack full of goodies. As I'm crowbarring his unconcious head in, his attack drone comes out of nowhere and messes up my arm and leg. After cowering in a nearby abandoned building that I tarted up with noise traps and tarps, I poured the dead soldiers whiskey all over my wounds and chowed down on my cured squirrel stash. I healed up, bailed the area and with my new armor and arms, became a total wasteland badass for about 50 turns. That is, Until 3 dogmen tracked me down to a forest shack and took turns arranging my intestines. Immense fun, highly reccomended to survival game fans.			"

												  You wake up to the sound of freezing rain on makeshift tarp shelter. You take a quick look through your gear making sure nothing has been stolen in the night. Shoving the pieces of your shelter into your pack and throwing your hide cloak around your shoulders you take off through the pouring rain.      You rummage through a few houses not finding much, these where the first places to get scavenger after everything went to ****. As you exit the last house on the street tearing an old tee shirt into rags, suddenly hearing a loud clatter you throw yourself to the ground and watch as a large figure resembling Werewolf from old story's lumbers past. It passes by and you release a breath you didn't know you where holding in. Unslinging the rifle from your shoulder you top off the magazine, fighting a dog man today is not something you wish to happen.        A few days later you stand atop a hill scanning the area with half a binocular you keep slung around your neck searching for any movement while munching on a handful of berries. After several hours you see the flash a blue sash moving out of the tree line, a blue frog preacher not friendly and normally carrying somewhat valuable objects you will have no remorse from ending this ones life. Moving closer as to not waste your valuable ammunition you line up a shot from your rifle. With a loud accompanying crack the figure drops to the ground motionless. as you get close the man jumps to his feet and sprints back into the tree line, Swear under your breath you give chase into the dense forest.       He couldnt have gotten far you think to yourself examining the blood trail. The trees seem to press closer on you and your draw a small revolver from your cargo pants pocket, your rifle would be ineffective at these close ranges. The blue sash makes it easy to find the lifeless body after a few minutes. Your so focous on looting the corpse you almost don't hear the rustle of foliage, you grab your pistol from where it lay beside the body and scan the woods searching for the source of the sound. A single shot whipes by your head and you throw yourself behind a log still searching for your attacker. You take a deep breath staying here is suicide, you lung forward from behind the log in a full on sprint. Stumbling over the overgrown roots of the trees you feel relieved as you see the light streaming for the edge of the forest. In all fairness you almost make it before the second shot rings out catching you in the leg. Gritting your teeth against the pain you fire blindly behind you as you break out into the field. You leap into the tall grass silently thanking what ever god stays about for the concealment. The third shot hits you in the back going through your lung, you cough blood flying from your mouth and then the fourth and final shot the only you don't hear finally ends your pain. Neo Scavenger is a post apocalyptic survival simulator. You must contend with food, water, the cold, the weight of your equipment, wild beasts and other people in your struggle to simply stay alive. Neo scavenger also adds in sides mission and a story although i must admit i have no lived long enough to complete any of them. Also random events can happen while moving about the hexagonal landscape ranging from slave auctions to abandon camps. Combat is turn based and visceral in its descriptions, enough to make you slightly uncomfortable with each killing blow. A skill is also in place allowing you to change your play style with each life keeping the game fresh. There can be quite a lot of reading in parts however its is done very very well, each line adds more to the atmosphere and does a good job of giving a visual of the surrounding area. This is a brutal unforgiving game Death comes quickly to the unknowing and the unprepared. Its not everyone's game by far taking up a niche role in giving a somewhat realistic survival game, probably the closest ive found to a proper simulator.  I give NeoScavenger an 8.5/10  Menus can be rather clunky at times and starting off as a new player can be rather brutal but once you grown acclimated to the environment it becomes a rather masochistic joy to play. Just be wary of purchasing and watch some footage and play to free demo to see if you think you would enjoy the game.			"

												It looks so good! It sounded like the survival game I'd been wanting for YEARS! But after scavenging only 2 abandoned towns I was shot at and constantly stunned until I died. I was Tough and had clothes on, not sure if that improves my defense or not, and I was behind cover. Infact getting behind cover was the one single action I was able to pull off.In my many playthroughs since I have never been able to find another frying pan or torch, and things were even harder. Finding a lighter is so damn hard that I usually starve to death. Or if I just try waiting it out and eating mushrooms in forests, I end up dying of sickness. This isn't a game about surviving, it's a game about taking a while to die. 2 days is my usual record.This game relies so incredibly heavily on luck that it just isn't fun. But survival is all about strategy, so this works out horribly. I've tried building a great shelter, but died of sickness. Tried never staying in one spot, but got mauled. There are only ways to lose and no ways to win. Also with the very small amount of recipes available, you'd think the game would give you hints on when you need just 1 more item to make something. Dragging the skills into the crafting table is just really monotonous. It should be doing this itself! It's the Minecraft crafting table all over again, with no user-friendliness.And the skills, they were a selling point for me, but now that I've gotten to play it I only pick the same skills each time. They are just not at all balanced. This is what I'd expect from a game still in beta. I thought I'd be avoiding these huge flaws in a finished game. Incredibly dissapointing. I've tried other survival roguelikes and they were pretty bad too in there own ways.Starting to wonder if this genre combo simply can never work.UPDATE: Same day I post this, a wonderful person tells me about a free game in beta called Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. It's got more content than I can handle! And despite it's wonky controls, it has a very clear crafting system, and loads of methods for getting materials. It's also far more immersive with you actually exploring the areas yourself. Just hope you don't need graphics, because that's the game's only flaw. To play it like Neo Scavenger, just turn zombies off and NPCs on. And finally, when you die in it, you learn from it. You play better next time. Something I sadly can't say about Neo Scavenger, where it's difficulty is based on a dice roll.			"

												While I really like the concept and everything:1) The menus are clunky.  This whole game revolves around those menus, so the game is clunky.2) Of the 10 tries or so, my character continually froze to death even if I had layered a shirt over a hoodie with pants and boots and slept in sheltered areas.3) The combat is awkward and does not feel engaging.4) Finding something to store my items was extremely difficult, so normally I'd only have a shiv or something.5) Crafting is strange and it's not clear what you can/should build.  You learn more about what you can make the more you play, and sometimes you even find recipes, but finding those items again by the time you need them seems somewhat unlikely.I feel like this could be spruced up and be far more exciting, but as it currently stands I cannot recommend it.

												If you like survival and scavenging games, and this is on sale, then buy it. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend this game. I like hard games, but I don't like when I don't understand why my character died this time or even from what. Certain skills are also a must-have, more or less, which means that you can't play it with the character you'd like (well you can but you'll die much faster/easier) but rather with the character that suits the game.

												I know I will get flamed for this, but this game is just too hard. Period. End of story.I do not understand the modern trend of making these rogue-type games with no difficulty slider. (Teleglitch, I am looking at you.) I mean, you make a game to garner profits, then make that game so hard that only die-hards will even bother to buy it, and that is somehow the new model? Why not make the game approachable to a lot more people by having a difficulty slider, and then special achievements for those brave enough to try the hardest settings?Far Cry Primal, for example: It has an easy setting that a 3-year-old can play, but it also has a very very very difficult survivor expert mode that 99.9% of players will never even play, let alone beat. Often, with games like Far Cry and Metro and Fallout, I beat it on an easy setting first, then go back for punishment later. I get a lot of hours out of these games, and the key: they are FUN. I mean, I am not necessarily asking for excessive hand-holding like the quest indicators in Skyrim, but just asking for a decent save system and a difficulty slider.Games like Teleglitch and NEO Scavenger are absolutely terrible for the elitist attitudes they promote. Those games have nothing to do with FUN and everything to do with hollow acomplishments few people can even relate to. So why am I angry or even bothering? I am bothering because other than the difficulty levels, these games are interesting and COULD BE a lot of fun.Consider the absurdity of Teleglitch. That game advertises hundreds of custom guns, but guess what? 99% of those guns you will never find or even get to shoot on this side of 1000 hours of play due solely to the difficulty of the game. I just do not think that is cool. For this nightmare, NEO Scavenger, I have put in quite a few hours, and I have never even found a gun. Ever. Never won a fight. Ever. I fixed the HVAC heater, fixed the electricity, found sleeping and mummy bags, found shopping carts, and really that is about it, and I always always always died for stupid reasons that in real life would never happen. So sad that the difference between a no-star review and a 5-star review is the simple addition of a difficulty slider and custom achievements.			"

												InB4 Noob.There's games, and then there's exercises in sadism.This is an exercise in sadism.The concept isn't bad, to be honest; and I don't mind the whole permadeath thing; but the difficulty curve is just above and beyond ridiculous. You can, and -usually will- die just from wandering around, because apparently your character is some sort of lizard who can't stand temperate climates. This is just one of the many flaws; but the most glaring. This game punishes new players hard. It's very, very difficult to get into. I've yet to survive a single day game time. Unless you're willing to die hundreds of times, just to get to a reasonable point, you're better off not bothering.Immensely frustrating, seldom rewarding. And even then, you're going to die and lose all your cool stuff, so why even bother?TL:DR.If you're the sort of person who likes post apocalyptia; and enjoys inserting thumbtacks into their perineum; this is your game. If you enjoy post apocalyptia, but are sane, and don't feel like starting the same game ninety times just to get anywhere; look elsewhere for games.Definitely not recommended.			"

												I like that game, really, but it feels like an incomplete one. I started enjoing it thanks to the multiple wikias guides... but come on, that's where and when gameplay fails. Also there are some basic bugs, like losing the combat turn while changing weapon, even if you had the weapon ready in the other hand; or losing the combat turn if you check your inventory (just looking at it); and an Autosave bug that will disable almost all locations on the map so you're forced to start another game if you want to follow the plot... right, the plot. I felt like something is missing. Dialogues are well written but I just thought ""why can't I start a new life on Detroit instead of roaming like a hobo?"", no, it can't be done. Because... ok I won't spoil it, but, it's like the game has only few endings that left me still with a lot of unanswered questions in mind. It's a game released 1 and a half year ago, and I think developer should need a big hand on upgrade that nice project.It's a nice dream, and playing it leaves me just wondering how would it be once completed.

 TL;DR Neo Scavenger is a brutal 2D survival game set in a supernatural apocalypse where you try survive the wasteland of everything that wants, can, and will kill you should they ever get their claws on you. Also permadeath is on. A shining example of gameplay over graphics. Game Detail Name: Neo ScavengerGenre: Survival, Strategic Inventory ManagementPersonal score: I never knew masochism and sadism was an art form till today. Fun. What is Neo Scavenger Neo Scavenger is a 2D survival game set in a hex based world where a devastation has happened to the world and well, apocalypse thing happen and you are a survivor of it. In first glance the innocent looking graphic and the non threatening looking trailer may throw you off on how brutal this game is but as people often say, 'you don't know hell till you been there' read on. Permadeath is on btw. 1:Gameplay The main gist of Neo scavenger gameplay is well, scavenging old ruins of buildings and forest  to follow the trail of barebone story. Each hex has a protection value from beeing seen, comfort and how alert you can be when something goes near you. Each of this stats can be improved by items, shelter and other craftable. A low protection from the enviromental will make your character slowly freezes during the night and if their body temperature is already low enough they will die. A low alert level will cause your character to not wake up when threats are nearby and bandits/looter/stuff can kill you in your sleep and you will die. A low comfort will cause your character to fight less efficiently and you might suddenly fall asleep and you will die.Adding to that, the map is hex form and you have a limited numbers of move during the day and far less during the night to move around, scavenge or perform one of the many in game action before needing to end your turn for the AI to move. On each hex you can scavenge supplies with city tiles having more supplies but comes at the increase risk of being discovered by bandits and obtaining injuries. Scavenging is extremely important in this game because it is your only way of getting randomized loots early game. Pretty much everything you need can be obtain by scavenging. Which might leads to a fight should you encounter bandits while on the move.Fighting in Neo Scavenger is a game of chances and luck. A fully kited out bandit can still be defeated by you wielding nothing more than a rock but such a thing would of course take extreme luck due to the hidden diceroll system. Based on the perks you have chosen special attacks may not be available to you and only to the perk wielder. A few way fights can be resolve is through killing your opponent, dominating them and causing them to surrender or simply point your gun at them and watch them flee. Even an empty gun works occasionally to fool the AI seeing as in real life you would of course not attack the man with a gun even though its empty but you don't know that.Should you get wounded in Neo Scavenger you will have to treat them to prevent the blood loss from draining too much and yes it regenerates slowly. Wound treatment has their own special menu where you apply splints, bandages and meds to your character. Left unchecked a large wound has the potential to end your playthrough instantly. Also water and berries you collected are often time poisones because the game isn't hard enough. This might cause disease that has a similar effect to a tired status or in worse case scenario cause a total system failure which leads to your death.From all the materials you gathered from the scavenging you can use the crafting menu to create items. A wood with a sharp object will yield a spear that you can use to attack. Container with strings and stones will yield a noisemaker to increase the alert level of your campsite. Many other options exist for the player to find themselves.The player character will also experience hunger and thirst which can be reduce by eating and drinking, failure to do so will lead to death. But as mentioned earlier, most of the water and food you find in the forest where the risks are low are poisonous and consuming them will lead to death.Inventory management in Neo scavenger are quite realistic in terms of real life, your character has only 2 hands and thus can only hold 1 item in each hands without a bag. With a bag this frees up 1 hand for combat and allows more item to be carried but a bag is not your only means of carrying. Side pockets in pants, shirt and even a sledge can be found and use to help you carry more items which is especially important during end game where you often have to make far away expedition. Any item being held or use will eventually degrade before completely break down into nothing and in fact most of the things found in the wild are actually used goods and so they already have lowered durability. To beat the coldness of the night without a good shelter multiple cloths can be worn on top of each other to increase heat levels during the night and prevent freezing to death.The day and night system is also quite important. During the day enemies can spot you from further away and the same holds true for you and the during the night the decreased line of sight cause your action points to be less that during the day.As you traverse the deadly world of Neo Scavenger you might come across strange landmarks or building that will lead you to a random event. Success of survival and loot gain depends on the players perks chosen and dialog choices.And lastly the perks. During character creation you can choose several perks with perk points limiting the amount. The best perks are usually the most expensive but to help player with that negative perks can also be chosen that frees up point for more positive perks. 2:Sound Utilizing more ambient noises instead of spoken dialogs the world of neo scavenger is truly brought to life, The forest shakes and the ruined city exhibit an eerie feeling as the player explores it. But well, good filler is better than no filler. 3:Graphics Everything is sprite based no exception. The characters are sprites, the menu utilizes sprites and even the backgrounds are sprites but like other sprites these are well done enough to pass the inspection. You can clearly tell what an item is at a glance which should be the most important thing in a survival game like this.At least they do look pretty. Conclusion You will die a lot in this game. That is a fact and i hope i emphasized it enough. But the game definitely do not hold your hand at all from the moment you walk out of the facility till the next moment your guts spilled out from getting stabbed by an alcohol bottle. This game is intense. Fan of survival game should definitely get it.FInal verdict: Yes. TIPS! FIND A SHOE, SERIOUSLY.FIND SOME CLOTHES TOO WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THAT SHOE.YOU WILL DIE. AND IT'S PERMAD DEATH SO GET READY TO RESTART A LOT.BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS....don't eat those red berries.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

								hmmmm what to say about neo scavanger, i think the true question is what not to say about it! yes sure its a point click type of game with low graphics but the game play is where it matters and it dosent lack in that. each play threw towns and items and etc are in a new location which is always a good thing for replay value which there is a lot of and as for the difficulty, it is insane!   but come on if the game was easy it wouldnt be worth the 10$. it reminds me of a civilization type world with a survival type  simulation which is very intrigueing and intresting and although it is mostly done they still plan on tweaking it and adding more stuff. so all in all i do recommend the game if your not conserned about graphics or the fact that it is turn based and there is no online mode, so get out there and die alot lmao good luck			"

												This game is the best survival/adventure game you can find on steam up to this day. For some players can be distracted by graphics this game is critically underlooked but make no mistake, this game is hard, unforgiving and overall insteresting. The world of this game holds many secrets. The map can look shallow and empty at first, but if you wander around long enough you can find some really creepy or just cool locations.  Hidden lake for example The combat in this game has almost no limitations, even in most dire situtaion you can come up on top. At least i had one encounter with that happening. There was a guy with a shotgun, i had only a crowbar. I lured him to me without revealing myself, broke both his arms and took the shotty. I felt like a complete badass and you will too. Oh, and for everyone who already owns the game or wants to buy it. Unequip the copper amulet.			"

												This is the kind of game STEAM Greenlight was created for not iOS games, horrible Russian FPS and hidden item puzzle games. I am listed as having only 3.2 hours on STEAM but I have played this game for many hours. Despite being built on a somewhat janky engine NEO Scavenger is a fantastic game. You will die often like many rougue-likes but slowly but surely you will improve with each game. Its more realistic than most games as well e.g. being a nice guy rarely comes out in your favor in the post-apocalyptic US of A.  I can't recommend this game enough especially if you are a fan of roguelikes. Experiment a bit with skills. Just because you picked tough doesn't mean you will survive your first violent encounter. The game is updated frequently enough that everytime I have played the game has been improved in some way. In fact the last time I actually made it to the city there wasn't much you could do there. I hope the game continues to be updated and I still hope for more variety in items BUT the developer has ensured that each playthrough is challenging but fair.			"

												If you ever wanted to play a hobo simulator, this is it.  If you manage not to get RNG'd into the dirt some compelling storytelling awaits you, although you could always avoid it and just try to survive as long as possible.PROS:- Excellent atmosphere.- Smart writing.  It's both verbose and short when it needs to be.- Mod-friendly.- Great for both short and long gameplay sessions.- Visceral combat.  Ripping an arrow out of your arm ans stabbin a man to death with it has a certain appeal.- Sensible crafting system and multiple skill combinations encourage different playstyles.CONS:- It's not winning any graphics awards.  Fortunately this doesn't draw away from the strength of the gameplay, but still...I could see someone not digging the look.- The RNG God really holds power over this game.  It's hard not to feel like the whole world is against you when you can't find a pair of shoes and your shopping bag full of whiskey and twinkies rips open.  Which leads to my next point.- The whole world is pretty much out to get you.  There are a couple of somehwat less hostile areas but for the most part everything in this game wants to kill you.  It's like Australia, except Michigan.- Visceral combat.  It's pretty soul-crushing to finally find a backpack and a decent pair of shoes only to later discover that someone has beat your head in with a sauce pan while you were asleep.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.Basically, this is the kind of difficulty and immersiveness you will find in this game.			"

												I killed the dogman, wore his fur and cured his meat.Gathered clothes, had matching shoes, and started a camp in the Cryo Facility. I was on my way to fixing the heat and electrical systems.And then I showed mercy to two feral dogs outside of my camp. I let them whimper away bleeding from their wounds.They came back with more dogs.I should have never stockpiled so many cured meats.10/10 would fight dogman again.11/10 would build Strong + Melee again to get tape of me kicking dogmans♥♥♥♥♥			"

												This is the kind of game STEAM Greenlight was created for not iOS games, horrible Russian FPS and hidden item puzzle games. I am listed as having only 3.2 hours on STEAM but I have played this game for many hours. Despite being built on a somewhat janky engine NEO Scavenger is a fantastic game. You will die often like many rougue-likes but slowly but surely you will improve with each game. Its more realistic than most games as well e.g. being a nice guy rarely comes out in your favor in the post-apocalyptic US of A.  I can't recommend this game enough especially if you are a fan of roguelikes. Experiment a bit with skills. Just because you picked tough doesn't mean you will survive your first violent encounter. The game is updated frequently enough that everytime I have played the game has been improved in some way. In fact the last time I actually made it to the city there wasn't much you could do there. I hope the game continues to be updated and I still hope for more variety in items BUT the developer has ensured that each playthrough is challenging but fair.			"

								This game is one of those low-tech gems that you find yourself immersed in despite it's obvious difficulty and it's lack of flashy presentation. You experience the life of someone in a strange, while still somewhat familiar world and you are left to what you can find to survive among a population that is more aggressive than passive. Friends are in a short supply, as are the means to adequately defend yourself from both the enemies of the world and the elements of it, two threats the game pits against you that are only outweighed by the threat you pose to yourself and your body's basic needs for survival.Can it look better? Probably. Does it need to look better? Absolutely not. Throw away what you think a game should look like and remember instead what a game should be, because that's what you'll find here. Certainly a selection for the determined as you will suffer inexplicable loss time and time again, but the constant struggle for survival make all of the moments of success you encounter, however many or few that you may find they be, all the more rewarding.

								Great game. I have to admit at the begining when i died every 15 hours was frustrating, then i began to look at those buttons on the screen and discovered crafting, now it is just pretty dang awesome. In fights it would be a little better if you had a better idea of what was happening, and it is really confusing at the begining, but it was very fun discovering things about the game. I do recomend if you buy this game mayber to look at a quick guide. not a full one as those ruin the fun but a small one to get you sorted with the crafting system and the  such. 9/10 i cant wait to see how it developes.

								NEO ScavengerNEO Scavenger is a game that wants you to die. Even more than that, it is a game that wants to kill you. Brutally and rapidly if possible, but slowly will work just as well. From hypothermia to bandit attacks to starving to death, it pulls no punches in the “you’re going to die” department. It is an unforgiving game and makes no apologies about it. Quite frankly, that’s one of the reasons it succeeds so well. Before you go running off without reading further, allow me a moment to elaborate. A single paragraph is all I’m asking.You see, NEO Scavenger also wants you to succeed. It does supply you with the tools and skills you need in order to survive. It simply doesn’t hold your hand or coddle you along the way. You begin simply enough. You start the game by picking your few basic skills and you wake up on the floor of a cryogenic freezing lab with something mean heading your way. Your journey has just begun in earnest. You may use your chosen skills to assist with the incoming creature, via feeding it another survivor or simply locking the door. The skills you have chosen to outfit yourself often change the game in this way, leading to all kinds of different outcomes to little problems like this. It’s undeniably gratifying to halt an enemy attack by using your hacking skill to drop a cryogenic tank and feeding the creature a reality television star. Let’s be honest; who hasn’t wanted to do that at one point or another?Are you still with me? I thought that might get your attention. The aim of the game is fairly simple; find out who you are and what happened to the world. Things take place in a post-apocalyptic environment, and you have no memory of any of it. It’s fairly standard, but it plays out relatively well nonetheless. Hints are revealed through old newspapers you find scattered about and obvious visual cues. Your hand is never held at any point, there is no tutorial, and there are no retries. When you die, it is game over and you start again from the beginning. NEO Scavenger is a harsh, unforgiving piece of work. But you also get a little better each time, get a little further, and learn a little more. It’s tough, often seems unfair, and is always exciting.Technically, it is a pretty solid game. It’s still in development, so it does have its share of bugs and incomplete features, but what is currently present does work well and you shouldn’t be deterred from giving it a shot if you find yourself at all interested. Over the course of the next few months it will be fleshed out and cleaned up, and it’s looking like it will become a great little game. I would recommend it easily enough, especially considering the $10 price tag attached to it. If you think you might be interested, and don’t mind a rough edge or two, give it a shot. If you think you can take the abuse, that is.  "

								A very good survival horror game. I first got the game on the 'Free Demo' mode and found it good fun. So, I invested the money and got the full version. There are quite a few improvments in the Full Version, but not really worth the proce tag. Still, I enjoyed the game for a good few hours, and once I reached the town in the south east corner of the map found that there wasn't really much else to do to keep you playing any further. I would either stick to the Demo, or wait for the game to go on sale. I would add too that this is a 'Early Access' game, so I am also looking forward to the 'Full Version' in the future ;)			"

Posted: July 19, 2015
												An amazing rogue-like that blends modern post-apocalyptic modern societal downfall with urban legend and the occult for a very unique setting.  While the game is not without its flaws, I still think it was very worth playing.The problem with a review like this is that it is hard to recommend the game without exposing story or gameplay elements that are in a lot of ways crucial to the game experience.  As with many roguelikes, game knowledge is crucial to success.  Unlike many, NEO is on of the few roguelikes that uses fixed story and locations and events.  The random elements come in the form of items found from looting and NPC encounters.  The game does not require any combat to complete it, and much of the items lack the progression and semi-uniqueness found in fantasy roguelikes.  There are shotguns, but no +3 shotguns of ammo conservation.  Skills are chosen at the start of the game and do not improve, and you cannot level up.  Thus a large part of the experience is in exploring the unknown of the map, the story, and the game's mechanics rather than the depth of its progression mechanics.  This is both a unique appeal of the game and a flaw.  It fits the setting and feel of the game with the player as a normal person and lends to a stronger story, but further playthroughs are not so meaningful when you know where to go on the unrandomized map and what dialogue options to choose and what items to craft.  If you want a Binding of Isaac, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, or Tales of Maj'eyal, this is not the same game.The story and setting deserve a special mention before I talk about the gameplay.  The content that is there is a good amount of content that allows for diverse approach, good for someone exploring the game for the first time.  However, by the end my feeling was there wasn't nearly enough of it.  The game map is large but a certain portion of the map is lacking in almost any of the game's unique elements.  While the game does indicate the location of a major world feature near the beginning, by chance a new player could decide to explore in the wrong cardinal direction and end up wandering around finding nothing but RNG encounters and generic locales for many many hours.   There are a few locales given extra detail in presentation but with no story attached to them nor reason to revisit, and given the fixed nature of the game's events at this locations it would have been nice for the developers to make more of them.  These and some various 'random' events are presented in a Choose Your Own Adventure book style with events presented in text with a few choices for action.  The fixed events are well written and choices can be very meaningful, but in the random events the choices dont reflect outcomes very well or nearly at all thus making those outcomes feel mostly arbitrary.  Compared to how good the fixed locale events are House at Seven Gables I'm looking at you, the random ones feel like low-effort filler at best and an excuse to abuse the player character at worst when things turn out badly for no good reason.Additionally, it is bizarre to me that while the game is a permadeath one it doesn't delete your save after giving you a you a time-limited info dump at the end of the game.  When game knowledge is so crucial to the experience and the story, why freely let the player reload the game at his last save and ask different questions at the info dump?  I'm not against the info dump in principle, its just strange.  This ties into my discussion of game mechanics next as it is important to note here that once you finish the game it becomes apparent that the main thing preventing the player from progressing to the end of the game and rolling the credits is just not knowing where the location for that event is the first time they play.  As I said before, game knowledge and first time experiences are the meat of the game here.Mechanics wise, the game is very solid when it comes to combat and health as well as how it treats item management.  Its a nice unique spin that doesn't just use HP and stat points like most, has some good surprises, and gives the player plenty of incentive to pick any of the skills at character creation.  Hunger, sleep, and weather are important more than just their immediate lethality from running out and triggering a game over.  Combat has a great mix of options and interactions as you play out whether you attack or wait for a good moment, or space yourself and try to run.  The only real disappointment I had with the game's item selection is that there wasn't MORE to pick from!  I wanted more cool things to find from poking around city ruins and by the time you finish the game you will very likely see every item the game has to offer with no +3 shotguns to spice up the mix.  Item crafting is slightly clunky but useful, but again only game knowledge prevents you from crafting one of the best melee weapons in the game two minutes in.  The game even has diseases but  it is practically inevitable that during the normal course of the game the player character will become infected with a disease that for any non-wiki spoiled player will be almost unavoidably lethal, which makes for a very odd check of the player's skill.  Lastly, the permadeath nature of the game is a strong contributor to the feeling of being a very mortal normal person that the game tries to present.  I clocked in 46 hours into the game, most of it in a fairly exploratory playthough where I spend a fairly good amount of time hording supplies and  preparing for unknowns with caution.   This felt appropriate, and I still died quite a few times despite my preparation.  I engaged in a fairly modest amount of savescumming for this one playthrough. and it is only apparent afterwards that the preparation wasn't so necessary and that the unique locales and events therein are not required to finish the game.  Again, the wonder of the game is in your first time experiencing what it has to offer.  Either I was supposed to learn to be more YOLO and careless and suicide rush to find new unexplored content, or I was expected to make an even larger time sink than I did from my cautious play.  46 hours is a lot, so seeing a sort of soft-death (such as saving only every 3 in game days or the like) might have been nicer than permadeath or savescumming.All in all, I loved the game's mechanics and the genuinely emotion invoking experiences it provided.  Absolutely worth the full $15 in my mind.  I would highly reccomend it to those wanting a story and setting focused roguelike, less so to those not experienced with the genre.  If you play, don't feel too bad if you have to savescum a bit.			"

It's challenging. A game without challenge is pointless. When you first start playing, you will get yourself killed multiple times, in a variety of different ways. This will keep happening unless you engage your brain, and use the tools available to survive. Permadeath means that you can't afford to make mistakes, which makes the game much more intense, and progression is much more fulfilling. I wouldn't have it any other way. 10/102. Gameplay. This game is a sandbox turn-based rogue-likeish RPG. Some may not like this sort of game, but I've played many games of this sort, and it's the best of the lot. Most of these sorts of games over-complicate everything, and gameplay suffers as a result. This is not the case for Neo-Scavanger! The sandbox element is the cherry on top - do whatever the hell you want to do. Perfect! :D 10/102. Focus is on gameplay and NOT on graphics etc. Too many games these days look nice, but in reality they have no replayability or depth. Neo-Scavanger is the opposite - the graphics and UI allow you to play the game, they are not there to be pretty . It's graphics and art are still great though, proper old-school stuff. Also, there is the added benefit that ANY computer will be able to run this game. It's built in flash, so if your PC can handle some random online flash game, it can handle Neo-Scavanger no problem. 10/103. Depth. This game is deep! I have been playing for a few days now, and I have barely scratched the surface. I've just about got the point where I can reliably survive in the wilds, and have yet to actually explore the world. The game is mysterious, it's hard to know what the game will throw at me as I continue to play, and I love that feeling in a game. 10/104.Lore and story. I like anything to do with post-apocalytic settings etc, who doesn't? I havn't really played enough to comment on this aspect of the game, but from what I've played so far the writing and story is top-notch. 10/105. Thoughtful developers who listen. Having read a few dev posts, it is obvious that they care about this game. They are very open to suggestions and discussion. 10/106. Mods. I haven't researched the mods much, but I know that they do indeed exist. Always great to have that option!Summary: 11/10. Buy this game now! Even if you normally don't like this sort of game, give it a go! It's cheap ;) "

												This game is great because it gives a feeling of gritty realism while only simulating things that are actually interesting to play. The crafting system alone will give you hours of fun just figuring out what makes what. Every minor victory feels important and gratifying. Not even close to being able to beat it yet, but I don't even care.			"

								I love this game. It's a lot of fun, and the writing for events is great! This game's mechanics have a steep learning curve, but is just fun after. The combat shows realism, and encourages not beating to death everyone, but rather beating up, trying to make surrender, or even kill with a ranged weapon. Also, the skills are useful. For a example, if your tired of freezing to death, get trapping. You can make a campfire from friction. Also, the current special areas are amazing, and have quite a bit hidden surprises. (There is even a haunted house!) Go play this game, it's just 10.00 US dollars, and is worth even more than that. It requires scavenging a lot, and the name live up to it. For those preferring strategic turn-based games, buy this.			"

												It's a interesting game and I would play it more but it has no working save feature. So I can never finish the game. I don't know why the game developers can't add an autosave, to the game that I already have as an update.I read that steam users can have a beta copy with an autosave built in. But I have no idea where to get that beta. It is a fun game to play it has replay value. But due to the half baked"" we save this game as cookies"" witch your web browser gleefully deleates is totally freakin stupid. It just ruined an otherwise good game. This is just what I think your results maybe different. peace			"

								This game is brilliantly complex disguised as a simple turn based strategy game. The creator has done a wonderful job creating a sense of turmoil and survival in this ruined alternate world. Gameplay mechanics need a little work, and the learning curve is a bit blind but I have no doubt once its all sorted out, this game will be packed with mystery and intrigue even more than it is now.

This game WILL kick you in your junk over and over again, yet you will find yourself coming back for more because the gameplay is just THAT GOOD.			"

												With the launch of Neo Scavenger I figured I would share my thoughts on this title.The good:* Great atmosphere.* Punishingly hard gameplay. One mistake and you die and have to start over.* Combat is best visceral and brutal. It's all text based but very well done.* Mostly well written story.The bad:* Pacing is really off. Feeding yourself off rabbits can take several in-game hours.* You sometimes feel like you're playing a hobo.* Sometimes too hard.* Lack of real character development options.* Unguided gameplay. You really have to dig deep to find the story and main quest.That said, I still think this is a superb title. "

												I really like this game, early on it was garbage, and now it's seriously got where I rank it in one of my favorite games. Took it a long time to get there. I have 25 years of video game playing expeirence, from the mothers milk of mario to your level 100 wow character. This game actually felt enjoyable to play and not just a clone. I like things that are uniquie and this game is uniquie in survival game genre. They did a good job, it's not easily noticable at first, but the true adventure expeirence is if you can actually travel a great distance in the game there a lot of interesting things to discover. pros:turn based with advanced fighting tactics *****Actually challengeing gameplay *****New things to discover in a fantasy world, I know thats a first right? *****Can die in under 3 turns *****npcs are challegening skillfull to defeat then pay to win or grind to win gear finding. Rocks are extremely useful *****cons:savefile system sucks it's like flash based or w.e so if you clean your computer bye bye save file.Could be even more complex and challengeing, it's good don't get me wrong but it could be seriously milked harder into a legendary game.Out of my expierence of playing almost every game ever made, I give this game these ratings.fun: 1000/1000 starinteresting story: 900/1000 starreplayability: 200/1000 starcreativity in design: 20/1000 starfeeling not like a cloned idea but actually improved apon in it's genere: 1000/1000is it a legendary game that will always be fun like mario 6? 1/1000To me it's worth 5-10$Hours of gameplay probably 8 broken up and played when you want to play a game that doesn't use much cpu.Once you get op gear will it be boring as hell and never played again? Probably I heard and seen for myself where you can get the good guns and gear easily, it was infact way more easier then it should ever be possible. Really fun story and npc interaction though.Total score compared to all the games I've played: 550/1000 good for it's price but not addicting and has a lot of useless starter abilities like electrician that do not really anything currently, yeah it looks good and can be gotten away with until someone uses a wiki, but meh I expected better? Needs a lot more work to become a legendary game.Also food for thought I rate world of warcraft a 330/1000 more of a social game.			"

												Game is pretty much empty. You can do few things that are detailed but that is all you can do. Just check the news for ""updates"" and you will see there is almost nothing. Fixes with very few new things and some advertisement like ""best RPG"" or ""NEO Scavenger discount"" I got this as a gift and I'm thankful but game is pretty repetitive, the whole ""STORY"" is always the same even the locations and dialogues are the same so what is the point ? Only thing that can help this is some content added by yourself (mods) that will add things ( weapons, clothes, food, misc., locations etc. and there are very few of those and they aren't even that compatible ( I tried myself ) ). So, no don't buy this. Ask your friend who has this if you could borrow their Steam for a while to play this and you will see for yourself it is not much. I have to admit at the BEGINNING it WAS FUN when you discover stuff you find special locations and items and so on, but after you repeat that ( and believe me you will because you will die A  L OT until you understand this game enough to survive long enough to discover something that actually is special (there are few locations.) ) So once again, sorry but ! NO DON'T BUY THIS !			"

												If youre going to have a survival game you should probably have a chance at getting a fair ways away from the start point. If youre looking for a brutal survival game youve found it. Pay $15 to freeze to death, over and over and over and over. It dident seem to matter what i found, two boots a shirt and pants to wear, froze to death. A good campsite, Death. but i digress. The UI you have to navagate is confusing and clunky i had to fumble around just pressing buttons for the first 15 minutes and i still dont fully understand it yet. This game has a simular style to the original fallout and by that i mean it seems like a duplicate exept in fallout you can acctually play for more than 10 minutes without parishing. There are seemingly cool ideas implemented into this game, a crafting system (wich you will never utalize before you Parish) drivable vehicles (wich you have no chance of utalizing for before mentioned reasons) and a campsite system (wich bearly helps you suvive). I see the efforts of the developer but its all wasted by brutal difficulty. The kind of difficulty that makes Dragons easyer to kill than snowy sabre cats in skyrim.			"

												Never let it be said that you need a tripple A studio, an army of designers, developers and artists, and boundless resources to make a game that's challenging and fun.Neo Scavenger is a breath of nostalgic air, harping games like Wasteland and Fallout, but with the new hardcore survival-style normally only found in modern titles like Rust. Just a dash of RPG elements, an elloquent crafting system and an intense focus on resource management (though ""scrabbling"" might be the better word) the world of NS is a brutal one.Combat is surprisingly deep considering it takes place almost entirely through text, and often results in a desperate brawl. You'll never be too well equipped, as even the best gear can't save you from some of the nasties out there. Planning, tactics and luck will see you through though!That being said, it's not perfect. There's a few terrible bugs, save games can be lost, and the nature of RNG can sometimes leave the player in unfortunate or outright unfair situations. Balance and tweaking post release will likely fix this.But if you've missed games that punish you, or just have masochistic tendancies then this is the game for you.			"

Early Access Review
								I definitly reccomend this game. This game is truly unique and the odds are never in your favor. for example: you could have a pistol and the other guy could have a stick, and you might miss and then he gives you a sever traumatic brain injury. The combat may be just choices, but besides it being turn based, and besides only clicking options repeatedly, its still fun to scavenge and work your way up from having only your bare hands to defend yourself to having a camp, guns, and a good amount of other items. And it gets BETTER! Its so in depth that you could get an infection if you put dirty rags on your cuts, you coult get knocked upside the head and people will grab your weapons and kill you in your sleep, you could trigger booby traps, etc. this game has very good potential, and i dont think there is any way someone could mess this game up for me. some people think its boring? not me. I love it! :D                                                                                                                                                               -Arize_Nation			"

												If you have an active imagination and love post-apocalyptic atmosphere, this game will really suck you in. Every game has it's problems, including this one, but this is really a work of love and art, and I appreciate it greatly for what it is. I started playing again after taking a couple years off and have really been enjoying the extensive changes and additions. *thumbs up*			"

												I remember taking a chance on this game a few years ago when it was bare bones.  I remember thinking the potential this game has and I couldn't wait for it to release.  I have not been disappointed.  This is one of the better survival games I have played and it will take multiple play throughs for you to see all of the content.  Be prepared to die a lot because while the game may look simple all it takes is one bad encounter or even one lucky punch for you to be knocked unconscious, coughing blood, robbed then left for dead.

												Rather fantastic, if somwhat suffering from a poor UI.Think Fallout 2, crossed with Day Z, with a little bit of Dwarf Fortress. This game really makes you feel it, (in a good way).Due to it's surprisingly deep narrative and RPG mechanics i'd highly recomend 'Save Scumming'  at the start of everyday. It's easy to find out how.It would be hard to recomend without being able to restart at the last day if needed. As although the enviroment is randomised, key locations and story are not. Leading to at best a lot of repitition.If you restrict yourself to a new day a new save, you still feel (a much lessend)  loss if you die, but can stomach carrying on. As death often comes brutal and almost instant. Or worse slow and you don't know it for a few days. But maybe you could (but not allways) fix it if you had the day over.In short, it's great, if you play with 'groundhog day' rules			"

												Two different approaches to this game:- go in head first with the character traits most similar to your own, following actions you would normally take (usually followed by dying horribly)- youtube how to play effectively and stay alive longer than 24 hours and wiki how to craft decent itemsEither way, this is one of the best indie games I have played, with loads of replayability. It can be unforgiving at times, but with practice (or google) you can make this dystopia your b*tch.TL;DR - rewards those who like a challenge "

This game provides a fun mix of survival tactic with RPG feel.This game is like Oregon Trail mixed with Civilization with a nice sandbox combination.Great job Blue Bottle Games! I know this game is still in early access past its release date, but i hope you are able to finish it, polish it up and deliver it to the public because this game is definatly worth investing in.

You need a lot of luck too.

												Barely changed or expanded since it was a web game, very easy to beat the survival aspect, only to die in poorly sign-posted instant death scenarios. Death by 1980's adventure game logic, but here you can't just reload because it's a rogue-like. Brilliant.Did I mention how plodding and slow it all is? Going from one side of the map to the other can literally take you hours, and there's only about one or two actual sites you could encounter on crossing the entire map.  As in there literally only seems to be about four places to go and most of them are lacking in interactivity. I would expect such a lo-fi game to have a lot of content, but it seems Blue Bottle would disagree with me.			"

												An interesting concept, but the game is plagued with too many practical gameplay issues. Crafting is cumbersome and time-consuming, UI wise, without no need for such.A lot of gameplay mechanics are not well explained (if at all), and it's sometimes not practical to find out about them without looking up stuff on the web (think, ""hidden instruction manual"").The ending scenario is super frustating, a lot of choices resulting in death (or injury/difficulty) with little indication of how things can turn out (again without looking it up online)...

												I think this game is super unbalanced in terms of how much luck you need to get through it. It's really hard to survive combat without one of the combat traits but in taking combat traits you loose the survival traits that keep you alive over the long haul. It's not uncommon to spend a couple hours building yourself and your camp up up just to get wrecked by a dog you couldn't out run. Ultimately the scavenging and crafting are alright but the combat system is really what gets me. There is no consistant means of escape and no way to tell how much health your opponent has or has lost during the battle. On a side note I'm really interested in the story elements of the game. I want to see the robot facility and I want to find out whats in the middle of the swamp but I just feel like I'm spending all of my time dealing with malnutrition and water poisoning. This is again another luck based flaw. If you can't find a tin can or a pot to boil water in your as good as dead within the first day or so. In all honesty I think the best way to fix that would be to have more set, consistent points in the game. That way I""m not forraging through settlement after settlement just to have varying results of survival gear, weapons or neurishment which leave the players superunder capable of surviving.Maybe I""m missing things that others figured out but there isn't even a tutorial system to introduce you to the interface.

												Wasted potential. A neat idea made unbearable by an inexcusably horrendous interface, glitches and things that don't make sense and completely break any immersion. More chore than challenge; would not recommend.- - - - - - The interface is absolutely horrible for no reason other than bad design. You're going to be clicking on things at least five times more than you have any right to. What's worse, once you explore the map a bit, the game begins to be unreasonably slow and unresponsive.- - - - Game suffers from bugs that have no right to be in the final product. For example, if you get exiled from the city, get a different tracking bracelet and try to get it again, the game will treat the new bracelet as the old one and won't let you back in. What's worse, the only way to get back is to literally wait (!!!) for an entire year of game-time (8760 turns).- - - - Unimmersive; for a survival game, surviving stops being any challenge whatsoever as soon as you reach the city outskirts and stay there. You can live safely and comfortably indefinitely while earning a shootload of money, and the only reason to leave safety is to push the story forward. Also, the character is supposed to be someone who got dropped into this post-apocalyptic world out of the blue, yet in the extremely limited NPC interactions he somehow already knows about things he hasn't even come close to seeing. The ""crafting recipes found on random pieces of paper scattered all over the place"" thing not only makes no sense, but is also largely useless as they more often than not show obvious things like ""heat source + kindling = fire"", or ""binoculars + strap = binoculars with strap"".- - - It's a wiki game; the game itself fails to give you even the most basic information about things for no good reason; for example, weapon reach, not to mention things like weapon damage, etc. The player has to look things up that he really shouldn't need to, and even then, the wiki itself doesn't bother listing a lot of useful information about a lot of things, which shows a lack of any real player interest.- Minimum in-game sounds, almost no music.~ Game might seem ""unfair"" to a lot of people who dislike dicerolling and are used to streamlined games. Some situation can simply kill you, and there's nothing you can do about it. Permadeath.+ A challenging and exciting early-game. Caution and risk management are needed, and running for it is often the correct choice.+ An interesting, strategic and tactical battle system, once you get the hang of it.+ Character creation is also interesting, which lets you choose traits and disadvantages (which let you choose more traits)			"

												Played the demo for a long time and finally decided to buy this game.Pros:-Learning curve is very fun and challenging-No level progression, so if you die, all you are really losing are items. No need to re-grind back up to level 200-Very atmospheric-Character customization is decentCons:-Very empty characters, only defining traits are those chosen at the start of the game. No real room for roleplaying.-Story is very difficult to uncover without multiple runs, and when you do uncover it, its also very empty and disappointing.-Music is so nonexistent that sometimes i forget its there-Dying is a bit unbalanced, explained more belowIf i have a fur coat, with a backpack jammed with goodies, and im wielding a crowbar, i should NOT get killed by a half naked man with his bare fists just because he had the ""Strong"" trait. Also getting OHK'd by a dogman when im in top shape because he just so happened to swing at my upper chest and got a good hit in, causing me to go into cardiac arrest. This may be a roguelike but that doesnt excuse poor game balance by the developers.Ill play this game from time to time when im bored but im definitely not jumping on this everyday when i wake up in the morning because im so excited to make ANOTHER empty character who i kill with alcohol poisoning because ive survived for about 5 years. (because thats how simple this game is once you master it)Game review aside, you should try Cataclysm DDA, its a free OpenGL game, and its wickedly addictive.Rating: 5/10Verdict: Buy it on sale if you have nothing more important on your wishlist.

However, this game let me down. It let me down on every fundemental level possible for a game of it's genre, especially for the price. I'd recommend instead, downloading and playing Catacylsm : Dark Days Ahead. The game is within the same genre, but has a much more robust supply of activites to do in the game, and various styles to play the game. The best part of the game recommended is that is free. Hilariously this is the first time I can ever say Catacylsm also has a better UI than another game as well			"

												For a game like this, you have to compare it to the other games in its genre, survival. I can think of Don't Starve and This War of Mine. Both games are probably superior to Neo Scavanger in both polish, balance and depth. The story/rpg elements in Neo Scavanger are very light so not worth mentioning. The main thing Neo scavanger has going for it compared to these two titles is it is turn-based.Don't starve has the most depth and polish.This War of Mine offers the most control (least randomness).Neo Scavanger offers turn-based experience and is probably more random.So do I recommend it? Well, I really like my games to be turn-based. If you are like me, consider getting this on a sale. Otherwise, the other two games are probably superior.Edit: Aaand I just got hit by a playthrough ruining bug involving my shopping cart bursting and the game not calculating my encumberance correctly.

You can really get emersed in this game trying to survive by keeping all of your stat conditions at the best they can possibibly be. NEO Scavenger is a great game that you can play over and over and never get tired of it because its different almost everytime (except for locations i think they stay in the same place I have a really good playthrough atm so im not sure). The traits that you can get at the begining of the game can really help or hurt you depending on what kind of playthrough you want to do. All in all, Neo Scavenger gets a 8.5/10 in my book.			"

												I know most of the reviews for this are positive. I'm not.I don't know what the developers did with the game but it is now impossible to play. Back when I played the beta and early release I could get to Detroit 9/10 times. Now I have played 5 times and I have died every time in 2-3 days from the never ending attacks or the freezing cold.It seems that they ramped up the difficulty by a lot.I'm not asking for an EASY game, but one in which I can survive enough to have fun playing it.I used to have fun. Not anymore.			"

												Neo scavenger is VERY fun infact i have almost 90 hours played (offline so it dosent count) but it has 1 single flaw that ruins the entire game and makes is almost unplayable, the saving is not done tradionally but instead saves with flash cookies which is not even remotely acceptable for a game that costs 16.99$ (cad) because after hours of playing your save is just wiped because your antivirus might think its malware or some other bogus reason.tldr: fix the saving and i will reccomend it.

												I've played this game for 14 hours, and I'm angry. Hear me roar.I played for 14 hours, slaughtered COUNTLESS beasties, raiders and robbers. I killed something called a ""melonhead"" and I've slaughtered so many dogs I could wear their skins and pretend to be the wolf-man.It was at that time - as I munched down another human steak, made on the desecrated remains of a man who had tried to steal my sled in the middle of the night, that I was assaulted. Well, it was actually while I slept after having eaten the corpse of the aformentioned adversary, seeing as time apparently stops when you eat things.In any case, let me recount to you, the story of Philip the Doghide boy.Philip, just as any man, awoke from cryogenic stasis in a secret lab, where he was quickly faced with a hideous creature screaming like the midnight wind 'cross a praire of bones so sharp as knives. And much like that praire of bones, the dogman was soon still and dead. You see, Philip was a total badass, and he vanquished this horrific beast with a few swift uppercuts and rock-hard right-left combos. The beast lay dead, and not satisfied with merely having sent this beast's soul to dogman-heaven, Philip decided that it's skin looked comfortable. He grabbed a shard of glass, cut it open and wore it's pelt - face and all, possibly while dancing to some trance-music and smearing cheap lipstick on himself. Naked. In front of a mirror.After that psychadellic trip, Philip wandered out into the wilderness, wearing nothing but the skin of his dead adversary. He was messed with. Attacked by rabid dogs and feral.. Dogs. And more dogs. This game has a lot of dogs. If you don't like killing dogs, this is probably not the game for you.Anyway, needless to say, dogs never really posed a problem for Philip. Philip had two good pairs of hands, and he had a shank made of glass in one of them. Philip was not to be ♥♥♥♥ed with.Now, Philip was a hulking mass of death, even when armed with nothing but a shard of glass, so I'll assume you understand what happened when Philip found a crowbar and a loaded shotgun in a shed. That's right. Philip turned into a lean, mean, psychopathic killing machine. This brings us to a dark chapter of Philip's life. The killing. The killing never stopped.Philip was a soulless husk of a man, and that crowbar whispered sweet things in his ears at night. It craved for blood. Lusted for it. Philip was renamed ""Philip Mordake"".Philip tried to fight it, of course. Philip was no murderer.. Philip merely loved to kill dogs, but that didn't matter. For each person that crossed Philip's path, the crowbar screamed. It pleaded, begged and demanded of Philip.. Terrible things. Great things. But terrible things.It drove him to insanity, the whispering. The screams. They all melded together as Philip gave in to the crowbar's crazed yelling. He'd separate flesh from bone, and smash until there was nothing left but something that barely resembeled a human. He'd eat the flesh. Why not? Cut it loose with a shard of glass, and eat chunk by chunk until he was no longer starving.Philip's path on this strange earth was carved from the blood and bone of any that entered his path. Any that dared touch his sled. Philip was a cruel God on this earth, his fury tempestous and his retribution violent and brutal as it was swift. He cut many a foe from existance, and wore their remains as trophies.This brings us to the end of Philip's journey. For Philip had been surprised to wake up in the middle of the night, at the sound of somebody stealing his sled! That could not happen - no not at all. And Philip's recourse to this - though predictable - was a thing to behold. He knocked down that poor thief, and whaled with his crowbar until there was naught left of his adversary. Philip hadn't even been injured at this. He was in perfect health, and continued to be so as he smeared himself with the blood of his enemy (note; you can't actually do this in the game. You'll wish you could, though.) and sat himself down again. He dozed off, and once more awoke. This time, to the face of the very first foe that he'd faced.It was a Dogman, looming above him like a gaunt, shadowy behemoth. The crowbar awoke. It screamed. It begged for blood, and Philip didn't have to be asked twice. He leapt for the creature! He cut it down, and bit it's flesh with that accursed crowbar time and time again! A hailstorm of blows weakened the beast, and it desperately slashed out!...Philip was struck in the heart, and died immediately. And the crowbar fell from his hand, going silent.. It was just a normal crowbar.Now, you might think that's an amusing story. Or maybe you hated that story, but let me tell you what.I spent 14 HOURS. 14 BLOODY HOURS ON PHILIP.Philip was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ED MONSTER! He was the toughest thing since diamonds armed with shanks in a cuban jail.He'd survived battles with up to three opponents at once, and though injured, he'd come out on top.And now he just got killed instantly because of some fantastic stroke of good fortune for some psuedo-werewolf.This game is interesting, but it's interesting for about 10 minutes. If you've discovered amazing loot in one house, you've basically found all there is in this game. Sure, there are random events and such, but very few of them actually lead anywhere. You're Philip, and you'll always be Philip. Not Philippa, or Sam, or James the Jive♥♥♥♥♥Jukebox Jockey. Philip.You'll pick your perks, disadvantages and roll out. You die because of silly reasons or because you had a bad start. And then you have to start all over, without any progress having been made.After a while, it becomes tedious. It's not fun to micro-manage your campfire, clothes, hydration and hunger-levels, as well as spend the ENTIRE GAME TRYING TO FALL ASLEEP, I MEAN♥♥♥♥♥♥ JUST FALL ASLEEP, MAN! YOU JUST MASSACRED AN ENTIRE VILLAGE!All in all, I'd refund this game if I hadn't hate♥♥♥♥ed 14 hours of gameplay out of it. Do yourself a favour and look at a youtube-clip of somebody playing it without audio first. That will be your life in this game. Like what you see? Go for it.			"

												I was really excited for the game. When I got it, it played well nothing wrong there. Then I realized that the saved games where somehow stored in local temp files on my computer, which can get cleaned from time to time, therefore, whiping out my saved game. After I lost a couple games without realizing it, I lost faith in the game real quick. I am not sure if this was my fault or the game developers, but it tarnished my experience with the game. Overall, I was really impressed with the detail put into the game. I agree with what everyone says here in the forum about the game. I just got a bad experience thats all.			"

												I really wanted to like this game more.The problem is:Although the game offers some perspective and interpretation of reality in a different manner than most survival games - like having and observing ""circumstances"" instead of certain stats - I think it lacks the enjoyable gameplay in most survival games. It's sometimes too unreasonable to die and what it offers you is mostly scavenging around which gets quite repetitive after some time. It's hard to understand why anybody would like such a game too dependent on inventory management. Crafting is painful to me. When I try to consider the game content and atmosphere, I feel like it lacks certain aspects, there's nothing really interesting compared to other post-apocalyptic games. I'm really sorry to say this game is a disappointment to me. I don't recommend it, but it might be really enjoyable to you.			"

												I'll just put it this way: I should have downloaded the demo first. I think my biggest gripe was the UI and difficulty in figuring out what I'm supposed to do within that interface. The trailer showing what the game was like seemed a little deceiving as well. Oh well, at least I got it on sale and save a whopping $5. I'd recommend it for people who'd have lots of time to figure out the game, but not someone who wants to jump into it and understand what they're doing immediately.			"

												You will freeze to death with one left boot on. This is the game in its entirety. I've played several survivor horror games in the past and I was looking forward to something different. Text/ turn based survival horror appealed to me.  At first, you kinda have to get used to the controls. Click this tab to do this, click this tab to do that. Click this button to turn off the text so you can do the only thing available to do. Speaking of, skills in this game are pretty much worthless.  Ya, some skills actually do stuff. Melee does help in combat, you can Hide while you explore the map, Botany gives you more loot to choose from in forest tiles, some cutscene you use tracking to reveal more text about something that happened when they just could have told you in the first place what happened. Other skills don't matter. Mechanical and Hide give you the ability to scavange buildings safely but reduce the probability of loot while scavenging.  Medic give you the ability to scavenge for medical supplies in the spawn point and gives you better healing but if you don't have any medicine ...who cares!  Your best bet is to hit the road and gather as much as you can to help you survive. The very first town you find will give you a cutscene and a little back story and that's usually it. Most times than not, this town is empty of stuff to take. So, you move out and explore the area around. And as you wander, in the cold and rain, you start suffering from hypothermia. You ""could"" build a fire but in the thirty five- fourty games straight that I played (because you almost always die within the first two in game days) I've found a lighter twice.  Now, as you reach near death due to freezing to death , you get a cutscene about an abondoned car. The car has a sleeping bag inside and if you use the Tracking skill, you will find one left boot. You can grab the sleeping bag and carry it to your camp, which camps always attract dogs, and if a dog or a soldier doesn't come into your camp and kill you, you can sleep for a few hours and warm up . But that just slows the inevitable. For the only out come for this game is..... you'll freeze to death with one left boot.			"

												NEO Scavenger is a fantastic, retro throwback to CRPGs of yore and a brutal simulation of post-apocalyptic survival. It's also one of the most frustratingly difficult games I've played. For every bit of smooth, crispy tactics and intriguing story bit you get, there's a death that comes within two minutes of booting the game, or scavenging five different city hexes with every effort coming up empty. It's obviously a very well built game and has a community that loves it, it's just entirely too difficult to have fun with.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a really neat niche title and I hope it succeeds.  It's great for 15-30 minutes here and there.  Once there is more loot/locations, etc, I think it will be nearly perfect at what it is trying to achieve.  Don't come in with any expectations, this is more of a thinking man's game - the crafting and realism (i.e, you die a lot) make for more paced, thoughtful play.  It is one game that would likely make you better at surviving in a real neo-apocalypse world.  If you like RPGs with character and gritty realism then this is what you need, mane...			"

												The game needs to have the save file that sticks around, EVEN after you have died!!! losing the save file when you die makes this garbage! I am tired of playing a game for some time and losing all of it by some BS encounter by dogs or W/E when I sleep. Oh and what is the point in making noise traps??? I always have full alertness and the hiding skill in the camp I sleep at but STILL get ganked when I sleep. I do love the game for all the chance it has but I am Tired of losing hours of game play for♥♥♥♥♥♥deaths. So at this point I would not recommend this. fun play butGREAT way to kill your time to have nothing to show for it.			"

												GAWD DAM IT!!!!!!!!!!FUC!!!!!!!STUPID GAMEE!!!!!Finally got my feet under me.Took 3 arrows but won the fight...i don't take them out cause I figure it'll make the wound worse. Limped back to base. Fought off a dog on the way. Boil up some clean rags, notice that my wounds have stopped bleeding.♥♥♥♥♥♥this is going to hurt.Takes out an arrow, bandages (wow, I'll survive this!)Takes out another arrow, bandages (Damn right!)Takes out third arrow, everything goes fine! I'm going to live! Arrow in 'hand,' move cursor to place arrow on ground, click, not enough room to place. Game decides ""oops, gotta put this arrow somewhere, but there's no room on the ground...""Game inserts arrow back into my gushing chest, slicing the pulmonary, kills me instantly.Fucing...hell....All because the game designers ♥♥♥♥ed up the item movement system. (FIX THIS!!!)So yeah.Otherwise, it's a pretty fun game, just lacks on content. I know, shocking...but I believe this. The big problem is how do you survive? Once you figure this out...not much left to do. The main storyline is pretty short all things considered (and not really deep or logical when you really try to make sense of it) and there's not terribly many 'random'/'lesser' encounters to keep you busy along the way. None of the guys that walks around ever talks to you, they just try to kill you or run away. Overall the impression you are left with is that you are fighting a wave of death. This is really cool. But shallow after about 5 hours because everything is so in depth that you are left wondering, ""why isn't the human side of things as complex?""There should be people who are traders. There should be non-combat entities walking around on the map, trying to accomplish their own goals (secure a campsite like you...hunt deer or creatures for their faction). Desperates who are sort of lost, running away that you can interact with. You should be able to form a band of followers, be able to discuss their roles in your little band of survivors and start relationships etc... I feel like other games already do this but that people developing a game pick one main theme to go after then stop, instead of diversifying and branching out and growing.At the moment there are some 'encounters' that happen randomly when you enter a square...and these are great!...but there aren't enough. This is sort of like a 'first step' towards humanizing the game.There should be an alliance 'system,' so that if a guy with the 'trapper' skill settles down 20 hexes from you and makes that his base, you can go approach him, offer to trade, and develop a relationship. Now you can approach more freely etc...Here's another idea: Instead of adding human-centric 'content' in the form of side quests and dialogue trees, try and think of some ways you can mix it up. Be innovative. If you can add something that completely shocks people because they don't expect it from a video game, they'll love you forever and your game will be remembered.What I think is funny is that the devs tried to hook a story onto the game without any of the above 'humanization'. You get a thrill from uncovering the story but the SECOND you know what happens, you stop caring. The devs should hire some literacy major who just graduated and is working at BK (this would cost next to nothing) to take a look at their game and write some story in for them. Might even do it for free for the resume.So my advice: 1) Add some more 'systems' (like the allegience, like seriously expanded dialogue, like other NOT-PLAYER CENTERED characters etc.). Every system you add on top of what you've got will expand the scope, audience, and profit of the game geometrically.2) Hire someone who knows how to write a story and populate a world with characters. If you're going to end the story like you did (and hint at a sequel like you did), you need to have a reason for us to follow the guy we play as. For the audience to care, you need a good characterization and some intriguing humanization. Try engendering endearment with non-life threatening consequences (severing of relationships, loss of 'honor' or something else your guy values).3) Don't give up. You've made something really great here, but it seems like you've stopped. Don't do that.4) With every step you take, ask if someone has done it before. If you can, try to make your solution unique.good luck			"

												RNG + Grindfest + Enforced micromanage = This. Making a meh-ish game is one thing, but watering it down with RNG poopfest is definitely over the line. Even the infamous Dungeon Crawl tries to make randomness controllable, and this... 'game' is just... too much.At least in other roguelikes, you get to choose starting options. BALANCED AND MULTIPLE OPTIONS, IN DETAIL. Instead in this 'game', we get take-it-or-leave-it starter's kit with Tetris level freedom of choice. If you can't get to skin the Dogman at the start, you're likely to end up dead like 10 minutes after.Say that you made the build, got the coat. Well, congratulations, you completed requirement for 30-minute survival. Enjoy so-oh-♥♥♥♥ing-much-DayZ-like loot grindfest. Let's scavenge this! Duh, empty!  And this! Yes, we got completely useless shirts and jeans!...While managing god-awful award-winning inventory. It's complete nightmare : tiny tiny single slot items, liquids being treated as individual items, all those junk items with no clear given use or whatsoever. Whatever you craft, it it's makeshift, expect them to be broken down like 10 minute later.If the progression of game itself was fun, I'd bear it. But in this game... it's like kicking the same old ground. Scavenge, find♥♥♥♥♥♥ make♥♥♥♥♥♥ scavenge more, rinse and repeat.But even with all these ♥♥♥♥♥, I guess people will still play it, because of it being 'Unique'.

												Ugh.  Let me just sum up my buyer's remorse with two points on why I do not recommend this game:1.) It plays as badly as it looks -- turns out this isn't one of those indy 'ugly duckling' games that have outdated graphics but excellent content and playability.  The graphics, story and gameplay are all sloppy.  Not to mention the previews are misleading.2.) The game relies purely on difficulty to make this a survival game, lacking any of the richness I was expecting given the high praise among the Steam community.  One would expect that a game rated so highly would have sacrificed looks for content, and it certainly is lacking in both -- instead it's a series of instant-death by storyline misadventure or because the character is about as hardy and resiliant as wet one-ply toilet paper... despite being 'tough'.I wanted to have some nice things to say about this game, but I really can't find anything worth the $15.  I would argue this should be considered no more than a $2 curiosity than a game worth the developer's asking price.			"

												This is one of those games you purely play to just try to do better, but in the end it just irritates you and not very fun.First off, the game plays in adobe flash player. First steam game I have ever seen do so, and feels sorta cheap, not what I was expecting for the price. The menu controls are a little clunky. For a survival game, I wasnt expecting to get the same linear story line every time I play, and although the map is random every time, and big, it's annoying knowing the correct play-outs of every critical event in the game each time.My biggest issue in the game though is just how bad combat is balanced, your average battle goes like this; You: Stabbed the guy 14 times with a glass shard. Enemy: Trips you, trips you, trips you, trips you, kicks while down, kicks while down, punch, your dead. Game over, you lose everything. Cause you know, stun locks are awesome, especially when NPCS get them and you get no counters to them.			"

												At first glacne NEO Scavenger promised quite a lot. After playing it for some time, I wish I was told beforehand that Linux version is a poorly designed Adobe Flash game that suffers from several UI flaws: flash warning popping up asking to use local storage, tooltips obscured by other windows, scaling issues in windowed mode and so on.I like the concept, but implementation is rather poor. Unfortunately.			"

												This game is the Running Man of homeless simulations.  This game lost it for me about the tenth time I killed someone hoping they would have a left shoe.   The text was too obtuse and hard to read on a small screen (microsoft surface pro) to glean enough satisfaction from murdering passers by for shoes and plasti bits to invest any more time.  What's the point?  The world is over.  The dogmen and cockroaches have taken over while you rummage through abandoned houses for plastic bags nd slippers.  There is no glory.  Just give up and die already.			"

												There crux of this game is you wandering around the wilderness re-arraning your pack to carry the maximum amount of junk you find. Descriptive working  titles include:""Homeless Man Shopping Cart Arrranger"" or ""Vagrant Cardboard Box Simulator""also ""Hobo with a Shotgun Plastic Bag Minmaxxer.""The idea for this this game and it's mechanic is very ingenious. The developer is very dedicated. The RNG element makes the skill cieling very low.In general: Random elements exist postively in a game for two primary funtions; to create variety & to approximate the large & infinte variables of reality. While I appreciate their intended role in this game is to do precisely those two things the simple fact is their implementation is coutner-productive here. The simple fact is if the RNG doesn't grant you the ability to find clothes in the first 12 tiles or so your game is over. God help you should you get attacked before findin a weapon.I really liked this game (& the developer) but I can;t in good faith reccomend it.Also the combat is like doing the Math portion of the SATs whilst ȿhit-faced; an ardous ordeal whereupon your efforts to apply skill or reasoning only inhibit the actual deciding factor: random chance.

												I imagine I'd like this game if I could play it enough to get good at it, like these kind of survival games you'd get better by failing and learning from your mistakes. I cannot do that however because it constantly freezes during character creation. I've only played 3 characters out of an attempted 30 attempts to make a character due to said freezing, so I can't play it enough to be able to figure out how to play it effectively. This is not an acceptable state for a game charging any amount of cash to be in.			"

Go click to a different screen to see what they were.Different Choose-Your-Own-Adventure style options for responding to an encounter? The game tells you what they are, but you choose them indirectly by moving the TOKEN of the SKILL that enables that response, rather than just clicking that option directly.You can see a MASSIVE list of what you know how to craft, but it isn't context sensitive - you can't click on a branch and see what you can make from it.

												way too hard, way too much luck involved. boring because permadeath makes you start over and over again - which means no chance to follow the story.it feels like black jack... you try to minimize the chances against you but in the end you know the bank is going to win at some point.of course you could start to hide a lot and to walk away from every fight and hide your tracks and stuff like that but then the game would become way too slow and it would take aeons to get through the story (and the rage factor after some really unlucky death would rise to infinity). i mean it is already slow because you have to deal with too much micromanagement and some really counter intuitive stuff. now add some permadeath and one really dumb encounter and everything starts again.i made two posts on their forums about those issues but the die hard fanboys over there don't seem to get the point that everything they love about this game makes it a really crappy experience for the average player who has been lured in by phrases like ""We serve the core role-playing game market by making role-playing games that focus on:exploring worldscustomizing characters and equipmentcreative problem solvingstory"".sorry to bring it to you but in neo scavenger you neither explore worlds (because you die and start all over again due to unlucky circumstances) nor get something from the story (because permadeath + no luck). i played it now for 24 hours and all i've seen is the facility i wake up in and it's near surroundings. creative problem solving: well in a twisted way you have to solve some really creative problems like for example the shoe problem - your player character is too dumb to put his shoes on. no joke. so if you wonder why you wear a pair of the same shoes but still get that improper footwear message just check if the right shoe really is on the right foot and the left shoe really is on the left foot. (<- my favorite example because it really represents just how bad the game design gets at stages). at least you can customize your character and equipment.it's a shame that you don't see anything of the world and story because what i really like about this game is that it somehow still manages to be immersive.this game is for people who love micromanagement and boring repetitive stuff. definitely not a game for someone who's into story and exploration and adventure.

												This game is the reason why I don't like spending more than $20 on a game.  Put simply, the game is terrible.  At its heart, it's a crafting game.  I like crafting games, but this one suffers from the same pitfall as many other titles in the genre.  There is no effective way to organize one's inventory.  It's a huge mess of items arranged by size.  It's nearly impossible for a player to understand what he has at any given time.  This would be forgiveable if the gameplay was decent, but it's not.  Combat is a complete mess.  I found myself trying to avoid combat because it is simply too much of a hassle.  There is almost no information given about the foes, and who wins is pretty much a crapshoot.  I have nothing good to say about this title.  It is one of the two worst games I've played in the last couple of years.			"

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. I'm a fan of roguelikes, but this game tried to be both roguelike and linear at the same time. You start in the same place every time, and while that wouldn't be an issue, it's always the same scenario. That's the issue I have - I don't play a roguelike to do the same tired story missions over and over. It has some pretty unique elements to it, but the things that aren't good really ruin the game for me. In most roguelikes, I accept the sense of permadeath and the inevitability of some unfair losses, but this game takes it to another level, stranding you with little to no resources and then giving you a disease that can only be survived through either extreme luck with the RNG or a very specific item. It'd be different if it was avoidable, but you can contract it simply by getting close to the enemies that carry it - and a nearly unavoidable game-ending feature like that doesn't make for a good roguelike.

												The game looked intriguing and certainly has a number of positive reviews, so I gave it a try. Ultimately however, this game just wasn’t for me.My main issue was that the game requires Adobe Flash Player, which (for me) frequently popped up during game play due to security settings, and ultimately crashed the game. And this was a huge annoyance, because every time I attempted to bring up the task manager to ‘end task’, the crash-screen interceded. It did present a quit or send error option, however neither responded to my input, ultimately I had to restart my computer.The other issue, which I admit is simply a stylist preference, was the color depth and color pallet, this game is definitely retro, like C64 retro. This included the user interface, which was very challenging (for me) to navigate, and in the short time I played this game I was never quite sure that what I intended to do was actually completed successfully (in a word: feedback).Unfortunately I was unable to play long enough to experience the story and atmosphere, which have been repeatedly praised for this game.

												Great game, if you like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I was in perfect condition, no wounds, full health, everything. Out of nowhere, I get ""Poison stage 2"" ""Sepsis"" ""Severe Abdominal Pain"". So I go to the hospital. Get ""Treatment for all sicknesses and Poisons""(♥♥♥♥ing nanorobots!). Painkillers. Anitbiotics.It does nothing. All of a sudden I get ""Blood loss"" (without wounds btw). ""You are getting colder"" AND ""you are suffering from heat exhaustion""(at the same time lol). Bam, dead. Btw, this is WITH a trait that says: ""You have a strong immune system"".In the Forum, I find a bunch of posts a la: ""Sepsis uncurable"" etc.So yeah, lots of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG. Like enemies RIGHT NEXT to you being able to escape, etc.Let's get into it.Right off the bat, this is a really amatureish game. It runs in Abobe FLASH PLAYER (lol). You can't take screenshots. If you click ""New game"", it doesn't even ask whether you want to delete your old save. It just deletes it instantly. So one misclick, and you're ♥♥♥♥ed.The inventory system is really bad; just your basic grid inventory. There is an auto arrange function. But that's it. No logic. Can't flip items. Can't put items in your hoodie's pockets, if you have a coat over it. Got some wire? You can hang a crowbar over your shoulder! But not a spear.Crafting is stupidly tedious. You have to drag items into the screen, to even see what you can make. WHY? How about you just show us what we can make from all our items? Nope.Recipes are nothing but written instructions. Have fun scrolling through pages of text. Intuitiveness = 0.Also, it's got the most basic quest system I have EVER seen in a game. IF you can get someone to talk to you, they give you one sentence, end of conversation. I say IF, because even if you hold someone at gunpoint, they won't talk to you. BUT you waste a turn, so now they can hit you in the face. And then escape. Seems legit.Also, just a little PSA to all wannabe game desingers out there: Items do not BREAK so quickly in real life. This is a survival game TROPE, and it needs to die. It's stupid.Survival Games ""survive"" on REALISM and LOGIC, and this game is just sub par in those regards.The fact that there is no help/tutorial whatsoever doesn't help either... Dying of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is NOT ""experiencing"" or ""learning"". It just sucks. I refuse to play another mediocre survival game, while having to read the ♥♥♥♥ING wiki...That's another ♥♥♥♥ing survival game trope. Gtfo!That being said, the game CAN be fun at times, in the usual survival game fashion. But seeing as this BS is making me consider just stopping this game already, I think it warrants a ""thumbs down""If this was the first survival game ever, it would be ok. But survival games come a dime a dozen, since over a decade, so you should have the genre figured out by now. And being an ""Indie"", is not an excuse.VERDICT: Low production value survival game with BS RNG mechanics, lack of logic, and -occasionally- fun.Buy at your own risk. Don't expect a great game.UPDATE: Just died in a fight. I had a knife. It ""Scratched"" him. Guy hit my arm with the blunt end of a pistol. I passed out from ""unbearable pain"" (hahaha). Guy kept hitting me. Died from brain injury.♥♥♥♥ this game.			"

The mechanics of the game are very good and the gameplay is very engaging. But having your character die of something whatever is so stupid and angering. I'd love some easy mode or save game system so I can enjoy the game a bit more, but no, none of that is provided.This game I have no idea to recommend or not, you decide! It's very hard and punishing, but fun at the same time. I'm gonna go with a no go for myself unless the game gets updated to have savegames or easymode, or have mods that do that.			"

												This game isn't challenging like one would expect it to be. Faster Than Light is challenging, Don't Starve is challenging, this game is just plain unfair.This game is completely dependent on luck. The first place the player scavenges from might either give the player clothes, a backpack, medicine, etc, or, and far more likely, will give the player absolutely nothing with a high chance of the building calapsing on top of the player. Going to sleep can either result in actually sleeping for a healthy amount of time and waking up the next morning, or just dying in the player's sleep(players can set up noise traps and all that but that never works). Combat can either result in three hits to the skull with a weapon actually killing the enemy, or getting punched once and dying instantly from it. Though usually before any of these scenarios can occur, the player will just die of hypothermia. People on the forums will tell others that if they get that skill, and this skill, and that other skill, then do this and that, then the player will never die, sure sounds like a lot of fun don't it?

								Neo scavenger takes ""Hard-core survival"" to the next level,Altho the game style makes you really think about the choices you make,it isn't QUITE impossible enough that you end up kicking the bucket to fast.at best it'll take 3 to 5 times of dieing before you learn the ropes of how to make it out there,50 times of playing it and i still suck :P, but regardless i regert nothing :D			"

												Selective realism at it's finest. No one in the history of mankind has ever made clothes out of plants. No tribes can be found right now that teach their kids how to weave clothing. There is no artwork showing humans wearing tall grass as shorts. If you understand the sarcasm about how this game chooses to be dumb about screwing you over with it's Rouge-like elements, you'll know this game is not meant to truly be a realistic survival game and punishes you with realistic things that should be easy to counter...like freezing to death for 99% of your deaths.

												I hate this game so much. I die, I play again, I die again, I hate this game again. I stop for a few days. I come back. I play again. I die. I hate it so much.I install cheats. I still die. I hate this game. I keep wanting to play this game, but I hate it so much. I sit at my computer wanting to play a video game, wanting to play NEO Scavenger, but also hating NEO Scavenger, so instead I just sit here thinking about how much I hate this game and how much I want to play it longer than two in-game days before dying. I hate this game so much.It's like erotic denial when you didn't ask for it.It's like having a black hole in your stomach so you just keep feeling hungry no matter what you eat.It's like an arranged marriage to someone who keeps putting to toilet paper roll the wrong way.It's like discovering your new graphics card doesn't fit your computer case.It's like insomnia.It's like all those things but not really like all those things, but really I just hate this game. But I'm gonna go play it right after finishing this review. Actaully, I'm gonna go look for a Save Game mod before I go play again. Game Saving is the only thing I need for this game. Game Saving would make me NOT hate this game. Game Saving--any kind of Game Saving--would save this game. Only Save at camp with specific paramiters, only Save at certain locations, only Save five times ever per play session. Any of those would work. Any of those would make me not hate this game.I like everything about this game except the perma-death. Literally everything else. The world, the gameplay, the mystery, the NEED to discover what is going on with my character. Everything is good. But perma-death makes me hate this game more than I have hated any game in a long time. It is literally stopping me from enjoying this game. It's the only thing I need this game to have. I hate dying because I don't know what a thing in game is, and then having to slog through the ENTIRE beginning again and hope I find useful items again.This game is too brutal to not have saves.

												The detailed gameplay and scavenging is so good, but this SHOULD NOT be a one-life game. It feels like playing Fallout without a save function. Once you die, nothing matters.The ""roguelike"" fad has made xhit of what would have been a cool game. I hope all bad roguelike games perma-die.			"

												A ""game"" with no gameplay elements.Every aspect of the game is completely random and simply beyond your control. No skill or tactics to employ, just plain old luck determines whether you'll live each day. Combine this with permadeath, and you find yourself stuck replaying the same day over and over again, having about as much fun as Bill Murray did when caught in the same loop.I'm being serious, you can fall, cut yourself, and die of blood loss just from *walking* if that's how the dice roll (advancing in combat carries the chance to trip and fall). Whether or not you find shoes and clothes in time to keep warm and not die from hypothermia, pure luck. Whether you wake up in time to defend yourself before an enemy kills you in your sleep, pure luck. Whether you can actually get to sleep because it's random whether or not you'll find a sleeping bag and it rains constantly... again, luck. Whether your very first fire started in a burnt out office building because you are hiding from the rain with nothing but a hospital gown and a large stick attracts an entire pack of feral dogs who you literally have zero chance against... need I go on?There's just no meaningful interaction. All of your equipment wears out shockingly fast and it's a crapshoot whether you'll find a replacement. At times it feels like a miracle during an encounter just to close the gap to an enemy without tripping over yourself and falling to the ground before you can poke 'em with your spear. Start a fire to keep warm and attract an enemy you aren't ready to deal with. Lay low and hide, die of hypothermia. Damned if you do and damned if you don't. Either option is viable based solely on luck. You're not playing a game so much as just watching the unluckiest man on Earth die over and over again.There is no character progression. You know how to make everything right away. Just put all of your swag into the crafting table and whatever can be made is instantly available. However good you are at fighting and surviving from the moment you wake up is as good as you're ever gonna be. All of your equipment has a ridiculously short lifespan. So even if you find a really good anything, don't get attached. Even crowbars wear out... CROWBARS! Solid bars of pure steel... wear out.  Seriously?There's just no feeling of accomplishment. None. If you manage to survive for a week, it's not because you did anything right, you just got lucky. A first playthrough can net you shoes, cargo pants, a hoodie, a multitool, and a saucepan after 12 hours of scavenging. A second playthrough can net you a cut arm, 200 pebbles, a handful of poison berries, and 3 shards of glass after 12 hours of scavenging. The player is reduced to the role of spectator of the very short and uninteresting life of some guy named Phillip.Without engagement, without meaningful choices to make, without progression, there's just no game here.

								It is a bad sign when the demo is more fun than the main game.NEO Scavenger has, as everyone has said, a TON of potential.  There is just so much they could do here.  Combat feels granular and staisfying, while at the same time being crazy-lethal if you're not careful.  The loot you find feels like you're struggling to survive, and the crafting system is elegant.  Character creation is simple, but offers meaningful choices.  It's got a LOT of good stuff in it.But the main game also wants to have a story.  And that main quest line feels kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when it's next to what would make a fantastic open-world survival game.  Since death is frequent, and often from kinda unfair places, having to redo the same quests over and over is unsatisfying, to say the least.  And I'm not a hundred percent sure if the game has magic in it or not, because it sure seems like it sometimes, and that clashes with the flavor of a sci-fi wrecked earth.Oh, the deaths.  Man.  I have died a dozen times at least from starting a game, and freezing to death before I can find shoes.  I have died because I can't find clean water, or anything to boil water in to sterilize it.  I have died from a single lucky gunshot.  I like how lethal the game can be, but I do not enjoy at all how arbitrary it feels at times.Also, the demo thing.  The demo shows off a scavenging system where each city tile has multiple things to search.  Do you check the storage shed, which may have nothing but is pretty safe, or do you go for the high rise, where you might get jumped, but could have a lot more left over?  The main game has one thing to search per tile.  Choice : eliminated.  Just right out the window.  I cannot, in good faith, recommend a game where the main game takes AWAY choices.			"

												This is overall a good game I think. it is not however worth 10 dollars as it is now. The game still feels like im playing to alpha test, and i understand this is an early acsess game, but is nowhere near complete enough to ask 10 dollars for. Save game system is broken, barely a shred of story. But the game play mechanics are great. This game has real potential and i wished I waited until it was finished cooking before getting food poisoning by trying it early.Update 11/28/15: Saw it had been released and gave it another shot. UI feels a hell of alot clunkier than before, but on the plus side saves worked so going to give it another go as time permits.			"

								We are in 2014. The game is made with Adobe® Flash® Player, by someone who does now know this ""technology"". As a direct consequence, the game is very buggy, and should be free, on newsground; not $10 on Steam.I recognize that there is some work on the artistic side, even though the use of Flash just negates most of it. Technically, this game is a failure, and will stay that way: it is not possible to correct that point without a FULL RE-DEVELOPEMENT of it; and let's be honest, we can't expect that to happen. So, as a result, do not buy. Too bad, it seemed promising.EDIT: I see that there is 70% of negative votes on this review. I could maybe use a little feedback. So if you voted down, please comment, if you can. Thanks :)EDIT 2: If the game is re-released using something such as Unity or Game Maker instead of AFP, I will re-review it, with the game in mind, rather that with AFP in mind.			"

								This is an incredibly deep game with a ton of customization options but I found that most of the time I was trying to figure out what the developer wanted from me instead of playing against the game itself. A robust tutorial should be an immediate goal. And formatting to fit full screen on standard resolutions instead of playing in a Flash window would also be a great next step. At this time I wouldn't recommend it. But I'll watch it with interest as development continues.			"

								I got this game in a humble bundle, which is the only way I would suggest getting it. This is essentially a text-based game. The only way you know things are happening is by reading the log. You have buttons presented to you that are options. When you click the button, the log updates. Nothing else happens on the screen. Even if you win a combat, the only indication is from the combat log.The graphics are awful. The UI layout is haphazard. There are lots of slots and buttons that make no sense. For example, when you are in your inventory, there is a red X in the upper corner, which usually means ""close window"", but in this case it does nothing and has hover text that says ""Current cursor mode. (1) Take (2) Drop (3) Use."" What? I was able to drag a lake and forest around in my area inventory. Why? The game allows you to hang yourself constantly. It never seems to help or guide you to an appropriate choice. For example, it will let you start the game without picking any traits! Combat seems to happen randomly, and is a baffling ordeal. If you just click ""Confirm"" and have no action selected, your enemy will alternate between charging at you, advancing, leaving himself open, etc. No clue what's going on, there. I could never figure out how to eat. When I right clicked on berries in my hand and ""used"" them, they fell apart in my hand.

								Absolutely terriffic game. I love the scavenging and survival aspects, because this game does almost all of these right. The dialogue and combat are both fantastic, and the events are wonderful, too.However, this is all completely ruined by the fact that you will probably always freeze to death. You will not go in the right direction to find clothing. You'll be very lucky to find a lighter. And even if you do all these things, you probably already have hypothermia, and you'll be dead in a few turns. Almost always.			"

								Neo scavenger is a slow paced roguelike and it pretty much has it all, learning curve, survival and character development.However it being a slow paced roguelike i can't recommend it because of its single feature which is text based death. As in random non descriptive frustrating ""for the lulz"" you-just-died-because-of-this-event.Until it hopefully changes the game is shelved in my library atleast.			"

								The concept of this game is great, the detail put into the crafting is excellent.  And that's about the limit of its positive qualities.  It's biggest and most glaring flaw is the 'erase your save upon death' feature.  That's right boys and girls, they PURPOSEFULLY designed this game so that if you die once, if, oh say, you cant find better clothing within 8 hours, or you encounter a creature, or you take off the silly little necklace you start with, you will die, and whatever progress you have made is erased.  The idea of a hardcore mode has it place, but in a game that offers such a chance for exploration, that offers such a detailed crafting grid, the FORCED, non optional hardcore mode is a terrible idea.  Want to play the game to explore, see the world they created?  Too bad.  You either blitz the story, or die once to either bad luck or bad enemy design, and poof, congratulations, all your time and effort has been destroyed, and you get to do it all over again.  I suppose this is probably someones idea of fun, but it isn't mine.  I honestly regret making this purchase.  If you're looking for a GOOD survival style game, get Project Zomboid.			"

								Fun for a little while but it gets pritty boring pritty fast. Understandably you start out with more or less nothing (depending on the skills you picked and if you bothered to use them in the first room) and for the genre and setting thats fine, however when 4 out of 5 Games Ends because you cant find a shirt, pair of pants and a set of boots before you freeze to death in what is clearly not a sub freezing enviroment the initial new game pains are a little frustrating.On top of that if you dont pickup either Trapping or Botany, you are going to starve to death. Beyond that its rather easy to stay alive. Remarkably easy really. The trailor vidoes hint at every decision potentially resulting in life or death but ive had very little trouble from noisly ransacking every building or storage unit i come accross with a crowbar and lighter. That might change however if i can ever light a fire... but of course ide need a tiny slip of paper to tell me how to use my lighter to start a fire and by the time i find that ill realise that I dont have the appropraite skill to start fires. Meanwhile Ill have alrleady hacked 2 laptops and a plethora of smaller eletrical devices to gain access to more or less nothing but a GPS that isnt neessisary because my map allready points out exactly where I am.Basicly I would give this one a pass for now, keep an eye on it though more features are bound to come out in time.

								This game is the worst form of survival games. It is a random number generator linked to some stats if you don't find the needed items randomly by scavenging your choices do not matter at all and you die. Its a shame because the mystery of who you are has promise and the flavor text is very well written (the world seems interesting) but the fact that all of your choices are pointless negates any intrigue. A game which repeatedly places you in an unwinable scenario until you luck out is more tedium than anything else.			"

								At no point have I ever had fun 'playing' this game. At no point have I ever been glad I purchased it. At no point will I recommend this game to my friends. I will recommend NEO Scavenger to child molesters, terrorists who spill American blood, and women who call grown men 'hun' because they deserve to suffer. This is not a game for people. NEO Scavenger is a device used to test if a player is human or not, much like the Voight-Kampff Test. Time spent interacting with his horrid program will only expose a player as being a poorly made simulacrum, a hollow mimic, who is not truly alive, because real people play real games. NEO Scavenger isn't a game, it's a punishment.			"

								First time ever writing a review.. Needless to say I'm pretty stoked about NEO Scavenger. I had stopped playing a while because the character I'd gotten good gear with got sick and died or something.. but I recently picked this back up and I have to say I'm impressed with the additions that have been made. Overall the game itself is frustrating, but not in  a bad way. You're constantly being challenged with the goal of survival. Right from the beginning the game throws this DogMan creature at you and you have several different ways to play out the encounter. What surprised me most was the wraith like being that popped up out of nowhere when I made it to the city, silly ol' me thought I could take a whack at him with a crowbar, Mr. Wraith had other ideas. I died... rightfully so. All in all... I think NEO Scavenger was a good purchase, if you aren't sure don't shy away from that demo, it'll give you a good idea what this game is all about,Also.. NEW SHOES!			"

								Neo scavenger is a hexbased ,turn based/ text based game. there as many different skills that will help you when trying to survive in the harsh lands. the combat is indepth with the text based  slection combat. you dont see yourself attacking but its decribed to you indetail makeing your imagination take over and letting you have a unique expreance every fight. The game has a story to it if you wanna fallow that , or you coul just go do your own thing and cause havoc. eating and drinking is a must as well as sleep , but becarefull not to eat anything deadly  that may be poision. and make sure you have a place to sleep at night as you are exposed to attacks and can be robbed. the crafting system is nice, there are many different thing to do and combind togeather to make survival easiser. Anyways i shall stop ranting on how Fun this game is.. if you like turn based combat and dont mind text based games like the first fallout, Then this game is for you			"

								I now got nearly 24 hours of this game on the clock. And i really like the simplicity of the design and the general way the game throws stuff randomly at you. It's not Disneyland and at least you do not need to worry about the occasional troll like in DayZ or else. BUT.Here goes:   - The GUI is sometimes cumbersome to control. For example you need to switch from the crafting screen to the movement screen to end your turn with a click of the mouse. Or you need to get send to the movement screen after waking up. need to go to the sleeping screen to sleep again. I see that the pattern of view fields on the left and action fields on the right is partially implemented. but could use some rework to make it more smooth. And the inventory moves stuff around, when consumed, that just confuses.   - You do not really see how many moves you got left and how much moves something takes. As a person, you normally have a good feeling how long you take for what task and plan accordingly.   - The important part, realism:    - Infections do not kill you within hours (i had no fights, no injuries and i get killed by an infection of a wound recieved in a fight, just a few turns back.. That got treated with sterile cloths and antibiotica... yeah no).   - Cured meat lasts far longer than two days tops. Iregularly smoke fish without salt and fish is far more prone to go bad than regular meat, and it lasts longer.  - The water consumption is way over the top, for the climate displayed. Heck you can't even sleep a night through without waking up by thirst in the middle of darkness!I'd like to see the points above as an encouragement to the dev to make a good game great.As i said, i got no problems with the randomness of the opponents or that you can get killed by a lucky blow of your opponent.♥♥♥♥♥♥happens ! Random loot, fine by that. Selling Prices at the Junkyard. Maybe Tannine Tea is a bit much, but thats a small thing. Corn-A-Cola too much effect? Nope! I've seen people collapse after they fell into a sugar and caffein low with red bull. I am unsure about the watermechanic of the game . Normally water from flee flowing runnels and streams is generally safe to consume to an extend (i mean the setting is clearly not in the tropics). Best but slowest is water gathered after rain or from dew, then again we do not know how much the rain is polluted in the game. All over all a good game, considering the pricetag and that it is early access. I played less hours on Titanfall, and that was quite hyped.			"

								ok this game was a great idea and a love at first sight game, its one of my favorites. and with the new update its gotten even better. its also MUCH MUCH MUCH harder with the update and is a good gaming expirence. i strongly recomend this game for these reasons.1. its orignal: you may think""this is a bad game because its turned based and its doesn't have good graphics, and it looks boring because it has hexagons as moving squares"" to those of you like that i say ♥♥♥♥ you. steam is a haven for good indie games so if your like that you shouldn't be here. the idea for scavenging for weapons and food is a good base for a storyline. but haveing turn based actions and the hard needing to survive is very orginal and neat. when you think about it its kinda funny how destriot the place your in (in know i spelled it wrong) is all ♥♥♥♥ed up.2. MAGIC VODO OF FUNNESS: sometimes when there is something that is amazingly good i say it has magic vodo, which this game has. its addicting to play( but not to watch) and very hard since the update. its very fun with a muiltitude of things you can do and............... i cant explain it but it is very fun and its not expensive if you dont like it.

Similarly, it's the rare title that does anything very well at all for less than $10 these days. NEO Scavenger fits both bills and still has more to come (I guess... I haven't noticed many bugs and I think I've progressed a fair distance). You'll probably need the wiki to help you get started, if only because you have to get the hang of some of the craftable items. I played the demo for about forty-five minutes before grabbing the full version and only had two or three things I'd count as bugs:1) My save data was inexplicably lost once, but I didn't mind starting over2) It seems to me that there's really only one way to start with any decent chance but that's not necessarily going to stay true in the final version (and I could be wrong - there's a decent amount of randomness with each play)3) Sometimes you setup a camp site and it disappears later, sometimes re-appearing on a later visit to that hexNone of these, for me, are game-breakers because I'm not playing NEO Scavenger to win - I'm playing to -survive-. This means battling cold weather, raiders and dogmen, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and the dangers of exploring/scavenging ruined buildings that might collapse on you at any moment. I simply include most of the bugs along with the other dangers and keep on truckin' (or start a new game). I highly recommend that anyone looking to play a game that focuses on those things as NEO Scavenger really does it well. Happy Gaming!			"

								This  game is amazing. It has endless replayability and there is so much to do and make. The developers obviously put alot of hard work and thought into this game and it paid off. The story is the same but how you complete it differs. While as great as this game is, I do not reccomend it to people who have little patience, because this game can be incredibly frusterating. It is very hard to survive and once you die that's it. No take-backs or nothing, so it's crucial to manage your stats and to use your heads when events happen. NeoScavenger is easy to learn with simple controls, and isn't too hard on your computer (aka, even the crappiest of computers should be able to run this pretty well). I seriously reccomend it, if you're looking into buying this game, just stop reading reviews now and buy it. You wont be disappointed.			"

								Do you like an intense game that rewards player skill, encourages thoughful play, and punishes reckless play styles? Do you like a game with a broad open world with plenty to explore and do? Do you like running screaming from crowbar weilding maniacs?Well, Neo Scavenger has all of this and more. This game with torture your psyche and leave you begging for more. This game is an intense and brutal introduction to a realistic post social collapse world. A world of monster, and maniacs. This game with♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, and bring you to your knees in frustration, and yet, at the same time, leave you cackling maddly after barely skating by in a pitched battle with an all too lucky looter. This game will delite and agrivate you in fairly equal parts, and always give you a reason to pick back up and start a new game each time you find your character has once more gotten his skull caved in by one of the many hideous monstrosities in the game. The best part, most of the monsters in this game are flesh and blood humans, not mutants, not zombies, normal humans, driven to the edges of maddness by a cold cruel and uncaring world.Will this world drive you mad too? Are you up to the challenge of the Michigan wilds? Can you handle the constant threat of being someone or something else's next meal? Can you survive in the brutal world of Neo Scavenger? Or will this brutal world swallow you up without so much as a burp, as so many before?			"

								Let's get this out of the way first - This is my first review.NEO Scavenger has a lot of potential. The gameplay so far is amazing, and the combat and scavenging system works really well, making it all the more impressive. I really can't wait to see the finished product, although there are a few things I want to point out.The scavenging system is great and all, but it is REALLY brutal unless you get lucky. Probably 8/10 times I played through the game and I died before I survived 1 day. It is really hard to find any kind of clothing even when there is a high loot chance in the scavenging screen.And when I get to the DMC Gates, as soon as I complete Hatter's request for the Urn, he gives me the pass for the DMC gates, but when I get scanned, it still won't let me in, and as well as that, it breaks after I finished a few turns, even when it's durability is at 100% (even after a few playthroughs this still happened) and I'm not sure if this is a game breaking bug or something is wrong with my NEO Scavenger.Still, even in Beta and it's well worth the £7 I paid for it. I recommend this HEAVILY to any RPG/Post Apocalyptic players who like any of the original Fallout series - 9/10.			"

								I would have enjoyed NEO Scavenger if it didn't ""end"" so abruptly. There is so much more to want. Otherwise, the game is addictive, difficult, and has an dark desolate atmosphere. The first two games of the Fallout series has brought about a morbid curiosity about the surviving in a wasteland for many years. NEO Scanvenger does really well giving a complex some-what realistic survival system. The main things to be concerned about is food, water, shelter, warmth, and health while giving curveballs with dealing with other humans. This game really tests your morality with your drive to survive while requiring you to come up with clever solutions to problems to continue to live. I would recomend this game to anyone with interests in survival and adventure.			"

								One Part Fallout/Wasteland, One Part Text Adventure, One Part Roguelike (or Dark Souls if you're trendy), and One Part Survival/Horror make up this indie game. You wake up in a cryogenic sleep chamber with no clues as to who you are, where you are, or what the hell is going down. All you wake up with is a hospital gown on your back, and a dogmanbeast right down the hall way that looks hungry. The game at first is hard as balls as you learn to survive out in the wilderness. Combat is brutal, with the persistent wounds (bleeding, head trauma, cuts/scrapes/scars) that affect your performance. Survival is even worse as you need to juggle hunger, hydration, and health all at once as you travel the wasteland. But after your few first brutal deaths you will eventually start to catch on and make your way further into the harsh post-apocalytpic scenery. Eventually you'll make your way into an actually populated city where the story begins to develop and the game begins to flex its Text Adventure muscles.NEO Scavenger is EARLY ACCESS as ♥♥♥♥ but shows plenty of potential due to a fairly ugly and not-so-user friendly UI, lack of toturial, and just general lack of polish or explanation for its myriad of features. For hardxcore gamers who aren't afraid of getting their♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s handed to them on a bloody platter a few times, or those who are roguelike veterans, pick this up.			"

								This is an amazing game. You hav to fight for survival and danger lurks in every hex. Once you get a lot of powerful gear, an an abunance of medical pills and bandages it becomes pretty repetitive. Nevertheless it is a great game. It has a lot of replayability value. You pick different skills for your character and there are random events sometimes to. Even the map is randomly generated except for major places (the glow, the ruined shoreline, etc.). And if you are feeling a little sociopathic or twisted you can even be a cannibal.			"

								I would say this is the best of the survival games I've played for the survival aspects.  Reminds me of a combination of Oregon's Trail and Fallout.  Doesn't have the story of Fallout but has the feel of the post apocalyptical environment that you are trying to survive in.  Titanfall beta comes out I play that for ~2 hours then I try out the demo for NEO Scavenger play it for 4 hours then buy the full game and play it for the next 8 hours.			"

								First - try the demo. The game style is somewhat of a niche, so it may not be for you. After that... well if you're still reading, perhaps a review is in order.Perhaps the best way to explain why NEO is worth a shot is the fact that I've introduced three players to it, with each having exactly the same responses (almost stages of grief style). First is the inevitable freezing to death (""What? What did I do wrong? This game is stupid!""). Next is figuring out how to survive that part (""Ah, I can use that sleeping bag until I find clothes, or possibly light a fire""), normally followed by having your head bashed in by someone (""What? What did I do wrong? This game is stupid!"").Next run through you figure out how to make weapons (""Now I can go take on those damn bandits!""). And, after killing a couple, you WILL get cocky and drown on your own blood (""What? What did I do wrong? This game is stupid!""). By about the fourth serious run (normally with a half-dozen freezing to deaths in there) you're surviving, and doing it well. You start analysing the risks of combat (he has a machete, I have a bow... how close do I let him get?). From there your deaths are almost always due to errors on your part - surviving can be time consuming but is generally not hard, unless you want to deliberately handicap yourself by not taking the easy way (no trapping skills, no botany skills) for a difficulty boost - and all three players were hooked. At each stage you could see them figuring out what to do next, how to avoid the mistake they made last time.Despite what some reviews have said you do not need to find the recipe papers to make anything - they tell you how to, but if you put the ingredients in the crafting screen it will let you know what you can make. Generally it's pretty intuitive too - large stick plus knife equals sharpened stick, for example, but you soon learn the crucial recipes by heart.Yes, it's unpolished. Yes, it's flash. Yes, the story and interface leave a lot to be desired. But it's still well worth the time.			"

That person you just killed even though he didn't have any form of defending himself has clothing and shoes for you to survive longer in the cold nights. It is always different every time I play especially with the permadeath feature installed, that is what I like the most about it. You don't just have the ability to reload and play it differently. When you die, that is really it and you'll just have to play it again and that is the fun part because nothing is ever the same!			"

								As a post apocylipic survival game, Neo Scavenger serves as a (probably) pleasent diversion from the typical zombie survival genre. In this game you are faced not only enemies from both the earth and beyond, but also with realistic factors to your person that may prove your undoing if neglected, and you are also faced with perma death.Combat in this game makes up with it's lack of action with it's in depth desicion system that controls how you approach situations, which also comes to play in miscelanious events that fall outside of regular gameplay. These 'events' will grant you with better outcomes if you select the right perks for your character at the beginning the game. Select the wrong ones during character creation, however, then you might as well let the dogmen (not to be confused with werewolves) eat you where you stand.The cruel realism of the game forces you to think, making this game fun to play and giving it it's strategic element. And now that modding is becoming available, I personally cannot wait for all the crazy - or scary - ideas the comunity can grant for this game!			"

								You either live long enough to see the source of the lights to the South-East, or you die from hunger, dehydration, hypothermia, or by a single attack from another human you couldn't sneak away from in the first few days.While you have a choice of skills at the start, the majority of the game is strongly effected by luck.  Luck of loot found, luck of places to camp in, luck during encouters; a single fluke can kill you.  With permadeath a constant fear, one must be wise about every action taken.It's a good turn-based survival, almost table-top-like game.  Your real entertainment will be seeing how long you can survive in this post-apocalypse world.  You have to use your imagination for most of it, but to those who enjoy roguelikes or table-top strategy games will find this a good buy.There's a demo; if you're even the slightest bit curious, TRY IT.  (there are things omitted from the demo, but it'll give you a very good idea of how to play the game)			"

								I now got nearly 24 hours of this game on the clock. And i really like the simplicity of the design and the general way the game throws stuff randomly at you. It's not Disneyland and at least you do not need to worry about the occasional troll like in DayZ or else. BUT.Here goes:   - The GUI is sometimes cumbersome to control. For example you need to switch from the crafting screen to the movement screen to end your turn with a click of the mouse. Or you need to get send to the movement screen after waking up. need to go to the sleeping screen to sleep again. I see that the pattern of view fields on the left and action fields on the right is partially implemented. but could use some rework to make it more smooth. And the inventory moves stuff around, when consumed, that just confuses.   - You do not really see how many moves you got left and how much moves something takes. As a person, you normally have a good feeling how long you take for what task and plan accordingly.   - The important part, realism:    - Infections do not kill you within hours (i had no fights, no injuries and i get killed by an infection of a wound recieved in a fight, just a few turns back.. That got treated with sterile cloths and antibiotica... yeah no).   - Cured meat lasts far longer than two days tops. Iregularly smoke fish without salt and fish is far more prone to go bad than regular meat, and it lasts longer.  - The water consumption is way over the top, for the climate displayed. Heck you can't even sleep a night through without waking up by thirst in the middle of darkness!I'd like to see the points above as an encouragement to the dev to make a good game great.As i said, i got no problems with the randomness of the opponents or that you can get killed by a lucky blow of your opponent.♥♥♥♥♥♥happens ! Random loot, fine by that. Selling Prices at the Junkyard. Maybe Tannine Tea is a bit much, but thats a small thing. Corn-A-Cola too much effect? Nope! I've seen people collapse after they fell into a sugar and caffein low with red bull. I am unsure about the watermechanic of the game . Normally water from flee flowing runnels and streams is generally safe to consume to an extend (i mean the setting is clearly not in the tropics). Best but slowest is water gathered after rain or from dew, then again we do not know how much the rain is polluted in the game. All over all a good game, considering the pricetag and that it is early access. I played less hours on Titanfall, and that was quite hyped.			"

								I'm a modern roguealike fan - even worked on a couple - as well as a fan of classic Fallout, and this game nailed it for me. The sparse writing is generally tense and flavorful, systems are accessible, and the survival and combat gameplays satisfying. It's something like Don't Starve, only you have all the time to think.Bear in mind the latest build 0.983 or some such is still rather bare: not enough NPC balance, item variety or story content to maintain my interest much beyond a few hours.

								Love survival games like this. The music goes great with the vibe of the game. Think minimal 80's soundtracks from movies like Escape From New York or Assault on Precint 13 (original). Games like this remind me of other movies I'd watch as a kid like Red Dawn and Rambo (the originals). The graphics look basic in the screenshots and that was keeping me from giving this a try, but after playing the game I'm looking at it a different way. The graphics come from your imagination and I'm fully into this game after only a few hours of playing it. I want to make a game like this.			"

								THIS is what Early access games should be THIS is what a post apocalyptic setting should be like. Its hard to describe in words what this game doesnt do right i mean jeez man the gameplay is addictive it too away 2 entire days of my life of me just trying out different handycaps different good traits its hardcore 1 mess up will screw you over is what keeps me on my toes combined with the one save rule the game enforces this is what a hardcore game is. The AI is unforgiving at times but it still leaves open the chance to run at a price at times or if luck is on your side scott free which is really cool in my opinion. Although i suppose if i had to make i con its that there arent many enemys to battle (or avoid) and there isnt too many things you can use to carry your gear but sense its early access it has a pass i just hope they add that soon its a much needed addition. But besides that this game is a testiment of what gamming is and that there will always be dev's who are creative and will do different things such as making this a text based game which was brilliant in my opinion, I look forward to play this game more as more patches arise time was well spent playing this game.

								After checking this out in the store it didn't look like much but, I decided to give it a try. For a game developed entirely in flash, it's awesome. A totally engrossing experience, you'll find yourself experimenting with builds, strategy and crafting. The interface is nice enough that you can figure out the majority of the game by just clicking around be warned, there is no in-game tutorial. Do yourself a favor and check out the FAQs and wikis. With some tweaking, this game would be awesome on a tablet, too. I was playing it via RDP on my Andriod tablet and had some trouble clicking around but enjoyed myself a great deal, anyway. I would totally buy this again if it ended up being released on Andriod.			"

If you like turn-based rpgs or roguelikes, this might be just up your alley.

								I heard about this game from a friend and decided to play the demo to see how I felt. About two hours passed and I purchased the actual game, to spend another two or three hours playing the balls off of it.At first a first look I was unsure about the action events (fights, encounters etc.) seeing as it was primarily text and seemed like it would be a little dull. I was very wrong, while yes the action events are just text along with some other info (character portraits, conditions and so on), it doesn't detract from the intensity at all. If anything imagining what is happening as it's described to you makes the whole fight even more tense.I think the most appealing thing about this game is how realistic it is. You can (and will) die in so many different ways, it's fantastic! You can be beaten to death, bleed out, get poisoned, mauled, shot, etc. But what I love is how indirect it is. You can go into a forest and eat some berries, a few turns later you get some pop up text informing you that your character is vomiting. What caused that? Was it the berries? The dirty bandage giving you an infection? The water from the lake? Along with hunger, thrist, sleep deprivation, temperature and the horde of melonheads closing in the game becomes very stressful. But in the best possible way.Besides the many ways to die, the scavenging is top notch. Far better than say Fallout for the sake of argument, where you gather stuff for a while and then you're good till end game. In NEO Scavenger you need to keep scavenging to survive and you will not find guns in every house, or food in every cabin. Chances are you'll die before ever using a gun, but when you have one with the right ammo, you feel worried about using it in case it's wasted. This combined with the crafting and character skills to open up new options, makes each playthrough very different.  The best part is the game isn't even done yet, so new features are being added to make this experience even better. So if you're reading this right now and you're still unsure I really reccommend you at least try the demo. I think this game is fantastic and would really sing it's praises to anyone who's looking for a challenging and realistic survival game.  I'd give it a solid 8/10 so far, would be swarmed by melonheads again.			"

								Neo Scavenger is a unique game thats been in development a long time. If you're a fan of survival strategy games, or just like playing great games, this is the game for you. Its the kind of game you can play whether you care about stories or not, you can play the story to the currents end, and roam around, just seeing how long you can survive, or just skip to surviving right away. Both are equally fun. In a sense, the game is a little like Dwarf Fortress: Adventure Mode, where ""dying is fun!,"" and where its fun to bumble around and ♥♥♥♥ yourself over countless times. However, just like Adventure Mode, its annoying in the sense that if you don't know what you're doing, you're liable to shoot yourself in the foot right off the bat, however the learning curse is pretty low, so you won't have to worry about that for long, espically if you watch videos on Youtube or read forums.

								The unique style of NEO Scavenger is not that unique as they want you to believe. It's very reminiscient of the original point and click games such as Fallout and Baldur's Gate with even similar typed ""cells"" you interact with. Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing. In this case it works great for the way the game wants you to play. Finding resources and survival are obviously key to this type of game and they don't fail on that note.However, the combat seems way too strange. Albiet, if you have a weapon (melee or ranged) the fights are much easier to succeed; my encounters with fights early game with no weapons lead in instant failure. I don't know many people in an apocalyptic setting that can take getting punched, tackled, kicked, and mercilessly harrassed for very long. Yet the survivors you fight, have exceptional durability. You can kick a person 10+ times on the ground and they still somehow manage to stand up, punch you and break your shoulderblade. After a 12 minute fight with the first random stranger outside ends, I freeze to death and all of that was a waste of nothing. I understand this game is not to be taken lightly and stroll through it, but I haven't made it far past the first main objective. I have frozen to death at least eight or so times because of how the world is roughly randomized. Sometimes you're lucky and fight resources to keep you alive and buildings to sleep in so you can make it there, but other times, you will freeze to death before you can find a shack. No matter how unsettling this sounds, I truly have been enjoying myself everytime I play. Simply because the story has already captivated me into wanting to hear more on the story. As well as enjoying the game, minus the few listed, I have had no complications with playing this game and I'm excited to see any possible additions and hoping for better luck in my coming ventures.

								Neo Scavenger is a survival game where you're dropped into a harsh post apocolyptic world with no instructions or idea of what the end game could possibly be. Everything matters: you need to stay warm, you need to eat, you need to drink, you need to not get cholera from eating and drinking... Add this to the fact that there other survivors out to kill and rob you as well as monsters and you may have some idea why I've yet to survive for 3 days. Turn based and very intricate I would strongly recommend that you at least try the demo. One of those games where you'll hate and love it at the same time.			"

								Wow. Just wow. This game is hard, unforgiving, and near impossible. I love it. My last playthrough, I had taken a guides advice with slight modification of my own and I was a super power nothing could kill me, except for nature herself. I had taken down four dogman, six strangers, Ftons of melonheads, and an enfiend horror all within six hexex of each other and only minors cuts and bruises as my reward, oh and a few dozen bullets, a couple guns, water bottles, and furs out the wazzo. This was only half way through. I wasn't playing the story, I wanted to gear up, I was challenging myself out in the wilderness and it was fun! Just doing what I wanted, fighting when I had to, chatting when I didn't, and just surviving. This can be a casual game or a hardcore game it depends on how you want to play, do you want to follow the story or simply explore the whole map. But in my opinion fun is all this game is going to be. Don't mistake it though. Remeber the badass you just read up there I overestimated myself and attacked when I should have dodged with hunger and thirst nearly claiming me along the way. Thus ending my adventure but also beginning a new and, hopefully, better one.			"

								ok this game was a great idea and a love at first sight game, its one of my favorites. and with the new update its gotten even better. its also MUCH MUCH MUCH harder with the update and is a good gaming expirence. i strongly recomend this game for these reasons.1. its orignal: you may think""this is a bad game because its turned based and its doesn't have good graphics, and it looks boring because it has hexagons as moving squares"" to those of you like that i say ♥♥♥♥ you. steam is a haven for good indie games so if your like that you shouldn't be here. the idea for scavenging for weapons and food is a good base for a storyline. but haveing turn based actions and the hard needing to survive is very orginal and neat. when you think about it its kinda funny how destriot the place your in (in know i spelled it wrong) is all ♥♥♥♥ed up.2. MAGIC VODO OF FUNNESS: sometimes when there is something that is amazingly good i say it has magic vodo, which this game has. its addicting to play( but not to watch) and very hard since the update. its very fun with a muiltitude of things you can do and............... i cant explain it but it is very fun and its not expensive if you dont like it.

								God damn, there are so many ways to die in this game. IT IS HARSH. Acting reckless always gets you killed, not having a game plan will often result in dying whether by a bandit or being poisoned by some bad water. When you get this game, don't expect the odds to ever be in your favor, (unless you're fighting melon heads). BUT, it is still pretty fun, I often have youtube in the backround listening to music, because there is not music yet in this game. Also, often I'm not really into turn based games, but this caught my attention, and I actually like it! The combat is very unique and awesome and real, and often if you choose different traits in your character, and you have different weapons, and different enemys to face, so each time you play the experience is different, considering also the map is mostly randomly generated, (story bits stay the same). So, overall I'd give this a good seven, because, despite all that, the game isn't very engaging, it's kinda hard for you to get hooked and play for hours straight because of how hard it is. But, keep in mind, this is just my opinion! And the game  is in Alpha, but a good alpha. I hope I helped!			"

								Truely amazing game. I have barely scratched the surface in the game, there is so much to learn and so many different ways you can go about doing things. The game is pretty big (in my oppinnion), and definitely has a massively high replay value. The game is very difficult and will take quite a while of learning and dying, so if you dont like a challenge then the game certainly isn't for you, but if you can get over that then you will love it.

								This is a fantastic old school RPG. Every item scavanged, however small, feels like an accomplishment.  Every hex explored is an adventure. Every encounter is the fight of your life. I encourage you to try the demo... but even more so to buy the full game because it is more full featured and provides a fuller experience.  I highly recommend this game.			"

								At first glace I didn't enjoy it much.However, after a few very fast deaths I have managed to keep my player alive for about 5 hours.You will become quickly addicted once you gather some items and increase your chance of survival.Holding up random looters for their gear has never felt more rewarding.10/10Buy it and keep at it.Once you get past the learning curve it becomes an amazing time killer.

								Very much enjoyed this game and will likely play it some more. I haven't even gotten very far so far, just under 5 days of survival I believe. Much like FTL (Faster Than Light) you will find this game gives the player a number of significant choices in a world that is generated differently each time with events equally varied and random. The game has it's flaws, to be sure. And without using much of a guide thus far I still occasionally get confused or am unsure as to how some mechanic works. It has occurred once that I was in a fight I believed I was winning when all of a sudden my equipment had disappeared and I was out of battle finding myself thinking to the game ""I'm sure you're right, but why?"". All in all, the game has many possibilities to make it immersive, there are a few things to be improved on, a few minor bugs and a learning curve if you want to make your way far. But all in all, I would say this is great for a player looking for a good survival game. Much like FTL, this game isn't made for you to be the hero, or in your favor like other games where you are central to the plot. You exist on it's terms, you can't run around being all-mighty.I would also like to add that this game has static graphics to accommodate the text/UI based game so don't expect anything aesthetically amazing. The graphics accomplish what they need to accomplish, they will make the world feel complete, but not 'beautiful', and to be frank that's fine. It suits what the game is. With that said, I would also like to add that the text portions are very well written in my opinion and the events I have encountered thus far have been incredibly interesting.This game isn't for everyone. If you aren't interested in survival games I wouldn't recommend it, nor if you are looking for a beautiful game. If you believe you have the imagination however or desire to see how you'd fare in a survival game I would definitely suggest looking into the game a bit further and possibly throwing out the $10 to buy into the game.

								I for one am a very big fanatic of hardcore survival games such as this one, but had been surprised when I first started playing. I have been playing ""hardcore"" games for years, now. This game brings on a new definition for the word. This game is immerciful, harsh, and unforgiving. One wrong move and you could have your entire life come crashing down. You should never expect to live longer than past the night when playing this game. At first, you'll likely only live about a few hours, if not a day or two. After a while, you'll start discovering recipes, finding equipment, and even special places that do/don't have much to do with the story, such as Zom Zom's. Along the paths you take, you will have opportunities to help people, scavenge for resources, and even get in a fight or two. The entire game is ectremely difficult and is not something to be played leisurely. I do have one problem with the game, though, and that's the constant dying by ""Acute bleeding in the lungs."" It's almost become the new ""Arrow in the knee"", which can also happen, making your experience feel somewhat ironic at times. But, back to the ""Acute bleeding in the lungs"", I find that it happens much too often, making the game feel somewhat less serious. Sure, it only happens after getting whacked in the chest and stomach repeatedly, but you could imagine how annoying it would be to see that it's the only reason you die, half of the time. I would reccomend this game to any person interested in a new type of survival game. A word of warning, though; don't take off your talisman!			"

								Don't let the boardgame hex look and turn-based gameplay fool you: This is a complex survival simulation, one of the best I've played and almost certainly the best on Steam. Even in early access, the game is in a completely playable and mature state, a notable contrast to the buggy, imbalanced status of almost every game available in this genre.The drag/drop crafting system is intuitive yet almost too simple, at once the game's greatest asset and biggest barrier to sinking too much time into it. A few minor ease of use tweaks would go a long way. Still, conceptually, this is the kind of system RPGs need to return to, especially outside of the roguelike/survival setting. The far less accessible UnReal World is the only game I can think of that compares. This game drops a lot of the old-school roguelike cruft in a positive way (usually that's a bad thing!), so I would honestly recommend this to anybody interested in this sort of game first.			"

								First time ever writing a review.. Needless to say I'm pretty stoked about NEO Scavenger. I had stopped playing a while because the character I'd gotten good gear with got sick and died or something.. but I recently picked this back up and I have to say I'm impressed with the additions that have been made. Overall the game itself is frustrating, but not in  a bad way. You're constantly being challenged with the goal of survival. Right from the beginning the game throws this DogMan creature at you and you have several different ways to play out the encounter. What surprised me most was the wraith like being that popped up out of nowhere when I made it to the city, silly ol' me thought I could take a whack at him with a crowbar, Mr. Wraith had other ideas. I died... rightfully so. All in all... I think NEO Scavenger was a good purchase, if you aren't sure don't shy away from that demo, it'll give you a good idea what this game is all about,Also.. NEW SHOES!			"

								The combat is turn based, but feels organic and possesses a gritty realism that is unparalleled. The first few fights are always the worst until your last. You take turns tackling other survivors to the groud, kicking while they're down, dragging and scraping and brutally beating one another with whatever wrench or saucepan or tree limb that is at hand until one of you begs for mercy, but only after sustaining a broken arm and internal bleeding. On the other hand, simply waving a gun and shouting is usually enough to scare off scavangers, nevermind you don't have any bullets because they don't need to know that. When a turn based system can get your heart pounding, something is being done right.			"

								This game looks and is low-tech, with alot of difficulty for new players. (suggest you get the demo first). That being said, this game is amazingly fun, replayabled and has ALOT of places it can expand into. If you like hardcore survival and a great challenge, I can't recommend this game enough for you. I was amazed at how many hours I put into it after awhile, and just how easy it is to get back into it for a few hours. It gives me a feeling of satisfaction when surviving fights and finding great gear, because it isn't easy. The fighting is Do or Die and one wrong slip or one strong thrust of a spear from a Bad Mutha and you're out. Once again this game is great and I hope alot of people buy and support its creator.			"

								I really like Neo Scavenger. That's why there will be a long, LONG review on it. To Start, in even a short time of five hours, this game has left a great impression on me, from death to art style to dialogues... It's brilliant to begin with.Gameplay: You wake up in the middle of Michigan in some sort of year, in which humanity is back to the dark ages. Heal yourself, fight, scavenge, explore, talk, DAMN. And more. Every choice is better then Mass Effect's Endings and choices. DAAAAMN. 10/10Story/Quests: Survive in the apocalypse, find out who you are, DUN DUN DUN! Kinda cliche, but I will give the quests and random encounters credit. 7/10Dialogues: Pretty long, and most of the lore is delivered through it, which was somewhat of a let-down. However, the dialogue was good. I'll shame it for it's lack of a Dialogue Tree thus far. 7/10AI: The AI was great. Enemies were either cowards or knew how to fight, and their AI reflected that. With the combat system, it sets up a difficulty of COMPLEXITY, and that's either really good or bad game design. Here, it's done great. 8/10World Design: Semi-Dynamic, beautifully designed, randomly generated. It's luck, but damn good luck. 9/10Graphics: The game is set up in a 32-bit art style (I believe?), and the graphics look promising. Some shots of the world are detailed, even with 32 pixels. This game would have great graphics back in the 32-bit era, and good indie graphics. 8/10Sound: Haha. None. 0/10Music: There is a death track, thus far. Nothing special. 4/10The verdict for NEO Scavenger is an 8.75/10. It delivers well, and it's promising, even for late Early Access. Some small tweaks, and this could easily go over a 9.DayZ Review Gimmick: ""Slept in an office, robbed and left with my plastic bag. 8.75/10, would sleep again.""			"

								Neo Scavenger is perfect for the hardcore Post Apocalyptic fan. If you've ever wanted a gritty, brutal depiction of survival when everything hits the fan. Continually updated, well made game, with a great artwork, riveting descriptions of important structures, and each playthrough is always different. With alittle imagination, the basic graphics and be ignored and you can become enthralled in your own personal story of survival.TLDR MODEPROS:Alot of content for a fair priceContinually updatedExtremely Dynamic GameplayRealistic feel and setting (for the most part)CONS:Extremely Difficult for beginners,Basic graphics (Who really cares about that?)Sometimes frustrating.

								Well, if you're into games like FTL, or df in the way you pretty much lose no matter what, this is your game! GAMEPLAY:In every way its a flash game, as most of us gamers believe, flash games suck for the most part. Though, this game is interesting and enjoyable. There are wolfdogs(kind of like a warewolf but dog instead....first encouter creature) and melonheads(science experiments gone wrong?), then you have good old raiders and looters. The AI in this game is really good! It tracks you(every time you move you have tracks layed down, and the AI can/will follow them if you dont hide them. There are skills that allow you to scavenge better, like lock picking. You can build things with machanic, etc. There is a large crafting system, vehicals to pull/push your stuff around(aka sleds, shopping carts.) So, all in all if you're like me, meaning you pinch every penny and get at least 20+hrs from every game, then this is most likely for you. 10/10 would buy.			"

								Neo Scavenger is a survival game where you're dropped into a harsh post apocolyptic world with no instructions or idea of what the end game could possibly be. Everything matters: you need to stay warm, you need to eat, you need to drink, you need to not get cholera from eating and drinking... Add this to the fact that there other survivors out to kill and rob you as well as monsters and you may have some idea why I've yet to survive for 3 days. Turn based and very intricate I would strongly recommend that you at least try the demo. One of those games where you'll hate and love it at the same time.			"

								THIS is what Early access games should be THIS is what a post apocalyptic setting should be like. Its hard to describe in words what this game doesnt do right i mean jeez man the gameplay is addictive it too away 2 entire days of my life of me just trying out different handycaps different good traits its hardcore 1 mess up will screw you over is what keeps me on my toes combined with the one save rule the game enforces this is what a hardcore game is. The AI is unforgiving at times but it still leaves open the chance to run at a price at times or if luck is on your side scott free which is really cool in my opinion. Although i suppose if i had to make i con its that there arent many enemys to battle (or avoid) and there isnt too many things you can use to carry your gear but sense its early access it has a pass i just hope they add that soon its a much needed addition. But besides that this game is a testiment of what gamming is and that there will always be dev's who are creative and will do different things such as making this a text based game which was brilliant in my opinion, I look forward to play this game more as more patches arise time was well spent playing this game.

								After checking this out in the store it didn't look like much but, I decided to give it a try. For a game developed entirely in flash, it's awesome. A totally engrossing experience, you'll find yourself experimenting with builds, strategy and crafting. The interface is nice enough that you can figure out the majority of the game by just clicking around be warned, there is no in-game tutorial. Do yourself a favor and check out the FAQs and wikis. With some tweaking, this game would be awesome on a tablet, too. I was playing it via RDP on my Andriod tablet and had some trouble clicking around but enjoyed myself a great deal, anyway. I would totally buy this again if it ended up being released on Andriod.			"

								I heard about this game from a friend and decided to play the demo to see how I felt. About two hours passed and I purchased the actual game, to spend another two or three hours playing the balls off of it.At first a first look I was unsure about the action events (fights, encounters etc.) seeing as it was primarily text and seemed like it would be a little dull. I was very wrong, while yes the action events are just text along with some other info (character portraits, conditions and so on), it doesn't detract from the intensity at all. If anything imagining what is happening as it's described to you makes the whole fight even more tense.I think the most appealing thing about this game is how realistic it is. You can (and will) die in so many different ways, it's fantastic! You can be beaten to death, bleed out, get poisoned, mauled, shot, etc. But what I love is how indirect it is. You can go into a forest and eat some berries, a few turns later you get some pop up text informing you that your character is vomiting. What caused that? Was it the berries? The dirty bandage giving you an infection? The water from the lake? Along with hunger, thrist, sleep deprivation, temperature and the horde of melonheads closing in the game becomes very stressful. But in the best possible way.Besides the many ways to die, the scavenging is top notch. Far better than say Fallout for the sake of argument, where you gather stuff for a while and then you're good till end game. In NEO Scavenger you need to keep scavenging to survive and you will not find guns in every house, or food in every cabin. Chances are you'll die before ever using a gun, but when you have one with the right ammo, you feel worried about using it in case it's wasted. This combined with the crafting and character skills to open up new options, makes each playthrough very different.  The best part is the game isn't even done yet, so new features are being added to make this experience even better. So if you're reading this right now and you're still unsure I really reccommend you at least try the demo. I think this game is fantastic and would really sing it's praises to anyone who's looking for a challenging and realistic survival game.  I'd give it a solid 8/10 so far, would be swarmed by melonheads again.			"

												Despite some of the more fantastic elements of the game, such as the inclusion of monsters from urban legend, such as the Michigan dog man and the Enfield horror, this is one of the more realistic survival experiences I've seen.  most of the time, the reasons why I died had more to do with the enviroment, freezing to death especially, but also poisoning, disease, nd starvation.  aas for the combat, it also has a more realistic feel, with some fights dragging on for several minutes as you get chased through the woods, while even weaker weapons can easily cause enemies to bleed out with good strikes.  sometimes i wish certain enemy types would be more adaptive, with most raiders attacking on sight and most people running away as soon as you spot them once you get good equipment, it still a really good game.

								Permadeath has never been so fun!It's so hard to find a good survival game that doesn't feature hordes of the undead - often in place of more creative challenges to, well, staying alive. Similarly, it's the rare title that does anything very well at all for less than $10 these days. NEO Scavenger fits both bills and still has more to come (I guess... I haven't noticed many bugs and I think I've progressed a fair distance). You'll probably need the wiki to help you get started, if only because you have to get the hang of some of the craftable items. I played the demo for about forty-five minutes before grabbing the full version and only had two or three things I'd count as bugs:1) My save data was inexplicably lost once, but I didn't mind starting over2) It seems to me that there's really only one way to start with any decent chance but that's not necessarily going to stay true in the final version (and I could be wrong - there's a decent amount of randomness with each play)3) Sometimes you setup a camp site and it disappears later, sometimes re-appearing on a later visit to that hexNone of these, for me, are game-breakers because I'm not playing NEO Scavenger to win - I'm playing to -survive-. This means battling cold weather, raiders and dogmen, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and the dangers of exploring/scavenging ruined buildings that might collapse on you at any moment. I simply include most of the bugs along with the other dangers and keep on truckin' (or start a new game). I highly recommend that anyone looking to play a game that focuses on those things as NEO Scavenger really does it well. Happy Gaming!			"

								If Fallout and Dungeons & Dragons had a baby, it would be NEO Scavenger.  It's fun, emotionally intense, and frustratingly difficult at times, but still manages to keep you hooked and playing over and over again.  Will have you frantically searching for single shoes and empty water bottles.			"

								This  game is amazing. It has endless replayability and there is so much to do and make. The developers obviously put alot of hard work and thought into this game and it paid off. The story is the same but how you complete it differs. While as great as this game is, I do not reccomend it to people who have little patience, because this game can be incredibly frusterating. It is very hard to survive and once you die that's it. No take-backs or nothing, so it's crucial to manage your stats and to use your heads when events happen. NeoScavenger is easy to learn with simple controls, and isn't too hard on your computer (aka, even the crappiest of computers should be able to run this pretty well). I seriously reccomend it, if you're looking into buying this game, just stop reading reviews now and buy it. You wont be disappointed.			"

Early Access Review
								THIS is what Early access games should be THIS is what a post apocalyptic setting should be like. Its hard to describe in words what this game doesnt do right i mean jeez man the gameplay is addictive it too away 2 entire days of my life of me just trying out different handycaps different good traits its hardcore 1 mess up will screw you over is what keeps me on my toes combined with the one save rule the game enforces this is what a hardcore game is. The AI is unforgiving at times but it still leaves open the chance to run at a price at times or if luck is on your side scott free which is really cool in my opinion. Although i suppose if i had to make i con its that there arent many enemys to battle (or avoid) and there isnt too many things you can use to carry your gear but sense its early access it has a pass i just hope they add that soon its a much needed addition. But besides that this game is a testiment of what gamming is and that there will always be dev's who are creative and will do different things such as making this a text based game which was brilliant in my opinion, I look forward to play this game more as more patches arise time was well spent playing this game.

								After checking this out in the store it didn't look like much but, I decided to give it a try. For a game developed entirely in flash, it's awesome. A totally engrossing experience, you'll find yourself experimenting with builds, strategy and crafting. The interface is nice enough that you can figure out the majority of the game by just clicking around be warned, there is no in-game tutorial. Do yourself a favor and check out the FAQs and wikis. With some tweaking, this game would be awesome on a tablet, too. I was playing it via RDP on my Andriod tablet and had some trouble clicking around but enjoyed myself a great deal, anyway. I would totally buy this again if it ended up being released on Andriod.			"

								I heard about this game from a friend and decided to play the demo to see how I felt. About two hours passed and I purchased the actual game, to spend another two or three hours playing the balls off of it.At first a first look I was unsure about the action events (fights, encounters etc.) seeing as it was primarily text and seemed like it would be a little dull. I was very wrong, while yes the action events are just text along with some other info (character portraits, conditions and so on), it doesn't detract from the intensity at all. If anything imagining what is happening as it's described to you makes the whole fight even more tense.I think the most appealing thing about this game is how realistic it is. You can (and will) die in so many different ways, it's fantastic! You can be beaten to death, bleed out, get poisoned, mauled, shot, etc. But what I love is how indirect it is. You can go into a forest and eat some berries, a few turns later you get some pop up text informing you that your character is vomiting. What caused that? Was it the berries? The dirty bandage giving you an infection? The water from the lake? Along with hunger, thrist, sleep deprivation, temperature and the horde of melonheads closing in the game becomes very stressful. But in the best possible way.Besides the many ways to die, the scavenging is top notch. Far better than say Fallout for the sake of argument, where you gather stuff for a while and then you're good till end game. In NEO Scavenger you need to keep scavenging to survive and you will not find guns in every house, or food in every cabin. Chances are you'll die before ever using a gun, but when you have one with the right ammo, you feel worried about using it in case it's wasted. This combined with the crafting and character skills to open up new options, makes each playthrough very different.  The best part is the game isn't even done yet, so new features are being added to make this experience even better. So if you're reading this right now and you're still unsure I really reccommend you at least try the demo. I think this game is fantastic and would really sing it's praises to anyone who's looking for a challenging and realistic survival game.  I'd give it a solid 8/10 so far, would be swarmed by melonheads again.			"

												This is an engrossing survival game that sloooowly becomes easier as you learn to do basic actions to ensure your survival...like sterilizing water and crafting a sharp-stick spear.  If you die in the game you must restart...unless you have manually copied a save game (nsSGv1.sol) to another folder.  In fact it is nearly impossible to progress without this crutch.  The game is very fun at first but once you have learned to survive for long periods you realize there is little other content.  There are some simple ""quests"" but mostly it is the same thing over and over.  I liked the game very much and played for more than 30 hours.   Well worth the $10-$15 price.  Can't figure out how to give a numerical rating but it would be 7.5.			"

												Possibly the best survival game I've ever played. I was very hesitant to purchase this particular game after my experience with Don't Starve. Although I did enjoy the gameply of Don't Starve, I feel no need to come back to that game, because even with it's rogue-like elements, it feels like the same experience every time. This is something I feel NEO Scavenger did much better. The skill system has so many good choices, that no particular set feels like the ""best"" way to play the game. It simply comes down to which way you actually want to play your current playthrough.The other thing NEO Scavenger did particularly well is entry to the game itself. Without limiting the player's choices, the developers found a way to keep the game simple enough at the start that you wouldn't get lost in the incredibly complex mechanics until you actually need to use the particular rules of the game. By starting you with noting to survive the cold weather, you're forced to learn how to utilize the scavenge mechanic, which is the most important decision of the game. If more games that were this complex had openings like this one, I feel more people could explore the depths of these incredible games.Even though it's clearly done on a budget, the art of the game is very well chosen. I found it easy to destinguish between the different items that I scavenged, and I rarely felt confused by the sprites that were on screen.Even though the story itself isn't the big draw to the game itself, it's very well written. I found myself genuinely caring about my character and even being sympathetic to some of the people i encountered. These characters were made so well that I genuinely found myself thinking if I really needed to kill the people I came across. Even though it's clearly ""every man for himself"", the difficulty of recovering from fights and the chance of my having to drop my cart and run made each encounter a very difficult choice.This is quickly becoming one of my favorite titles that I found on steam.

Its harsh, and you should probably expect to die a horrible, cold death the first couple times you play. But when you start to figure out everything, it gets easier. I haven't gotten too far into the game yet, but there seems to be a pretty cool story involving your character. I highly reccomend picking up this game			"

The learning curve is reasonable ( You die frozen/ starved the first few times around) and you will quickly find out how useful some skills are compared to others. Now speaking in terms of story, there is a lot to find out: If you have the chance to talk with people, take advantage of it.

												After spending an in-game day or two barely subsisting on squirrels, I spotted a military looking guy near my camp. I hid and spied on him, he hadn't seen me. I creeped up behind him and managed to get the jump on him with my crowbar. He went down like a sack of potatoes and now all his shiny army gear was mine. I am the master of the wasteland!I then spent the next 3 days being relentlessly tracked and hunted by his 2 army buddies who eventually caught up to me, shot me in the gut, stripped all my gear and left me to bleed out :(10/10, incredibly detailed survival simulator randomly generated for a different playthrough every time.

												A surprisingly deep game about amnesia and survival in a harsh, apocalyptic themed world. Manage food, hunger, body temperature, and injuries and disease while you try to navigate the world avoiding fearsome monsters and people alike. Find the most secure campsite you can and hope that nothing gets the jump on you while you sleep (crafting can help alleviate this issue), encounter different events around the world which will make the world you're inhabiting seem strange, engage in a very deep combat system which has many types of injuries and conditions as well as ways to go about combat, and ultimately try and figure out who 'you' are.In case barely surviving through the mass consumation of ketchup packets isn't your thing, it's the only game I've ever played where I got into combat wielding a bag of potato chips and pulling an orange toboggan behind me, or after the stars aligned punched somebody so hard in the chest that they died of acute bleeding after one hit.

												One of my favorite rougelike games in recent memory. I actually really enjoyed learning all the mechanics of survival, and going from only being able to survive for less than a day reliabily to learning how to survive for days and weeks on end was really rewarding.I must have spent 30 hours learning the systems, and around 2-3 hours for a winning run. I only wish that there was more content: it felt like the game was only just getting started by the time I had won. Then again, I guess it does make sense to end the game when you're getting a run to the point where you're pretty self sufficiant. It could get a bit boring otherwise.			"

												All-righty, nothing like waking up from a nice long cryo slumber with nothing but a hospital gown, a wrist-Band, and a 1970's medallion to your name. Then immediately being assailed by a cross between Cujo and Hulk Hogan, which causes you to flee for your life into the wastelands  of Detroit...(Which oddly enough is a lot like present day Detroit). It is all good for a while drink a little scavenged H2O and some berries ( I suggest the Botany Skill ). Ahh yes you can feel the rumble in your tunny as the unfiltered and tainted water begins to take it's toll. Soon you are crapping blood and running for your life to find the nearest tree so you can prolapse your♥♥♥♥♥♥, congratulations in the not so distant future amoebic dysentery is alive and well . After crapping yourself into the who's who book of The Screaming Squats, you realize you are now suffering from hypothermia...but it is ok you can pretty much scavenge , salvage, and construct most anything. That is of course if the Melon-Heads, and Bad Mutha do not find you and make you ""Squeell Like a Big Boy! CAUSE YOU SURE DO GOTS A PERTTY MOUTH!"". MAYBE YOU LOOSE IT AND AXE MURDER THE WHOLE LOT OF THEM WHILE THEY SLEEP...!Just do not eat them, eating human meat is for Punks...dont be a Punk, harvest a berry or eat a shroom....then start beating feat again...Just understand you are gona die...maybe you'll freeze or starve, or crap yourself to death, get eaten, electrocuted....who knows,but it will happen....But it is OK, because this is one fun as hell game...It will not try to dazzle you with BS, no super flashy graphics to hide the fact that it sux more than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ named Eureka..No, see because if you took this game from Samuel L Jackson and dropped it in a bag of other games, and then same told you to give him his Sh*% back and you asked which one was his...Sam would tell you...It is the game that has Bad Mutha f%$#$% written on it.

It's old school nintendo hard at its finest. It's permadeath, so if that's a turn off save your money but it opens up the option for different styles of play and gaming. Also, take trapping. If your just starting out, take trapping. It makes the game so much easier to play and you are less of lady luck's ♥♥♥♥♥. All in all, worth the money. Wait for a sale if you can, but if not, I'd buy this again for 15 bucks.			"

												I have discovered my true calling as a hobo, fighting off feral dogs to scavenge post-apocalyptic ruins for anything remotely valuable.This game is quite good. It's actually very short, which is probably a good thing because it's so difficult. However, despite the amount of random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that seems to kill you in this game, I never had a death where that I couldn't see why it was my fault. The world is extremely harsh, but you'll mostly find out about the stuff that kills you early in the game, or it's common sense, so you won't get to the endgame only to be insta-killed unless YOU do something stupid. Just be aware that the minute you DO do anything stupid, you will probably die. This, together with the core gameplay around surviving, is what kept me coming back to the game, even after ragequitting in frustration and deciding to never play it again. The different systems around survival -health, scavenging, combat, crafting, character creation, bartering, and inventory - work together extremely well. I have a weakness for survival and sandbox games, especially rogue-like survival games, but I'm also very harsh on them. I have a lot of problems with games like Minecraft, Rust, Ark, Terraria, DayZ and more. NEO Scavenger has been the perfect survival experience for me though. It's not something to spend hundreds of hours on, no. Based on my playtime so far and the playtime of other reviewers, 70ish hours seems to be the cap before interest dives. That's when I felt like I had thoroughly learned how the game worked. What makes this an engaging experience is going from knowing nothing about the game to being able to take on any challenge it thows at you. Amazingly, it succeeds in being an experience both fantastic and realistic.It's not perfect, of course. The story events and random events have some problems, but even though these choose-your-own-adventure style events can kill you, they're actually surprisingly lenient compared to the core mechanics of the game. You usually have to screw up pretty bad to get killed, and most frequently you just get a slap on the hand if you didn't choose exactly the right path through event. Since I died so much outside of the events, it was pretty fun to see how different paths and different character builds affected the outcome. Other than that, I personally couldn't care about the story and events very much. It's interesting, moderately good quality, and original. I normally love narrative and world-building in games, but in NEO Scavenger it took the backseat to the core gameplay. The only negative thing I can say about that is it could just use MORE. The art style, while flat, is exactly what it needs to be for the game, but everything definitely looks the same after only an hour or two. If there were a few more hex-types and some variation in textures, and especially if there was some physical depth, as in changes in elevation, to the terrain, it would be much more visually interesting. The item count is decent, but if there was just a bit more customization possible it would be awesome, and then every single npc wouldn't look identical. The map is actually quite large, and it can take a long time to get across it when you're looting everything that's even slightly lootable and fending off all manner of dangers along the way, but it could really use a few more unique locations with events tied to them, even though I said that's not what I'm here for. The character building is great: it really does feel like original Fallout and it totally determines what you can do and how you play, but for a system so deep it just feels so small. The world NEO Scavenger takes place in is very interesting, but outside of vague newspaper articles there's not actually all that much to explain it all. With a more cohesive and expansive lore, I could really get into this world. The story, like I said, is very short, and I frankly don't care that much about it; it's good enough for me. But it does have this interesting problem that unless you explore everything you can easily ""complete"" the story in just two ""quests"". It's pretty hard to tell what kind of story NEO Scavenger wants to tell, and how. I don't think it needs to be longer. With multiple paths and endings and the difficulty of the game it benefits from being short. But it does need a few more storytelling mechanics, and probably a better, more dense distribution of the story throughout the gameplay. As is, you play the core game and progress for a long while, and then you get a big chunk of wall-of-text story.All in all, if you want a solid survival role-playing game, this is what you want. I think that for the type of people who enjoy this game you can expect as much as 70 hours of extremely engaging time with this game, which is definitely worth $15. Enjoy!			"

But if  you can look over that fact and have some love for indie and survival games. This is DEFINITELY a game for you. You have to start over a lot of times and find ways to make the game easier for you.

												Despite its aged graphics and less than perfect UI this is a real gem of a post apocalyptic survival game. It can be truly unforgiving, but that to me was one of the things that drew me into the world of NEO Scavenger. The survival aspect is a lot more engaging to me than most other survival type games I've played, and you quickly learn to pick your battles very carefully. Just like in reality, a single wound can end up killing you if you're careless and don't have access to modern medicine, and nature itself can be equally lethal. This is something I've found to be missing from most other survival games. The story is fairly interesting as well, but some of the choice based encounters are a bit harsh. And losing a character that survived for a long time in one of those is rarely fun. Still, the game kept drawing me back in until I had beaten it, and I'm looking forward to what the developer has in store for us next.If you want a challenge, love the roguelike aspect of dead is dead in a post apocalyptic setting and can look past the graphics then you can't really go wrong with this game.

												Highly recomended, this game lets you do a lot that, at surface level it does not apper that it would be deep enough to allow.Example: I had just reached a little shack in the woods, I was a little low on provisions, so I desided to camp there for a little while so i could try to find water and food. While I was there two looters with guns came by and tryed to steal my stuff. I, naturaly, tryed to stop them. After all that was all my stuff. They shot me a couple of times, and while a was sitting on the floor looseing blood they made off with my backpack full of stuff and most of my medical equipment. I dressed my wounds as best I could, and went to get some water and something to eat. I was banged up, but I would live. Then as i was headed back to my shack, I eat some poisonous berries and died.If you think that sounds frustrating, it was, but that is not the games fault, it was mine. You learn from your mistakes and you get better, could not recomend this game any more than I am right now, buy it.			"

												You wake up from a cryo sleep.You look around and suddenly you're attaked by a massive hairy werewolf like creature.What do you do?Do you run out the window like a coward? Do you use your nerd skills to hack the door to shut? Do you use your medical prowess to unfreeze another cryo sleeper and use him as a live bait?If you are like me you'll choose secret option 4: Beat the living daylights out of it, video record the beating and then procede to skin him and run around Post-Apocalyptic Michigan wearing his flayed hide for as long as you can.""As long as you can"" = Death by cholera. Day 3 (but maybe you'll have better luck!)Pretty much Oregon Trail meets the Walking Dead, this Post Apocalyptic romp will have you dying millions of times but trust me, you'll learn to love it (in a non-masochistic way, of course. Lets keep things PG) Perfect game for people who like survival games. Only down side was the poorly directed objectives, but hey, it's a survival game not an rpg, SURVIVE is enough of a goal for me.Happy hunting.P.S. Nevereverever take off that amulet around your neck unless you want a cool way to comit suicide. Trust me. I know things.			"

												♥♥♥♥ yeah.  This game is great so far and I've only put 32 hours into it.  I haven't touched any mods yet.  Very excited to play it again and I've been dreaming about it (daydreaming and night dreaming).  I've only even used two sets of perks that were closely related (strong, melee, medic, trapping, athletic).If you like games like FTL, 7 Days to Die, X-Com, get it.  If you're on the fence, get it.

												I like it a lot, but I never seem to survive long. Decided to make a awesome forest dude who could was strong and had botany, he was awesome. Unfortunatly he met his demise in a forest when he decided he could take on a beast. So then I decided I would see if a computer nerd with medicine would survive. nope, froze to death.I keep playing this despite my guy never making it more than a few days. My best guy made it to the city and then was gunned down when he left by a guy with a lucky shot...And I keep playing...Either this game is good or I'm a masochist.Or both.:)			"

												This game will rip you into pieces if you haven't watch someone play it or do some wiki research beforehand.I decided to go long range so it might be easier on me. I killed everything in my path with ease, but then they started coming into packs of wild dogs!two at a time? no sweat! another consecutive dog after the two? I can make it!A dogman afterwards? Wtf game?Another consecutive dogman. Running outta ammo...A third consecutive dogman? ♥♥♥♥! WTH!isdedNext run:I can do it!A pack of 2 dogs at the beginning. Alright I'll run away.Retreat into a bad mutha with a rifle. No problem he probably doesn't have bullets, as usual.fall back to throw stones at him. Get shot and instantly dead...You win game!

												This game is rather unique. It has a pretty flexible crafting system which is nice and combat is pretty different. I have two regrets. One is that it's hard to make a balanced character due to their trait system I find myself only making someone super strong or someone with good survival skills, it's hard to make a character that can do both and last a week. The second is that even though you can make an area your camp it isn't an effective base system, you can't really protect it or give it defenses.It's an ok game just not very immersive for me. 5/10			"

												Neo Scavenger and me just clicked right.The games in depth detail to inventory management and crafting just had me fall in love with it. It's a little intimidating at first and you'll  probably have to look at the wiki to learn how to survive. This game doesn't hold your hand. You're not special. You're as weak as everyone else. But once you learn the ropes you'll feel like a pro survivor of the apocolyse. I found this game quite immerisve in the sense that once I understood how to play I could think of something and it'll work. Like I got a scope and it's sunny out, time to make a fire with that to boil some water with my steel bowl. I think back to this game often of how smart it is how smart it made me feel when I was ruling the wasteland... until I was killed in my sleep by a dog man.			"

												This game is a true survival game, and follows the rouglike forumular very well, and chances are you will not survive youre first play though. Although once you get though the game and understand what you must do to survive it can become very metagamey, you will eventualy pick a particular path every play though because its ""right"" and there are some instances in some encounters that will kill you that make no sence, like getting eaten by 'the grudge' monster in the assylum. but that said there are some elements of common sence that can be followed though some of the other encounters its very aparent after reaching the main city that the game maker just wanted to wrap up the game as quickly as he could, and it dose not really end with any kind of real resolve. Some time the Random encounters toy with the part of you that wants to be a wasteland hero instilled in us by games like fallout, only to flip you the middle finger and remind you that you are very human and weak and vulnerable and something bad happening to you as a result. Some of the writing could be improved being a bit more decriptive, but it captures the feeling of Michagan Hobo cannibal shoe Salesman very well.			"

												I love love love this game. It is fun,hard,and no matter what,you are GOING TO DIE.the only downside is the new ability selecter.What you used to have:4 free slots for being human.extra slots for you to pick weaknesses,yet have some strengths to balance it.What you have now:The stupidest selecting system ever,they limit your ability to make your character SO badly. now you have 15 ability points,and the weaknesses add to your ability points. the downside? Each ability you used to use takes so many points.My character set:Melee,Tough,Strong,Medic,Botany and Trapping. Weaknesses:Myopia (see a tile less) and insomniaMy new character: Didn't even make him,I just gave up.Now,I'm not saying I hate the game. In fact,I highly reccomend it. It's a fantastic experience. The story is beautifully immersive,and the areas you go to range from scaring the absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you,to Madhouses for insane survivors,to Utopian Societies. Like I said,it is a beautiful game,and a once in a life time experience. Get it?

												When I'm tired from working and my brain is having  a hard time kicking into gear in more intense games, Neo Scavenger foots the bill.Addictively fun.  Sometimes you just have to laugh at yourself.  The permadeath makes this game a fun challenge.  You may die alot in the beginning but then you start to figure things out and it gets a little easier.  If you remember your survival basics ( shelter, fire, water, food ), and don't take off your necklace, you will eventually get to a point where your surviving indefinitely and can go hunting for the quests and hidden adventures that are scattered around.I look at the stupid number of hours I have played this game and think to myself...""Really?""warning: Don't go into the swamp!

												This game drops you right into conflict: you wake up amnesiac, barefoot, naked, with a hungry wolf-thing in the adjacent room of a cryogenic facility.The first second of the game is pretty much the last time you won't be desperately hungry, thirsty, hypothermic, exhausted, bleeding out, diseased, hunted down, or some gruesome mix of these things.From there, the game revolves around challenging resource management as you explore a large hex-titled world looking for supplies and answers.Do you leave behind the squirrel-trap or the cleaver?Do you carry the sleeping bag or the rifle with 5 bullets?Do you risk alerting the raiders nearby with a bonfire or do you let the cold weather grip you a bit tighter for another sleepless night?Do you eat the rancid meat or do you risk a fist-fight with another looter to see if they have food?Do you slowly drag their corpse to the woods to cook their flesh or do you press onwards into the fog of war?Do you run to your next destination and get there in a day or do you silently sneak there and get there in three?Until NEO Scavenger, I had no idea a turn-based hex-tiled game could compel such a convincing post-apocalyptic desperation.My advice to you is to just jump in and hang in there until you've spent a couple hours. To be honest, I didn't even like the game at first until I'd suffered about ten deaths or so. Then I began to understand and get a glimpse of what the game had to offer. Like when I let a bandit limp away from a fight only for him to come back five turns later to kill me in my sleep with the cleaver I left behind at a salvage site a few tiles away.It also sometimes feels like you aren't making any progress since it's so easy to die (permadeath), but soon you realize that you're surviving a little longer every attempt - 3 days, 5 days, 1 week, 2 weeks. And the game just gets better and better as you begin to master it. What used to seem like a basic combat system turns out to be a nuanced one. What used to seem like a pointless skill/ability becomes your favorite. etc.My only complaint is that the UI is sometimes a bit tedious. For example, having to put down the sleeping bag every night and remember to pick it back up in the morning. Or doing the same 10-mouseclick dance with the crafting system to chop wood, light a fire, cook meat, and then eat the meat. But then again, you're usually so happy to find meat that 10 or so clicks is a small price to pay.Also, due to the crafting system UI, it's tedious to answer the question: ""What can I craft with the things I currently have in my inventory?"" As I accumulate items, I often find myself flipping through my recipes to see if I can make anything useful, only to do it again in five turns to see if anything changed. The game would benefit from a quick-view of ""Here are the items you can currently craft"" with the ability to click those items to instantly make them.However, the grid-based inventory management system is a fun minigame in itself. It really is addictive to answer questions like ""Should I put the pistol with zero bullets in my pocket or should I fill my pocket with these gummy bears?"" - Oh wait, your worn-out pants are going to disintegrate in about five turns, but you'll probably get hunted down by a mutant wolf before you have to deal with that.Good luck!

												After reading a few reviews, I was sceptical, especially after one person said it was similar to FTL (Faster then light) which is ok, but really dosen't compare. This game is similar in a lot of ways yet totaly differant and much more enjoyable. It's very random so some people might be turned of by that, and you can't save! even though....games can last a hell of a long time once you learn some crafting and your skills you pick at start. Its all good though. Best game of the year imo.Highly recomended! 10/10			"

If you were a fan of fallout tactics,or fallout 1/2 this game will blend well with you. 8/10Not a 9/10 since it does rely HEAVILY on RNG a.k.a luck. If you die quick dont hate the game try a few more lives before you judge.			"

												Raw, Challenging, Unforgiving and ultimately a test of will. You must survive in a harsh environment against realistic conditions and wounds in what appears to be a post apocolyptic world. Every wound could become your last as you struggle to find equipment to help push you forward. Balance your traits to your advantage and use them as your life depends on it.This seemingly simple game will prove a true challenge as even the most seasoned veteren can find himself in an untimely end as the environment and its stalkers barrage you with attacks from bitter cold, poisoned food to cannibalistic warriors hell bent on your life. Every night could be your last as survival is truly of the fittest.This game pushes you to your limits as you use your wits to make every choice from what you carry, to how you fight, and how you treat that gashed leg and shattered ribs.Can you survive?As someone who truly loves a true raw environment where the details count in the mechanics of the game, I have to give this a high score. It's truly one of the few of its kind out there and it does it excellently. I highly recommend this game!			"

												Despite its aged graphics and less than perfect UI this is a real gem of a post apocalyptic survival game. It can be truly unforgiving, but that to me was one of the things that drew me into the world of NEO Scavenger. The survival aspect is a lot more engaging to me than most other survival type games I've played, and you quickly learn to pick your battles very carefully. Just like in reality, a single wound can end up killing you if you're careless and don't have access to modern medicine, and nature itself can be equally lethal. This is something I've found to be missing from most other survival games. The story is fairly interesting as well, but some of the choice based encounters are a bit harsh. And losing a character that survived for a long time in one of those is rarely fun. Still, the game kept drawing me back in until I had beaten it, and I'm looking forward to what the developer has in store for us next.If you want a challenge, love the roguelike aspect of dead is dead in a post apocalyptic setting and can look past the graphics then you can't really go wrong with this game.

												Probably one of the best if not best survival games I've ever played.I played the demo for a few months on Blue Bottle Games site and I fell in love with it, I spent hours playing, crafting, getting as far as I could then starting all over again. Finally I begged my Mom for 10$ and purchased the full game. I play on my Macbook Pro and I am not dissapointed with the full version at all.PROS:- Randomly generated map with each new game (different potential situations and outcomes)- Charming and beautiful graphics and sountrack- Indepth and intruging storyline, very well written and executed- Skills, crafting and survival elements are realistic and very satisfying for survival fans- Easy interface/controls- Hours of gameplay with hundreds of random encounters from enemies and items to findCONS:- Can't save a long running game and later continue it which sucks because I would really like to progress further in the story instead of dying repeatedly and needing to start overOVERALL: 7/10			"

								This game exceeds all the survival post-apocalyptic games I have ever played. It truly gives a new meaning to survival where finding a can of soup is life and death. That person you just killed even though he didn't have any form of defending himself has clothing and shoes for you to survive longer in the cold nights. It is always different every time I play especially with the permadeath feature installed, that is what I like the most about it. You don't just have the ability to reload and play it differently. When you die, that is really it and you'll just have to play it again and that is the fun part because nothing is ever the same!			"

								As a post apocylipic survival game, Neo Scavenger serves as a (probably) pleasent diversion from the typical zombie survival genre. In this game you are faced not only enemies from both the earth and beyond, but also with realistic factors to your person that may prove your undoing if neglected, and you are also faced with perma death.Combat in this game makes up with it's lack of action with it's in depth desicion system that controls how you approach situations, which also comes to play in miscelanious events that fall outside of regular gameplay. These 'events' will grant you with better outcomes if you select the right perks for your character at the beginning the game. Select the wrong ones during character creation, however, then you might as well let the dogmen (not to be confused with werewolves) eat you where you stand.The cruel realism of the game forces you to think, making this game fun to play and giving it it's strategic element. And now that modding is becoming available, I personally cannot wait for all the crazy - or scary - ideas the comunity can grant for this game!			"

								You either live long enough to see the source of the lights to the South-East, or you die from hunger, dehydration, hypothermia, or by a single attack from another human you couldn't sneak away from in the first few days.While you have a choice of skills at the start, the majority of the game is strongly effected by luck.  Luck of loot found, luck of places to camp in, luck during encouters; a single fluke can kill you.  With permadeath a constant fear, one must be wise about every action taken.It's a good turn-based survival, almost table-top-like game.  Your real entertainment will be seeing how long you can survive in this post-apocalypse world.  You have to use your imagination for most of it, but to those who enjoy roguelikes or table-top strategy games will find this a good buy.There's a demo; if you're even the slightest bit curious, TRY IT.  (there are things omitted from the demo, but it'll give you a very good idea of how to play the game)			"

 Survival done right NEO Scavenger is another survival game set in a post-apocalyptic scenario where your mission is to, you guessed it, survive. Lately I've noticed that many games of this genre are, for the most part, shallow and very boring. Whether it's the oversaturation or my lack of interest, but I just haven't been able to find a good realistic survival game to spark my interest. But then comes Blue Bottle Games and gives us this fantastic, well-thought-out RPG that I just can't stop playing.The gameplay is probably my favorite part about it, because it involves turn-based strategy, the best kind of strategy that fits these types of games so well. You will cautiously think about every next move you make. The style is similar to games such as Wasteland or S.T.A.L.K.E.R. but the difficulty resembles that of a Dark Souls game.I think it speaks volumes when an indie game does a much better job at creating a world so dark and brutal that will make you dread every moment you explore it than most AAA titles with their overblown visuals and lack of originality. Just to make it clear, this one of the best survival simulations that you can experience, this game does not favor sloppiness, you will die until you learn how to survive the wasteland.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 10 shoes/10  "

												I am OBSESSED with this game right now. I definitely recommend it. The graphics aren't great, but I think the game makes up for it in content. I found it to be pretty tricky to survive on my first few play throughs. You'll probably die a lot. There's quite a bit of luck involved as well as strategy. You have to scavenge to find all your items, and it can be frustrating if you don't find shoes/clothes anywhere. I think the trickiest thing is finding a matching pair of shoes. There is a lot of storyline involved as well if you enjoy reading. Random events will pop up as you're wandering around. There seems to also be a main plot of figuring out who you are and who released you from the cryo chamber. All in all, it's a great game once you get the hang of not dying. lol			"

There are interesting places to go, mysteries to unravel, and things to fight. Gameplay is turn based and overall is solid, combat requires some strategy and you never know what you will find exploring and scavenging.

												Neo Scavenger is a fantastic indie turn-based, survival, strategy, roguelike game played on a hex map. The game is very punishing and largely based apon RNG but also requires a lot of pre-planning strategy and skill to complete. Every playthrough randomizes many locations in the game and enemy spawns, allowing the game to be very replay-able. The learning curve may be steep at first but once you have the basic mechanics down it's just a matter of playing it safe, but the game can be very deep with a great skill system opening up many different ways of surviving the post apocolyptic wasteland. Pro's : + Fantastic survival mechanics ranging from your usual hunger/thirst to illness , fatigue and comfort.+ Challenging turn based battle system based around your skills and condition. + A large variaty of items.+ Randomised loot, enemy and location spawns on every playthrough making it very fresh.+ A good story with lots of hidden treasures and ways to complete.+ Great stealth mechanics.+ A hidden reputation system.Cons :- The RNG can be absolutely infuriating sometimes, but that's the way of the roguelike.- There are very limited animations, the game is mostly text based.- At first the game is not very user friendly and the UI may be difficult to navigate. ( particularly campsites )- Extremely difficult to complete on your first few runs, requiring you to playthrough once or twice to learn which options to avoid.- Limited options for character creation.- Very limited building options for shelter / bases.All-in i would deffinitely recommend this game if you are into hardcore roguelikes, there is a lot of depth beneath the surface and the randomization and character skill system brings a variety of ways to play the game. If however, you are looking for an easy survival game to build up your own haven and sit back surviving the nights i would stay clear as NEO Scavenger can be very punishing at the worst of times.

												Despite some of the more fantastic elements of the game, such as the inclusion of monsters from urban legend, such as the Michigan dog man and the Enfield horror, this is one of the more realistic survival experiences I've seen.  most of the time, the reasons why I died had more to do with the enviroment, freezing to death especially, but also poisoning, disease, nd starvation.  aas for the combat, it also has a more realistic feel, with some fights dragging on for several minutes as you get chased through the woods, while even weaker weapons can easily cause enemies to bleed out with good strikes.  sometimes i wish certain enemy types would be more adaptive, with most raiders attacking on sight and most people running away as soon as you spot them once you get good equipment, it still a really good game.

Do you use your medical prowess to unfreeze another cryo sleeper and use him as a live bait?If you are like me you'll choose secret option 4: Beat the living daylights out of it, video record the beating and then procede to skin him and run around Post-Apocalyptic Michigan wearing his flayed hide for as long as you can.""As long as you can"" = Death by cholera.

												NEO Scavenger is an incredibly in-depth survival game with a real throwback feel. It *LOOKS* rough on the edges but is actually incredibly well made. * TL;DR*Well made game about making tough decisions to survive a wasteland in a rogue-like setting. Almost a Darksouls/Fallout child with survival and exploration focus. Prepare to die, pretty often, and have fun.* *The game is all about making those tough decisions. From the get go what traits you feel you'll need or use best, and what hindrances you're willing to cope with to take on all of those useful traits/skills. Fairly regular scenarios in which you make decisions based on the items you have, the skills you've acquired, and your environment, whether it be setting up camp in a crumbling building or out in the woods, to drink water of questionable origins, eating berries that may or may not be poisonous (a choice you can ignore with the botany skill), knowing eating said berries could stave your growing hunger a little longer, but also that it may end your game with you sweating and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your life away... unless you find the right medicines. Was that the red pill or the blue pill (should've taken the medic skill)? This game pulls no punches. It's hard, it's frustrating, and it can feel like your progressing very slowly... and you will. But you'll learn. You'll find what works for you. If that's a spear-wielding bandit, preying on others, chopping off their legs for a nice roast, go do it! If you want to hide in the forest, hunting game, living off berries and scattering sound and animal traps amidst your domain, go haunt those woods why don't you? The game's replay value is high. (Mostly) randomly generated, with no real reason to follow the story except personal interests. If you want to make a life for yourself in the wastes, there's nothing (but everything) to stop you. It cannot be recommended enough, and for the price, it's a steal!			"

												This is a solid turn-based post-apocalyptic survival rogue-like (that's a lot of hyphens). I found it to be addicting and sunk a lot of hours into it when I had things that needed to get done, that's the way it goes with these types of games. Pick your starting characteristics and then wake up in a lab with something fearsome at your heals. Every action could lead to your death. It takes you a while to figure out how not to die from hunger, thirst, and exposure. Next comes figuring out whether you can handle combat and to what degree. After that you worry about what happened to you and the world, and where you need to go. All this is done while crafting or looting nearly all your equipment and dealing with the survivors of this world.You should try this game out, it's an experience you need to have.			"

												Neo Scavenger is, in my opinion, one of the greatest survival games ever put to market.I strongly advise you to play the demo before you decide if you want to purchase this, as how you feel about the inventory system will likely make or break the game for you.It's brutal, at times tense, at times it may feel unfair, but there's genuinely no other game like it out there, especially in the survival subgenre.The combat is rough, dirty and unforgiving. Get shot? I hope to god you know how to treat that because you're not walking away until you've got that under control.  The environment is dirty, broken down and makes finding food so difficult you're likely to consider cannibalism a few times.If the price seems a bit high, play the demo a few times and see how you like it. I've already sunk 30+ hours into the game and I still haven't beaten it.			"

								I got this game AGES ago when it was MUCH less complete than it is now, and even then it was great. Since then, the game has grown by leaps and bounds, and with every new build it gets better. A post apocalyptic setting that isnt just an irradiated desert makes for an interesting environment with a lot more options. The crafting system has so much depth its rediculous. Countless items, weapons, ingredients, great resource management elements, weather systems, and a story that will slowly but surely draw you in. Permadeath is a bummer, but you can always reload a previous save. However, chosing to start again with new traits and skills is just as rewarding, with a new experience with each new game. Even the opening moments of the game will change depending on your chosen traits. I can not reccomend this game highly enough.			"

								To the developers I love this game I have about 15+ hours of offline play as well as my online time and it is just great I love the permadeath, random encounters and traits features. But I would like to see more traits a new start instead of just starting in the room with the dogman all the time it just gets annoying. There should also be an in game guide for beginners to get them started instead of just forcing them to learn basic features. The good thing about this game is that it makes you think ahead like should I or should I attack this enemy to get his gear Considering his weapon do I have enough medical items if I do get injured. Another one of the cool things is how suddenly a battle can change one minute you can be shooting the S**t out of the guy then the next minute he caves your head in with his crowbar.  Considering your opponent is a big thing for example I was trying to kill a melon head then he starts calling for others so I started to fight them but then my guy got tired so I had to retreat. When I got out of the combat screen I saw that all 4 hexes in front of me were filled with melon heads which would have made me pass out if I kept fighting and could have killed me.  The things that aren’t that good about this game are not very major just things like the lack of types of enemies, traits, the same starting room all the time, no beginners tutorial, some overpowered enemies, how you can only put one weapon with a strap over your shoulder, sometimes there is a lack of enemies around and there could be more items like more bags, guns, melee weapons and clothing.But overall this is one of my favorite games that I own and not just on steam out of all my games. My recommendation is to buy this game it is easily worth the $10 but I suggest that people try the demo first. Note: many features of the game are not in the demo. 10/10 for me keep up the good work developers.			"

								This game is really quite brilliant.Just remember that in order to survive you NEED to learn how to use the crafting system....Also botany and trapping are essential survival skills.remember: trapping skill + handful of twigs&bark + 2 sticks = small fireBotany skill + handful of twigs&bark + water + pot + fire = tannin tea (an immune system booster)			"

								This game is incredible. The art style and movement system is Civ 3 esque, and it feels great. The events are entirely random (save for the intro), and will ALWAYS keep you on your toes. It forces you to adapt incredibly fast to situations you never saw coming, and leverage your abilities to the max. Decions can affect you miles down the road, which really causes you to think. The game has a steep learning curve, but stick with it, and you'll find endless hours of fun.			"

								Entertaining survival game. Game has a good deal of depth as far as available skills, items equipment and encounters. Need to watch body heat, hunger, thirst, tiredness and overall health as you find your way across Michigan. Figuring out how to survive at first is difficult. Once you get a character through the early part of the game things become easier, but enemy encounters can still be dangerous. Game could use a little bit more work with the crafting and main storyline, but I would still recommend it.			"

								So far, so good!  Rogue-like gameplay in a different setting.  Definitely getting a ""Fallout"" vibe and that is a good thing!  A perfect game to go in ""blind"" without looking at any strategies or walkthroughs for at least the first few playthroughs.  Difficult, but not too punishing, especially when you start learning the basics.  Looking forward to seeing what happens next!			"

Early Access Review
								Have you ever wanted to be all alone in dangerous world fighting for survival, being able to do things normally impossible or morally incorect? If this is your dream you should play Neo Scavenger. The gameplay is not finished yet, but it is already one of the most correctly done survival. Of course there are flaws, like is predictable but fun is that you may now that you should be able to kill dogmen with a semi-auto shotgun from long distance and having a range skill, but game like to suprise in that case a little. Another things like illnesses, weak from hunger or thirst, not enough sleep, beign able to froze to death or (what is actually my most favorite) died from diaharea, are funny and reasonable. In shortcut i would definietely recommend this game to anyone who is not scared pixel graphic and want to have fun.			"

												NEO Scavaneger is a turn-based hardcore Survival game. The goal is to survive as long as you can in the harsh environment of post-apocolyptic Michigan. The game is quite brutal, and you will find yourself dying a lot. But the interface is easy enough to manage. You WILL feel pretty powerful once you're fully kitted out with the goodies you find scavenging around the map.The color scheme is defintely on the dark side though. There are way too many games that use desturated dark tones in them lately. And sometimes, the RNG can take you down pretty quick even if you have all the nice things in your posession.All in all, it has it's flaws, but it's still worth a good play.			"

												I have got this game in a bundle and I never thought that I would ever play it. However, it became my top 3 most played games on Steam :)This gem is a really great survival game. The world is truly crude and unforgivable. Each decision may cost you everything and there is no place for making mistakes. You will probably start all over dozens of times, but it will not be frustrating. The luck and randomness matters a lot, there is a chance you will loot cool stuff at the very first house you scavenge but the next attempt will make you struggle for hours in searching for good medicines, weapons or food, while constantly dealing with diseases and random encounters.

												9/10 It is honestly a great ♥♥♥♥ing game (if you know what you are doing) but sadly there is no tutorial and sometimes it gets boring but you can download player made mods from the game dev`s website for even more hours of fun(I like NEOScav Extended). This game is very unforgiving and the first time you play this, don't expect to live long. The joy you get from this game isnt the first time you find a weapon, or clothes, or a gun. It is when you manage to survive everything this unforgiving game throws at you. Also, a message to everyone who hasn't bought the game yet, when you buy it, try experimenting with skills. It gets interesting.			"

												Plays like a mix of fallout, FTL type surivival games, 4x4 strategy, and an interactive novel. The guy who made it worked for Bioware, so the writing is high quality and this makes all the difference when the most dramatic scenes of the game are described entirely through text. My main complaint would be the gui, which I understand is supposed to be a throwback but ends up making very odd use of space, some buttons are just way too small or in weird places. NEO Scavenger has some rough edges but it's hard to tell what's intentionally rough and what decisions are simply quirks of the developer. Regardless, it's very hardcore and rewarding so far.			"

												If you like the Classic Fallout series, Wasteland, and The Atmosphere of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. You will likely spend an entire weekend into this game. The learning curve is reasonable ( You die frozen/ starved the first few times around) and you will quickly find out how useful some skills are compared to others. Now speaking in terms of story, there is a lot to find out: If you have the chance to talk with people, take advantage of it. It's been a long time since I've been this fascinated with a game like this one.			"

												I have a love hate for this game. As i've read in other reviews, and I agree, this game is pretty realistic when it comes to strategy and survival. It is a very challenging game. Sometimes you get lucky right off the bat...and other times its like you struggle thee entire way. You will never experience more irritation than when you get a good distance into the game and die from a dumb infection, or a monster/human comes and rapes your face. Once your dead there are no checkpoints or restarts. Nope... you start alllll over. But the games keeps you curious so while you may be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you'll try again. Its different with every start and like I said... a good amount of challenge. If you are curious about this game, I would try it. Its a lot more fun than you'd think!			"

												Bought this game thinking this was a simple turn based rouge like to waste time to, ended up discovering way more. Once you can get past the learning curve (even so this game will find ways to ♥♥♥♥ you, you will die A LOT), there's a lot of really interesting things that occur plot-wise. With all the traits you can choose from, there are always different ways to handle or solve things during events or otherwise. Trust me when I say that spending a lot of time with this game will be very rewarding; there are a LOT of possibilities with this game.Definitely not a game for the impatient, I wouldn't recommend this to you if you're the type of person what will give up after carefully spending many hours building up your gear and supplies, then suddenly get killed by a seemingly random or unavoidable force. To me, that only adds more to the post-apocalyptic feel. Nobody how hard you struggle, there's never a guarantee that you're actually going to survive; you're never fully in control of the situation and there's always something much bigger than you out there. Sometimes it just takes sheer luck.			"

												Alright, so you wake up in some abandoned medical research facility, some sort of creature is pounding at the door ahead of you, using your affinity for mechanics, you lock the door and prevent it from getting in. Going outside, you notice its cold, so you scavenge a near by town for clothes, but its too late, you freeze to death.So one more try. Again, you wake up an abandoned medical facility with a monster pounding at your door. This time, you chose to excell in strength, so you decide to fight this thing head on. You take a few scratches, but otherwise you beat. Using your trapping abilities, you managed to make a cloak out of its fur, keeping you warm for the forseeable future. Right on! so you start scavenging, you come across some food, a butchers knife, so shoes. You are doing pretty good! Buuuuut remember those scratches from before? You never treated them and they got infected, so you die. Again. Third times a charm, no? So you start again. You kill the monster, you make a cloak, this time you manage to find some clean rags to cover your wounds and carry on. You scavenge, find a nice ole' shotgun to keep you safe, but you come across a stranger, you don't know much about this person so you ease your way up, you threaten them and they try to run so you blow them away. They start crawling, and you decide to finish them off and loot whats left of the innocent guys corpse. You get a little tired, so you rest in the woods when something wakes you up in the middle of the night. Its a feral dog, and oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ youre out of ammo. You decide to stick to beating the thing with the but of your gun, but its no luck. One too many bites means its game over.Incase you can't tell, you will die a lot in neoscavenger. Like...a lot a lot. The game makes no attempt to hold your hand, and that will inevitably turn some people off, while others will find this a refreshing change of pace. Neo is a tough game for sure, and the survival aspects are fantastic. Of course you have to eat, sleep, drink etc etc but you also have to make sure you don't freeze to death, make sure your wounds are tended to and don't get infected, make sure you have shoes so you don't get blisters on your feet, try and make some interesting moral choices along the way (Do you help the mother and her child escape from the cannibals? How about watching people fight to death in an arena for scraps of food?) All in all, I think Neo Scavenger is one of the gems of 2014. I didn't even know about it until searching through steams library. I think if you're a fan of the survival genre and want something that's tactical with a lot of options and a nice change of pace in terms of story other than your typical ""Oh my god! Zombies!"" schtick, I recommend you check it out.			"

												Get stabbed by a shard of glass? No problem, clean wound, bandage myself with rags and pray to not get an infected wound.Get kicked in the ribs by a very angry looter trying to get your sleeping bag?Not a problem, grab that guy leg, bring him down and bash his head in with a rock or whatever you find in the ground at the moment.Get your head bashed in by a rifle butt cause the guy who was using it didnt had any bullets left?Maybe a problem, but nothing that a expensive and very rare medikit cant fix after a couple painful and long hours later.Drink lake water without boiling?Get ready to die by explosive diarrhea while you keep trying to be hydrated by drinking more lake water and making your explosive diarrha an nuclear diarrhea and have all your hydration go away.I love this ♥♥♥♥ing game, 10/10			"

								With a creative and brutal environment, realistically harsh combat, and an intriguing story it will take you several lives to unravel, NEO Scavenger will keep you engaged for hours on end. Bad luck will claim your life plenty of times, but it's because of that adversity that the moments of triumph truly shine. It's an insanely good game that makes you earn every bit of progression. I can't recommend it enough!			"

								NEO Scavenger is an excellent example of survival RPG, bringing to mind other isometric games like UnReal World and Haven and Hearth.  This game masters the eerie, abandoned quality present in Fallout, and is as challenging to navigate.  You will realize the painful cost of each difficult decision.That said, the game features nothing by way of world building.  You can craft your own ramshackle gear from the broken remnants of the pre-war world and the often hazardous wilderness, but you cannot cultivate, construct defenses, or harvest natural resources apart from sticks, branches, water, and a few edibles.  Everything in the game is slowly decaying, and ultimately, so are you.  If you want a sense that your character has a future other than ending up the corpse someone else scavenges, this is not the game for you.I can honestly say I feel I've had my money's worth, but I don't think I'll finish the main story line.  This game may well leave you feeling like a murderous hobo, starving, infected, insane, who would gleefully pop out of nowhere and bludgeon some random stranger to death with a tree branch for a shoddy left boot and a plastic shopping bag.  But some people who enjoy the survival genre are looking for just that.Happy hunting, you psychopath.			"

								Neo scavenger is a hexbased ,turn based/ text based game. there as many different skills that will help you when trying to survive in the harsh lands. the combat is indepth with the text based  slection combat. you dont see yourself attacking but its decribed to you indetail makeing your imagination take over and letting you have a unique expreance every fight. The game has a story to it if you wanna fallow that , or you coul just go do your own thing and cause havoc. eating and drinking is a must as well as sleep , but becarefull not to eat anything deadly  that may be poision. and make sure you have a place to sleep at night as you are exposed to attacks and can be robbed. the crafting system is nice, there are many different thing to do and combind togeather to make survival easiser. Anyways i shall stop ranting on how Fun this game is.. if you like turn based combat and dont mind text based games like the first fallout, Then this game is for you			"

								A difficult but satisfying RPG with sprites that have clearly had some work put into them. during one playthrough I found myself resorting to cannibalism to survive. I found a bandit asleep near my camp and needless to say, he never woke up. after a few days of sneaking around, gutting bandits, and avoiding dangerous wildlife, they stopped coming near my camp. this fact forced me to go further afield to find them and it was on one such outing that I encountered a whole pack of something quiet a bit more dangerous than myself. good game.

								Wow. Just wow. This game is hard, unforgiving, and near impossible. I love it. My last playthrough, I had taken a guides advice with slight modification of my own and I was a super power nothing could kill me, except for nature herself. I had taken down four dogman, six strangers, Ftons of melonheads, and an enfiend horror all within six hexex of each other and only minors cuts and bruises as my reward, oh and a few dozen bullets, a couple guns, water bottles, and furs out the wazzo. This was only half way through. I wasn't playing the story, I wanted to gear up, I was challenging myself out in the wilderness and it was fun! Just doing what I wanted, fighting when I had to, chatting when I didn't, and just surviving. This can be a casual game or a hardcore game it depends on how you want to play, do you want to follow the story or simply explore the whole map. But in my opinion fun is all this game is going to be. Don't mistake it though. Remeber the badass you just read up there I overestimated myself and attacked when I should have dodged with hunger and thirst nearly claiming me along the way. Thus ending my adventure but also beginning a new and, hopefully, better one.			"

								A surprising nuanced hex game that is heavy on survival and crafting. The game is being made primarily by one man, Dan Fedor, who is a former BioWare developer. The game is easy to learn but hard to master which gives it a certain level of replayability, especially since it is still in development. That being said, Fedor does a great job of communicating with the community, including writing out DAILY UPDATES on his website. The level of polish that the game has, even for simple things like GUI and aspect ratios is kind of amazing considering its being developed by just one guy.			"

								I cannot express my love for this game enough.I've always been a fan of minimal graphics games which can deliver such a compelling, engaging story and survival based-gameplay. Every step through the Hex world brings with it the chance to stumble on the thing you most need to survive. Or turn out to be something which leaves your bloodied, broken, bacteria-ridden body crawling back to one of the last bastions of human civilisation.When my character was dying of thirst and racing back towards the city gates, the howls of dogmen in the background, I felt every slick of the mouse which was one step closer to salvation. A rush without the need for a next-gen PC :PThe inventory management takes me back and time can be spent organising your goodies and packing the essentials close to hand.The developer is fantastic, responds to the players and is constantly evolving the game to new levels of awesomeness!Do it. Do it now. Brave the wastelands!Sidenote; multiplayer would be an awesome addition, no matter how slow it might go.			"

								ANOTHER terrific retro game! If you think ""Under-Rail"" is intriguing (another steam title) this is another gem in that vein. A perfect blend of RPG and Rogue-like, you are thrust into the post-apocalyptic world with no idea of what has happened and the whole open world to find out what the hell is going on. Brilliant turn-based fare, and really easy to get hooked on. This game reminded me of the day when games had to offer greatness in other ways, because it was before a time graphics could sell your product. Instead, it enthralls, intrigues, challenges, and keeps you drawn with it's personality. Recommended. I am so thankful games like this are still coming out!! <3			"

												I've played this game for fifteen hours now, not very far into it. I can make a few assertions about the game quality however. First allow me to state this fits into my desired game ""style"" very well. Turn-Based and Survival and two of my favorite types of games - this has both. Perma-death is also another great feature of the game. Namely, the sense if you die you have to start over is a great motivator to be extra careful while scavenging.The combat mechanics take a bit of getting used to, but once you have them down it's fairly easy to ""manipulate"" the encounter to be in your favor. Naturally you don't want to attack everything you see, sometimes it's wiser to stay hidden and let the group of guys with guns walk past you.The crafting system is great, it's very well thought out. I love having the ability to make a tarp shelter and after I'm done sleeping breaking it down and collecting my tarp and string to be able to move along with a smaller load.Scavenging for supplies is well done, the mechanic is both rewarding and frustrating at the same time - mainly when you're looking for something specific and keep getting trash.On my last play through I was horrifically murdered by the shop keeper. All I did was try to sell him cured human flesh, is that really so wrong?			"

												Highly recomended, this game lets you do a lot that, at surface level it does not apper that it would be deep enough to allow.Example: I had just reached a little shack in the woods, I was a little low on provisions, so I desided to camp there for a little while so i could try to find water and food. While I was there two looters with guns came by and tryed to steal my stuff. I, naturaly, tryed to stop them. After all that was all my stuff. They shot me a couple of times, and while a was sitting on the floor looseing blood they made off with my backpack full of stuff and most of my medical equipment. I dressed my wounds as best I could, and went to get some water and something to eat. I was banged up, but I would live. Then as i was headed back to my shack, I eat some poisonous berries and died.If you think that sounds frustrating, it was, but that is not the games fault, it was mine. You learn from your mistakes and you get better, could not recomend this game any more than I am right now, buy it.			"

												NEO SCAVENGER is a game driven by the stories you write. In one run you could be a survivor who runs around collecting berries and putting them into a bag of chips and in the other run you could be a medic who finds a sniping rifle which he uses to kill other survivors to claim their stuff. There are endless possibilities. Another great aspect is that everything is textbased and menu based, You are telling your own individual all in your head. If NEO SCAVENGER would've been a more visual dependent game then it wouldn't have been that great! It's just you and nature fighting against each other and it's beautiful. NEO SCAVENGER is the best and most realistic survival  game out there. Definitely give this one a try!			"

The combat system is pretty interesting (altough I wish they'd impliment a different stamina system, so you wouldn't feel like taking a nap right after caving a mutants skull in). The story I described earlier is completley unscripted and just happened all on its own, as are pretty much all of the stories in the review, they might not happen to you personally but you'll probably have your own unique story of that one awesome/hilarious death. I definitley recommend the game to anyone who wants a challenging survival experience.			"

You can never be fully prepared. Even if you make it to the end of the game, a randome guy can still sneak up on you and wail you with a rock... and then the screen just cuts black and the games over. No single playthrough will be identical to the last. Personal note: This is just about as real as it gets when it comes to survival games.			"

												I was fighting a stranger, i was only about 1h (realtime) into the playthrough, was doing really well with a few ranged weapons and other♥♥♥♥♥♥.. So yeah, was fighting him, he was bleeding, had trouble concentrating, and guess what. I must've hit him like 20 times, with my pistol, and then he hit me ONCE, with his FIST into my leg. I passed out. From, quote, unbearable pain. He beat me up and killed me.10/10 would RNG again.			"

												EDIT:I will change my review, because only stupid people never change their mind :)I still think the game is slightly overpriced, the content a bit limited and the graphics pretty bad.But, after installing a mod, it became quite clear that this game does things I never saw elsewhere. It is incredibly detailed, and realistic. In the end, I had fun playing it and it would be wrong not to suggest it.			"

												A great game. Reminds me most of a single player dnd sim. It has an amazing atmosphere and complex gameplay for those who want a difficult survival sim. There are flaws but the overal expieriance more than makes up for it and the story is incredably deep. If you can get past the learning curve then this game I can recomend. Just be aware, instant death is comon for those that don't prepare or take unecessary risk.			"

Rip up that shirt for a rag to fix a point to a stick and make a proper spear, kill three people and take their food, good. Die of exposure when it starts to rain despite your triumph.

												I was honestly extremely skeptical about this game for its appearance and price tag. However, that skepticism turned out to be about as valid as trying to say that FTL isn't a good game because its graphics are primitive—the actual gameplay is masterful. I have been at this non-stop for maybe ten hours, and there's still obvious signs of endless story left. If you are the kind of person who plays Fallout New Vegas on Hardcore, has ever played a game of Rifts in your life, ever went on an Outward Bound and found it a little too tame, or just appreciates an all-consuming survival horror game; then this is for you. If it's on sale, it's definitely for you; but I've paid more for games I've liked a lot less!			"

												All-righty, nothing like waking up from a nice long cryo slumber with nothing but a hospital gown, a wrist-Band, and a 1970's medallion to your name. Then immediately being assailed by a cross between Cujo and Hulk Hogan, which causes you to flee for your life into the wastelands  of Detroit...(Which oddly enough is a lot like present day Detroit). It is all good for a while drink a little scavenged H2O and some berries ( I suggest the Botany Skill ). Ahh yes you can feel the rumble in your tunny as the unfiltered and tainted water begins to take it's toll. Soon you are crapping blood and running for your life to find the nearest tree so you can prolapse your♥♥♥♥♥♥, congratulations in the not so distant future amoebic dysentery is alive and well . After crapping yourself into the who's who book of The Screaming Squats, you realize you are now suffering from hypothermia...but it is ok you can pretty much scavenge , salvage, and construct most anything. That is of course if the Melon-Heads, and Bad Mutha do not find you and make you ""Squeell Like a Big Boy! CAUSE YOU SURE DO GOTS A PERTTY MOUTH!"". MAYBE YOU LOOSE IT AND AXE MURDER THE WHOLE LOT OF THEM WHILE THEY SLEEP...!Just do not eat them, eating human meat is for Punks...dont be a Punk, harvest a berry or eat a shroom....then start beating feat again...Just understand you are gona die...maybe you'll freeze or starve, or crap yourself to death, get eaten, electrocuted....who knows,but it will happen....But it is OK, because this is one fun as hell game...It will not try to dazzle you with BS, no super flashy graphics to hide the fact that it sux more than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ named Eureka..No, see because if you took this game from Samuel L Jackson and dropped it in a bag of other games, and then same told you to give him his Sh*% back and you asked which one was his...Sam would tell you...It is the game that has Bad Mutha f%$#$% written on it. Listen if you have 15 or so bucks do yourself a favor and buy this game, buy it play it and then watch your character die horribly and love enjoy it.			"

												So I've played this a bit before release so you know... Playtime not entirely accurate.I don't really have much to say or add but here goes:It's a minimalist, roguelike, RPG that manages to be intruiging without any visual elements. Obviously there are visuals and not just text, but they serve more to simplify the UI. The UI is pretty great honestly and it's something a lot of these hardcore roguelikes just don't give a crap about, so it's a breath of fresh air to say the least.I love the addition of the ambient soundeffects and the music. It livens up the experience quite a bit and makes it easier to immerse yourself.To sum things up: it's immersive like a great text adventure. Lots of descriptive text and important decisions with the addition of much needed visuals and soundeffects.It's just really solid and I recommend it if you like great text adventures and hardcore roguelikes. Just don't expect a flashy presentation.			"

												Decptively simple, extremely nuanced, thoroughly frustrating.  It's one of those games that is easy to hit the wall right from the beginning and feel like you're not progressing.  If you keep trying and ram through, it's a very deep survival game.  Even the most mundane things cannot be taken for granted. A small cut can turn into a life threatening infection to not having shoes to walk across the map.  It is a very brutal and unforgiving game, but rewards you greatly when you manage to survive long enough to reach a town or even establish a base.			"

								The best $10 I've spent in a while. Not just another post apocalyptic ""RPG"" to clutter the store, but an interesting setting, challenging gameplay, and harsh realism. If you aren't freezing to death in your hospital gown, you have monsters and thugs breathing down your neck. Even if you manage to survive a while and get some good equipment you may succumb to infection or just get killed by a lucky shot from the business end of a monkey wrench. It's a nice change of pace from 1st/3rd person shooter games with it's turn based system. And just a tip to keep you alive, make a spear.			"

								ok this game was a great idea and a love at first sight game, its one of my favorites. and with the new update its gotten even better. its also MUCH MUCH MUCH harder with the update and is a good gaming expirence. i strongly recomend this game for these reasons.1. its orignal: you may think""this is a bad game because its turned based and its doesn't have good graphics, and it looks boring because it has hexagons as moving squares"" to those of you like that i say ♥♥♥♥ you. steam is a haven for good indie games so if your like that you shouldn't be here. the idea for scavenging for weapons and food is a good base for a storyline. but haveing turn based actions and the hard needing to survive is very orginal and neat. when you think about it its kinda funny how destriot the place your in (in know i spelled it wrong) is all ♥♥♥♥ed up.2. MAGIC VODO OF FUNNESS: sometimes when there is something that is amazingly good i say it has magic vodo, which this game has. its addicting to play( but not to watch) and very hard since the update. its very fun with a muiltitude of things you can do and............... i cant explain it but it is very fun and its not expensive if you dont like it.

												Since the recent updates, I have noticied that it is much harder to get started.  Scavanging even with the strong perk in the beggining yeilded nothing usefui on my last 3 play throughs.  I Build my char. to be meelle, but a frog preist mureders me with a stick and i have a broad spear.  Last time I played prior to the updates, I was able to get around and make it to detroit megacity, not easily mind you.  At the current update I would have to say im will not be playing it until scavanging leads to finding a lighter, or maybe ANYTHING useful.  Paper is great for making arrows, but pebbles and glass shards are way to common of a find, I don't know, just occasionally hook a player up man! Its fustrating when your strong, tough, melle, trapping, and tracking, but when you try to attack a feeble shooless enemey, they Crush your face....			"

												If you love looting hardcore games, you will love Neo Scavenger! It makes you think of, how you want handle the situation you are in, silly mistakes could end you quite instantly and it is really unforgiving. This is a rogue like game, so it's hardcore mode, and you will lost your long hours of gameplay if you are not careful. This game really grows on me. Im loving it. i love the hardcore, slow pace, thinking decisions, the looting and crafting are all fantastic! <3			"

I do admit though, after getting amazing gear and weaponry and dying, there is a great temptation to open CheatEngine. Overall, a simple and fun game that allows you to chose to take the path of a good man or a filthy outlaw.			"

However, those pebles actually end up being usefull. Just not as much as the gun. Combat is a very good turn/distance/cover based, the terrain plays into effect, you actually have to find your enemy first, etc. etc. Tons of crafting recipies, a lot of which make sense, for example, a lighter and a stick make a torch. Very good game. Worth every penny.			"

												I had a pretty good start to the game going for me, a full set of clothes, good shoes and a spear to protect myself. I decided that the wandering traveller that I spotted would be easy prey; little did I know that he would knock me out, leave me bleeding to death, coughing blood and bruised all over. All that remained of my gear was a left shoe and the crowbar that he beat me down with; he made one fatal mistake though, he didn't finish me off. I spent 3 days recovering enough so that I could track him down and get what gear he had stolen from me. In the survivors defence I did go out of my way to try and kill him for his gear but I would have atleast finished him off so he wouldn't have to worry about freezing or bleeding to death. In the end I found him, killed him while he slept with his own wepon that he left for me, clothed myself in what he had taken from me and then I died a few hours later from another scavenger with a shotgun blow to the chest.10/10 - Would go through hell and back just to get revenge			"

												Good lord is this game hard.Trust me when I say this, this game holds no punches. Think pixelated turn-based STALKER. It's one of the best games I've played in a while. Turn-based combat is normally a huge hurdle for me, but this game does it really well. You WILL end up being so hungry you will resort to cannibalism (No, really, this game has cannibalism). All the combat is text based, but instead of leaving a lot to be desired, it lets you imagine how the event played out. Were you tripped and are desperatly trying to grab at your attacker or are you secretly planning to show weakness right before you lash out with a concealed knife? It's one of the more original titles out there and it's not in early access anymore. But don't take my word for it, try the demo! (Word of warning though, the demo is a lot worse than the full game)ADHD Version: Bash people's face in with a rock so you can steal their pants.			"

												Since the recent updates, I have noticied that it is much harder to get started.  Scavanging even with the strong perk in the beggining yeilded nothing usefui on my last 3 play throughs.  I Build my char. to be meelle, but a frog preist mureders me with a stick and i have a broad spear.  Last time I played prior to the updates, I was able to get around and make it to detroit megacity, not easily mind you.  At the current update I would have to say im will not be playing it until scavanging leads to finding a lighter, or maybe ANYTHING useful.  Paper is great for making arrows, but pebbles and glass shards are way to common of a find, I don't know, just occasionally hook a player up man! Its fustrating when your strong, tough, melle, trapping, and tracking, but when you try to attack a feeble shooless enemey, they Crush your face....			"

								Let's get this out of the way first - This is my first review.NEO Scavenger has a lot of potential. The gameplay so far is amazing, and the combat and scavenging system works really well, making it all the more impressive. I really can't wait to see the finished product, although there are a few things I want to point out.The scavenging system is great and all, but it is REALLY brutal unless you get lucky. Probably 8/10 times I played through the game and I died before I survived 1 day. It is really hard to find any kind of clothing even when there is a high loot chance in the scavenging screen.And when I get to the DMC Gates, as soon as I complete Hatter's request for the Urn, he gives me the pass for the DMC gates, but when I get scanned, it still won't let me in, and as well as that, it breaks after I finished a few turns, even when it's durability is at 100% (even after a few playthroughs this still happened) and I'm not sure if this is a game breaking bug or something is wrong with my NEO Scavenger.Still, even in Beta and it's well worth the £7 I paid for it. I recommend this HEAVILY to any RPG/Post Apocalyptic players who like any of the original Fallout series - 9/10.			"

								I would have enjoyed NEO Scavenger if it didn't ""end"" so abruptly. There is so much more to want. Otherwise, the game is addictive, difficult, and has an dark desolate atmosphere. The first two games of the Fallout series has brought about a morbid curiosity about the surviving in a wasteland for many years. NEO Scanvenger does really well giving a complex some-what realistic survival system. The main things to be concerned about is food, water, shelter, warmth, and health while giving curveballs with dealing with other humans. This game really tests your morality with your drive to survive while requiring you to come up with clever solutions to problems to continue to live. I would recomend this game to anyone with interests in survival and adventure.			"

								One Part Fallout/Wasteland, One Part Text Adventure, One Part Roguelike (or Dark Souls if you're trendy), and One Part Survival/Horror make up this indie game. You wake up in a cryogenic sleep chamber with no clues as to who you are, where you are, or what the hell is going down. All you wake up with is a hospital gown on your back, and a dogmanbeast right down the hall way that looks hungry. The game at first is hard as balls as you learn to survive out in the wilderness. Combat is brutal, with the persistent wounds (bleeding, head trauma, cuts/scrapes/scars) that affect your performance. Survival is even worse as you need to juggle hunger, hydration, and health all at once as you travel the wasteland. But after your few first brutal deaths you will eventually start to catch on and make your way further into the harsh post-apocalytpic scenery. Eventually you'll make your way into an actually populated city where the story begins to develop and the game begins to flex its Text Adventure muscles.NEO Scavenger is EARLY ACCESS as ♥♥♥♥ but shows plenty of potential due to a fairly ugly and not-so-user friendly UI, lack of toturial, and just general lack of polish or explanation for its myriad of features. For hardxcore gamers who aren't afraid of getting their♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s handed to them on a bloody platter a few times, or those who are roguelike veterans, pick this up.			"

												Despite its aged graphics and less than perfect UI this is a real gem of a post apocalyptic survival game. It can be truly unforgiving, but that to me was one of the things that drew me into the world of NEO Scavenger. The survival aspect is a lot more engaging to me than most other survival type games I've played, and you quickly learn to pick your battles very carefully. Just like in reality, a single wound can end up killing you if you're careless and don't have access to modern medicine, and nature itself can be equally lethal. This is something I've found to be missing from most other survival games. The story is fairly interesting as well, but some of the choice based encounters are a bit harsh. And losing a character that survived for a long time in one of those is rarely fun. Still, the game kept drawing me back in until I had beaten it, and I'm looking forward to what the developer has in store for us next.If you want a challenge, love the roguelike aspect of dead is dead in a post apocalyptic setting and can look past the graphics then you can't really go wrong with this game.

												Despite it's low-fi visuals and text-based combat/feedback (leaving much of the action unfortunately to your imagination), NEO Scavenger still gave me plenty of chills with its eerie atmosphere, attention to detail, music, and RNG events. The game forces you to weigh the consequences of any action you do, and be timely about it. There's a lot of replayability since you can choose from a wide arrange of skills and strengths/weaknesses at the start, which will alter your decision-making and options.I have a short play-time since I mostly played the demo, but it's a surprisingly complex game that more survival games should take notes from. The vibe is spot-on; creepy, harsh, and very mysterious.			"

It took a while to understand how everything worked but I felt that difficulty curve of knowing what worked and what didnt, was a necessary part for the games immersion, appeal and replability. This game has alot to it in terms of content and character, with an established world in the background of the gameplay that makes you feel involved with the situation that your character is in. The consistant narration of your character allows you to place yourself in their shoes and relate to them more. The gameplay, ohh the gameplay.

								I really like Neo Scavenger. That's why there will be a long, LONG review on it. To Start, in even a short time of five hours, this game has left a great impression on me, from death to art style to dialogues... It's brilliant to begin with.Gameplay: You wake up in the middle of Michigan in some sort of year, in which humanity is back to the dark ages. Heal yourself, fight, scavenge, explore, talk, DAMN. And more. Every choice is better then Mass Effect's Endings and choices. DAAAAMN. 10/10Story/Quests: Survive in the apocalypse, find out who you are, DUN DUN DUN! Kinda cliche, but I will give the quests and random encounters credit. 7/10Dialogues: Pretty long, and most of the lore is delivered through it, which was somewhat of a let-down. However, the dialogue was good. I'll shame it for it's lack of a Dialogue Tree thus far. 7/10AI: The AI was great. Enemies were either cowards or knew how to fight, and their AI reflected that. With the combat system, it sets up a difficulty of COMPLEXITY, and that's either really good or bad game design. Here, it's done great. 8/10World Design: Semi-Dynamic, beautifully designed, randomly generated. It's luck, but damn good luck. 9/10Graphics: The game is set up in a 32-bit art style (I believe?), and the graphics look promising. Some shots of the world are detailed, even with 32 pixels. This game would have great graphics back in the 32-bit era, and good indie graphics. 8/10Sound: Haha. None. 0/10Music: There is a death track, thus far. Nothing special. 4/10The verdict for NEO Scavenger is an 8.75/10. It delivers well, and it's promising, even for late Early Access. Some small tweaks, and this could easily go over a 9.DayZ Review Gimmick: ""Slept in an office, robbed and left with my plastic bag. 8.75/10, would sleep again.""			"

								I'm really enjoying this game, except for a couple of details.- Picking [Strong] [Melee] [Tough] is overpowered. If anything. ANYTHING comes within melee range and you're carrying a branch, they can kill their♥♥♥♥♥goodbye.Got a rifle? Nevermind the bullets, just use the gun's butt and turn them into a greasy paste.- If you get a disease, that's pretty much the end of the game. I was in an extremely profitable run, but caught dysenteria, then bloated, then the symptoms subsided. It came back not long after, then I reached ""the lights"" and I traded almost everything for a medikit, which couldn't do anything to save my life.- There's an enemy that will call for reinforcements in the middle of a fight. While this is an interesting and welcome mechanic, IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE CALLING MONSTERS FROM NEARBY HEXES. THEY ARE GENERATING MORE OF THEM. I got into a fight with one of them, I was hiding and using a slingshot and by the time I managed to kill the first, 4 more had shown up. By the time I killed the next, 3 more had appeared. I kept picking them off, but more kept being summoned.Had it not been for the lack of ammo, I wonder if they would've kept spawning infinitely?- It's turn based, but sometimes my actions are limited. Sometimes I get 5 actions per turn, sometimes, I just get 1, and I get no explanation as to why.Like any good roguelike, it relies in random chance.It has a very interesting crafting system that uses the skills you picked and an array of ""substitute materials"" in which it specifies what *kind* of item you need to craft.""Waterproof, fireproof container"" may refer to a pan or a glass bottle, ""sharp edge"" may be a piece of glass, a shiv, or a knife...It's a very interesting game, which is a bit frustrating at times. If you get out of a bad fight alive, you're likely to die anyway.Combat is turn-based with options for actions, which will vary depending on what you picked for skills. For example, picking [Tough] will allow you to headbutt an oponent sometimes, and the [Trapping] skill will let you lure an enemy into a makeshift trap.Crafting is relatively easy. Drop the right items and skills into a grid, click the ""craft"" button, presto. You got yourself a new bow.In the end, yes, it's still early access, but it's still fun, complex and interesting. I had a smile on my face when I fought a big, furry monster barehanded, took no damage, and got a ""video recording of you beating the crap out of a wolf-man barehanded"".I like a game with a sense of humor.

								This game is really quite brilliant.Just remember that in order to survive you NEED to learn how to use the crafting system....Also botany and trapping are essential survival skills.remember: trapping skill + handful of twigs&bark + 2 sticks = small fireBotany skill + handful of twigs&bark + water + pot + fire = tannin tea (an immune system booster)			"

								Definetely a great game for what I've seen, a few suggestions would be maybe streamline the experience, make the combat and eating, crafting all a little bit easier to understand, a game shouldn't be confusing in place of difficulty. Other than the roughness of the game, it's fantastic and I look forward to it's developement.			"

								I just wanted to do what I can to try and promote this amazing game. I am absolutely loving it and I think it deserves a little more praise and hype. It's a single player, post-apocalyptic, turn based, permadeath, hex-mapped, rogue-like, rpg. I love these flavour of games and now that I have a tiny baby to look after these days, I thought I might try something more 'pausable' because I may have to suddenly be elbow deep in doodie duty at a moment's notice. Which is something that you just can't reconcile with games of unforgiving immediacy like DayZ.There are some great intro tutorial videos on Youtube that explain the slightly foreign quirks of what is basically a gui format you should be comfortable with.There is a free demo version available on the Steam Store, so you can check it out fearlessly before making up your mind.Should be a big hit with my Tabletop folks.

												A challenging, clunky, and surprisingly deep survival sim.Best: Atmospheric, procedural game world interspersed with story events and areasBrutal but fair survival sim keeps you coming back, learning new tricks each timePerks grant new info about the sim mechanics (eg playing Medical allows you to see your health bars)Modding to allow saves or grant more perks adds greatly to already high replayabilityWorst: Not a lot of explaining done, only partial visibility of what's happening under the hood, mechanically. If you're the kind of optimizing player who needs to know how many units of hunger a gummibear diminishes, you'll be stuck spending some time on a poorly-maintained wiki looking for clues.Awkward UI for a modern gameUnpredictable responses from game engine (ie autosort ground inventory when away from camp) discourages late-game experimentationInefficiency makes for a time-suckMy strong recommendation for NEO hinges on the opinion that the simple mechanics support a compelling emergent narrative. Repeatedly clicking the ""kick when down"" option in combat, each time seeing your fallen opponent gain increasingly grisly status conditions, packed a surprising emotional punch. And that's what this game is going for: drawing engaging story moments of wilderness and post-apocalyptic survival from austere gameplay elements. Never in a game have you been so happy to find a plastic bag, so afraid of a lone dog, so desperate for a drink of clean water. The very central crafting system, while inefficient, is fairly intuitive and visually interesting. After I'd played for a while, a central occupation became setting up camps decorated with the bones of my enemies. The story was interesting, though you'll have to play hard or get lucky to see all of it. Modding to allow saves broke the game in that it destroyed the haggard, roguelike grind for survival. How quickly, failing to plan ahead, you'll find yourself surrounded by a pack of dogs or caught out in the open at night makes every decision important, and the longer you survive the more is at stake. Without saves, however, I wasn't able to gather the resources necessary to explore the hacking and electronics mechanics, or to wholeheartedly play the story encounters, which are often deadly, without being afraid of losing my entire enterprise to a single bad decision. Then again, that's exactly what NEO is all about.			"

												I love this game so much, I own two copies and I plan to get the mobile version when it's released. It's immersive with an extremely interesting story, it has fun mechanics, and it's one of the most frustrating games I've ever played. I was ecstatic when I found 500$ worth of antibiotics, knowing I was safe from infection and I could sell some of the pills for food and other necessities if need be. Happily I made my way through forests and marshes across the map, secure in my wealth and odds of surviving. This and that happened and eventually I needed one of those sacred pills. I reached into my backpack with a smile on my face - only to find out my backpack had fallen apart somewhere in the middle of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere and I hadn't noticed (the game told me, I'm just an idiot). ALL of my antibiotics were gone, along with my clean cloths and everything else I was keeping in there. Then I died.That was a year ago. I'm still raging about it and I'm still playing this game, because I can't ♥♥♥♥ing beat it, yet it's really a blast. Seriously one of my favorite games.			"

Early Access Review
								NEO Scavenger is an excellent example of survival RPG, bringing to mind other isometric games like UnReal World and Haven and Hearth.  This game masters the eerie, abandoned quality present in Fallout, and is as challenging to navigate.  You will realize the painful cost of each difficult decision.That said, the game features nothing by way of world building.  You can craft your own ramshackle gear from the broken remnants of the pre-war world and the often hazardous wilderness, but you cannot cultivate, construct defenses, or harvest natural resources apart from sticks, branches, water, and a few edibles.  Everything in the game is slowly decaying, and ultimately, so are you.  If you want a sense that your character has a future other than ending up the corpse someone else scavenges, this is not the game for you.I can honestly say I feel I've had my money's worth, but I don't think I'll finish the main story line.  This game may well leave you feeling like a murderous hobo, starving, infected, insane, who would gleefully pop out of nowhere and bludgeon some random stranger to death with a tree branch for a shoddy left boot and a plastic shopping bag.  But some people who enjoy the survival genre are looking for just that.Happy hunting, you psychopath.			"

								I want to love this game, I really really do. I still would suggest it to people who like rogue-like(lite) games, and enjoy the survival because the survival is incredibly well done. I’m akso sure I will play more hours of this as time goes. With that said, my main issue is, unlike a lot of other permadeath games, this one has a story to tell, which might take you a long time to figure out when first playing, and it seems really interesting. The problem is, very few will ever get to experience that story as no matter how you gear up or character build, your character has the staying power of a lit candle in a hurricane. Little to nothing can stop a low or average enemy from getting in a lucky shot that will knock you out or kill you in one blow, costing you hours of game time. You will lose anything and everything you were working on. Having to re-create a character and starting again with the repetitive cryo facility wake-up scene. I understand this is the concept of this genre, but to have nothing left after working so hard to build up a character and losing 3-5 hours, for me, is frustrating. There are some who may love that, though. Once again, it’s not the permadeath for me, as much as it is the lucky cheap-shot.There are several mods for it already, though most just give more items and such. There are no saving mods as of yet, and the only way that truly seems to provide a means to see the story is some kind of invulnerability mod. Though removing the challenge entirely isn’t any fun at all. There is also a great mod out there that gives limited repair features that help shift the gameplay.With that said, the scavenging and survival system is absolutely incredible. Sometimes it can be a little over-complicated when you first play, but as a general rule most recipes make logical sense. Found a shard of glass? Use it as a cutting tool, wrap it with a piece of paper for a makeshift shiv, or use it as a weapon in dire need at the risk of cutting yourself. Found a glass bottle? Smash it and use it to threaten off an enemy. Use clean water or whiskey to sterilize your wounds before using those rags you sterilized in boiled water to stem the bleeding.The survival is the strongest aspect of this game and it shines over everything. From having to keep warm, to managing your health. Accidentally drank some bad water? Got sepsis from that wound you forgot to clean? You better find a place to hunker down and heal up with that bottle of anti-biotics you found in the locked shed with your makeshift lockpicks. Forage some wood and keep that fire going to stay warm and keep your immune system up, but make sure you set up some noise traps because people and…things can see it burning.The in-depth survival system makes this an amazing game to enjoy overcoming what I have said above, which is why I still suggest it. To see an indie dev put together a system that a AAA company could never have the creativity to pull off is a breath of fresh air. A game that will make you♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants in excitement just for finding a shopping cart.			"

												A friend of mine designs games and I wanted him to make a game where you were dropped into the desert and had to use what was around you to survive. He said he was too busy making aa tank game called shellshock skirmish, so im glad to have gotten round to finally purchasing neo scavenger. After being on my wishlist for a long time I picked it up on sale and its worth it and worth spending the time on. Using your brain to figure things out rather than being on a guided tour is a refreshing aspect not allowed in many games and theres plenty of small details and replayability to be had. Not a game for those who enjoy giving up as you will die many times, each time figuring things out more and more. On one of my plays through I had a good haul of equipment 7 days in and was progressing with the story (there is a story, you have to find it!) when I stupidly setup camp in a bad place and was murdered in my sleep, in another playthrough after just making it to the east coast i died from an infection from having drunk infected water on the trip!All together this is worth your time and the turn based nature allowd you to relax and play alongside doing something else like checking your emails or cooking :)			"

												A good survival game with a surprising amount of depth and content - I enjoyed the play-throughs. However, it crashes. In each attempt I survived the early-game and was set-up for the next step, then I'd get inventory bugs that forced an exit without saving. Hours of progress gone, would have to restart. This happened in all 3 of my attempts (8ish hours invested in each).If it was a $5ish dollar game I'd be more understanding, but for a $17 price tag I expect more reliability. Can't recommend in current state.Edit: recent updates seemed to have fixed most issues. Happy to recommend.			"

												In my last run, I found myself holed up in the cryo facility, which I'd made into quite the comfortable little strong-hold, with electric light, a comfortable bed, the works.  I'd only leave to collect water, firewood, or go hunting.  I could use the firewood to boil the water, and cook the food.  I scavanged what I could nearby, but that part of the map is pretty well picked-over.  I could get back to the barter-town and plot line, probably, but it'd be a lot easier if I could repair my push-cart.  I guess I'll chill at my chateau till the right parts show up on one of my few scavenging trips (I still need lighters from time to time, after all).  I'm armed enough that most critters and people in that part of the world aren't really a threat.  Yep, life is actually pretty good.  I'm thinking about taking up some farming, maybe learn to play an instrument, or ferment my own wine from the less poisonous berries around here.  I think I win the game, at this point, don't I?			"

												Frighteningly realistic. Can be difficult to get into but very hard to put down. Story is vague, and you have to pick it up in pieces. Character creation needs some work still, but it's fine. Some of the permadeath aspects can really suck, like how in certain encounters 2 out of the 4 choices will kill you. However this is compensated for with beautiful writing and detail. Combat is one of the best aspects of the game, it feels fresh, rewarding, and pretty realistic. Your first playthrough and your later playthroughs will have such a big difference, it's crazy. If you can't afford the kind of big price tag, I recommend the demo at the least. That has the combat.			"

												The best word for this game is 'harsh', I reckon. It just doesn't care about you if you screw up. This makes it incredibly satisfying to succeed in. Gameplay wise scavenging is gritty and engaging, combat is incredibly serious, and crafting is pretty satisfying. The UI is pretty weak, especially in crafting and managment, but it all works fine once you suss it out. The story has been pretty compelling so far. I was blown away by how they executed Detroit, I haven't seen anything quite like it before. That said I have only managed to get to it once, and it seems a sort of first stop for the plot to really start rolling. If you like survival games give it a crack!			"

												It's hard, tough and unforgiving, but when you finally get your ultimate skillset there is no one who can stop you (exept melonhead plz fex felfe).I mostly run: strong, melee lockpicking and hacking.Sure there is some RNG involved and if you dont like the fact that there is some in it, dont buy it then. But if  you can look over that fact and have some love for indie and survival games. This is DEFINITELY a game for you. You have to start over a lot of times and find ways to make the game easier for you. One bad choice can ruin everything you worked so hard for.In my opinon, this is a great game, 8/10 But hey, thats just my opinion.			"

Early Access Review
								At first i got the demo and liked it, so i bought the full version, this the the first low graphics/spec game that i ever liked since i started pc gaming recently. This is definitely worth 10$. By the way the maximum time i survived was 3 days 8 hours.EDIT - THIS GAME HAS BECOME VERY ADDICTING.       Just have a look at the hours I have played it. OVER 50. Let me describe this game's pros and cons       Pros -              Great survival mechanisms ( Eg . Crafting, tiredness? )             Good story ( not great )             MODDING ( YAY! )             Great Community             Big open world ( including little bit of wildlife and enemies )             Personal favourite - It has real life mythical creatures ( One can pluck your eyes out )             If you liked Dayz you'll probably like this game             Can run on almost every PC.         Cons -              Bad graphics ( Can't be called bad but just for people who only like games with good                                                 graphics)              So yeah if you want a game that you can come  back to anytime on any PC buy this game!

												I really enjoy this game but it seems like it can't decide whether it's a roguelike driven game or a story driven game, as there are multiple story events where some will kill you outright. So you must start over. (unless you used file explorer to make a back up save)In addition, the demo is a horrible representation of the game and doesn't really do the game justice. While I recommend trying the demo anyways, looking up gameplay videos would be a much better option.Still an enjoyable game			"

Early Access Review
								Sometimes you just want to lay back under your improvised tarp-shelter. Sink your teeth into some freshly roasted human meat on a stick, and die from the dirty water you drank five days earlies.Strangely cozy post apocalyptic survival roguelike with a mystery to boot. The swiftly respawnable version on Fallout.			"

												My plastic bag broke and I didn't notice so I lost my water bottles... I was dying of thirst so I drank some swamp water... Some stray dogs attacked me so I killed them with a pointy stick.. I built a fire and cooked up the dogs and ate them...I got sick, it must have been that unboiled swamp water, but I ate some antibiotics and got better... I got attacked by a psycho while I was sleeping... he killed me and took my single flip-flopBest week in a post apocalyptic world yet!10/10 I will find some ammo for this gun I've been lugging around if it kills me!

												a truly brutal survival sim, if you dont go in with a plan you will die. bravado is not a thing that is rewarded, it is to be punished with bone shattering realism. if you dont respect the game, the game will chew you up and spit you back out. this game is not something a more casual gamer should buy, only people who have played other unforgiving survival sims (such as Sunless Sea) will be able to grasp the difficulty of this game. despite its unforgiving style, it is enjoyable. if you liked the sheer scale of map size and exploration in games like Fallout or Oblivion you will like exploring NEO Scavenger, and crafting makes sense. There is a lot of text story, and the game lets you imagine much of how you interact with its world.			"

												The first thing you have to know about NEO Scavenger:You will die. A lot. I was told there is a fabled ending to the game but I have yet to see it. That said, I adore this game. It's old school nintendo hard at its finest. It's permadeath, so if that's a turn off save your money but it opens up the option for different styles of play and gaming. Also, take trapping. If your just starting out, take trapping. It makes the game so much easier to play and you are less of lady luck's ♥♥♥♥♥. All in all, worth the money. Wait for a sale if you can, but if not, I'd buy this again for 15 bucks.			"

												I have discovered my true calling as a hobo, fighting off feral dogs to scavenge post-apocalyptic ruins for anything remotely valuable.This game is quite good. It's actually very short, which is probably a good thing because it's so difficult. However, despite the amount of random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that seems to kill you in this game, I never had a death where that I couldn't see why it was my fault. The world is extremely harsh, but you'll mostly find out about the stuff that kills you early in the game, or it's common sense, so you won't get to the endgame only to be insta-killed unless YOU do something stupid. Just be aware that the minute you DO do anything stupid, you will probably die. This, together with the core gameplay around surviving, is what kept me coming back to the game, even after ragequitting in frustration and deciding to never play it again. The different systems around survival -health, scavenging, combat, crafting, character creation, bartering, and inventory - work together extremely well. I have a weakness for survival and sandbox games, especially rogue-like survival games, but I'm also very harsh on them. I have a lot of problems with games like Minecraft, Rust, Ark, Terraria, DayZ and more. NEO Scavenger has been the perfect survival experience for me though. It's not something to spend hundreds of hours on, no. Based on my playtime so far and the playtime of other reviewers, 70ish hours seems to be the cap before interest dives. That's when I felt like I had thoroughly learned how the game worked. What makes this an engaging experience is going from knowing nothing about the game to being able to take on any challenge it thows at you. Amazingly, it succeeds in being an experience both fantastic and realistic.It's not perfect, of course. The story events and random events have some problems, but even though these choose-your-own-adventure style events can kill you, they're actually surprisingly lenient compared to the core mechanics of the game. You usually have to screw up pretty bad to get killed, and most frequently you just get a slap on the hand if you didn't choose exactly the right path through event. Since I died so much outside of the events, it was pretty fun to see how different paths and different character builds affected the outcome. Other than that, I personally couldn't care about the story and events very much. It's interesting, moderately good quality, and original. I normally love narrative and world-building in games, but in NEO Scavenger it took the backseat to the core gameplay. The only negative thing I can say about that is it could just use MORE. The art style, while flat, is exactly what it needs to be for the game, but everything definitely looks the same after only an hour or two. If there were a few more hex-types and some variation in textures, and especially if there was some physical depth, as in changes in elevation, to the terrain, it would be much more visually interesting. The item count is decent, but if there was just a bit more customization possible it would be awesome, and then every single npc wouldn't look identical. The map is actually quite large, and it can take a long time to get across it when you're looting everything that's even slightly lootable and fending off all manner of dangers along the way, but it could really use a few more unique locations with events tied to them, even though I said that's not what I'm here for. The character building is great: it really does feel like original Fallout and it totally determines what you can do and how you play, but for a system so deep it just feels so small. The world NEO Scavenger takes place in is very interesting, but outside of vague newspaper articles there's not actually all that much to explain it all. With a more cohesive and expansive lore, I could really get into this world. The story, like I said, is very short, and I frankly don't care that much about it; it's good enough for me. But it does have this interesting problem that unless you explore everything you can easily ""complete"" the story in just two ""quests"". It's pretty hard to tell what kind of story NEO Scavenger wants to tell, and how. I don't think it needs to be longer. With multiple paths and endings and the difficulty of the game it benefits from being short. But it does need a few more storytelling mechanics, and probably a better, more dense distribution of the story throughout the gameplay. As is, you play the core game and progress for a long while, and then you get a big chunk of wall-of-text story.All in all, if you want a solid survival role-playing game, this is what you want. I think that for the type of people who enjoy this game you can expect as much as 70 hours of extremely engaging time with this game, which is definitely worth $15. Enjoy!			"

												Fun, but it can get maddeningly hard. Like when you've built a stable home base in the starting hex and the game decides, despite the fact that you're basically a fetus in the time span of playing, to spawn a wolf man to come and kill you simply because you were enjoying yourself too much. There's using RNG to spawn enemies then there's being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about it.			"

												Incredible fun with a very high learning curve, you're going to spend the first hour trying to survive just a handful of turns out of spawn. The game is very unforgiving, but when you do get the hang of it, it's a lot of fun. There's probably only 4 or so hours of actual content in the game, but by the time you are able to beat the learning curve, you'll have spent 8+ hrs. TL:DRIt's fun, but challenging.

												Really great game! Extensive crafting, skill trees and story telling. Who really needs graphics to enjoy a game, this game does great with its unique graphics style and turn based actions. No matter how many times you die, you keep reaching for the NEW GAME button and end up trying all sorts of different skill sets which will completely change the style of play, from sneaking around in forest harvesting for recources or killing everything you see then eating their corpse in a worse case scenario. You roam around the waste land searching for information about yourself and meet all sorts of characters from tribes people to crazy cultists!			"

												Frighteningly realistic. Can be difficult to get into but very hard to put down. Story is vague, and you have to pick it up in pieces. Character creation needs some work still, but it's fine. Some of the permadeath aspects can really suck, like how in certain encounters 2 out of the 4 choices will kill you. However this is compensated for with beautiful writing and detail. Combat is one of the best aspects of the game, it feels fresh, rewarding, and pretty realistic. Your first playthrough and your later playthroughs will have such a big difference, it's crazy. If you can't afford the kind of big price tag, I recommend the demo at the least. That has the combat.			"

												The best word for this game is 'harsh', I reckon. It just doesn't care about you if you screw up. This makes it incredibly satisfying to succeed in. Gameplay wise scavenging is gritty and engaging, combat is incredibly serious, and crafting is pretty satisfying. The UI is pretty weak, especially in crafting and managment, but it all works fine once you suss it out. The story has been pretty compelling so far. I was blown away by how they executed Detroit, I haven't seen anything quite like it before. That said I have only managed to get to it once, and it seems a sort of first stop for the plot to really start rolling. If you like survival games give it a crack!			"

												Get this game only if you like hardcore roguelike games that doesn't give you any slake. While I enjoyed the fact that this game seemed to be a love letter to Fallout 1/2 with it's turnstyle controls and combat, the luck factor in this game will often be against you if you are starting out. You will die a LOT in the first playthroughs, but if you retain your experiences from those playthroughs you'll be able to survive long enough to progress on the storyline.It is a good survival game that is worth the price but my only complaints are that it feels a bit empty what with only a handful of locations to visit on a giant map. There are random encounters, but most of the time, they tend to be to your disadvantage unless you save beforehand. The major thing is that this game has permadeath ie. you lose EVERYTHING when you die...including your savefile. Unless you manage to make a backup of your savefile, you will have to start at the beginning everytime you die and that will be the breaking point for gamers interested in getting this.Finally, my last grip is that there will be no new content added to the game by the creator. However, there is a growing Mod community for the game an the creator made the game itself to be moddable. Hell you can even play around with the xml file of the game itself to adjust the game to your liking, though you'll have to go to the game's forums to learn more on that.All in all, if you enjoy survival turnbased games dealing with post-apocalypse and supernatural themes with good story, crafting and (more importanly) mods to extend the game , then buy this. If not, then Project Zomboid might be more your thing.			"

												This was one of my first buys on steam and my introduction into rogue-like games. I started palying this game in early access and learned to love this game. Despite the simple graphics and mesic do not be fooled this game is deep and difficult. I've lsot count of the number of times I've died. Sometimes it's heat stroke, or dysentery, other times it was a Bad Mutha smahing my head in like a pumkin in the middle of the night, I've been suffocated under a pack of Melon Heads and knocked out by scavengers. I've spent days having diarrhea after eating the wrong berries. Spent many sleepless nights waiting in dark abandoned apartment complexs for a pack of Dogmen to come and rip me to shreds. And despite all the deaths, all the battles,  and sleepless nights I keep on playing because the map is vast and there are so many places to go and people to talk to. Because the lore of the game is hidden in a multitude of places and despite the number of times I've lived and died at Zom Zom's I still come back for the BBQ			"

												This is a great game, atleast if you like a game to punish every single mistake you make. becuse this game is unforgiving, which I personally love about it. It features a advanced crafting and talent system that lets you survive the harsh landscape in many different ways. Some skills are more usefull than others but non the whole you can play it in differently each time. The one thing that I miss is a save system. Sure its nice that the game is grueling hard, but more times then not, combat comes down to pure chance. A guy with a rock can get a lycky hit which makes you blead internally and kill you in two rounds, when you are far into the game that really blows. A savesystem that only works at a few key-locations would be nice.On the whole this game is a great experience!			"

												I'm not one to review games on here, but ill give credit where credit is due. Of all the crappy shovelware indie games we have had thrown at us in 2014, this is probably one of the better ones.If you like realism and games with hyper detail such as Dwarf Fortress. This game will most like satisfy your tastes for at least 50+ hours. Although the beginning gets a bit repeatitive due to the amount of times you will die in the wasteland, once you trek out into the wilderness things begin to take shape for your own little adventure. By my tenth life in the world I thought I was well acquainted with the game only to come upon a scavenger with a bow who struck me in the head as I hid behind a boulder.Alas such is life, buy the game and have your own little adventure.

(comment if im just wrong and stupid)3: RNG. the rng is bull.The good things1: sandbox.2: my favorite combat system in any game. it is so amazing whenever you engage in a fight, the text describes everything in detail and there are so many choices in combat like real life. you got your flurries, leg sweeps, trips, tackles, ECT. also its fun hearing in detail how you knocked the enemy out causing internal bleeding, then stomped on his chest and made his lungs collapse and bleed.3: THE FALLOUT ATMOSPHER YOU HAVE BEEN CRAVING. yeah fallout is amazing and this reminds me alot of fallout with the atmosphere and what not.4: LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT, enough said.TLDR: its an amazing game buy it, the only problem is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG,but the positives by far outweigh the cons!

As you keep playing, and it keeps killing you, you learn to adapt, to grow stronger. Eventually, you get to a point where you can fight the toughest enemies and actually win. Then a random dog will slit your throat while you sleep. It's a frustrating game, but it's hard to stop playing.			"

												First of all, go ahead and play the demo, it is very representative of the game and if you like it, you are going to like the game.The tension this game puts you through is remarkable, you will find yourself analyzing the tiniest details, making sure you won't wake up in the night being slaughtered by a wolfman.There are, however, a couple of things I personally would've liked to know before I played the game. I'll put these in spoilers in case you want to find everything out by yourself: If a weapon has a strap, you can carry it by pointing at the shoulder of the character in the menu. Also, some bags can be carried over the left shoulder. The biggest problem this game has is bugs. Unfortunately, they can be truly devastating. Once, I loaded my game and the progress on the map was completely gone, so I could not see what I have seen in the past. If you take anything away from this review, let it be this:The game, despite my hours played, is actually really short. Once you have managed to master the mechanics (which will take at least 30 hours I would say), you can finish the game in a couple of hours.I was very disappointed when the ending screen appeared, because I thought now that I mastered the game I could use all my skills to explore the world and getting stronger.Anyway, the game was worth playing and I hold it in high regard.

It is unforgivingly difficult, but very satisfying when you weather the storm and stabilize.It allows many viable builds which will vary your play style significantly, although you will always play as a desperate scavenger.  Learning the survival systems and how to manage each is fun and engaging.  And it always feels wonderful when you discover the tools you need to make it another few days be it the means to make fire, clothes to stay warm, something to boil water in, or a large bag/sled to haul your stuff.Although it seems unfair at times (such as when you are killed in your sleep without a chance to act) the real choice you made came earlier when you did (or were not able to) make a safe camp with noise traps.I have one major gripe with the game is that the story elements, while immersive, tend to be too deadly, either ending your run prematurely, forcing you into a trial and error state to learn the proper choices, or spoiling the story by looking up the solution on the wiki.  While the rest of the game is fair but difficult, and revolves around the choices/play style of that run, these only involve foreknowledge of what is coming up and the time it took to prepare for it.Even so, it remains one of the best indie games I've ever played.

												One of my favorite rougelike games in recent memory. I actually really enjoyed learning all the mechanics of survival, and going from only being able to survive for less than a day reliabily to learning how to survive for days and weeks on end was really rewarding.I must have spent 30 hours learning the systems, and around 2-3 hours for a winning run. I only wish that there was more content: it felt like the game was only just getting started by the time I had won. Then again, I guess it does make sense to end the game when you're getting a run to the point where you're pretty self sufficiant. It could get a bit boring otherwise.			"

												This game brings me back.  Way back.  Way back to my 386/33+Boca graphics, playing deep into the night.  It's similar to the late 80's and early 90's quasi rpg, exploration games.  Kinda like Fallout, Wasteland, etc. This one is perma-death and quite fun.			"

												Damn almost 80 hours, I truly got my monies worth on this game. I watched Jame's Recommends on this game which made me interested. This game is brutal, even when you feel you are unstoppable, one simple wrong move and you have lost hours of work. It really gave it that rogue like feel. Starting over became fun, you get to experiment with different traits and have a whole new different experience. There is even an ending and it has taken me many attempts to get a complete playthrough visiting every story and key point. I have some videos of my playthroughs on Twitch.			"

												I have played neo scavenger for about 23 hours and i have fallen in love with it! it is one of the most unforgiving and indepth rouge-likes i have ever played and i just cant stop playing!! It does have quite a learning curve but once you get the hang of it it is extremely enjoyable!			"

												Plays like a mix of fallout, FTL type surivival games, 4x4 strategy, and an interactive novel. The guy who made it worked for Bioware, so the writing is high quality and this makes all the difference when the most dramatic scenes of the game are described entirely through text. My main complaint would be the gui, which I understand is supposed to be a throwback but ends up making very odd use of space, some buttons are just way too small or in weird places. NEO Scavenger has some rough edges but it's hard to tell what's intentionally rough and what decisions are simply quirks of the developer. Regardless, it's very hardcore and rewarding so far.			"

												Great game set in complexive and interesting, post-apocalyptic word. You will scavenge, craft and fight during your travel to the end of the horizon, where the big, light glow is located. Simply amazing.			"
