												MUST READ BEFORE YOU PLAY:There are a few things i think people should know about before playing this game.I bought kingdom wars before it was a f2p game and have had two maxed out citys with high lvl hero's and have spent money on the game beyond just buying it pre f2p.This is my honest review about what i know of the game.BUGS! Be prepared to lose resorces for winning pvp matches.That's right you lose for winning! If a person trys to fight you and you accept and then he pays you to flee battle you get a win and maybe a little gold from the payout BUT you will lose 5k food 5k wood and 5k stone from your towns resorce stash which varries depending on what your stash has in it but that was my last loss to this bug. Not only do you lose for winning a pvp match in this manner you don't recieve the crowns for the win that you are supposed to get for winning.The only way to avoid this bug is to fight until the game tells you you won or lost.BUGS! That's right more bugs.This one however is in your favor.When creating troops to build an army some times you will dupe extra units.BUGS! Your city is full of small bugs that are annoying at times but minor and not worth more then a mention that thay are there.THE MOTHER OF ALL BUGS! This is a big one in my opinion! Be prepared to lose it all! That's right and not because you can be captured or destroyed by another player but because everytime the dev's change the game some people not all but at random get a full wipe including your account like you never exisited in the first place. The money you spent ""poof gone"" the time you spent ""poof gone"". I know this first hand as both my maxed out city's got wiped and in return i didn't even get a response from the support team. After the first time i said ""ok i haven't played in a wile no big deal i lost my stuff"" and i moved on rebuilt spent money on the starter packs and was back on top in a few weeks and that's when the dev's changed the game again and i lost it all again.Sense the game came out pre f2p i have put about 60$ into the game and 288 hours which i wish at this point i had not but if you don't mind losing it all and spending money and time on a game so that a bug can rob you in the end then this game is for you!There are some cool things about kingdom wars but the amount of bugs makes the amount of cool things not worth the mention as the bugs destroy the enjoyment all together.The dev's don't really care about the game the bugs have been there forever and have never been fixed the team took what was supposed to be an update to kingdom wars and made it a stand alone game ""kingdom wars 2: battles"" which is the same game with a cuple added fetures.The team only did this to pump more money out of people instead of fixing and updating the game they had already created ""Kingdom wars"" leaving KW broken and a waste of time and money.In the end i can't say i recommend any games from this team as they don't put any real care into the games they create beyond publishing bug filled crap they have no intention to fix.

												Some games are born great, others have greatness thrust upon them... This one is neither, through the efforts of the developers and a great part of the community it has worked toward something truly unique. I have played my share of games that had Pay to Win (or elements of it) schemes going on in the background, yet never had I seen one where the developers actually completely changed the game because of critisism from the players themselves... I know of no better community of players then the ones who stalk the digital halls of Kingdom Wars, (it's the only game that I leave the chat window open on) when there was a shortage of Moderators the players themselves would offer advice to the new arrivals. Simply put, my hours should speak for themselves, and I intend to continue for a long time. Many people have claimed that Kingdom Wars is rough around the edges, that it is, but those same people usually don't stick around enough to see the simple truth that we veterans know by heart... (or atleast we should by now) ""If you don't like it, spend some time and wait for the next update."" So in closing, it's fun, it's free, and no other game in the genre can come close to it's majesty!			"

												7/10** Developers removed the buying of premium currency in the last patch. now it is only availble through quests.****AKA NO BUY TO WIN ANYMORE**Game plays similar to total war. Are a few bugs that tend to occur with each patch that take time to get fixed.The multiplayer and persitant aspect of DoF adds a new and more refreshing element into the genre.  Managing your kingdom is just as fun as battling players and NPCs.Take time to compare the negative and positive reviews.  Take game time played into consideration.It took me a good 4 hours before I finally got hooked. That time was spent learning the ins and outs of the game due to me not having played strategy games in eons.Is it the perfect game? no.Is it a fun game? Yes.Should you buy it?  Yes, especially since it is always on sale it seems.			"

												Kingdom Wars is a very interesting game. At first I had a very low opinion of it, but if you can overcome the first hour of the game and look past its shortcomings you'll find a very addictive experience with so much potential.Negative impressions:  Visually it looks as if it made in the early 2000s, and the combat leaves a lot to be desired. Once battle is joined unit formations devolve into disorganized mosh-pit like globs with very poor unit collision detection (if any at all.) The animations are primitive and very basic, not just in combat but for walking, idle, and cutscenes dialog. There are also a host of bugs, many of which are highly destructive and infuriating. The worst I encountered was when I lost an entire army, 28 units, because a quest sent them into a void and left me with an empty army on the map- without even starting the quest. I was left without my hero unit, and an entire day worth of invested resources that I used to build said army.Positive Impressions: The economic system and a load of fun, and by far the best part of the game aside from the general idea. You can make profits by trading, harvesting resources, looting battlefields, and questing. Each option presents its own benefits and challenges. If you decide to harvest resources at home then you will looking at the safest and most reliable way, but it also means you need peasants working the land which drags on your unit cap. Trade is the quickest way, but it also means you’re at risk of losing caravans and thus your cargo. It also requires more management and the natural risk of losing money on a trade if you’re too hasty.The game has a pretty mild pace, which is certainly a positive in my opinion. You won’t become powerful overnight, and all buildings and soldiers take quite a bit of resources and time to make. There is also a healthy variety of units and plenty of defining traits to pick from. Units gain experience from battles which lets you upgrade them, in addition to researching new technologies and equipment. From what I can tell there is no pay-to-win advantage either. The cashhop is purely aesthetics and speeding up the process of questing rewards.If the combat would be overhauled then I think this would be an easy game to recommend, and if animations and visuals where modernized then it would be a jewel. However as it stands it’s a give and take. If you can overlook its issues there is a lot of fun to be had, but not everyone can do that. "

												It's a great concept and the idea of the game is interesting, but don't expect to engange in many PvP battles, more so it's rare when someone tries to attack your castle, which hasn't happened yet. Your Troops fight in a squad and can actually level up and you get to chose from several different strenghs, such as how hard they hit and how much damange they can take. If you loose a sqaud of high level soilders it's not the end of the world but you feel bad.The game is almost too slow to start, but after 5-6 hours you start to see the gold coming in. You might have read it's ""pay to win"". You can spend cash for crowns which buy's you the special units or upgrades, yet after you get established it's easy to build a bank of crowns. Your gold even starts to overflow to the point where a good portion of the time your lugging your troops around from town to town selling goods.Whatever race you chose to play isn't a total lock, you can still buy units from the other races. One of the key factors is collecting your loot off of dead bodies, I strongly recomand  getting Female Wardens from the elf race because you can simply select their duty to collect loot and they do it fast compared to human peasents. The AI isn't great.  They are going to attack is how they are going to attack. Generally they don't engage you till you engage them. If they try to flank it's a pre-determined before the game even starts. The AI doesn't adjust to the battlefield and what is going on. The AI will flank when basically you already broke the line.Archers and Crossbow men are generally a strong staple of castle RTS'. They aren't effective. When you see 60-80 Archers on a castle ridge after a few times it doesn't make you turn your soilders around.The big draw back besides the lack of PvP fights, which when they do happen are very laggy is the overall Missions of the game. Basically it's fighting a small group of soilders, or laying into a castle.  Most of the missions are putting down rebel armies of peasents. The developer has been putting out patches, but the game isn't new, so I'm not sure what the future holds in stock. If they make a second one, I think they will get the game right.I enjoyed my time with the game, but with no real challange and a weak storyline that actually may not have a ending , it's hard to say ""Yes"" or ""No"" to the game.  However, if your looking to play a RTS game and can't find one I would give it a shot, it did provide me several hours of gaming.			"

												What the page doesn't actually tell you, something that I was stung by, is the presence of a real life cash shop in the game (where you can buy one of the strongest units in the game, dragons for instance, as well as various ""pay-to-win"" instances)As such I would recommend some further research into this game before purchasing.Edit: This may no longer be true as per my post on the comments section of this original post.

												I would recommend this game to anyone who loves RTS fantasy games. PROS-Beautiful scenery, interesting units, races, strategies and play styles. The story line is a bit interesting too. This is definitely worth the FREE download and try. The game runs on my outdated subpar computer. Game is NOT pay to win. You can chat, have friends, create an empire and a guild. You can control multiple cities and races, and armies. You can have vassals, do co op with friends, and show off your high leveled up units. All the races are viable to play.CONS-Large battles tend to lag and make clicking important things hard to do and the combat systems leave much to be desired as the units are sometimes oblivious to quite obvious enemies and sometimes stand there and do nothing or chase after an enemy while forgetting the actual enemy you clicked on for it to target. You cannot melee a moving unit, even if you are faster and chasing that unit. Town population cap of only 90. Hero unit level cap of only 60. Towns are only semi customizable as you cannot place whatever you want, wherever you want you have to build on plots, and you cannot really design your defenses or choose where you put the walls, towers and gates. Cannot actually view friends towns and you cannot add a new friend if that friend is currently offline. Can only click/use one referral code. Limited town storage and upgrading your storage buildings does not increase it. Upgrading buildings in general should improve things relating to that building, but in most cases it does nothing other than increase the HP of the building.I know my list of cons is big, but I put it there because I wish the game were a bit better in these areas, however, regardless of the cons this game is still amazing and I cant put it down.

												This is definetly the best Free to play game.Also as an RTS is very balanced and the AI is pretty intelligent.Also,the graphichs are amazing.It's the first MMORTS I've ever played,but I bet if there is any other MMORTS it cannot be as good as this.Those 3 races you can play(elf,orc,human)and the existence of dwarfes(which you can also use in combat) + dragons and other creatures makes you feel like you are playing Lord of the Rings,and the combat makes you feel like you are playing Total War.Even it is Free to play,it is not a Pay to Win game,so you can simly be as good as others that pay.The PVP sistem is very nice too,You can battle army versus army or siege a player's castle.You can also PVP army vs army at other castles(controlled by AI).And the variety of quests(which can be played co-op) makes the game even more interesting.But definetly by far the best thing in Kingdom Wars is siegeing.Take your mate and siege a castle,and I guarantee you won't regret seeing thousands of men fighting.IF you have a wizard,dragon or a hydra with you,the battle will be even more interesting.Of course there are plenty o bugs,but the developers are trying their best to fix them.And there are always moderators online to help you get through those bugs and refund your lost resoruces/units. Also,the comunity is very nice and will surely help you questing,battleling,and maybe even giving you some resources :)If you are an RTS/Medieval/RPG or just a browser games fan,you definetly have to try this game!

												A Fantasy free to play non pay to win fairly slow-paced RTS game with PvE and PvP elements, with an ever growing communityIf that sounds interesting to you then this is the game for youMy first time playing this game I had mixed feelings. Low res graphics, buyable units, premium accounts and Purchasable city plots. All of it was too Pay-to-Winesque for me. But after having spent quite some hours into the Game by talking and bonding with the Community I very rapidly discovered how wrong my assumptions were. Buyable units are easily stomped on by non-buyable units. Premium is merely a small bonus. While it may not be Pay To Win on the gameplay part it does have a few knacks of its own, for example: ''Starting another city'' with another race and settings requires a payment of 4.99$ or by deleting your current City. This feature is very stupid as it limits you to only 1 race which limits the player from sinking more time into the game without sinking money into the game. A very positive change would be if they gave you 2 slots instead of 1, maybe when they release the Undead race they will give everyone a 2nd slot. HINT HINTUpdates are pumped in weekly so expect bugs/glitches that you might encounter to be fixed soonNext to bug and glitches fixes new content is added to. Such as skins, units, buildings maybe even a whole new race.On a side note, this game is still pretty unstable, on a daily basis people come in and complain about how they crashed during big battles or that certain things aren't working. One of the Major malfunctions in this game is the fact that Online gameplay isn't fully server hosted causing bugs with Resource gathering from time to time, but that is simply because they don't have the financial support to make everything more server dependent. Which is where you come in.Gameplay itself is very solid. While the Army management is pretty flonky because of bugs with manual Army mapping and you can only select 18 Units at once, it is still fun and massive, there are some performance issues with big armies moving around and large fights (FPS drops and sometimes Crashes) it is still very fun, competitive and enjoyable. A few issues here and there make the competitive part of this game ALOT less... competitive, such as Battle protection pausing when going offline. But it is still carried forward by the massive rewards PvPing and PvEing give, especially late game.The best part of it, when you start PvP you can't be put up against opponents with a larger or smaller army then yours, making it completely skill reliant.Pros-Solid game-Solid experience-Lots of dialogue-Wide open-world with lots of provided Lore-Updates are sinked in on a weekly basis-Lots of playability-Fun and growing community-Lots of content-Beautiful designCons:-Bad AI-Inconsistent unit collission-Workers not always doing what they are told to until you manually send them-Extremely buggy-Not enough is server hosted-An extreme amount of dialogue (This could be a Pro depends on how you look at it)-Extremely low res (Ruins the design part by quite alot)-Some Pay to Win elements that do need to be removed-Pretty hard learning curve for newcomers-Unit management is not that good (HD patch would help xP)This may look very negative but as a whole the Pros outmatch the Cons by far, since the Developers of this game are working very hard to take charge and improve this game as a whole. While some issues may not be fixed in a few weeks, months or even Years it still is a solid experience and a must play for Hardcore RTS players that want to enjoy both sides of an MMORTS, the Town management and PvP without PvP taking the cake like in most MMORTS games.The best part of this, it's free.

												Hello! Let me start by saying this game is unique and have great potential but its far from perfect!I'll start with the good side of Kingdom Wars:If you are fan of Stronghold, Total War, Warcraft, Age of Empires series you will love this game, has the all elements including some unique features like live economy and constant online world!You'll start with a small village, few peasants, soldiers and a hero (24 hours battle protection) .... build and upgrade your town and armies, siege and ally with other players and NPC , train Hyrdras, Minotaurs, Dragons to become emperor and conquer the world!Enjoy sieging your enemies (player or NPC) but be careful about where you deploy your armies couse anytime you can be attacked by other players (in game system have battle protection but you will need to spend cowns to get it and wont be able to pvp or coop will its active), hunt other players on battlefield if you dont have anyone to siege, trade with other towns, escort your caravans will moving resorces, explore the world with your armies and much more!If you are willing you can spend real money to customize your hero armor,town architecture,army banners,symbols.Buy additional town space (only 1 town is free), build new Empires with different race and share new expiriance with your friends!Ok here is the bad side of Kingdom Wars:Servers ... uff i am feeling sick already .... they are just not good, game have huge number of buggs and will lagg even on amazing configurations will coop - duo to server issus .... if you are in Europe and you coop with someone from Australia! Buying naming rights for your heroes and monsters is throwing money couse names will mix or reset everytime you enter new region, also prices for some staff are not worth the money, they should balance this.You will be frustrated with same buggs and controles because they are still working on improving game engine. Recently all servers crushed and they lost most in game data, however I have to commend the moderator they really made the effort to cut our losses but at the end everyone started over with promise it wont happen again!Generally viewed this is great game and you will enjoy playing it even with all its faults .... i know i did :) 7.5/10 Would give it 9-9.5 if they fix servers and all of the above mentioned!Sorry for my bad English i know its not perfect but hope this review will help ppl!All the best guys and good luck! ;)			"

												Yes, this is worth getting.I've noticed a lot of negativity about this game since it's release and frankly I don't understand where it is all coming from. What you have here is a solid, fun, online RTS game, with some innovative original flourishes.Pros:= Three distinct factions with very different play styles both in terms of city building, unit disposition and battle tactics. They are further differentiated by their own distinct unit, building and UI art, quest lines and voice acting. Each faction can also recruit a variety of mercenary units to further enhance army customization.= The battle pacing is just right. Look I'm an old fart, so I prefer a game where I can actually see the action unfold rather than everything be over in the blink of an eye. The pace of combat is somewhat slower in DoF than in other contemporary RTS games. I think this is a good thing becasue it allows for more tactical options and also negates any ping advantages in multiplayer.= Heaps of single player content. Each faction has a very generous quest line which I estimate to be around 30+ hours worth per side, not counting replayable missions. There are also countless NPC skirmishes to explore in a variety of landscapes against varied NPC elements.= The quests are involved and interesting. They have put a great deal of thought into felshing out details of the fantasy world. It's not a testiment to originality, but it's a top notch effort for a video game setting. I love how half of what the elves say is made up gibberish with no explanation offered, but after an hour or so in the game you find yourself understanding it all.Cons:= There are a few technical issues especially with pathfinding, but nothing that some patience and practice can not overcome.= Multiplayer is a mixed bag. You can grind out a very formidable army against NPCs and newbies can get crushed if they dive in unprepared. That being said, when the balance is just right, they battles are a lot of fun.= Speaking of grind, there is a bit of it. It's an online game so the pace of progression is sedate. You won't max your units out over a weekend. Your rank and file units can also be permanently lost, so you need to be paying attention. I personally like the perma death touch for some units (hero units take an xp penalty instead when they get ""KOed""), but I can understand why some people would consider it a negative.All in all I had a great time with DoF. If you're an RTS fan and looking for something a little different and long term, you should definately pick this up during the sale. It's a steal for seven bucks.			"

												Game servers are not recording progress. It recognises a new kingdom created but forces you to start over every time you want to play that kingdom, making it pointless to play in the first place.If you want in-game support, there is none as the ingame community is dead and the only way to contact GM's /devs is via email.If you exit the game via main menu, it tries logging you back in, in an endless loop, forcing you to crash the game in order to exit.This game is plagued with bugs as a result of the developers abandoning it last year, (read the forums) Hence why it is now on Steam. It's a pitty because it had a lot of potential even with a in-game shop, but now it's just an empty shell of what it could have been.			"

												Hello,Just figured I would write this quick review of my recent experience. Please take it with a grain of salt and your experience may be different.I played Kingdom Wars earlier this way. Around July or so for several weeks at least. Spent actual money for some of the perks. Premium being one of them. As well as a small expansion I believe. I won't go into how the game was then or that experience though.Just wanted to share that it is now December. I hadn't logged into the game since late July so I just wanted to see if my city was still there. To my amazement when I logged in it treated me as a completely new player. My city was totally gone and even the premium days that I had payed for that were left on my account also were gone as well.This review is not meant to be positive or negative or bashing anyone. Only a simple statement of experience. The reader can feel free to take from it what they will.			"

												Yup this game is awsome! For those who like RTS and is must have piece. Luckily its not pay-to-win i have paid nothing yet and i dont feel anyway behind other players. It must be added, that you can feel the 'under contruction' sign, but all in all its a game in a world with rich lore, and the feeling of classic fantasy is only the top of the cake.Thanks to the well planed PvP protection you wont get raided and farmed in that very moment you join the game, also you dont have to sit 24/7 in front of this game, since you are protected while offline.You should definetly give it a try if you liked any total ward games mixed with a bit of Mount&Blade and a bit of Warcraft III :)			"

												Kingdom Wars (Race: Human) 0. Resource gathering  Resources are gathered by peasants (stone, wood, gold, food - though food is a bit different as you can slaughter pigs that are ""fattened"" for a large food income). Each peasant unit takes 1 population space and costs some food. 1. Story about my wizard and about ""wealth"" (crowns)  For quite a while I had battle protection as a starter player. This battle protection gave me enough time to form an army, walls and a wizard. Wizard is an extremely strong unit. Maximum population number of town is 90 I think - you can increase the initial low population limit by building houses - also, you can have initially up to 5 armies outside of your town on map - each army has 60 population cap (Normal units take 1/90), wizard takes 10 and costs 120 crowns. Crowns are gained either by paying 5000 gold (daily limit of bought crowns is 30) or winning a pvp/pve battle (siege or army fight) [You can get 20-40 crowns for winning when attacked by enemy player in your town). A wizard needs further spell upgrades to be able to cast spells (10,20,40,80 and 150 crowns - example for lightning (of the Deep) wizard: shield,drain stamina, buff allies, large aoe attack, teleport) so it's very expensive unit. Once I got the wizard and trained him to get to higher level and bought 2 spells (shield gives him extreme resistance to everything and aoe attack kills everything sooner or later) I was able to siege enemy castle with one man - the wizard. 2. First defence of my town This happened when I finished building my inner stone wall and outer wooden wall (There are 2 types of wall - One made out of wood and the other one is made out of stone, stone is very expensive and there is inner (cheaper) and outer part - outer is much more expensive than the inner one, it's like a second layer of walls) and placed trebuchets on them (you can build trebuchets, rock throwers (close range) or hot oil thingy that pours hot oil on top of the enemy) on top of stone walls. I recalled all of my peasants into my middle part of the town. I chose to fight the enemy. I placed my archers on the wall - on the side from where the enemy was coming. He started attacking my town with trebuchets, he focused on my outer wooden wall and used fiery stones that set the area around my walls on fire. I had plenty of stone in my town and you can buy stone during battle for gold if you have market built so I started aiming all of my trebuchets (the ones on the walls) at those trebuchets. In 4 minutes the enemy trebuchets were destroyed. Then I opened the outer wooden door. As I expected, enemy archers started pouring in, hoping to shoot my people, cattle and soldiers. As soon as they passed my gate I closed it behind them. They were trapped in my outer wall part of town. I started ordering all of my elven rangers (best archers in game, I got them from befriending one elven town and buying them in it) to increase their rate of fire and fire at the enemy archers. Then I opened my inner gate and sent all of my unicorns (also elven unit, they use them for gaining gold and as a cavalry. My wizard kept placing defencive shield on my rangers and they kept firing while unicorns were slaughtering the archers and crossbowmen. They died in 2 minutes. Only thing that remained were enemy melee units behind my wall. I sent my archers to shoot them from safety of my walls and aimed my trebuchets with another 3000 stone remaining (Enough for a long time of constant firing from few trebuchets). The enemy surrendered before I managed to obliterate the rest of his army. I got 28 crowns. The whole siege was like 20 minutes long.I find this game very nice - also, any units you loose during the pvp or pve fights is dead permanently (except wizards, main hero and other heroes like them) UPDATE: I've returned to playing this game, got affected by a roll-back and lost most of my proggress - I was given codes for crowns (ingame currency, something like ""cash"" type of money  in most games, dragon and a free code for Kingdom Wars 2: Battles <- It took them only 43 minutes to reply with these ""refunds"". Best support ever "

												I was thinking of giving up on this game during the first 30minutes of gameplay, but im glad I didn't. Very fun and addictive once you get into it (past the inital quests and learning curve). IMO best MMORTS out there!Additional comment: this game is NOT pay to win AT ALL. I have not spent a single cent (excluding buying the game) in this game and I have an 80% pvp win/lose ratio. I also have the most expensive units ( that requires premium currency to buy) on my account. The premium currency (that you can buy) can very easily be attained through in game questing. So please do not let the fact that others say that it's a Pay to Win game to discourage you from getting this awesome game!			"

												Very well done game. I seen youtube videos and these guys have been around for years updating this game and it's only been getting better and better as I have seen. It's very worth the money and building a kingdom in this one is very fun seeing there's lots of quest that keep ya busy and crowns you have to gain or buy with money you make from cattle or chopping trees and gold and stone mines. I like the experience and upgrading units. I've been on many hours since I started and there's so much more for me to go. Just now got a powerfull dragon and have been burning up lots of enemies.

												Changing my oppinion on the game after having played a good 30 hours.This game has been out for 3 years yet should never have been released in its current format. The devs seem keen on taking suggestions and fixing bugs, but the base of the game is broken. Terrible UI, delayed commands, units not doing what they are supposed to, no interactive pve, broken pvp.You get shown all these amazing battles you can fight with massive armies and awesome castles you can siege. You will not see this ingame.In pvp: You will build a massive army and level them a bit only to see them destroyed in pvp by a single enemy dragon or wizard. A high level 60 dragon or wizard has the same army strenght as a fully deployed army but has many times the defense, attack and hp regeneration stats so your units will be hitting and shooting it in vain. The only way to counter is to recruit your own super monsters and you'll end up using just those.In pve: Sure you can use a massive army to siege a city and lose half of them in the progress. Or... get a dragon and/or wizard as said above and decimate the enemy castle as they cannot kill your dragon. Its easy to see which is the better option.This review will be voted as not helpful just as all the other negative reviews as the core players have been playing this game for years and are good friends with the mods/devs (who btw can and will abuse their power to restore units and ingame currency by just being nice to them) and are raging fan boys thats are just happy with 1v1 units fighting and thus destroying the idea behind this game.

												I would like to recommend this game. I really would. I cant. Like a lot of games it has a lot of potential. That is why I have followed it from the beta on and off. I would love a decent mmorts. The enthusiasm shown for it by the developers kept me checking in and believing everything would eventually turn out ok. Over three years after release and nearly a year on Steam. How is it now?One year anniversary email Oct 2012 ""After a disastrous beta and early release and severing ties with ex publisher 505 Games, our studio have finally gotten a chance to make Dawn of Fantasy the game we always wanted.""(edited for relevance/space) Apr 2013 email ""We have an ambitious plan to get rid of the last remaining issues by May 1st and so that we can switch to adding awesome new features.Here's a brief overview of the top problems we solved in the past couple of weeks    Server stability resolved - no more server downtime    Fixed lost progress, lost unit and army rollback issues    PvP, Siege and Coop does not Out of Sync or Disconnect    Fixed the quest, Co-Op and PvP victory problems    Started the UI redesign and replaced some fontsIf you left the game because you had any of the problems above, now is the time to come back and give Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars another go.""Looking at what is there right now it feels extremely buggy, poorly designed, implemented and unfinished. Losing units (mods will reimburse, with logs), crashing during battles (lose incurred on profile), lag during coop battles (rubberbanding), Syncing issues during pvp. Unit stances and behaviours not sticking, Unit commands not being followed. Very annoying voice spam messages and popups (deleting a voice file solved one, the mods responded they would look into the other) Resource system not working. I could go on and on.Its a real shame as the Homeland building aspects I really enjoy, enticing me to log back in and check on the little fellas regularly. The rest is, quite frankly, and I hate to say it, crap.The ui is poorly designed. It feels like it is trying to fight me on what I am trying to do at times. Not showing all my units when I select all peasants (I believe there is a cap of 18 units selected which does not help you find that one unit you want to garrison) Hiding units in single man stacks behind a wall with no way to find them in a timely manner as the onscreen indicators are poor, Elements of the ui requesting you to look at them (quest book and invite friend button thing) flashing repeatedly until I click recognition and then flashing again a few minutes later repeatedly. I read my goddam quests the first time! Gaahhhhhh! Its like a facebook game!You have a world map where the ""mmo"" takes place. This consists of a static map which is nice enough. You will never see another player on this map. This map is for you, To meet (fight) other players you move around declaring your looking for pvp and hoping that the area you are in has someone there. The system will tell you when a match is found. So its more like a lobby in the multiplayer sense. With an unnecessary visual element. The map for single player contains npc towns which you can visit(very rudimentary diplomacy), siege(coop or single) and visit for quests/selling/buying/trainging. It all just feels tacked on and has done since the beginning.I feel like I have been harsh in writing this but I feel it has had more than enough time to be in a decent playable state. Right now I feel nervous carrying out actions. I feel increasingly nervous the longer sieges go on in case of crash/loss. I fear sieges, not because of players but because of desyncing. I feel nervous upon logging in to find any units missing.The positives of the game are grossly overshadowed by the problems. Of note is the nice way of earning the currency (crowns) ingame. The initial period, base building in your home instance. The fact they kept my account and it was available to me from steam after a long absence. Friendly dev interaction,Despite all that I will probably still log in to check on my little homeland every now and then. Quickly mind you, before the immunity timer wears out.I will continually update the review as changes occur. I will happily change the recommendation if its deserving. In march apparently big changes are happening. We shall see. Unfortunately I have heard that many times before. "

												Been waiting for this game for a while, so glad to see it hit steam. Dawn of Fantasy combines classic Stronghold style RTS with Facebooks dull version of ""Kingdoms of Camelot"".If you like the Stronghold series or the Total War games you can slide in to this game with ease. Starting your kingdom takes a bit of time but compared to most other MMO's the learning curve is minor and you can get rolling pretty quickly, anything you need to know about the game will be answered in game by the VERY helpful community via the help chat tab. and the quikly responding support!bear in mind this game is new out and with surprisingly few bugs, patches and improvements are being made frequently and is rapidly flourishing in to an amazing game. It's totally free, I would 100% recommend this game,			"

												Now that I have almost 30 hours into the game, I feel like I can give a bottom-line up front review with the most important points of interest.PRO:Fun castle siege / medieval warfare game; has a nice old school feel to itCastle building mini sim? ...shoot... I felt like I had to have a #2CON:- Plagued by a crown system which stunts your rapid growth/gameplay unless you play real $ at an outrageous price- Once you have finished your ""introductory"" crown based protection system, you have to pay more real money or use all the crowns you saved for upgrades, if you don't want to PVP. If you want to Co-Op all of the time, don't buy this game at all. It just isn't for you.- No custom castle/wall/tower building--everything is pre-designated- Requires real $ to customize your city or hero (even if it is a small amount, they quarter and dollar you) and the customization is minimal at best- Peasants are morons- Enemy AI has as much intelligence as my Mr. Coffee- Units have a tendency to just up and disappear- More bugs than a Zerg SwarmBottomline:  The game is getting older and older and not getting any better. Kingdom Wars 2: Battle has come out and I doubt they will put any effort into this game at all. If you buy it, you're feeding the green money monster.			"

												I would definitely recommend you try Kingdom Wars  if you love a great medieval rts game. Build massive alliances and armies to conquer and control the world map by siege and vassal as well as coop and pvp options. You are able to choose from several different races and traits with the option to build cities in many different regions on the world map. The game community is very helpful with questions and resources until you are able to build a strong economy in your home city,  (the best game community I have had the pleasure of playing with). Although Kingdom Wars has a few minor bugs nothing major, the dedicated team of developers are always fast to respond to keep the game running smoothly. Thank you for the great game Reverie World Studios.			"

Am not much of quests person but they do provide some fun and PVP in game altough it was before bugy now plays fluently.

												Highly recommended for Human Race only, but i think it can work in any race if u use it carefully.How to make fast resources.Quick Tip for being a Human Race, in this game sometimes new players have hard time geting resources... a veteran friend teached me how to make gold fast and easy, Humans got the best defence in all the race that makes them good for fighting in balance and some formation to make them useful for certain enemies, a friend teach me that swordsman is the best melee units for human when you are a newbie or a starter, you can use this to your advantage, my friend teached me how swordsman can really be useful, 1st buy the technology in the blacksmith, in the armors and you can find the Mail Armor for swordsman to improve crush armor it will highly improve your swordmen's resistance to impact and crush armor it is important to unlock this upgrade,and you will need to train 16 units, just 16 ok you can only highlight 16 units at once to highlight them click the swordsman units in the top left corner then press Ctrl+1 to put them on Num. 1 , after you trained 16 swordsman, make an army in the world map, you will need at least lvl them to a nearby castle for example dagbor if in southmont, thorndale if in wold, and denwall if in rollingplain, lvl them at least 3-4 i will cost at least 2-3k gold after that you will need at least 600 gold, you need to go in the elven territory and make camp in any of the elven territory make a least a basic camp, then manage camp, and recruit units, then find the male warden, 1 warden is really useful you will just need 1 male warden.After you bought 1 male warden, you need to go to Bal Rattha and press find (the magnifying glass in the right side of your army HUD) in your army. Do not make a camp, thieves will slowly steal your money if u make a camp.WHen u lvl your swordsman you get at least 6-8 time to improve the skills of your swordsmen Improve the heal rate to 2 and improve all your resistance to impact to max.After that Highlight your army and your warden to num. 1 and num. 2, Go kill all the ogres and make your wardens loot the dead bodies of the ogres, (You have a chance to tame an Ogre) Male wardens got special abilities, they can instantly lot dead bodies, AND! Turn the resources to gold.A dead ogre has at least 100-700 meat that means, at least 1 dead ogre can make you get 100-700 gold (beware of the Ogre scouts, when u looted 1 ogre camp make sure, always guard your wardens because ogres camps have dead bodies and ogres can literally smash your wardens and watch out for Ogres scouts, 1 try can get you at least 15-25 k of gold at at least 16-20 ogres, if u try at least 9 times you can get 300k of gold and if u want to turn them to resources you will need market in your base and transfer the money you collected form ogres to your own base and turn them into some resources from the market.I think this will help you alot, but sometimes its boring but it can lvl your swordsmen fast, (At least 16 lvl for your troops in one try ), (Warning. Do not bring archers with your swordmen because almost all the time ogres targets archers and other ranged units). I hope I helped anyone thank you for reading all of that XD :D~peace			"

												Kingdom Wars is the first true MMORTS(that's massively multiplayer online real-time strategy) with a town/base that you build and doesn't disappear or reset after every match. Once you build your base, you build armies that are also PERSISTENT. So everytime you login, your base and armies are there from the last time you played and they're ready to battle.Each faction(humans, elves, orcs, +more to come...) are unique in every way. They gather resources(gold/food/wood/stone) differently. They have different units with different abilities and formations. They even have subfactions(3 subfactions per race) that make them even MORE unique by increasing/decreasing unit stats, economy, build times, etc.  Then you choose two traits from 5 or 6 options that further customize your experience with more stat boosts and whatnot.Once you've built a base, done a few quests, and trained a decent army you can either conquer the AI controlled cities(either solo or Coop with someone) or search for another player's army to fight or siege their town. The Player vs Player fights are matched up according to the strength of your army, which prevents powerful veterans from picking on new players(or vice versa depending on how good you are :D ).The best part is that anything can be earned by playing the game, except for a few items that are purely cosmetic and don't affect actual gameplay or mechanics.PROS:-Game Moderators are easily accessible and available for questions-Wizards, dragons, minotaurs, treants, hydras....that's right, HYDRAS!!-units level up and can be customized to your playstyle by spending skill points to increase health, stamina, attack, resistances, range, reload time, etc.-better than average graphics considering the size and scope of the game-massive battles with unlimited tactical possibilities where terrain, weather, and NPC patrols/camps are all factorsCONS:-some minor bugs/issues, but the developers have released more patches to address bugs in the past two weeks than in the past year, so they're committed to keeping the game running smoothly now that it's free to play.-high system requirements to run the game even on low settings-some parts are difficult to learn to play early on because tooltips and tutorials aren't very helpful, but the community of players and the moderators are great about helping outBasically, you have nothing to lose except maybe a little time and hard drive space. And if ya don't like it, delete it. But if you're like me(as you can see I've logged almost 400 hours in this game), you'll be playing it every chance you get! Also, if and when you see me online, add me as a friend and I'll send you a bunch of resources to help ya get started. My username in the game is ""Quintessential"". I'll even invite you to my alliance if you like.See ya on the battlefield!!			"

												This game may not look like a whole lot. but it offers more then what meets the eye. The overall ""LOOK"" of the game is a bland land scape with somewhat vibrant colors and dull textures. The part that gets me hooked is the gameplay and micro managing of the establishment you are trying to build and expand upon. This game has both a single player and multiplayer to it. It is suggested to start off with the muliplayer first so that way you can learn the game faster. If you like an RTS that is advanced but has a nice learning curve to it. Something that you can pick up and not get scared off. Then I highly suggest you give this one a try and don't let the looks fool you, theres a very thick under side that you should try to get through to.			"

												So i got this game, not exactly sure what it was. An MMO, RPG? Its an RTS, and a pretty well done one. The whole free-to-play is actually that, but they added a twist that i actually thought as something a whole lot better than the other ones out there that ""need energy to complete actions, come back tomorrow"". This has that ideal, but they did it in a way that keeps people entertained. You set some units to gather resources, and they gather small amounts over time, more units, more resources brought in. The best part though, is that you can constantly play, without having to check back up on your kingdom every few hours. You can create an army relatively quickly, and go out and fight (have not reached parts like that, just doing a quest to attack goblins at this point). This is when the RTS main fighting starts, though i should mention the home city is set up the same way, RTS style. This game is pretty fun, and i cant wait to either siege a castle, or get sieged. Im realy looking forward to the co-op battles.Just 5 hours in this game and i already love it, it has an excellent RTS-RPG mix, and i cant wait until i experience multiplayer. Plus this game is free, no need to buy things. Download it and try it, you have nothing to lose and a lot to gain. Being a WoW fan and playing as the orcs is extremely delightful too!			"

												Good game, for a little while. Replayability doesnt seem as good as many other games out there, and i wasnt able to find the quest lines enjoyable at all.The world isnt very interactiveable either, you cant take over other cities and make them part of your kingdom, when you battle a NPC city, and win, they just become your ally, giving you benefits such as recruiting a small number of units, trading and the likes..Game had potential, i wouldnt recommend to buy it for the full 18.99, but if its on sale (which it is often) its worth buying if you like RTS. It has some cool siege play, and basically on the siege front, it is everything that Stronghold 3 wasnt.			"

The units are cool the battles can change in the blink of a second and for a free to play game it is very fair with its crown system. Its a free to play game so all you people that have nothing to do and like strategy its made for you. A quick warning the recources take some time to get so imagine kind of like a world that keeps running with or without you gathering recources. Still a solid 8.5/10 if your reading this download it now. I mean right now get up download the game and come back when you have.

												Review of Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom WarsDawn Of fantasy, what a game it is, it was originally launched in October 1st, 2011, with so much excitement and a lot going for it, but was plagued by poor programming and bugs and rushed by the publisher, features promised but never delivered. Still we all had high hopes and knew there was something special there. So the Devs still apart of development that cared about the game and wanted to see it grow, ended up ended up taking care of it out of their own pocket over the past year and a half just worked mostly for free, using the what ever means, any current sales to invest into better servers or pay for outsourcing some fixes here and there and now they released a new version on steam with many new features and updates that fixed a ton of the game making it a lot better than its first official launch. In the end, The game is very addicting, I have 4 cities, and massive armies, sure theirs many issues and bugs and sometimes horrible path finding, and pvp doesn’t always work, yes there has been major crashes but only because the game has grown so fast, there was none of these issues before, but the community and gameplay is just so rewarding I can't stop.So glad I’m done with this review, Already 70hrs in and all I want is more! The Review easily could have been pages and pages with everything the game has to offer.Final Verdict A solid 8.0/10			"

												10/1/14I originally really got into this game, and really played it hard, wanted to advance, got really strategic about all of it, and now I threw my hands in the air and am tell it to go blow itself.First off the game is a patient one, some builds take hours to build, there is a lot of slow freaking traveling and sieging an area actually takes time and a lot of effort. You feel accomplished when you get it right and it is awesome. Absolutely awesome. But the game mechanics are atrocious.Pros: Rewarding, new-ish style, feels like you can explore a lot.Cons: -♥♥♥♥♥♥ game mechanics: Units randomly stop firing and run into battle without attacking. This happens with super expensive units and it sets you back literally hours. Spike traps are an instant (and invulnerable) kill for your units so while sieging the enemy you may lose 20% of it regardless of what you do.-Not intuitive building (for the elves)-Everything is slow, inaccurate, frustrating, expensive, unresponsive, and repetitiveAlthough I was expecting an Age of Empires-esk game, it delivered but in a C rated experience. This game has a lot of potential to be good, but it needs more polishing			"

See the details below.If you like doing only PVE you can dedicate your self to it wheter sieging NPC towns, clearing diferent map aereas from NPC, doing missions, you can get resources from PVE as well as from PVP.You are more of a PVP oriented player you can get resources as well from PVP, you can atack other Players Armys, Siege their towns.If you get atacked you can pay a little bribe to your oponent, and you will get under protection, and if you feel brave enougth, you can accept the challenge and fight your oponents army, wheter you win or lose you will get under protection so that no other player atack you again for a goo period of time.Protection system from PVP sieges and army on army battles, if you are under protection and you log off your protection resumes when you get back, the time counts for when you are online, and if you are offline no one can atack you.You can only play a few hours a day, a week?, Doesnt matter no one can atack you when you are offline, and you continue gattering resources while offline.

												Let me first state this for the record. This game, has great potential. It really does. The developers of this game really do care about this game.However with that being said, this game is a bug-glitch ridden mess that is holding hands along side a microtransaction system, That offers cosmetcs, and also ""preminum"" accounts, booster, etc. You name this game has it on the microtransaction side. This is not how you do microtransaction, btw. It's either one or the other, not both. Doing both may or may not work. In this case it doesn't work, in terms of concept and execution.They shove it right in your face the whole nine yards, ""Hey tell your friends about us!"". Yup, i mean all of our friends play videogames, i mean yeah ALL of our friends...... >.> not only that but this game randomly encourages you to do so, and also suggest to sign up, and god knows what else. Anything to get their game more attention and care, and also $$$$Since gathering resources might take awhile, and you might need the few extra crowns (which by the way can be obtained through quests, or *ding, ding* you guess it. BOOSTER PACKS! :D) expect to not be stocked up for a long while. But even then the proccess is really, really, slow. Unless you have upgrades and you communicate with the community.It just isn't the microtransaction system that is also plauging this game, but like what i previously stated before, this game is a bug-glitch ridden mess. The army's AI is chidlish, making illogical decisions that baffles you, plus the ""co-op"" system in this game is a complete joke, no lobby, but through a random selection of players or friends that, and oh by the way they must meet certain requirements in order for you to play with them. So if you are X, 1, 2 & 3 and your friends are, Y, 4,5,6 guess what? can't do it! Must be on the same page. But even then the game's cp-op system is still broken. the PVP has the same system, and runs just like the co-op system. You can tag team against players and what not.Now. How is the rest of the game? Well it's like Stronghold. You rule your own little ""territory"" in various landscapes, races, etc. All of which have their own set of skills, abilites, quest, etc. You can't customize your character, and if you want your character to have a name, must buy, buy, buy a renamer thingy in order to do it. In your terriotry, you see your land grow, however bewarn, upgrades require certain techs, large amount of resources may vary, and guess what? CROWNS! GLORIOUS CROWNS! :DAlso these ""VIP"" status buildings, and upgrades? They require an insane amount of supplies and CROWNS! so don't think getting to the top is going to fast and swift.You can create alliances, but it costs......CROWNS! :D as Buzz Lightyear would say: ""Crowns. Crowns, everywhere!"". You must be invited by the clan leader in order to become part of the alliance, yup kiddes you have to make a ton of friends in this game if you want to be apart of it on a larger scale. The tutorial does it's best, but honestly, if you played Stronghold, and a Total war game, then it shouldn't be a bother.Now, unlike a Bethesda Game Studio game (Oblivion, Skyrim, etc.) there are no radient quests, the quests are given to you, so don't expect it to be quite fun. And unlike a Total War game, there is no real panic with the peasntry and such. Which would've been nice to have in this game, as it gives players an incentive to think about their territory first.The lore is alright, i guess. For a medival game it does the job right.One more thing, if you don't have a good rig. expect big performance issues, and even if you lower down the settings, the game still has weird performance issues, etc.So in the end. Despite the patches, the issues are growing, and with this absurd and constant in your face ""give us promotion"" and also, buy, buy, buy! I recommend, NOT playing this game.			"

												Kingdom Wars is a fun packed game, Very Interresting, And easy to learn. First i would like to say how Kingdoms Wars is free, That just makes it such a better deal, For Everyone. I do like how there are multiple teams, Humans, Elves And Orcs. But that is not all, if you need you can even spend your money to get more and better stuff. Finally i would like to say i personal love this game. I have had this game since you had to pay for it, And now my friends can play and get it for free! That is all i have to say, Thanks For reading.			"

												It's mouse based gameplay; which I like. Feels like it's more 'strategic thinking' rather than 'who can remember which hotkeys to press the fastest.' It's like Age of Empires and Total War had a baby that was breastfed bongs and became the most chilled out, yet totally badass, medieval strategy RPG			"

												Love this game. But after playing it a while, the community even says the devs have left it. An update was announced over a year ago and never came? Supposedly. Idk,,, Anyway This game is beautiful. If you like RTS's and the ability to play with or against others, this is the game for you! Actually the second one is, but i havent been able to try it out yet  :( Feel free to gift it, ill love you long time jk lol. This has a different approach to an RTS that most mmorts games miss. Its not a chess board with people everywhere trying to kill you, take your town, start over, etc. This game has a little bit of an offensive Ai and defensive Ai camps, towns, castles, and armies. All the while you are able to pvp with other players. Repair your towns when your attacked. etc. This game allows you to build. Allows you to have fun at your own pace. BUT make sure you go through the tutorials for orc and elves. They have their own style of play.  Which is also very intreging. (sp?) Though in order to have a town in each faction you will need to unlock slots with real money (as far as i know only way) otherwise its start, erase, and start again to test them all out. Which isnt too bad seeing you dont have to wait 12hours for something to build...This game really makes me want to try the second one and i will once i can! :PFans of:Age of EmpiresEmpire Earth Starcraft You will love this. :)			"

												Kingdom Wars has the same concept and battle physics as Age of Empires which is one of my favorite games. But in this game you get to make a kingdom, though if you want to make another city you have to pay $2, thus it's trully an origional MMO. But there really isn't anything good to buy in the story other than buying city slots, skirmish mode which you don't need, the campaign, and a few custumizations. Other than that it's all up to you which is really nice. LOVE IT!!! 10/10			"

												Set in the fictional-mideival lands of Mythador, Kingdom Wars gives you a chance to play in a 3-D land with your kingdom.  Highly detailed maps offer an excellent gameplay experience, as well as a fantastic look into RTS style strategic gaming that took me in for hours of fun. I give this game a 9/10.  I've had a blast and will continue to in the future. Some things to be improved on are the graphics and animations because they were made a while ago, as well as the variety of bugs and glitches.

												Nowadays, it's quite hard to find a game that is a Massively Multiplayer Online Real-Time Strategy Genre and certainly as good as this game, Kingdom Wars is a saviour to a dying breed of MMORTS.Kingdom Wars certainly has a great Community that many games lack, in my eyes it also has a high chance of reviving this great Genre. I’d like to list all the negative things first:As this is a game still in Development, there would be much work to be done, as i am a Games Developer myself, i understand that creating a game and meeting everyone's expectations is not easy.Bugs are on the loose which can dishearten a fan of the game, however the Developers and Moderators are both working well together to clear them. (I believe the Development team should look more closely to fixing these before adding any new content.)Making sure that all NPCs that you can talk to etc… have a nice smooth crisp looking graphic design, as some do look pixelated rather than looking smooth with the rest of the NPCs. Now for the Positive:Hours of fun to be had when the bugs can be overlooked. Various races to be played (Orcs, Elves and Humans) You do also get the awesome Dwarven Armies you can build. Unique units, Kingdom Wars offers a variety of Unique Units that you can build to boost your armies’ strength and even rename them which gives you a more personal favourite feeling to your units.Quests are quite important within this game, it gets players activated as well as the PvP (Player Vs Player) and PvE (Player versus Environment) these would vary from easy to hard.Theres just so much that i could list that makes this an awesome game.

												This game is fun. Temporarily.First and foremost: It's NOT pay to win per sé. You can achieve all the things you want by just playing the game. Even the crowns (which are used for upgrades) can be bought via ingame gold.My reason for not playing the game anymore is: Walls are bugged. I really wanted to dig in and build a nice stronghold. But when my archers bug through the wall and stand IN it or below it ... that annoys me to some decent degree.Also the combat is kinda wonky and if you upgrade your archers to increase their range the AI wont even bother defending itself.Nonetheless the game is more like a browser-game and CAN kill some time. Serious fun is not a thing for me with this game.			"

												This game is great so far. Been playing for awhile and imagine Age of Empires with a dash of the Total War series and plenty of High Fantasy Setting with a large open world map complete with questing, offline major keep skirmishes, coop, pvp, and tons of utilities and realism like weather, seasons, faction traits, perks and even random events. If you're looking for an RTS that scratches both a persistent world MMO and an RTS to enjoy with friends, this is definitely it. I would say buy it now, its $4.99 and it's already paid for itself with entertainment value. Looking forward to cool new features and updates with this!			"

												Devs, this game really made me have goose bumps when I first heared of a browser like rts/fantasy/medieval game. Start working! Get the game shaped!I would enjoy it the same way as I did the first (monthly progress) time, although the goofy combat, and delayed movement of units fustrates me, I will still play it. If that major annoyance would be fixed/improved/ or get better solutions, I would pay again (but don't get cheesy). But PLEASE. F****** don't leave the game die as many good ones did! It's a waste of art. Obviously I won't even talk about many features it can have, such as more races,more tech, management, more opportunities, etc....Just do this one splat of lazy movement and sluggish and unresponsive combat. Improve it.( You might say: ""you can get used to it, it's not that bad""...but then why does it have to be bad? when it can be improved. <<Lazy mentallity I say!>>)This is where you want to stop? or end your limits?. As many other obstacles may be (which of course I'm not aware of, financially or whatever) just don't give up. Is it just me this game is still feeling unfinished? (And yes, I am aware it's out already, don't tease me)Otherwise, enjoy the game. It's fun. As it is. Untill another one pops out even cooler and better then this. It always has been like this.			"

												Ok....when i first saw the game...it came with a subscription...granted with its graphics...and cash shop, as well as...slow gameplay it didnt really work out. Strangely though, the game does offer a few unique things. Units Lvl Up, indefintely, making the difference between keeping a large army or small elite force obvious.Unit mantainence is harder.Multiplayer Sieges especially on big cities are extremely fun, on a huge scale.On a side note, the subscription is gone.Cons: Pathfinding(not sure since i havent played it since its new update)          Cash shop advantages(there are daily rewards though, you wont get the dragons. A player who can get their city to become an economic superpower can however convert gold to in game CASH at a steady rate i believe)New: Arcana Update : New Units(mages in general) , removal of buying cash(no more pay to win, but im not sure, i havent been on for a long time), Better pathfindingUpdate: Arcana(not tested) : Includes better pathfinding as well as new units with spells as a focusUpdate: Arcana seems to have added guilds, also there is an EMPIRE expansion coming up for free, which enables more COOP or single player empire building, you can now get up to 30 towns			"

												If you like RTS fantasy games then this is a great one to start with! You can play offline single player modes but the online version is so easy for new players. To begin with this game is NOT ""pay to win"" it never really was but in the past about 2% of players shelled out the extra cash for some better units. Now there is NO cash shop. Instead you earn an extra type of currency called crowns by doing PVP. You can literally spend the first 24 hours of in game time just building up your city and levelling up units WITHOUT worryinging about being attacked. Your 12 hour immunity to attack BEGINS when you decide to build walls and you can hold off on the walls for 12 hours so you have a nice army and city ready to give any attackers a run for their money. The game matches you based on army strength so even when you do finally decide to PVP you will not be getting owned by players with much stronger armies, this is not the D-Bag gank festival that other PVP oriented games tend to be. Even when you do lose you still get a few crowns and your heroes do not die permanently nor are your buildings destroyed beyond repair! I am Namaste in game if you have any questions! there is tons of helpful posts in the steam forums to help get you started. It is the sort of game you can take your time with and play at your own pace! Hope you love it as much as I do, it is a steal on sale as of the 22nd for a limited time at 5$			"

												Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars is an RTS with some ""unique"" features, it wraps up some RPG and MMO elements in an RTS shell, I have got to say Dawn of Fantasy is not a bad game really. it takes patience, lots of it and can be pretty time consuming (from my admittedly little experience). Dawn of Fantasy looks and feels pretty ""rough"" but dont let that completely put you off from the game if you find it interesting. You choose from one of three races, then from one of three starting zones, you choose your heroes gender, and then name your city. Afterwards it should drop you into your tutorial. After the tutorial your loosed upon the world to build your forces and manage your city. Other than that I dont know how else to describe the game. In the end, all I can say is, does it look interesting to you? if so go ahead and give it a try, its free now!			"

												I Wouldn't buy this game, Reason is when i did i had to buy 3 slots for building other towns. Now i have to say i didn't log in to much cause well with everyone i had a job and worked, going out with friend living the so call good life! One day i saw they made an update to the game which i was fine with evething updates or new stuff get added in. I also spent some money on a few other things which was not to much maybe 20- 30 dollors canadian. Anyways i get in and everything is whiped , my account is wiped, i had no citys or anything that i worked for or spent time on. Ok so i was confused i made my account again went in and ask one of there so called devs who was trying to refer me to send in proof i did  any of that and everything would be i guess restored but not my citys i beleive i would have to rebuild them and that but anything i payed for would be given back to me. Long story short i can't find any of these so that makes me other a lier or it ws a money grab and for those that don't log on everday! Right now i would say the game was good but way to low population and other mechenics of the game were annoying but vary still playable!my e-mail is Patrick_Robinson_11@hotmail.com for any devs of this game that want to contact me on this issue cause im confused on how you wiped someone who payed for stuff but you still wiped a player who payed for more slots and a few others stuff! is this a game a money Grab or was it an honest mistake time may never tell!

												The basic concept of the game is great, but the gameplay is very glichy. Units wont move sometimes and also maybe one of the biggest problems is DOF.exe has stopped working. One of the ways to play is in RTS mode but this mode crashes more times than not. Also pvp is very laggy at times. I like playing the game and have logged well over 100 hours trying to play this game. have spent money on it and overall am disappointed as I really like the idea behind the game.

												I have played this game a decent amount of time and i think you should get it. firstly it is a ftp game yes you may spend a couple of pounds/dollars in game but nearly every ftp does that , clash of clans for example gems KW crowns you should get this game before it goes global and is charging £15 or more because it is unique the graphics could be improved and the lag in big battles sorted out but every game has its pros and cons it truly is a hidden gem			"

												This game is pretty bad. The game has some neat idea's and concepts, but just fails to deliver even basic RTS mechanics that have been the standard for quite a while now. The controls are very poor and the response from units is very sluggish and half the time I tell them to do something they just plain don't do it or it takes the 5 seconds to actually start moving. None of the games mechanics are explained anywhere in the game and in a pvp game like this where you can be raided by other players this is a major fail by the developers.The quest system is also very poor at explaining what you need to do. A lot of the quest I did I had to fumble my way through as the directions aren't very clear and there's again no explanation on how it's done. The quest will say go trade with this settlement for X resource and that's it, but in order to do that you have to go to your world map fumble around for a way to create an army that can move to other cites then deal with poor user interfaces to select things and finally do a trade.The graphics are pretty lackluster as well, but I don't really hold that against a game as I focus more on gameplay.Combat is also a mess as you get large groups of units that are really one unit, but it has multiple small units that encompass it. These individual units can become spread out over a large distance sometimes which cause a lot of problems with organizing an army. Controlling units is some of the worst I've ever seen as there are no hotkeys for abilities or unit stances/formations and there is no quick way to know which units you have selected as again the UI is very poor and doesn't do a good job of clearly showing you what it needs to. You would think with all the units it would be cool in large battles to see them all fighting and stuff, but you would be wrong as they have no collision and will all stack up in small area's and at the same time they have collision with your units which makes them pathfind to where ever they want getting your units killed.Overall the game looks like and plays like it was designed for an iphone and it shows. The game is below average and I would say it's a 3/10 at best.			"

												Yeah, sure, it looks a bit derpy. Sure, the graphics aren't optimal. But this game has lots of things going for it. For one, it has excellent customer service, and it's not pay to win. The game overall is fun to play, if you like real-time tactics, albiet without unit collision it looks a bit like a derpy moshpit. The animation isn't optimal, but it's enough to enjoy the gameplay. The only real downside is that the game has such a dwindling community.			"

												Although the game could use a little polish, it's definetly worth trying out. Building massive armies, freedom to build and share you'r own maps and features. Helpful people always offering to give tips. decisive live strategy battles. laying waste to everything from small bandit camps to entire empires through massive seiges. The game is a bit finnicky and i have found a few bugs myself, but if  you are able of basic thought the game is easy to pick up but difficult to master. Including a lot of micromanaging and sort of planning economic success and quick decision making skills aren't required, but they are recommended. But all things can be learned in time. So on behalf of my word, try the game out, and i mean really try it. you can tell that alot of work was put into this game, and it deserves quite a bit of gratitude for it.			"

												This. Game. Is Amazing.  I always was intrigued by the mmorts, though i have never felt any of them got it right.  DoF on the other hand, feels like what i always wanted an mmorts to feel like:  An RTS where my city persists in a world with oither peoples cities. I bought the game solely because of the dev's participation in the community, and discovered that the game is really good.The content is really well thought out, especially the little things, like the types of units and their skills.  For example: archers have an 'enfillade' skill, which allows them to place spears  at their position.  Awesome.You can have multiple cities, so one could play as Man, Elf, and Orc, without being locked into a decision.Again, the little things, like the dialogue of the Orcs that really seem, well, orcish, and the Dialogue of the humans that have a real feudal feeling. The Devs also have listened to the player based, which is refreshing.  The players didnt want the cash shop: they removed it.  The players didnt like griefing:  they made pvp protection easier to obtain.  Another cool thing:  Your town can't get attacked if your offline.  Very cool.The community is really helpful too; Ive never seen a question in global chat go unanswered.I've always like real time strategies, and mmos, and DoF does a really good job of joining them.

												After playing this game and messing around on it for around an hour, I thought to myself that I wouldn't be playing it fo too much longer. However, I put a bit more time in to it and I intend to invest a lot more time into it now. Once your city develops and you learn more aspects of gameplay the game shines. The graphics aren't top notch, some issues here and there but overall, the gameplay is awesome and the customization of armies is brilliant. For £3.74, this is a steal. Also, the devs are good people! :D			"

												Despite what most are saying, the negative reviews are actually obsolete now, the development team and staff are only 5 people and they have managed to wrestle the graphics issues and such.they've also released their first free expansion with wizards and hydras.Also the P2W thing is kinda  off the beat, I got free units from the daily gift button which would be considered P2W, though the crowns are able to be earned in game by doing quests or even asking your alliance members.right now these guys need a huge help, I love the game...but it needs a more active community.Again most of the negative comments have been already adressed and if anything, this game is worth the price.I would highly recomend it for almost everyone who likes RTS's and MMO's. the graphics are a little bland and they are working on beutifying the game in a future update, but the seasons cycle, and the detail so far is quite good.P.S. I would also like to note that I got all three dragons through the quests, and the daily sales which is clientside, you can get them 50-75% off, so your quests can deal with it, though I will admit they aren't super powerful.

												There is the basis of a good game here, but the interface is just too difficult to fight through and the gameplay not quite deep enough to make it totally immersive.I think the designers have made some bad choices here and there, in that instead of improving on the UI and deepening the game they have gone for breadth and made more races, which, athough it adds replayability, doesn't improve playability.They have some great concepts, the PvP ""shield"" being one of them, but they haven't been able to get over the steep expectations a game player has these days in terms of interface and display.It is a shame, because I get the feeling that with a bit more investment this could have been a really strong game.It is free up to a point, so I recommend you give it a try, your opinion may differ to mine.  It may just be that my tolerance level is too low for this kind of thing.			"

												Its free, And for being free it has a alot of army style options, fairly interkit, similar to age of mythology or empires, its new, needs patches . but its really promising and again the army tactics and possibilities are amazing with Fun co op, really hoping this game keeps working for more co op abilities,As well as the pay to play element isn't really there, you can “buy crowns” or do a never ending quest loop to get crowns , and that isn't very hard to do. And isn't too grindy as you can try new things every attack and the quests rotates missions.If you going into this game accept their will be bugs but its fairly forgiving game but still really fun, with a feeling of long term progress. as well as this game i belive has a chance to be big on steam.

												Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom WarsHello! Let me start by saying this. I wanted a game that I could command large masses of troops to attack strongholds. After searching EVERYWHERE I found this. This game exactly fit my needs! Now I am going to let aside my desire for games like this for the rest of the review to keep it biased.Ive been playing this game for about 80 hours now and I fell in love! I only have one friend that plays this so we usually attack together. The game is way more fun with friends! Now on to the things I need to explain.First if you don't care for the tutorials provided at the main menu you WILL be lost completely! I rushed straight to the game and couldnt figure out anything. Please Please do them. Next the Global chat and Disscusion page are needed! The in-game help is very minimal and you will have a lot of questions. Next this game has a lot of bugs!Now a lot of people say this game sucks because it crashes all the time and has slow battles. Do not believe them all. I can run this game at lowest graphics 50fps on my 3gb ram 1.2ghz laptop! When fighting large masses of people it is true that the frame rate drops. For me prop to about 3 or 4fps, I dont really care though because it picks back up after a few seconds.  Now on to the pros and cons.Pros:1. Awesome Gameplay and Idea2. Great Potential3. Friendly Community 4. Great graphics as a whole5. Good money system6. Very complex and soooo much to do7. Long Coop and Solo campaign8. Good rewards for fighting especially PvP rewards9. You can do everything in the game for free!10. Devs that are on the forums helping people out all the time!Cons:1. Individual Model graphics (Mostly my fault for turning down quality from High to Very Low)2. Bugs3. Lack of tutorials and guides4. Not very easy for new players to begin (goes with con 3)5. On my bad laptop takes around 10 to get the game loaded to my city (Again my laptop is bad) Finally my over viewThis game has grown a top from ""Dawn of Fantasy"" with new updates and bug fixes. I really enjoy this game and wish it does good in the future. I can spend hours a day on this game seiging new cities and taking territory. You can also do online coop quests with random people is you feel like it. It is Massively multiplayer and PvP! I hope whoever is reading this decides to download it and give it a try! I mean its Free! Cant get much better than that! And that concludes this reiew! "

												Hey addicting game, especially if you are looking for a medival/fantasy twist on the classic strategy / RTS type game play. I love this game because it combined the resource gathering and dependent villagers/peasant workers from Age of Empires with a beautifully done epic medival warfare gameplay that is reminscent of those epic scenes from Lord of the Rings. Despite being a smaller title this game has a lot of potential in being a great play for anyone wanting to play a Co-op / Single player game laying siege and marching troops across the map.			"

												The bugs alone ruin this game, that's without the dated UI and poor AI.The most game breaking bug I found (and posted about) where you can buy a building and sell it for more over and over again. What does this mean? You don't need to accumulate resources, you simply puchase all your solders via trade and upgrade them to max level with gold. It is a simple number fix yet it has not been changed despite there being a few bug related patches. Either the devs don't listen or they just don't care (or both). "

												Unstable servers & numerous game breaking bugs. The pathfinding is TERRIBLE, one can completely avoid melee attacks by spaming movement orders, theres a trick to it. If you give an order to a unit to enter a castle when the gates are open it will pass through the gate even if the gate closes before it arrives. For some unknown reason, even on a quad core 4.2 ghz machine, when units need to find a path it will generate a terrible lagspike and eat your machine alive. Also sometimes they wipe all your characters and you have to start over.Sometimes you will simply not be able to log on for prolonged periods with no explanation.Often the game crashes to desktop.If it worked it would be more fun.

												Great game, considering its free to play, that's worth a try. There are some bugs and it does seem like it would be much better suited to an up front fee as the game feels a bit constricting even if you spend a fair bit on it, but as you can tell by my play time it was worth the download and i have tried both orcs and humans and seen elf gameplay and they are all very unique in style.A quick run down of what the races are like as the game doesn't give the best description of them:Orcs give a lot of freedom in building and rely on mostly melee troops and have poor defensive capabilties.Humans are very linear in building but have a good mix of all troop types and have good defensive capabilities.Elves (from what i have seen) are a good mid ground but are really to unique from the other two especially in economy as their buildings produce resources instead of gathering with workers like the others. They rely heavily on magic and ranged in combat.			"

												Great game, Its eal hard to find a game that hits all the aspects of what I want in a game. I understand their are still bugs that need to be worked out, but the progress made thus far are impressive and I can't wait to see what the game holds for the future. Recommendations: 1. Incorperate something to the alliance portion to make your own empire seem that more impressive. IE, more costumization pertaining to your clan. visual asspects that other players can see and say ""Yep, that alliance is awesome"", or ""How can we get that?2. Incorperate add on's to own castles. This will make each castle feel more of thier own deisgn and help players create more tatics for deffense. But make small add on's with a variety of dessions to work with. some you can earn and speacial ones only given by ether successfully defending your castle a certian number of times or completing certain missions. The sky is the limit3. I have a few more ideas but I would liketo if anyone responds to this. So I an't just wasting my time writing a bunch of ideas that no one looks at.Again, Awesome game and can't wait to see what u have instore next.			"

												This game is something with great potential.You get to build a town , build walls,collect resources, and other stuff in real time. You get a hero and some random people and use it to create an impregnable fortress, or an unstoppable army, or whatever. You get to choose between the usual fantasy lineup of humans, humans with long flowing hair and pointed ears (elves), and shrek fanboys (orcs). They each have unique structures and play styles and you go on adventure.That's all I got for the good now the badthey sort of lie about this being pay to win. Of course you don't have as much super BS in game currency. One thing you have is crowns but you  can get them from questing and stuff to build structures and research, and the build times are relatively short. But you have to pay SEVEN US dollars in order to have more than 1 town, you also have to pay to customize your hero in anyway. I get that these guys need money, but it would be nice to atleast have 1 more city free in order to test out other races without throwing all your work down the ugly thing they call a drain.Also they have a premium that tells you how many days you can use. I can't really advocate with bugs or glitches because the closest thing I got was this

												Online Empire Simulator, thats what i call the Genre, maybe you call it something else, but its been around for a long long time. Maybe you started in Tribal Wars/Travian, or noticed those Evony ads everywhere. I think my first was Astro Wars in 2002, (its still up) and countless more since then. For many people, the combat might of ruined the game for them, for almost all of these games use automated combat, you send an army and you win or lose.Some games of this genre tried to improve on that, offering tactical deph in way of army formations, eventually some games gave combat a manual mode, in turn based style; Heroes of Gaia and Forge of Empires for example. But we've all probably been waiting for a real RTS combat experience, and Kingdom Wars is the closest thing to getting it, and without walking for hours on an overworld.Naturally, merging these genres brings setbacks. Remember planetside 1? The first MMOFPS? Yeah, the actual gunplay sucked, but you played it because of the scale, you couldnt get that anywhere else, you put up with it. Kingdom Wars is in the same boat, stepping into new ground, the controls suffer for this and take getting used too. I dont view it as a MMORTS though, its an online empire simulator with RTS/RPG mechanics as its broken up into instances with icons to represent your army on the world map, a map shared by all players but in their own instance.Here's what you need to know you're getting into.You pick a race, then customize it by choosing a specific region, then two of five perks.Your town is persistant, you train workers to gather instead of upgrading mines. It CAN be attacked, but not while you're offline.When you make troops, they shouldnt stay in your town, thats when you enter the world map and create an army.The world map is full of NPC cities, these can be traded with, allied with, or dealt with. You cannot see other player cities or armies.There is a long story and quest chain, almost like its a single player campaign in an online game, you'll be doing quests but they can be done in co-op too.Your city is relatively safe compared to other games of this genre, chances of being attacked are low and you cannot be attacked while offline or otherwise unavailable.While your city persistently generates resources all the time, actively playing the game is very rewarding since there is no stamina system holding you back from playing it all day, it does great at blending the Idle and Active aspects of both genres.You cannot build extra cities like other Empire Simulators, you have a main city to grow, and other cities you conquer trickle rewards. You can unlock extra city slots in case you want to try other races or regions but these cities cannot interact.The F2P element is very generous too, starting with Protection peroids that only count down while you're online, having multiple and efficient means of farming premium currency, and restricting PvP to armies of similar Strength, so you wont be fighting an army of powerful premium units without an army of equal strength on your side, and even if you lose, you still get Crowns, so dont shy away from a fight!If you're just a RTS fan, this might not be for you, although there are unlockable Skirmish/Campaigns for solo play. But if you've ever enjoyed growing a persistant online empire then you have to check this out, I cant kill all the elves myself.			"

												""WE BEEEEEAAATT!!!""-Orc SlayerOn a more serious note, this game is very fun to play in a relaxed way. Combat is very micro managy (or it can be) which can be both a good thing and a bad thing. Although, I've found myself spending most of my time so far watching my hunters hunt while I wait for buildings to build. Still a very fun and in depth game. Pro's:+In depth and micro managable combat if you want to, click and swarm units if you don't want to micro.*+Fleshed out races with personalities. +Great soundtrack.+Fun animations and ai things to keep you entertained while things build.+Customizable city lay outs (for the orcs anyway, not sure about other races).+Good variety of units and upgrades.+Good PvP.+Very in depth lore that gives you a good feel for the world.Con's:-Buildings can take a very long time to build (as in a few hours real time).-Skirmish mode has to be bought. -Can be very dull at times.-Most of the quest dialog is text only, but there are still fun unit battlecries.-Graphics are about on par with Warcraft 3 (but then again, it's just as enjoyable). Overall, I recommend this game as a fun strategy game to play as a relaxing ""watch your city grow"" type of game. Especially now that it's only $4.99 USD. 8/10*EDIT: This has recently come to my attention (I didn't really get into much combat earlier and I'm just now really finding out about this): Unit AI. The unit AI is really buggy and they will randomly stop attacking, run the other way, attack things you didn't want them to, and are hard to control. I still recommend this game, but just be aware of this if you buy it (or downloard it I suppose since it's now free to play).			"

												Grand strategy game which heavily suffered from pathfinding issues, amongst other things. All these issues have now been solved, however. With the free Arcana Expansion released, now is the perfect time to grab the game.A persistent online RTS, or MMORTS even. There's been only few attempts at these over the past decade, and each has had it's own values. But Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars stands out from the few in the genre. In a good way, that is. This is a game of pure quality, you can experience the love the developers put into the game first hand. Apart from the issues which have haunted this game, the core gameplay is sheer fun. Building up your small settlement into a mighty fortress while managing your armies, sieging massive pre-made strongholds, or just going out on a looting trip, no challenge is ever the same.While I have not played the game in quite awhile, I do remember there to be an in-game shop using premium currency. Nothing essential, but plenty of things which cannot be obtained otherwise, including the mighty Dragons. I am, however, quite sure you were able to gain premium currency ingame, which becomes considerably easier the stronger your economy gets.Edit: The cash shop has been revamped. The currency can no longer be bought but only earned in-game. As such there are no longer microtransactions possible, removing any P2W brand the game could possibly have had. These devs are really responsive to the community and actually willing to change their model to such an extend. Kudos for that.			"

Yes i did refrence some oldschool games there but just giving an idea if you've never checked this game out before. I have found the CSR's in this game to be more helpful then any other game i've played thus far. Willing to go above and beyond in this game for others to help out.

												A compelling store, decent graphics, and even a fairly priced micro transaction store. Playing Elves in a RTS game is something I have always wanted and now we have it. You can also play humans, and orcs but why would you?In addition to the race you also can pick the realm/lands they live in which adds an additional level on to the complexity and variable traits to your race and settlement. I can't recommend this game enough after 15 hours in and many more to come. The only suggestion I would have for the game developer and publisher would be to automatically give the user more ""city slots"" so I can try additional races without needing to delete my original city or purchase the slot that I may not use if the other races aren’t fun to me.Please try this game, for the cost of nothing you really can't go wrong. Also check out the sequel which is wonderful and cleans up some small issues I have in the original. "

												previously wrote a bad review early december.Because - I was one of those who lost everything, account wiped clean.. after 200+ hours of gameplay and a few hundred dollars in 2013.Sent an email to support@reverieworld.com 7th december 2015. Turns out that my email ended up in their spam-filter.. x) ... ok, fair enough I guess, small indie company - in a busy time as well.But once the support did find out, namely the moderator Zane, in a matter of a few hours of personal support with the tools he had available I was up to close to where I was after 200+ hours of gameplay and a few hundred dollars.. since I did get a little bit of some of the stuff that wasn't even out back in 2013. (In exchange for some of all of the now kinda obsolete dragons I bought.. I guess you could say, since you can only have one of each now in an army.)So that's honestly some of the best support I've gotten from the game industry.. (if not the best, looking past the fact that the spam filter caught my email :P )  With that said, I think I can honestly say they do care about this game even after so many years and it going free to play... speaking about free to play, it does actually look like you can get everything for free it just takes a bit more time to build your stuff and level up - but only in the beginning when you build your city :)			"

												Kingdom wars is actually a pretty nice RTS, and while the MMO aspect doesnt have all that much yet (its mainly just PvP against other players or working with them to take NPC cities, alliances also dont do much yet) from an RTS standpoint i would say its pretty fun. The game takes a while for you to start up, and its certainly not the kind of game you'll ""finish"" in a week or so. Units actually matter as resources take time to collect and when most units die they are permanently gone (exceptions to that include the starting ""Hero"" unit and special units like wizards and dragons that simply lose levels upon death) Speaking of levels, as your units kill enemies they will gain levels, these can be used from simply increasing max HP to extending an archer units sight/amount of arrows. The units that you level over time actually matter as they will be the most powerful units in your army and form the backbone of your fighting force. Tt feels like battles actually mean somthing in this game, win or lose you will be affected. Currently there are only three races in the game, Humans, orcs, and elves, but talk of adding an undead or dwarvern faction is being discussed. I would say if you are into strategy games you should at the very least give this game a try.			"

												Well I have been keeping my eye on this game and been waiting for the developers to make some changes before I bought it. there is no more in game shop where its a pay to when with cash. I am happy about that. This is the only MMORTS game I could find that is actually 3d with micro managing. I did end up buying it due to the sale of 4.99$. my first thoughts where I wish the graphics were better but when I got a feel how the mechanics of the game works i lost interest ing the graphics and found it has allot of in depth stragety with city managment to build a strong economy. I suggest players to pay attention to the in game quests and everything will come together. I dont have much more to say being I only have been playing for a few hours but so far I am happy. if you go to the community page you will see the developers are very active and doing there best to get this game to last by listening to the players.

												So here I am 128 hours of gameplay in my first week of Kingdom Wars... The time I have spent on this game alone should speak for my overwhelming reccomendation of this game. What I still can't believe is that this game truely is Free To Play, and NOT Pay To Win. Anybody can pick up this game without spending a cent and find themselves ruling the battlefield. All it takes is a little knowledge of the economics of the game, and some good old fashion battle Skillz. This review will hopefully outline some of the awesome features included in this game, all so you, the reader, can finally jump into Kingdom Wars and finally expierence the MMORTS that is Kingdom Wars for yourself!First off, a look at the battles! What can I say except that they are truely an epic experience. The game includes battle matchmaking service that ensures you aren't being attacked, or can attack, other players outside of your own Army size and expierence. This ensures that veteran players can't simply prey on the weak newbies to the game. This is awesome as it ensures players don't often shy away from battles, and continually work on their own strategies and skills through first hand expierence. When you finally dawn that Army backed up with a royal dragon, and march to the front gates of an enemy, I guarentee your heart will skip a beat as they fly in wreaking burning havoc on the field.In addition to the gratification you will get from some PvP battle, there are countless PvE battles awaiting you in this game. The map is filled with other PvE castles and towns that are available to attack. In addition, after winning any of these battles you will have the option to loot them for Crowns, OR make them your own vassal, increasing your resource collection rate, and allowing you to recruit troops outside your own race.For those looking for a solid economic simulation, rest assured, you can find that in Kingdom Wars. A lot of the micromanaging has been eliminated from the simulation mode by adding the ability to select your workers and assign them tasks from their menu bar. This works GREAT in battle especially, as when fires break out during a seige you can simply click on the peasant and assign them to fire fighting, and off they go douse the flame preventing further damage. For those that enjoy the micro managing part of this, you can still individually click on your workers and send them to specific duties still. Workers duties don't just stop at your city. You can also establish work camps throughout your region, filling them with workers assigned to tasks on the map, such as wood cutting, gold mining, ore mining, and farming. Managing these camps is even simpler, all it requires is some simple clicking through an economics screen that lets you add workers or subtract them to tasks. This tool is also used at cities that have become your vassal, but in addition, have the ability to setup trade routes to other cities, further expanding your resource gathering.My favorite part so far with the game has actually been the fact I started playing prior to Halloween and was pleasantly surprised to see that the game gets so much developer attention they released a Halloween package that included an ""Eternal Night"" for the holiday. I could truely go on and on about the many features this game includes, but every minute I spend typing this review I feel my anxiety increasing from being away from my own game. That all being said it should be mentioned that there are some minor issues with the game still. On a couple occassions it has froze while loading a PvP battle, and I have found some resources missing a time or two. However, their is nearly always an Moderator or Developer on whom is ready to issist and remedy these issues. I am stunned by how much the developer team cares to ensure a solid game play expierence. In addition, it doesn't matter if you have purchased premium content or not, the DEV team still give you amazing service in navigating a small hiccup here or there. Plus, with nearly daily updates to the game, these small problems are quickly dissapearing. After playing a dozen or so ""Free To Play"" games and always being dissapointed in how much an advantage players who purchased premium content would have over others, I am simply in bliss finally finding a game where the broke the college student could come on and have an enjoyable escape without forking over their tuition money in order to do so...

												Hi, I am a new player to this game and I love it and would recommend it to anyone. It is a fun online game with a great story. If you like Lord of the Rings you will love this game, it has taken great aspects of the triology and has put a good story to it. I myself am a big fan of Age of Empires so I really like the game as the combat is even better that it.Another great aspect of the game is it PvP ( in a similar to clash of clans) but instead of being raided all the time. You can only be attacked while your online. And it's not just attacking their defenses like Clash of Clans but you have to fight their army like in Age of Empires.Thank you for not making it a pay to win game, those are just annoying.It is an amazing game and I would recommend it to anyone.

												It’s a great RTS game with some good Ideas…..but that is all it got, good ideas.The game suffers from bugs which really ruin the game experience, it's badly optimized, the UI is horribly designed – everything is really small and it's hard to find what you need when using it and the siege…..to say badly implemented is an understatement.The devs released a 2ed game so I guess this one was abandoned so I don’t even expect the game to be fixed at all….I would really like to recommend it but only if it would ever be fixed…..

Everything in this game can be obtained without have to buy anything, Even then special units can still be taken out with regular foot soldiers. The balance of this game is great between the 3 races so no one is at any great disadvantage making this a true game of stratagy. The customer support is very helpful and profesional as well and has helped me out a great deal. Even the online MODs are a great help with a good comunity to boot.			"

There are some issues, but they are getting fixed on daily basis and all bugs are addressed as soon as possible.Any RTS lover who's interested in MMO based strategy will love it. For those not interested in MP, there is also single player component.			"

Product received for free
												So I started this game with no real expectations. It looked lke your standard Battle for Middle Earth/Civillization knockoff game, with none of the interesting storytelling, and all of the grind. It plays well enough, with no truly devastating glitches that I know of yet, but there was one thing that made me stop playing. Before I get to that thing, let me explain some of the pros and cons of the game: As I've said before, it's like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mix between LOTR: Battle for Middle Earth and Civilization, with both Real Time Strategy elements and that good old fashioned resource management component to give it a realistic hue. You kind of get tossed into the game with no proper training, and the beginning of the game, as a result, can be a pain in the ♥♥♥. Thankfully, you get an awesome amount of Battle Protection, which keep the PVP hawks off of you until you can set up a decent and defensible foundation. There are four main resources: wood, food, stone, and gold, and a fifth pseudo-resource called Influence, or Crowns. Crowns are not important when you're getting your basics down for your town, but later on, they will become a very valuable resource that will become frustrating for you to acquire, since they mostly are acquired via quests of PVP. Luckily, however, you can convert gold to crowns, and if you're good at resource management, then it shouldn't be too much of a pain in the ♥♥♥ to handle. Getting the controls down isn't exactly a synch, but it isn't impossible to nag down, if you're experienced with RTS games. The game's story are lore are unimaginative and yawn inducing, with the generic, Tolkien esque knockoff vibes stemming from the three main factions: The Humans, the Elves, and the Orcs/Goblins. The dialogue is badly written, with some of the texts even bleeding off the boxes they are cramped into. The way the dialogue is written, it feels like the writers are trying to copy off ye olde engrish ways of writing, where every word and sentence is a headache to put together and understand in your head. Even if you do manage to finish translating the drek, it's all this very generic lore, with the elves and their nature and magic, the orcs with their war and tribal mentality, and the humans with their... Human ♥♥♥♥, I guess... There's obvious betrayals, with obvious setups for war and bloodshed, and the whole campaign is just there for filler, so the antisocial ♥♥♥♥s can feel like they're playing the game while the PVP nuts hash it out with each other. Now I'll admit it: the gameplay is riddled with dozens of little gems that made me keep wanting to play the game. You had a versatile unit structure (at least with the humans), that allowed for different approaches to siege and warfare. You can fight to defend your stronghold, you can fight to siee someone else's stronghold, and you can just get your army out on a field and hash another army's brains out for all you care. It's a nice, versatile game structure that allows for a lot of possibility. The problems crop up when it comes to controls and the AI itself, and this is where the story of why I stopped playing begins:I was set up as the Human faction, with a nice little stronghold on a hill in the mountains. I had set up everything I needed and didn't need, including a few mercenary workers from both the orc and dwarven lands to work in my mines when I needed them to. I had my peasants fully upgraded and able to handle and gather any resource I needed within minutes. I had an army with knights, mounted knights, cavaliers, and archers, all battle hardened and toughened up wth the scars and calluses from the many grind battles I did on account of Sir Lentoth. I had several dozen catapults primed and ready for a siege, with enough stone to last me several hours, if need be, and both my archers and catapults had the flame upgrade to give me a boost when I had to inevitably shoot the enemies down within their own walls. I was ready for my first major siege, and I was admittedly kind of pumped.I scouted the elven regions, looking for the smallest city to start on. I knew I wasn't ready for the big times yet, and that I needed to start small, so I didn't bite off more than I could chew. I picked out some ♥♥♥♥ery named city att eh top hand corncer of the closest elven region with the ""Very Easy"" tag written into the description. I said, ""♥♥♥♥ it, why not?"" and sent my army there. I started the siege, and found myself doing pretty well, going back and forth with my archers to and from the stronghold, taking out as many as they could before they died, bringing them back, and using my knights and hero to heal them up, and prime them for the next wave. The enemy reserve timer hits zero, their reinforcements come, and at the cost of all of my melee units, I take out the calvary they sent after me. I had 20 archers, my hero, and 9 catapults after that wave. I managed to take out the city's archers, and were using my archers to take out as many within the wall before my catapults took down the gateway. I had my hero healing them up as best as he knew how, and the process still worked, until I finally cracked through the walls. I expected to lose quite a few men once the walls came down, my archers could only reach so far, within the city, after all, and there were plenty of melee units left that were capable of taking me down if I wasn't careful. Problem is, I was careful. I knew my strengths and knew my weaknesses, and I used that to my advantage. I brought my archers in and used them to slaughter all but a few of the units in the city. At that point I decided to make a retreat to reheal and regather my strength. But there was a glitch in the game, a minor flaw concerning the AI. I had 20 archer units, mind you, and I had taken out all of the units, save for a few stragglers that were on their own. Nevertheless, I needed to heal, because something was off with the archers' targeting. My hero wasn't doing any killing, and ended up getting himself killed right at the gate. My archers were killing most of the enemy units, save for a lone mounted unit that they just couldn't hit. Let me reiterate, the archers were firing at the horseman, and were hitting him, but he wasn't taking any damage. He was the enemy that followed my units back to camp as they retreated, I tried firing, repositioning, and refiring once again, but this guy simply would not ♥♥♥♥ing die. His comerades died, the rest of his unit apparently died too, but he wouldn't ♥♥♥♥ing die, and wouldn't even get a scratch on him, regardless of the fact that I had 20 archers with flame arrows attacking him. He eneded up following my guys back to camps, killing them one by one, It was then thhat I realized that because of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I couldn't get into the city for long enough to win the battle, so I withdrew and sent my army home. Maybe there was a technicality here, maybe the unit was a special one, he did have the ""Mounted Grandmaster"" title on him, after all. But that technicality cost me a battle,cost me my resources, and cost me my energy and time. I'm officially done with this ♥♥♥♥ing game, and I can't stand to see it on my desktop anymore. The minor glitches I could handle. the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ storytelling and grindy nature I could tolerate. The painstakingly slow travel speeds of the armies across the continent I could tolerate while reading a book or setting up my town some more. But this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, this glitchy, unpredictable ♥♥♥♥over was the straw that broke the camel's back. It's a free game, it's a 3D game, and it's playable until you start to do something important. So waste your time here if you want, I'm ♥♥♥♥ing done with this ♥♥♥♥.  "

												This game as a Free Play was great up until my Battle Protection ran out. Then no later than one hour out of player protection I was attacked by a very ""STACKED"" player, very POOR POOR Player vs Player balancing. Although I had played 20 hours, had a very decent sized army and defensive town (with stone walls) I was easily defeated by the attacker. My units were Level 10 to Lv 7 on average. All of the attacker units were Lv 20 that I could see. I had just built a Wizards tower and it would take another 120 crowns to build a Wizard, he already had one and it was fully leveled. I was not playing passsively, I played for a longtime building my base, fortifyinh it and building very decent army. Even so; as soon as Battle Protecttion ended I was crushed.I would not suggest anyone play this game unless you look for disapointment. I would relate this game to any other Facebook or CRAP Online game that requires a Pay to WIN requirement to pull ahead. If you wish to be attacked by Sadists who have money to burn on this game help yourself.20 hours in I was hugely dissapointed,had I been able to progress without Player vs Player it would have been just as enjoyable....however I got the EFFIN CRAP beat out of me by a guy ""vastly"" out leveling me and 10 times my strength. It's really not a matter of ""he did it better"" it's a matter of allowing players vastly stronger to attack and crush any other player starting out no matter how strong he is. It took me sometime to get some of my units to level 11 but as I said he had units all at Lv20. I was smart enough to go out the backside of castle with two Level 10 Mounted Knight units and flanked his Wizard and supply trains. I took out all of his supply trains and pounded on the Wizard for 5 minutes of game time and NO DAMAGE to the wizard. Not point of dmage done to the wizard. In the meantime his wizard cast lightning bolts at my castle defenders and basically took out 50% of my troops al by himself.If there is any game balance there you tell me.The game was somewhat fun up until that attack. I stopped playing not because I'm a sore loser but because if any player 10 times your strength can come in and hammer you then there is just no getting ahead.			"

												Well, I must say, when I started to play I thought it was not that good because I believe it lacks a tutorial and so when you start you start to get confused on how to play but just go to the top right and there should be a help menu, that helped me do some things but this game does not allow you to place buildings, which kinda sucks you cant custimize your city layout.     But it does get pretty fun when you start to understand it and get troops to attack. Thats pretty fun. I think it is very stragetic. Its not a bad game,But don't plan on customizing your hero and he wears some pretty basic armor, your town, well good luck it looks like a village for a while and i believe you can buy crowns to speed up building progress.     If you ever played clash of clans on tablet, its like that but with more cons then clash but its pros are pretty strong where you can control what your troops do but lack building placement, (does this mean that all our towns look the same)      Well this is a positive review cause i still find it somewhat fun, but give it a try if you think your into games like these.p.s. never send 3 squadron of troops into a army triple the size. they never come out alive.

												This game is a unique sort among the strat MMO's. Its tough at first starting out (for humans that is, I am not a fan of Orc or Elven playstyle) but once you get a decent setup the game becomes fairly easy if you can invest time into your economy first before rushing off to pvp and siege.Pvp however is fairly unbalanced as all the high levels who use their near unkillable lvl 60 hero's and dragons to terrorize lesser players. Though my sound advice for dealing with small minotaur forces and Hero's is massed Crossbows for the humans. Works like a charm.While there is an ingame micro transaction thing its completely option for customizables, and several booster packs that can only be bought once per city slot, I think this is a fair system compared to other games like battle pirates where its forcing you to constantly spend to stay up to date.The factions play very differently from one another, Humans play like most fuedal and medieval armies with a large portion of their troops (or as my suggestion goes for) A lot of Halbardier and Archer battalions as they are the cheapest to upgrade at the local training yard, Human siege is rather inaccurate and I would suggest for those dedicated siege armies to bring along 5-10 Treb's or 8 Dwarvern cannons if you have the crowns for them.I overall give the game a 6.5/10 for soild gameplay, friendly community, nice enough looking graphics.Though there are quite a few bugs overall besides the occassional resource loss or other minor incident I would recomend this game to my friends.

												I am not some expert in giving a review, but this game is good and very good. I feel so happy about this game, remind's me on Age of Empires and it is similiar with Total War series.Pros:+Good graphic+Base builder. Can build very big city and expand futher.+Three faction's: Human's, Orc's and Elves. Every faction have it's own way in development (I tried only Human's).+Can support/build massive armies.+Battles+Game is based on single player and multiplayer. You can open world map end see that meny stuff is based on      singleplayer, but if you bild an army, go to an empty field, then will apear PvP mode witch allows you to ""forge"" battles with other player's. Also, you can join or create alliance.Cons:-Too many time waiting for resources, building structures and marching amry.-Zoom level is limited.-Some bugs (games crashes some times). "

The market is well done and the special units are not out of reach of the casual player with a reasonable investment of effort.			"

												There are currently three races to choose from, the empire/town emulation is fazed out quite quickly as you discover a drawn out grind fest to level a single army and any heroes you earn or buy. You can earn heroes and elite units buy generating gold and buying premium crowns or simply buying them with money, you will end up with a single army with a hero or two and several camps generating gold. The PvP will only include a hero setting fires to kill your non elite units and a hero that can solo any regular elite units, you will only have the option to counter a certain hero or just ending up co oping PvE sieges to gain crowns faster. I recommend simply clearing your home town map of quests and enemies then upgrading your resource gathering tools and start trading off extra resources you do not end up using on 2nd/3rd tier units. You want any upgrades that increase your gold income and you want to travel to neighboring towns and find which resource they pay for the most and setting up a camp nearby with that said resource. After you have three maxed camps set up generating resources set up another of all storage traveling units to trade and a single army of 25 2nd/3rd tier tanks, 25 2nd/3rd tier ranged DPS and either 9 town workers to gather resources off dead bodies or 5 of them and 4 storage traveling units. The last slot will be for either your starting hero or a crown bought one, leave your army out of your hometown so no one will attack it but if they do make sure to either have a single hero there or walls with long ranged dps mounts. Gold is key. Support is weak as they run with a small team so wiki and check forums for any issues or wait for the newest Empire Expansion to come out.			"

												Real-time strategy is a genre enjoyed by most gamers. there are two distinct ways to play an RTS: online in a single game against opponents or offline against computer generated enemies. Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars is the first and ,as of writing this review, only 3D massively-multipleyer-online real-time-strategy game. At first glance, it seems as though these two characterizations could in no way combine together to form a fluent game that's fun to play. Dawn of Fantasy does this almost perfectly. The game takes place in a mideival era with elements inspired by fantasy. The game takes a healthy dose of inspiration from titles such as Age of Empires and Strongholds Legends while still remaining origional and unique. DoF is easy to pick up and play if you are experienced in the RTS genre, but can be challenging if this is your first strategy game. What makes the game unique is that it is in a persistent world that keeps on going even after you log off. while this may sound like a bad thing to you, it truly isn't. While you are away, you can't be attacked by other players and production of any units or construction of any building will not be halted. DoF manages itself well so you don't have to worry while you are away. The game's player-versus-player isn't overpowered either: you won't have to worry about being attacked by players with armies that could overthrow a galactic empire. Instead, you will only be faced against armies that match your own army with a slight 10% deviation. You also won't be attacked by anyone until you construct walls around your city, which isn't mandatory to continue playing the game but not having walls means that you can't play co-operatively with your friends.As soon as you do construct walls though, the game really gets into the most fun parts. As well as being attacked by enemies, you can team up with your friends and wage war against players and NPC's alike. With a game this amazing, you'd think that it would use microtransactions so players could pay-to-win. That is not the case in Kingdom Wars. As of January 10th, 2014 buying your way to victory with in-game currency has been disabled: meaning that the only way you can make money in the game is (Plot Twist!) to play it! I picked up this game for five dollars, but i'd gladly pay the full price for this game! "

												This game has become one of my favorites, and strongly suggest you to try it. It is free-to-playy, with a new and different free-to-play model. I wont tell any details, im sure you can find some. This game perfectly mixes fantasy and RTS with leveling of heroes and even the grunts can be upgraded. You have your basic grunts, y'kno, Swordsman, Pikemen, and Archers. Also, there are like 26 villages you can siege that vary in difficulty, and each has a different description and race, depending on the region. This game also allows you to PVP, and Co-Op NPC sieges. The resources are different and each race has a different strength when it comes to econ. I suggest you try it and if you dont like it, leave it a review.			"

												I'm a huge fan of strategy games, I've played aoe, empire earth, total war, bfme, stronghold, anno 2070, imperium, civilization, might and magic, spellforce,kohan,tzar etc. But Kingdom wars has its own unique concept. You have a castle in a campaing map, you can develop it just as you would do in a strategy browser game, all the changes you do remain. But with you armies you can assault npc castles with other players, you can fight against other players armies or you can assault other players castles, and all in rts battles! So you have a mix of a Stronghold castle building(permanent) combined with castle sieges and pvp battles.  The game has its flaws and some bugs but the community is really close to the players and they are still launching updates to improve the game vastly.

(a bit boring sometimes tho)Command a huge army!Or a MEGA Economy :P(Up to you)Gameplay BORES me to death most of the time...but attacking someone,something,etc has a fair share of good times aswell!

												Not bad for a free game. I feel like the items they do charge for (all of which are cosmetic) are over priced for many of them however it is early on. The game itself has the problem most MMO RTS have of slow resource gathering but unlike a lot of mmos the buildings themselves build fairly quickly. A BIG thing I have to give this game credit for is they did something I've never seen. MMO 'strategy' games frequently give a grace period (usually 24 hours) that you can't be attacked during. However the counter continues to count down even when you're not logged in. In Kingdom Wars the counter only goes down when you're LOGGED IN! Meaning if you need to take a break and let things farm in the background you can sign off and come back later without loosing that starting protection.			"

												The pace is slow, can't deny that. And the learning curve could be bypassed a tad more by providing longer resource-boosts throughout the beginning stages for newbies. God forbid they build 69 houses and wonder why they're broke. A more in-depth tutorial wouldn't hurt, either - but then again a good portion of players skip it with a yolo mindset. Their towns don't last long.Anyhow, The graphics are fair, even on the Maximum setting(s). The mechanics (movement) is somewhat clunky, and it takes a good bit for your soldiers/army to realize they've walked past the enemy. A few key commands take a while to register at times, but it could be server lag(?)Resource accusition isn't unbearably slow, but it's nothing to hold your breath over; it's definitely a long term game.This is more or less what the browser-based-strategy MMO gamers wanted, BUT IN 3D!Overall, this game has DEFINITE potential to become something great. 6/10 for now. Will continue to expand.			"

												If you liked playing ""Game of War"" or any of the Kabam style facebook and tablet games you will get a kick out of what they are attempting to do ""Scale""wise with this game.  Don't worry, they took the ""Pay to Win"" element out of the game that you read other people whinge about in the comments. The ""Crowns"" are a hinderance here and the fact that the monetisation was on this currency that was required for building and upgrading most things was an insane choice.

												Kingdom wars is a decent game if you want to spend a lot of time building up a small village and slowly building it up more and more as time go on, to be honest I like it I havent found any game similar to it and of course there is also ingame store which I guess kinda breaks the pvp but if you want to just play by yourself build an army and take over cities even if you rip out your own hair doing it I would recommend buying it.PVP side I wouldn't recommanded it since it has ingame store which breaks it people can buy a chest and become a pain in the ♥♥♥ more or less right away it boost people up since you need a resource called crowns which you get from quest and other means but also you can get a lot by doing ingame purchases.

												I personally enjoy this game a great deal.  It reminds me of Strong Hold, Age of Empires, and Total War all wrapped up into one; taking certain elements from each and using them to the in such a unique way that it is niether a copy of the games, nor is it a jumbled mess of all those favorite elements from those games.  The mechanics of the game are not at all difficult to learn, especially if you have experience in any of those games that I have listed above.One of the best features, and the one that I most enjoy, is that the initial starting protection does not expire while you are offline.  So someone like me who has to spend 9+ hours a day working is not penalized for that.  The game also allows me to move at my own pace throughout the game; let me choose to explore, raid local areas, siege towns, and then pick up right where I left off.Even though I could continue on with game place itself, I want to take a moment to say that this game does not run hard on my computer.  I have maxed out the settings and it still moves flawlessly.  As a whole, the graphics are not top of the line, but they are naught bad either.I do not recommend many things, but when I do, it means that there is something decent about it.  I suggest that you give this game a try.			"

												Kingdom Wars, previously known as Dawn of Fantasy, is a controversial game.On the one hand, it offers some unique features well-made and set on a balanced way for the player to enjoy, when you could be expecting grinding. Despite being a FPS (free to play game) and, surprisingly, it offers very few advantages for players who decide to spend their money on it. Namely, you can buy singleplayer, a handful of skins for buildings, banners and heroes, some treasures (basically a 1 push economic boost that will give you a lot of resources) and the premium mode, that gives you better drops of Wealth (an ingame resource that is obtained through fighting), being only the premium mode timed. Excluding the treasures and the premium mode, everything else put together doesn't reach 5€ euros. One of the most non-greedy FPS MMOs I've seen in my gaming life.Gameplay wise, it has its ups and downs. The player freedom is absolute and there are no restrictions to what you may or may not do, at all. There are 2 stances in the game: PvE (Player vs Environment, the AI) and PvP (Player vs Player). Each player has his own game bubble and therefore is own environment, allowing him to fully refuse any player interaction and stick to the questline (which works as a tutorial and introduces you to open field and siege battles to prepare you for multiplayer, as well as offering a grinding option to obtain crowns and loot. Completely skipable but enjoyable). Each player bubble is connected to the rest through the server. In order for 2 players to fight, one of them must select the PvP option always available, and a search engine will find you the nearest fair opponent. The term ""fair"" refers to a strenght value that every army has got attached, avoiding this way imbalanced fights in terms of army size and quality. You may also choose to play cooperative the same way to take over a town, defeat the AI or complete a quest.As every MMO, there's a grinding component: obtaining Wealth. This is the most precious resource in the game that will allow you to upgrade buildings, recruit heroes and some other functions. However, you're free to choose your own way. You may earn as much gold as you can and trade it for Wealth. Raiding the countryside, taking over AI cities, player cities, armies, quests, unlocking achievements. Your own path and style all along.The looting, construction and squad/formation system, as well as the training and siege mechanics are very peculiar and enjoyable, actually making you feel like you're fighting in the harsh mediaval age and adding a very important and heavy strategy factor. There's a wide variet of units and strategies for each one of the 3 races (Humans, orcs and elfs), being the player able to hire troops from other races at any given time. The art style and looking is quite colourful and lively, your town shines with activity from the very beginning.On the other hand, not everything could possibly be good. The game has some unpolished factors and plain issues. Graphical glitches aren't hard to see, minor bugs (units getting stuck, happens very rarely) and a general feel of non polished textures and wierd motion when zooming in the battlefield. The beginning is quite slow and can make new players hesitate about playing the game any longer. The general perfomance FPS wise isn't the best either, making the less powerful PCs sluggish in large sieges and battles.Only time can tell if the game is going to fix these minor issues and become a high quality, popular game.Time has passed. I, as a beta tester who played the game almost 2 years ago now, can tell the development team has only improved in their work. New features are added almost every month, patches are released regularly and in good amount to fix both bigger and minor issues reported by the players. The community as a whole has a generally positive and friendly attitude. Mods and admins attend to every request the players make, include multiple (viable) suggestions and interact with the playerbase. There's almost everytime at least a set of mods in the chat in order to help players who have issues or don't know how to play the game, get started, etc. Refunds for minor losses, glitches or disconnects are instantaneous in-game and take a timelapse of (usually) less than 12 hours to happen. The support team also solves non gameplay related issues single- handed. (This is my own experience: I bought the game 2 years ago, and now that the system has changed, I've been given all the content that my original purchase included and some extras. For free). The playerbase grows in daily basis, the game is always in constant development and there's not such a thing as end-game.All in all, the gameplay after a few hours become very enjoyable. It's by no means a fast paced game: you may take your time to take decisions, reconsiderate the ones you've taken and scratch the ones that didn't pay off. There's a long-term plan. Even if you don't know. You're not going to build your castle overnight: it will take weeks, maybe even a month, as mentioned previously, the beginning is slow. The sieges are highly challenging and PvP is never easy, but the rewards are great. You'll lose entire armies that you'll have to rebuild from scratch, and you'll crush cities, kingdoms and races. The vassal system will allow you to eventually take over every AI center, and be attacked by players who desire such influence. The game is good, it's going to get better, and it's free. It's nothing like you've tried before. You should give it a chance, go ahead and have fun with it. The entire community and support team will be available for you at every point of your Kingdom Wars experience. "

												This game is not what it used to be, it has far improved from its original inherited state. As a moderator for the game, I may be biased, but my knowledge and experience gives me the confidence to say that if you choose to download this game, you will not be sorry. However, there are still some bugs, one of the problems with using an old engine. Despite this, they have completely overhauled a majority of the original game, fixed the broken pathfinding, made the world conquerable with the addition of vassal cities, added alliances, and so many more features. All of these additions were free, and now that the game has gone F2P, there is no reason not to try it.			"

												It is a really fun game. Creating your mighty city from the small speck of land is a satisfying experience ( It takes time though as does building up an army, but it's worth it). There are always people online and the community is very helpful. A bit of advice stick to the world chat rather than regional chat. Co-op and pvp are fun, you can take npc castles (you can make them your vassles and they will give you tribute) together or challenge each other on the field of battle or in epic sieges. Since the last update I have not had a crash, which was the games only real drawback before,  though it did not stop me from playing 170 hours.Edit ( Becuase I forgot to mention)There are DRAGONS in this game, there are wizards too, but I like dragons more.

												One of the most atmospheric RTS game's I've played and I've played a lot. The graphics/textures may not be AAA quality but they get the job done. The textures are greatly overcome by the stunning lighting and ambient sounds. The three races are very unique and all fun to play and each come with their own strategic playstyles. The City building is especially fun to show off and makes defending them a whole lot more important. The pathfinding needs some work and there is a ton of lag in PvP as there are no Australian servers. The battles are quite overwhelming with the vast amount of units and micro managing is very tedious as unit selecting is glitched. Overall it is an enjoyable game once you get around the many minor technical problems. 7/10			"

												So I have played kingdom wars for over 200 hours, and I must say, I would rate this game a 3/10 because it is full of bugs, and mishaps, and problems they're non stop, whether it is based around my resources in my city disappearing out of thin air, or the game not saving and my entire game resetting to multiple hours if not a day in the past, making all the time I had spent playing for nothing, I like how this game is played, but I think it has too many bugs and problems to even be considered to be played, after the problems that have occured to me playing this game, it questions me if it is even worth my time paying the $20 for the second game, considering how bad the first game was, I have a feeling the second game might just be as bad. Therefore I suggest people to skip this title and look at the next RTS. Thanks for reading, hopefully those of who HAVE bought the second game don't run into as many problems as I have run into with the first game.			"

												Kingdom wars is not only an RTS with in-depth leveling system on units, it is an MMO. The ability to co-op seige npc towns to gain bonus resources and crowns (used for upgrading technologies, and advanced units) is remarkable.Combat system - Each group of soldiers has a number of units inside it, and as long as 1 lives the entire group can be healed. The abilities of each group of soldiers also come with abilities which help in the midst of battle, some are more defensive abilities while others can deal heavy damage or movement speed in tough situations. In all the combat is well rounded with units that counter other units, and ways to win if strategically done.Building and Resources - This game is not a win in 1 day game, it takes patients and time to succeed into being a king. The resource gathering is per minute, which draws the building out but is worth it. During the time it takes to raise walls and gather resources for other builds you can spend time doing the Unlimited quests in the game for Crowns (In-game currency). Each building takes time, but you can build it all at once if you have the resources for it, or if you become impatient on a nessecary building you can rush the build with Crowns.Questing - The game has unlimited quests, this gives you a never-ending pve aspect to a largely pvp game. From Quests you recieve Crowns, and/ Resources. Some quests are very challenging but with co-op quests it notifies you that you can get assistance doing the quest (either from a random player, or from a friend off of your friendslist).PVE - I enjoy the pve the most. The battles in each of the zones is different, elvens fought in elven zones, humans in human zones, and orc's in the orc zones. Beyond that there are zones not allocated to a race. These zones have harder creatures to fight like orges (a unit of the orc's but the entire zone is ogre's), Dwarfs (a style of unit bought with crowns), goblins (another unit of the orc's but the entire zone is goblins), and even an extremely hard zone of Dragons!PVP - The pvp is setup as matchmaking, you will never fight someone much bigger then your army/town and you will never be able to pick on the weak. Its balanced so that you can enjoy fighting without the fear of being slaughtered. If you choose not to fight a player who is trying to fight you then you can do a ""payout"" option and sacrifice some resources or a few units to not have to battle them and it allows you to return to what you what to do (Quest, farm, pve, etc).Not pay to win - I want to state that in no way is this a pay to win game. There is options for buying packages, and being a Premium account but it gives only crowns, resources, and a bonus daily reward for premium accounts. These are all things you can aquire very easily in game but by buying a package you are not spending 30+ minutes gathering the resources or farming the crowns. Buying premium not only saves you time gathering crowns, it also helps the game grow and gives incentive to play. As a closing statement to this i will repeat - Its not pay to win, its free to play. Buying only helps you grow faster and helps the game grow faster. In all I must recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RTS games, this breaks the mold of what RTS use to be and brings a new light on the future of RTS. I have enjoyed every aspect of the game and hope to see more content in the future.			"

												First off i gotta say i went into Kingdom wars aka Dawn of Fantasy with a couple of excpectations.I was excpecting the game to be slow as all hell early game , cause its a MMO rts . And usually these kinda games can be a chore early on.Certian features seemd to look promising . Stuff such as naval combat and building your own settlement , defences and castle's .And finally i was excpectin some form of conquest .Lets start off with the first bit shall we ? This game is by far one of the few MMO type startegy games ive seen where the ammount of resoruces you accumilate is drastically fast . Most games of this sort will have you mine for like at least a month before you get your city to a presentable/Combat ready level . Not in this case ,ive managed to get my city into a decent fighting shape within a week .And for those fearing they might not be ready by the time their battle protection runs out , no fear theres several systems in place that should assure that newbie players dont get ganked up on or attacked by a higher player .Expectation number 2.Now sadly in the game everything is decided for you in terms of where buildings will go with specific poitns o nthe map  . The whole point of the game is besiegeing enemy castles right ? So its kind of dissapointing that you have no say in where startegic defences should go , instead its all pre determined for you . Even the placeing of houses for human players is determined ahead of time .The game should at the least allow you a small ammount of freedom when designing your castle . Like being able to place decorations such as parks or statues etc as well as houses , will make besiegeing each city at least feel somewhat uniqe .From what ive gatherd Naval is currently not in the game as it was unbalanced , the trailer is misleading and they shouldve taken that out before the steam release .Expectation 3 You can conquer NPC cities and make them your vassals . So theres that .Now ...these things seem mostly kinda negative ? Okey now onto what the game does well and features that are good.Quests while generally simple give the player a good sense of what he can expect to be up against , Quests also scale as the players armies grow in size (at least grind quests ). CoOP ing sieges or quests can also be alot of fun as well as you and a random strange coordinate your attack on a stronger opponent .The gameplay during fights can be explained rather simple with one word . Chaotic.Now what i mean with this is , if you dont keep a eye on your units ESPECIALLY melle units it is EXTREMELY difficult to tell weather your units are winning or loseing .Cause all units simply mesh into a large blob , not to mention individual untis from a squad tend to just go wherever and seperate themselfs fro mthe group leading them to end up who knows where.As it is the units move / fight way too quickly to keep up with what they are doing and makes fights more determined by the guy with the army that has the higher level units/ numbers as opposed to strategy.The most input you have during a melle fight is watching out your guys health doesnt go to zero and pull him out  , for a game like this micro manageign every unit like this can be a real pain.Bugs unfortonetly still plauge the game but the blow is somewhat softend by the constant moderators that in a sense refund you for your losses sustaind cause of a bug , so kudos to good communtiy managment .So this review sounds awefully negative right ? In a way it is , but i DO recommend this game , its free to play and it feels like it , all prices and all things they charge for are extremly fair and it looks like it wont be yet another pay 2 win game .The game has potential , especially seeing as how its developed by 4-5 developers . The games graphics are somewhat dated , but they get the job done , which means great news you dont need a strong computer to run it .Overall i highly recommend Kingdom Wars for actually being F2P , being properly supported and fixed , good community and potential for a REALLY great MMO RTS with time as the game and developer grows who knows what we might see in the game			"

												This game reminds me of Crusader stronghold, mixed with elemants of the mount & blade series. :3 The game itself, gives you just enough of a start for you and a freind, that if used wisely, you'd never need to pay a dime playing it XD. I'd definatly watch a walkthrough though, for the beggining, because my dumb mind couldn't comprehend how to create an army for the first 20 minutes of gameplay XD (which btw, all you do is click on your town below your town name on the map to do :p). That being said, I'd definatly recomend this F2P to anyone.			"

												At first, this seemed like a good idea. Still is a good idea. But, poorly executed in my opinion.Some issues I ran into:- While the tutorial covers how to play as the humans, I tried playing as the elves. Must have been playing for 2 hours before I figured out how to add additional buildings. Not at all clear.- The text in the game is an odd mix of old-english and modern. Threw me off quite a bit.- The elven language uses a lot of custom words and lexicon. But they don't explain what many of the words mean, and you have to figure it out from the contex of the conversation.- Tooltips for the upgrades referenced other upgrades that I could not locate.- Graphical problems. The game would freeze randomly. Sometimes the game would suddenly flip back and forth between day and night multiple times over a few seconds. Turning down my graphics settings didn't seem to help.These are just a few of the issues I had.			"

These zones have harder creatures to fight like orges (a unit of the orc's but the entire zone is ogre's), Dwarfs (a style of unit bought with crowns), goblins (another unit of the orc's but the entire zone is goblins), and even an extremely hard zone of Dragons!PVP - The pvp is setup as matchmaking, you will never fight someone much bigger then your army/town and you will never be able to pick on the weak. Its balanced so that you can enjoy fighting without the fear of being slaughtered. If you choose not to fight a player who is trying to fight you then you can do a ""payout"" option and sacrifice some resources or a few units to not have to battle them and it allows you to return to what you what to do (Quest, farm, pve, etc).Not pay to win - I want to state that in no way is this a pay to win game. There is options for buying packages, and being a Premium account but it gives only crowns, resources, and a bonus daily reward for premium accounts. These are all things you can aquire very easily in game but by buying a package you are not spending 30+ minutes gathering the resources or farming the crowns. Buying premium not only saves you time gathering crowns, it also helps the game grow and gives incentive to play. As a closing statement to this i will repeat - Its not pay to win, its free to play. Buying only helps you grow faster and helps the game grow faster. In all I must recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RTS games, this breaks the mold of what RTS use to be and brings a new light on the future of RTS. I have enjoyed every aspect of the game and hope to see more content in the future.			"

												Although this has a lot of bugs and its had it probelms with servers, it has a lot of potential within it. This game really combines a lot of different game genres e.g. city builder, stragey etc. and if you ask me has a unique play style. The graphics for a free to play are actually quite impressive if you ask me and you will not find yourself easily bored. In its current stage i would give the game 6.5/10. I would have given it more but there are a lot of things the developers need to work on but overall its fun, diversive and in my opinion has a lot of potential to become a fantastic game.			"

												-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------KW, is a game that make you  forget the time, this is an important thing because  mean that the game are very good and funny.However have many bugs, the most irritating thing is where you are playing online with another people. The game sometime crash and kick you out, losing all the progres in batlle, time protection etc..This is the point that make me feel more angry, because the strong of the game is that point and can not afford to fail in this.I hope the developers continue implementing it and improving it, adding new additions, and most cooperative and perfecting everything about the connection with other players. One way of statistics would be fine either global or battle. In short, this game hope and desire to grow and implement more because here is gold, but need to resolve BUGS, BUGS, BUGS, that only give you frustation. Losing one hour to capture a city,bugged to stay on the loading screen after the victory¡¡, or units through walls, to  name someone..---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			"

												The game may seem slow at 1st, but you'll come to love it when you start owning the npc and after that, pvp.  The game has all kinds of monsters that you can train into your army, dragons for example.  You can explore, man i love exploring the world, destroy anything in your way.  It's not pay to win so anyone has their chances of winnning.  So far it has everything that a medieval age game you would want.  There's mages too, which i barely got 1, they're hard to get.  There's 3 races atm, Human, Elf, and Orcs but i look forward to more races(undead).  Hopefully there will be navy fleets too from the looks of image pop ups.  So far the only bad thing is some bugs, and the archers are mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  You would think that they would shoot the enemy but they shoot the buildings(does no damage depending on what structure) or on the ground cause of the level of the ground is too high.  So basically you have to manually control them so they dont waste arrows.  As for the my last words, I'mma about to get a hydra! lol			"

												Been playing the past few days and I feel like I can finally make a decent review. Does not seem to have many pay to win aspects to it which is very good for a free to play game. Can get a $10 and $20 pack which will put you ahead but does not seem to give you anything you cant get already, devs need to eat too. Has a sort of Age of Empires feel to it which i like.Unit pathing currently seems to be a bit derpy but definitely not a game killer as im sure it will be fixed. Some other bigs here and there but no game breakers and im sure theyll be hammered out soon so that wont rly affect my judgement much.Be warned if youre at 90 pop cap in your city do not try to keep buying houses to increase your population, price will increase and youll keep paying wood but no new houses, they should definitely disable the button once you hit the cap, again nothing really major just something that made me a bit sad when i realized what happened.Game has a bit of a learning curve (like any mmo / rts). Could likely use some pop up hints perhaps to help new players along. Few of my friends i brought along to play were getting frustrated and i had to help em along, Which isnt a big deal i could just see players not having someone to help them simply giving up out of frustration. Yes i know there are tutorials in the game but lets be honest. Aint nobody got time for dat.Other than those few things which werent really al lthat bad i cant really think of anything negative so now ill start on the positive!Siege warfare seems so far to be implemented pretty well, I like the different world view and city views. You definitely have an mmo feel to it with the quests and your hero but also functions as a very good RTS, They have balanced it pretty well which makes this game pretty unique. I like the trading you can do in the game as well, different cities seem to have different prices for goods which also seems to fluctuate. Gives you something else to do other than the regular quest / kill grind.Early game they have you start off pretty well. You have an income boost which helps a whole lot and really gives you a good nudge to get growing quick, I like the fact that they did this as it makes it so there is little down time / sitting around waiting for resources to accumilate.Different races seem to have different ways of collecting resources, for example orcs dont have farms like humans and they must hunt. Not too sure on elves as i have not played them but differences like this really make each race feel different and adds new things for you to do and new ways for you to play which can keep this game feeling fresh and new for a long time.Normally when i see a currency in a free to play game (crown in this game) I immediately have a bad feeling about the pay to win aspects. They seem to have made it so that after every battle or quest you get crowns, and you dont really need too many to progress. and the packs you are able to buy are limited to one per city slotso someone cant spend all this money and get 10 million crowns. Kudos to the devs on that one.Well thats pretty much all i could think of off the top of my head. Overall i would rate this game at a 7-9/10 (7-9 only because i feel like i would need to play to the end game in order to really be sure)			"

												Kingdom Wars, a fantasy RPG game based around 3 races, the Elves, Humans and Orcs. This game is an ''Open-World'' RTS with RPG Elements here and there, with a great execution on Mass-Battles it can be kind of unbalanced here and there, in PvP for example if you have a highly trained army of 25 people you will be easily killed by a weak army of 10 units. The game still requires alot of scaling in many different aspects but the developer team which by the way exists out of only four people who are working very hard to provide you the best possible RTS game they can make out of this.Gameplay, the gameplay aspect of this game is still wonky and outbalanced by bugs or mistakes in the ''Scaling'' system but overall it is still a solid part of this game and most ''Hardcore-RTS'' players will be able to look past it. This game is  not very competitive because of a simple mechanic called: Battle protection. It allows you to not get attacked by anyone at all for a long time. In most FTP RTS games the Battle Protection timer continues even when you are Offline, but in KW Battle Protection pauses removing the Competitive aspect of this game by a lot. Luckily though, you can never be matched against an army bigger than your own. After some mishaps here and there and unbalanced features the gameplay is still solid and since it will most likely be improved in future updates it isn't such a big issue. I give the gameplay in this game a 6/10. Which will most likely become an 8/10 or a 9/10 if they fix these issues.The biggest problem in this game so far are the graphics and the countless bugs that keep appearing, while this may sound like a stupid thing to say, in this case it really isn't. The resolution in this game is incredibly low, I have seen games from back in 2001 that look better than Kingdom Wars. And Kingdom Wars was made in 2010. The bugs though are far worse than the Graphics. People are constantly reporting in that they crash during Sieges or that they bought something with real money and didn't get what they bought an even bigger issue is that the resource counter doesn't work. For example, sometimes I make 10 food per minute and 95 wood per minute and then 10 minutes later I make 29.9 food per minute and 63.5 wood per minute, the Resource counter is by far the biggest issue. Small things like this can be quite irritating at times but it is also to be expected from a WIP game and will most likely be fixed eventually.Cons include:-Outdated graphics-Several unbalanced gameplay elements-Lots of bugs-Huge amount of dialogue can be a bit overwhelming at timesHowever this may sound negative, the pros in this case outnumber and outscale the cons by far. Pros like:-Solid gameplay-Lots of detailed lore -Frequent updates usually containing lots of bug fixes-An ever growing, non-toxic and friendly community-Great and active staff members-And most importantly, NOT pay2winThis game has a lot of potential. As long as the developers get rid of bugs and expands upon its pros, this game will have a bright future ahead of it.			"

												I only have 2.5 hours in the game, but I used to play it on my brothers account for him before I used steam for games, I only actually had Steam originally because I needed a Valve Account to play TF2 on the PS3.. So I used the one my brother made for me. But yeah, I put a little of 200 hours on it for my brother, he ended up deleting the game when I got my own PC so, and the PC I got wasn't able to play the game, so I ended up forgetting about it. So about a year or two ago, I found it again and started playing, I had a better computer then, and so I played it every now and again usually only for about 5 minutes just to check up on my village, and rebuild my defenses. So I didn't do much. However from when I used to play, it was still full of Microtransactions so it wasn't like it's not the same as it is now, and I loved it then and still do, you also have to remember, back then there were a decent amount of hackers... not as much as War Rock but they were still there, and they weren't all that blantant, no free gold, just faster troop movements and probably slightly faster build speeds. So it wasn't really that noticable unless people were recording them invading, and their accounts got looked into by the devs, Most of the time they didn't get banned, the devs just patched the game to disallow the hacks being used. Nowadays I rarely see anything about hackers in the forums, so it doesn't seem like an issue anymore.			"

Dawn of Fantasy features both Online PvP play as well as a few single player modes more geared to the casual player. Single Player mode is broken up into three sub-sections; Lay Siege is a quick jump in and play random scenario that starts the player with a squadron of troops and siege weapons (such as Belfries and Trebuchets) in a basic camp just outside the enemy fortress .The goal is to invade the enemy fortress break open the main gate and kill the king. There is only one wave to play in lay Siege and the outcomes does not affect your save file Homelands.Next we have Castle Defense, a little more involved, where players instead are given a hometown with peasants,soldiers,and walls. Tower upgrades, many archers, and spike traps are key to surviving the long siege as wave upon wave of enemy troops march towards your castle front. One problem with this mode is that the enemy troops swarm up by their target gate but do not move out-of-the-way for the battering rams to do their job. Soldiers don’t break in, siege weapons stand around, in fact everyone stands around slowly getting picked off by a single battalion of archers perched within the final keep. Even when the next wave arrives the only rip apart what they can easily access. Again all spoils go to no one after victory/defeat is declared. Lastly for single player there is the Kingdoms mode. This is like a campaign but more open ended. It uses the World Map but with less instruction than the Online Kingdom provides. And instead of quests and tutorials players are given an expected battle every few minutes regardless of progress made. The goal of this mode is to conquer the entire World Map without your Hometown being captured by the enemy forces. This is in my experience the hardest part of the game,and if you are new to the game and confused on how the world map works, don’t fret, it is explained in the Online Kingdom mode, the main mode of the game,which is next.The Online Kingdom mode is a go-at-your own pace experience that guides players through a story based on the player’s selected Kingdom. This game differs from the single player games because it revolves around taking armies out from your hometown and bringing them to the World Map so that they can travel to other towns and quest locations. Other towns give means of trade, buying mercenaries, training units to do other jobs; and in a pinch acting as a place holder for precious units when the town population cap(s) are full. Swapping between the two perspectives, world map and town, is the vital key to Dawn of Fantasy’s uniqueness.Along with all the mechanics introduced in the other modes, this one has an extra influence resource known as crowns that can be used to buy other resources,speed up building constructions, and most importantly buy special units such as dragons and Dwarven fighters. For $9.99 you can buy 120 crowns which grants one the option to purchasing the Royal Dragon, the most powerful unit in the game. Unlike the Kingdom’s Mode of single player, battles are engaged at the pace of the player. The image below is a swarm of Orc Riders actually waiting to speak with my towns hero before deciding to attack my precious colony.With all these gameplay modes spending an hour or two building armies and raising an effective economy is quite easy. Units are created in squads of multiple members. Instead of training one peasant for 180 food the game actually trains 5 little guys on the screen, same goes for infantry. Despite these 5 little workers being spawned the towns’ population is only increased by 1 for doing this. Building houses also increases the total population cap by 1, making a booming economy a very long-term goal. Paradoxically, gathering times for resources in Dawn of Fantasy  are a slower than some may find comfortable. This is to encourage the World Map exploration and trade, as well as looting the dead corpses with peasants for that extra economic boost. Erecting buildings requires no peasants, but takes on average an hour to complete without the use of any crowns.Presentation of the game has a few minor bugs in it as well. Some background cameras in town menus do not stay on course and can be spastic. Leaving your mouse on a button can provide information, but it does not help when the information box is in front of another button. The ticker above head saying the resources gathered per minuet is also inaccurate, and will not update even when there are peasants collecting a resource .Despite these few hiccups the game itself is a treat to play. The camera controls are well done, same can be said about the speech banks. Unlike Age of Empires, the characters in-game actually say what needs your attention, instead of the sound cues you has to learn about through multiple session will not disappear Dawn of Fantasy is a game filled with hours of gameplay for the strategist waiting to capture castles and rule a world of fantasy. The PvP options now are for the competitive player mostly, because you cannot share resources with other player in-game, however alliances in a multiplayer game .			"

												Okay, I'm going to explain the good and the bad about this game. Keep in mind that this is my first review.The bad: You cannot manuelly place buildings, they are all automatic. If you're hoping to leave your workers to gain resources for you while your offline then you'll be terribly mistaken, while offline you gain 50% less resources than you did before. The game is terribly buggy, Some units walk across the sky in sieges, some walk over mountains and the pathfinding is not that great. The AI are some of the worse I've ever seen; While doing a custom siege I sent my reinforcements to attack the army that was besieging me and after they killed my reinforcements what did they do? they stood there for the next 45 mins doing nothing when my castle was rype for the taking. Some of your troops wont attack certain troops when they're standing right in front of them unless you right click on them to attack. The game also has a terrible learning curve and you will ofen get bored playing this game. You WILL spend most of your time in the world map traveling between cities and to new strongholds to attack. Also when starting off in southmont players can attack your townhall from outside your double layered walls and immediately win the battle since battles are won by destroying the town hall, not the army nor the city. The town hall. Mods are also usually never on, I've never seen one on anyways or one that would actaully do something productive and help players. The good: PVP is fun. Sieges are fun and battles in general are fun. The storylines are decent. Though you cannot manuelly place buildings it is always nice to finish your city and admire its beauty. Theres also a nice little shop that you can spend crowns on to get special units or more resources. Crowns can be rewarded to you through attacking other players or doing quests or by buying them. You also require crowns to build walls. I played 12 hours into this game, so before you haters say I didn't play the game enough then think again. I played 12 hours into this game and i listed all the things i could think of and most of those things are bad. This game may be for some but it's not for everyone. If you can get past all the things listed above then this game might just be for you. 5/10. Im not the best at giving ratings.			"

												This game is a lot of fun... at first.It's a fantasy based real time strategy game with a surprisingly good interlacing story for each of the three factions. The free-to-play model is actually very good and isn't as pay-to-win as some people claim, especially since they added a hard-limit to how many crowns (the in-game currency needed to buy the most powerful upgrades/units) you can buy with gold. You can take control of dragons. O.oIf you're clever, you can thrive in this game very quickly. PvP is.. fairly balanced but it feels like an afterthought. What stinks is that the game almost forces you to co-op if you want to take large NPC cities as you only have 30mins to complete a seige. I really, really want to give this game a thumbs up because it IS a lot of fun and has a ton of potential BUT it is absolutely plagued by bugs. You will most likely rage quit the first time you spend 25 mins trying to take a city and the game crashes.. which happens OFTEN. Armies and units will get stuck and you might have to start over entirely. Controls lack finesse. Ehh.. if you're reading this and love fantasy RTS games, feel free to give the game a try but expect a few technical difficulties.			"

												I personally like Kingdom Wars a lot. First of all I have to say this ISN'T pay to win. I think people saying that didn't understood the game at all. Everything is achievable through gameplay for everyone, only payable items are pure estetics, also the premium just gives a speed boost in certain ways, it is for example like buying an exp boost on league of legends, you just go faster, not better. I repeat, this is a free game, so you can't blame people who use the premium, you can get the full gameplay without it. Guys spending money, are just helping the devs and the game getting better and bigger, is that a bad thing? That said, the game is great, I see a lot of potential. Yes, there are some bugs (what game has no bugs?) and the devs are awesome in fixing them as fast as possible. Just try the game and see yourself, it is free.I really hope new players will come, this game truly deserves it.			"

												Kingdom Wars is a amazing title to play if you are into the rts genre. Taking the scale of the total war series and stronghold games it is a game you are sure to play for hours. My inicial recations and thoughts on the game were that it would be a pay to win players dream, but this was not the case. Like many F2P games out there paying only gets you cosmetics that have no greater purpose. The ingame economy system is also well balanced with limatations to just how much you can acheive. Based around four main resource types and crowns, the harder to earn currency, you'll have a fun time trying to arrange your workers into such a way to balacnce it out. Another strong point in this game is the graphics and model textures. For being made by a realtively small company the game is very well looking with some much going on at once with minmal to no lag what-so-ever. Going off of graphics they have a very sound sound engine (pun intended) that has very realistic effects and ambience.Now no game is perfect, this game does have a few bugs now and then, but nothing gamebreaking. The devs and mods are on all the time with their fanbase and players supporting and helping when they can. It can also be a little on the hard to run side if your computer is a little on the lower side. With the amount and time the devs put in this game can only get better in the future.			"

												we need to support this game i believe this game will be best online strategy game forever the game will be more than   great if u add graphic like (Crusader Kings II ) and strategic plans like (Rome Total War 2) and story like  (Warcraft Frozen Throne)  and more races like  (Might & Magic Heroes VI) and some  myth units like (Age of Mythology)  this game will best online turn based strategic game all the time                                                                   Kingdom Wars                                                           remember this name			"

												Kingdom wars is a well thought out Real Time strategy game, the ""pay to win Option"" is almost not there which makes this game unlike the others out there by a long shot.the pvp is good and one of the best things i have seen so far is skill,skill can win you any battle weather it is were you place your archers or what units you put in the front and the fact that every unit has a unique place in the army.my feeling aside prosthe mass attack is never a good ideayou never have to pay to win and the option isn't there for the guy with the bigger walletnothing is Opeverything is easy to find and figure outquests are never ending (some are repetative but so are the goodies)there are a lot of pros so etc etc etcnow for the consthe game glitchs a lot some times (it is a new game)you can loose all your armies in a single fight (not that bad)Resources can just fly away and ruin your day if you log off with lagunits can double some times (i know sounds great if that was you and not your enemys)i have been playing for a few days now and i have not been able to stop playing the people are friendly even when they are trying to take your castle. i cannot give a higher recommendation for an Rts i think it is not for everybody but i bet if you read this and others and get the right mind set you can have a great time. i look forward to seeing you in game o7			"

												Español: Tengo que admitir que no me esperaba mucho de este juego, que sería algo tan simple como construir y matar. Pero estaba equivocado ... llevo pocos días de juego y me está encantando. Simplificándolo mucho, podría decirse que es una mezcla de un juego de navegador, tipo Ikariam/ogame, y un total war, para las batallas. Es un juego donde tienes que esperar X tiempo para conseguir recursos, unidades, etc ... combinado con batallas en tiempo real a gran escala. Además de una buena diplomacia incluida, buen transfondo y multijugador. Entre otras cosas. Haciendo que la gestión de cada raza sean completamente diferentes entre sí, además del estilo de juego.Es un tipo de juego que jamás había visto y que no me esperaba que me gustase tanto. Es algo nuevo, una corriente de aire fresco. English:I have to admit I was not expecting much from this game, it would be something as simple as building and kill.

												Kingdom Wars is a real time strategy game with a twist. think stronghold kingdom meet age of empire. i really enjoy the game so far,, when you first start , it give you a 20 hours safe from pvp buff.  im up to 13 h into the game, got my army wipe a couple times,, it could use better tutorial  to prepare you for tough battle, but its not so hard to give up,, you feel proud when you succeed a siege of a stronghold, after adjusting your tactic because your full army got wipe the first time you tryed.   overall, its a very fun game, keeps you login you back after a few hours to spend your ressource , big plus is it doesnt look like its pay to win, altho i have to say, it can be a while to gather crown to spend on upgrade. maybe im doing something wrong.  so ya,, if you like this sort of game, where it takes days/ months to build your empire,, its a great try at least,, hey its f2p  you cant go wrong with that.  try it.  cant wait to see what the pvp looks like,, 7/10			"

												I bought the game about 2 years ago.  Back when they had the cash shop.  Although some poeple felt that it was pay to win, it was not in the least bit since I never spent a dime on it and still was able to pve and pvp without problems.  Still to this day now that it's F2P, you still don't have to pay for anything since your armies are always matched with people of similar armies.  It's a really good way of handeling a cash shop.  If you don't want to pay any money, you will have to learn how to play is all, which isn't a bad thing.It was a buggy game when I first got a hold of it, as most newish games, and that did deter me for about 4 months.  After a while they had a few patches that made it less laggy for me and that's when I started racking up the hours, Building more cities, destroying more foes, and gathering those crowns for more armies.  I grew up playing RTS games, Age of Empires was my first multiplayer game, and I played that for a couple of years along with Empire earth when it came out.  This has strong elements of your typical RTS, but it has so much more.  Long term cities, taking over NPC towns, exploring the map, questing, and co-op sieging just to name a few great things that seperate it from your standard RTS.I had so much fun that I invited a few friends to play with me and after teaching them how to play we were pillaging empires left and right.  When you play with friends, it usually makes a game that much more fun.  You invite friends, your friends invite friends, etc..  Soon you can start an alliance with people you know that you will get along with.  Although you can only 2v1 vs AI, and 1v1 in pvp, hopefully later in the games life they can expand that.   Good times were spent on sieging cities with a friend. I wasn't too interested in the MMO part of this game at first, I had played world of warcraft for about 2 years back in 2008, and grew out of it, but this game fits right in and youre not overpowerd by MMO nerds sitting on a ♥♥♥♥ bucket and trying to hit on a night elf.   I grew up playing age of empires, empire earth, and starcraft.  Although this game isnt on the same level, it's still tons of fun.  More of a long term RTS.Since I bought the game, fast forward to today, Reverie has had many great patches that improved the game immensely, and with the launch of their FtP model, it's better than ever.  New units, new buildings, better performance, vassels, and unit balencing (and that's just the tip of the iceberg)Also, I have a guide on my profile for new players to get some all arounds tips for the game.9/10  Unique, fun, cheap, and helpful devs/mods.  Would buy again.			"

Personnaly this is my favorite game and touches everything I like and want from a game and it does not require you to spend money to have a nice time, yes it might have a few bugs/glitches but, in the overall, after you`ve spent a little time and gave the effort while playing you`ll realise that it`s a truely amazing game.Not only is the game itself simply fantastic but, the Veteran players themselfs are awesome, while not only just providing help and guidance to new players but they also help out the developers on fixing and adding new content to the game.

												Stronghold meets AoE fused with Mount n Blade with dash of awesome. Dispite what the critics say this game has kept me engrosed and engaged.  It has a learning curve but once you get the hang of it you better hang on tight. PVP yes, it has that. Guilds, Yup! Solo play, they got that covered too. Base building for sure. Oh, you just want to sit back and quest. You got it!Graphically speeking its not the prettiest but it's loads better than any Stronhold game. It's RT based so plan your time wisely or you might just get hooked enough to make your friends think you moved and were enrolled in some witness protection program.Try it now!  "

												Funny Total War like game with RPG elements and Browser games elements.It's no more P2W but it has marginal Pay2Progress elements.Devs keep upgrading the game nearly every week and try to improve the game further and further.One Problem that this game has is that creating formations with your units is a bit messy because the unitcontrol system is not a powerful tool.It is very hard to march forward in a specific formation or place your units in the right order on the battlefield. And the ""Hold the Ground"" order is really buggy and not working perfect.That is something that should be improved.A other Problem is that single units can be too strong. Something that defentily should be fixed. The last problem is, is that the AI is extremly passive. You can lure enemy AI units one by one out and kill them.It is possible to conquer a whole fortress with very few units.But this game is still great and has alot potential.There is no other game like this out there.

												Stunning variety amongst the three races with their unique Units and Research. Your given so much Freedom to acheive what you want with this game. Rather beautifull lands and buildings   ( unless your orc, lol ). Combat in Quest battles is of the type where if you don't think on the run, you'll lose your troops en-mass, a terrific challange alone, without the PVP added. It's not that combat is alligned against you but the choice pre-battle of your units is critical. Fortunitly you are given a very wide range of units, if you choose to research them from amongst each race and choice of mercenary forces also wide are available to be hired from cities. Very good help within game and support.			"

												I have been playing this game for the last few weeks.  I was so excited about this game in my first day, that I draged 5 of my friends to play this game.  With any game you find what you like and don't like.  What sets this game off for me is, its what I expect an MMORTS to be!  When friends of mine ask me, whats the game like or how to compare it.  I tell them that this is a unique game, then I tell them I can help them learn.  I personly found the game easy to learn and so did my friends.  The game is complex to get you very excited, but not difficult by any means.  The game runs smooth on the graphics and is very appealing to the eyes.  Yet of course my favorite thing of all about this game however is the building of my own castle and how I want to build my army, hoping for more styles of castle and land layouts down the road!  So would I recommend this game to anyone, yes deffenitely!  Even if you don't care for  the multiplayer aspect or your not a true rts fan, give this game a whirl, I bet you'll find something you highly enjoy about Kingdom Wars.			"

												This game is a very unike and good game.im going to be listing the good factore about these games and the rating of each sectionCombat- 7/10 the combat in this game is very good, but is still sort of buggy. sometimes during the combat you dont even see the soliders swinging their swords or anything, but the descriptions of each troop stating their weaknesses and stregths actually take place in the conbat. overall i think the combat has a lot of potential, but lacks a bit. it is definitly the only weakness of this game graphics-7/10 as we know this game was released in 2013 but the graphics arent bad for a free game. im not too sure how this game company profits off this amazing game becuase you can really see that a lot of time and money went into this game, but it is still free. the graphics in this game are bummy in some areas, but are pretty good overallStrategy-9/10 this game requires a lot of brains and time to be successful. it is a very slow game to progress through (i got 10 hours and i still dont have walls) but it makes it very realistic, this isnt like a game where everything happens and its very quick. however when you do spend money it speeds up this process, which is obviously intended so the company can make profit,Multiplayer-10/10 this game has an amazing multiplayer layout. you can send your friends resorces, do campaign with them, and fight with them. To me the multiplayer is pretty straight foreward, and i wouldnt change a thing about it.Difficult- 9/10 Im going to admit, this game is VERY difficult. your troops die pretty easily and its not easy to get precious resorces like wood stone gold or food. by building a wide variety of building, it eats up all of them. this is where the money spenders come in and get a free run to successionoverall i would STRONGLY recommed this game due to the fact that it is free and is AMAZING, and i would pay for this game any day. this game is a mix of banished,mount and blade, and stronghold crusader. if i were you i would get my hands on this before the developers put a price on this. i hope this helped you make you decision:)			"

												This game is excellent for all of those people who are dying for a patient, Non-Pay2win game. Kingdom Wars is like the Total War Series + the Age of Empires Series. What I love about this game is that there are 3 Factions that are playable, the Humans, the Orcs, and the Elves, each with its own unique strengths. There is also a conquerable map that has little settlements that have their very own, very detailed lore. This game is also not a frustrating Pay2win game, although, there is a special currency called influence that you may buy with real money, and the currency is needed to grow your Empire, it is not that hard to get though. There are many ways to get this special currency, one way is to log in everyday and debate whether to claim Influence or the Random item, another way to get Influence would be to battle with other players. The Community so far seems very nice and so far I've not met many people who want to make you have a bad time while playing. The game offers very fun challenges that really are challenging! So far, I am having a blast playing, I've been very addicted to this game and ever want to pull my eyes off the screen, I'd highly reccomend this game to your friends!			"

												Oneof the best RTS Resource games to come out in forever. Love the combat system that actually forces you to think about your units and where to place them and the seige mode is very clean and well built.  The Addition of winter changing resource gathering was also a great idea. It is a refreshing change from games where in an hour you could be pvp ready and decimating those who were just behind you for easy points. Definitely recommend this game to all those who like games that require patience and skill with resource management.			"

												This game is OK, it could be a great game, but it has some flaws... actually it has three flaws.1st : You have a huge army and attack a enemy, but you can not launch a huge assault, because you can only control a limited amount of units, but this is a minor flaw.2nd : This is a big one and really annoys me. Some times the game just freezes... just like that, mostly it starts running again after a minute, but some times you have to close it via task manager and when you restart it then, your progress of over half a hour of gameplay is lost... and that happened to me two times.3rd : This one is a even bigger one and seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. The trebuchets are broken.I was doing the quest ""Dangerous Neighbours"" and attacked the second of the three strongholds.It had 2 stonewalls, towers, mounted trebuchets a.s.o. I had a full army of swordsmen, maceman, and archers, with 10 trebuchets and 1000 stones. I ordered my trebuchets to throw the stones on one wall segment of the outer wall and set them on ""hold fire"" so they kept shooting and shooting. I know that catapults are no accurate weapon, but with the trebuchets in this game you can be happy if they hit anything. After several minutes some buildings were damaged, but those were mostly buildings inside the walls and a few soldiers were killed, but nothing happened to the wall segment which i told my trebuchets to attack.Many frustrating minutes later there were no stones left to throw at the enemy. In the end my trebuchets destroyed two towers and dozens of houses, but the targetet wall segment still had about 50% of its HPs left so i had to cancel the attack, because there was no way i could get into the Stronghold anymore.BUT I still recommend this game because those things can be fixed by patches and because this game is free to play.

												So far this game is awesome. It is everything I have ever dreamed of for a strategy game.

												First off, I do recommend this game. Other titles of this genre tend to be slow moving and often play at a stand still pace.  Kingdom Wars has much more to do and livens up the game play and that is a nice chance of what you get used to playing these types.   Lots of options for varied town and playing styles. My only critique is that for mission completion there is no help guide.  Certain functions are no explained, so just use the chat to ask another player, so far the community has been pretty helpful.			"

You can go get mercanaries to join your army, you can be Elves, Orcs, or HumansEach race comes with its own enviremont. The Siege combat on another players land, is truly immersing and has such an epic feel when your troops are marching up the hill and his troops are raining arrows down upon, your sending fireballs in there base it's just so epic.

												So heres a quick and honest brake down of the game. This game offers a ton of replay value, rick lore, cool faction units and epic pve and pvp battles rangeing from seiges or open feild. The world feels active and alive and as a pvper on a good day i can fund my cites easy from pvp loot. And a huge more, but this game has a ton of game breaking bugs the devs have promised to patch since I played in beta. A huge lack of a support team the updates have stoped to a hault no cummuncation to the players. Pvp system is buggey most of the time ui is very out dated the match making for the game is lacking big time as a pvper my self I haft to spam click the auto search sometimes it feels 100 times before I even get any thing and then that person just pays out. Most days I cant find any thing and the fact that there is no auto search function that I can pop and go do somthing else it bothers me alot having this account and 2 others I've pvped on. I should ot haft to click over and over again. But putting that aside if you are lookinf for a ftp mmo rts that you can pass the time with and not haft to pay to get any thing back this is one of them. Tbh this is the first mmo rts I've played on steam that was not 100 % pay to win. I think kingdomwars would be defined as pay for time you can get crowns very easy in the game. The only benifte i see it giving is faster build times. So that said I've played this game through 5 so called mistake server wipess and I can say I never regreted playing. But with a bunch of new rts mmos going into alpha next mnoths peeps I would say leave this on the back burnner for a bit. It might explode on its self ride safe and long live the orcs!			"

												Overall this game is pretty enjoyable imo. There are some things I feel could be better - notably the lack of customization with regards to walling in your settlements - but it's a solid RTS I feel, with solid combat and enjoyable-enough game mechanics that it's worth your time. Definitely a good F2P game. Solid 6.5/10 in its current state and the devs are working on major overhauling improvements, so I can only hope to see that score increase over the next few months.			"

												This is NOT a pay to win game.  Yes, you can buy crowns, but I make so much gold that if I had the storage for it I would not need to spend mony on crowns.  Most of the micro purchases are cosmetic and give access to units that you can get in game anyway.I have been playing this game for about 3 months now and I like it alot.  If you liked the total war series you should like this one.  It reminds me a lot of that series of games with the added benefit of Orcs and Elves.  That being said there are a few things I don't like about it, takes for ever to walk to the battles in my opinion.  I know there are technologies you can unlock to march faster, but they are quite expensive as far as crowns go and the one that I have didn't really increase it much.  THe trading system in the cities seems a bit odd, like I lose money everytime, but then I am not too powerful as of yet and don't do a lot of trading so maybe I am wrong.Anyway, I really like the game and contine to play it and will continue to.

												Yes the game is excellent, there are some parts that lag a bit but not too bad at all like in the world map. The UI for moving material is a bit complex and some times requires a little for thought before hand. It would also be nice to put a quest on hold if it is still out of reach power wise and start a new quest so troops can level up instead of stopping in a blank area on the world map.....I havent been through the whole world as of yet but it also seems all the stops in between the cities and town always have the exact same map....it seems anyways i could be wrong on that one,  Over all out of 10 I would definately give this game an 8 to 8.5 on my own personal sfinter scale, great job making this game you all.Mike.

												Kingdom Wars is truly a unique take on the RTS (Real Time Strategy) genre and is truly worth a try for both fans of the genre as well as those new to it.  People who are fans of city-building simulators will also find much to enjoy in this unique title.While Kingdom Wars has gone through many changes, some good, some less-than-desirable, overall the experience is really something that has to be experienced to understand it.  The very early stages of the game can be somewhat confusing, however it is my understanding that the developers have addressed this issue in the time since I was a new player.Although there is the option to spend real money (in fact, I obtained my copy of the game back when it was still a regular purchasable title) the game truly is ""free to play"" in the sense that, while you can beef up your army using real money purchases, you will not be penalized for not doing so.  When PvP occurs (which is largely optional) players are matched up roughly based on the strength of their armies.  This is not an absolutely perfect system, however it vastly eliminates the possiblity that your opponent will have an absurly stronger army than yours via real money purchases.Also, both the PvP and the PvE aspects of the game are truly exciting and offer an experience not found in other RTS games or titles from other genres.  While similar to PvP, the PvE side of the game can be better tailored for those who like a more relaxed approach to playing.The thing I like most in the game is the building of one's kingdom, which is a gradual process that can take weeks or months to expand, depending on your playstyle.  It is really fun to carefully plan your defenses out and try to set up ambushes for would-be attackers, while at the same time it can be very engaging in that you take semi-permanent losses from battles, so you are encouraged to really think things through.  This is the most true for the human race (who specializes in defense) however all of the races, humans, elves and orcs, have an aspect of this.The different races play quite differently and I actually have yet to branch out into the orcs and elves, but their playstyles are all unique and offer a vast amount of play time should you choose to explore all three.  Even with only having focused on one race, I have spent many hours on this game and feel like I have only scratched the surface.This game has its rough edges, but the developers are serious about making it as polished as can be and have been working hard to make many changes that both improve the gameplay and well as the look and feel of the game.  Bugs have been being addressed over time and overall the game can be played and enjoyed with few interruptions caused by bugs.  The UI (User Interface) could use some attention, however it is still quite functional and usable after some experience with it.Overall, this game is really fun (which is the most imporant part to many people) and worthy of sinking at least a couple dozen hours into it before deciding if you like it or not.  Do not be fooled by the graphics or the first few minutes of the game - this game is huge and in a very good way.			"

												Amazing game! First time playing an MMORTS but I love it. The epic seige and defense battles make me feel like I'm watching a movie. Great paced resource gathering without being OP on producing goods, Easy walk through and how to play. I love how you can get what you need without having to spend actual money and that you can get whatever you need to purchase units and buildings just by questing.			"

												This game is amazing. You run an entire kingom that you build from the ground up. While there are still bugs that you will encounter, i give this game 5/5 stars for what it is.  If you want to tactically command an army, just as a king would lead his men in to battle back in the mideval ages, this game is for you. It's a game that doesn't go too easy on you either. There is always a new challenge due to the PVP system. The trading system in this game works just as you would think too. Send trade carts, and send troops to protect them from other hostiles, risk your resources, and be rewarded for being smart.			"

												This game has so much potential. As I continue to play and get used to the controls (which currently need significant work) I am enjoying it more.There is much the game can do to improve, currently, the controls are my biggest complaint.  The units often time seems to be confused, and most recently the game suffered a pretty horrible bug during an update.   I know this company is not a huge company, so I can forgive them.I have been waiting for a game like this for SOOOOOO long, and I am glad someone has finally made it.  It the future, I would like to see more races, better controls, and better unit AI.  3 stars out of 5-edit-The recent bug that caused deletion of my city was fixed at a speed I do not expect from most companies.  Also they had fantastic customer service and resloved the problem way above satisfaction.			"

												I've very much enjoyed this game.  I chose to go Elves, and much like another review I read some time ago they have a very Protoss-esque feel to them.  Their units are individually stronger than all the others, however they train slower and cost more.  Their buildings also give great benefits, yet generally seem to be on the fairly costly side.Yet the cost usually isn't an issue as their economy is entirely trickle based, well actually it's mostly trickle based, the single glaring and strange exception to this is stone.  The lack of any way other than through alchemy or manual mining to get stone is honestly a pretty big issue, especially since I've been getting a resource boost already and was only making about 4 stone per minute if I didn't use alchemy - contrast that to the ten food per minute and the 25+ wood per minute.The balance of resource gathering, at least for Elves, is off.  You have a resource cap, however most of your resources are going to be wood considering it takes zero effort to get lumber as an Elf.  As a matter of fact you start off the game getting 10+ wood per minute, compared to the paltry sums of about 1 to 3 per minute of everything else.Despite that issue the game was absolutely still worth trying and playing and, for those looking for a slower-paced gameplay or an RTS that didn't take up all your time, the Elves would have been right up your alley.The main benefit of the Elves, I feel, is the ability to log off of the game and come back some hours later to build your buildings and military up.  As resources continue to trickle in whether or not you're logged on it feels like a game that doesn't force you to pay attention to it every waking second of every day in order to progress, which, honestly, was a breath of fresh air.Furthermore it's really nice not to have to worry about being attacked while logged off, unlike some games.  While it's a little clunky and has a few issues every once in a while the dev team is very active and clearly working hard to bring the best experience they can.  In such I really do suggest trying this game out if you're in the market for a fantasy RTSMMO.			"

												This Game is one of a kind. You get to build your own medieval town or city whilst doing quests either in pvp, co op, or solo. You get to play as humans, orks or elf's, each have there own unique way of building cities and armies. You can recruit armies of darwfs and summon dragons to you aid.If your into big fights on a large scale with pvp or pve with 1000+ armies on each side battling for gold, crowns,  power and land, this is the game for you. Its a fun medieval game just waiting to be conquered.  It's not all about the war though, you have to use your mind and skill to build your empire. You need to upgrade the armor on your troops for better defense in battle. You can also upgrade your sheep or cows for more milk and wool to trade for any resources you may need.  You can upgrade the tools the workers use and the clothes that they wear so they work faster and it improves the quality of materials they produce.With every great army theres a great leader chose your hero, build your empire and destroy your rivals.

												I like this game due to troop and castle managment. Being online it pitch you againts other players in siege attack and defend. Think of it like Stronghold online. Besides the PvP, your army can roam the countrysides for quest, trade, laying sieges on npc towns, or plain field RTS battle.			"

												This game is beautiful in every way, buggy every now and then but beautiful and it has what many games are missing today which is character. Pros - The Developers are doing there upmost best to work on this game even though there was a big crash last year where everything was wiped. The Developers and Admins are very active usuasly. Cons - Watching your army get washed by the major orc captical (This is more of a bad joke but it happens lol)			"

												Kingdom Wars is an intresting game the diffrent options you have to control your empire is pretty cool. Also you have many options in battle which make it so you can craft your empires own victory or defeat?! But honestly i would recommend this game to anyone wanting to give this game a try or wanting to return to this game since the developers are adding many great additon to the game and allways fixing any issues that pop up.

												I actually bought the game back in the day, stumbling upon it during a massive sale. At the time, I wasn't particularly impressed, as it lacked a lot of the freedom of your typical city-builder, and the progress seemed slow enough that I wondered if I'd ever see my town grow into a city before losing interest in the game.In retrospect, I think I had largely missed the point. As it has gone free-to-play, firstly, I'm glad it avoided the pittfalls of becoming a pay-to-win game in the process, as the two more often than not go hand-in-hand. My town is still small and undeveloped, and as more of a city-builder myself, I have yet to really go deep into the siege/warfare aspects of the game. The controls for that, in what little of it I have engaged in, were a little clunky and troops were difficult to manage, but it seemed that it was surmountable, and that with time and experience, one could probably master the warfare system, should they be inclined to do so.As a city-builder, which is where I'm coming from, it is a bit limited, as you don't really choose where buildings go as freely as you do in most others. That said. it has been fun seeing my town grow, and stocking it with a large enough garrison to defend myself against any potential attackers. In fact, the game is probably more comparable to an online game I used to play called Travian, but it is very polished graphically in comparison, and much deeper in terms of variability and different units/buildings.The slow pace of the game might deter some, but I've come to enjoy stopping by every so often to see how many resources my villagers have accumulated. I check in once every other night or so, and in that span they've usually cobbled together enough stuff for me to be able to signifiantly add to my town with each log in.All-in-all, it's not a game for everyone, and it limits the freedom of both the city-builder and the strategy/siege models, however in return it provides both of those in one game, doing something unique and playable, to me anyway. There's a lot in here for one game, and not necessarily too much, as is so often the case these days.The price is right, these days, so it's certainly worth giving a shot, and remember to log in a few times before giving up on it, if you're not enjoying it so much. It wasn't until my fifth login or so that I started realizing that I was actually having fun with the game. Be that a critique or not, I recommend the game as it currently stands.			"

												This game is great, in my opinion. There are pros and cons to it though, so I will list them below.THE PROS:A. NOT pay to winB. Each in-game race (Orcs, Humans, or Elves,) offers a different playstyleC. The Developers of the game seem to have put a decent amount of effort into this game, even though it is free to playD. IT IS FREE! seriously, this is important - even really poorly done games (This one isn't poorly done though) are nice if they are free - all you need is hard drive space to play - Why not at least try it if it is free?E. It offers many hours of play time.F. Updates to the game are released periodically, and they are also completely free.G. Doesn't require a super powerful PC to playOK, there are cons too thoughTHE CONSA. Not enough people play this game - I have only ever seen 200 people online at one time - not exactly MMORTS (Massive, Massive Online Real Time Strategy) more like just ORTSB. It has some bugs - they aren't game-breaking, but they are there.C. It is very difficult to actually gather enough army strength to sucessfully lay siege to an AI town - you need expensive and exotic units like dragons, Minotaurs, etc,  to do it reliably.D. Most of the playerbase seems to be either Old, experienced veteran players, who have all of the best units, all the upgrades, and essentially unlimited resources. They are all but unbeatable unless they fight themselves. Most of the rest of the players are new to the game, and don't know the most basic things about playing yet. In essence, there are very few players who fall in between these two extremes.E. If you choose to play elves, it is more difficult than Orcs and Humans to gather resources.All in all, though, this is a great game, even more so because of the fact that is it free. I would recommend it to anyone that likes Real Time Strategy games.			"

With this awesome game there is a second one called kingdom wars 2 and they are both improving both of these games all the time. They care for what you say when your on fourms theres no hackers, which means its more fun to most of us.I will reccomend this game because its great to me and hopefully the 3 expansions will make the game better than it is. Also i was looking at the comments i heard that there is lag, but theres not unless you have a bad connection, bad internet, or your computer needs some upgrades.The only bad part about the game is the crown system, i have heard rumers that there going to remove them for units but not the buildings them selfs. Because if they took it away people would have a army of max ranked dragons, minotaurs, hydras, and dwarf tools, which all makes you (over powered)=>OP <=(over powered) like 3,000 army power, which is way to OP.

 Everything I want, Nothing I don't  Kingdom Wars is a melting pot of different styles of games and game elements/mechanics. I personally view it as a Stronghold Crusaders + a dash of Total War + World of Warcraft (the RTS, not the MMO) + A strong influence of the game elements/mechanics of those web browser based games where you build a base and army and attack other people, get attacked etc. etc. I'm sure someone will correct me on the abreviation for that kind of game but I cant remember right now. Now here are some  VERY IMPORTANT  distinctions from the rest of those games that I and many people have been asking and looking for but have never found with other games similar to this one. The developers built into the game features that actually prevent a P2W environment!  For example there is absolutely no 'Low Energy! Come back tomorrow... OR pay us $5-$10-$20-$50(best BS deal!) to keep playing!' because  there is no energy.  You cannot be attacked or attack players of higher or lower level (premium units? stronger opponents!) and  you cannot be attacked while offline!   Finally, thank you!  Waiting for resources to gather and/or something to finish building and feel like there's nothing more to do in town? Make an army and go fight NPC/AI on the world map for gold and then use your spoils of war to buy those resources or even new units! Oh did i mention this is a great way to level up your units at the same time? Or just log off and go live your life and come back to find the resources collected while you were offline! Yes there is 'premium' currency  but  it is  reasonably and realisticly  obtainable in-game for your time + effort for free! Quest's and NPC/AI battle's being the best way I've found persoanlly. An actually entertaining story line. A suprisingly indepth and well made system for selecting your race, skills, and city location(s).  Single player  modes including campaign, seige, and seige defence.  You do have to pay $2 to unlock each of these modes however.  Personally this is not an issue for me as I don't plan on using single player mode, however it could be very useful to try out different seige strategies and really $2-$6 for this game is a ridiculously good deal considering some of the alpha games on here that cost $15 in the  hope  that they turn out good. Predetermined building locations make your city(s) astheticly pleasing, strategically challenging and easy to build! None of that layers and layers of wall's shinanigans like every one of those crappy web-based Base Building RTSMMO's Wow those first five elements are  exactly what people have been asking for in games similar to this for years.  That is a  huge  reason I like this game. Now I can feel satisfied that I finally found a good game out there where the developers/owner(s)/publisher actually give a **** about what me, the player, wants in a game rather than how much money is on the paycheck. From the bottom of my heart,  thank you  and I hope you cotinue building the game like this while keeping the same ideals! You know what's even better? If you actually do spend money on the game, lets say you buy a dragon for your army,  they protect your investment.  While your normal units disappear forever when they die, your premium units, like the dragon you bought, only get knocked out and lose a few levels. Oh and you can't make an army of just dragons because that would be P2W plus they can still be countered and defeated by a prepared player, there's a dragon slayer i got for  free  after all. Right off the bat they are giving me a unit that counters one of the stronger units in the game! To make it even more balanced there's a unit cap, each unit takes up a certain amount of space, so you have to choose what you bring to battle wisely, a small but individually strong group of heavy hitters? Perhaps a massive amount of inexpensive foot soldiers with archers? It's all about the strategy, not who had the larger wallet. Also you wanna know something awesome the premium days you can buy in this game? You choose which days you want to use them for. How many games can you think of that actually do that for their players? Personally i don't know a single one, because money. Now for the other side of the coin, this game has flaws as all games natuarlly do. Animations are decent, but not great. Yes things still take time to build but it's not ridiculous amounts (i.e. 5-7 days). You have to pay for extra cities (gotta make money somehow so this is perfectly reasonable and fine with me). The controls can't be customized and are a bit clunky, biggest issue for me personally is the right mouse button. It controls your units  but  it also moves the camera if you have a single unit selected, very annoying esspecially when your trying to moe just your hero. plus there's is a very noticeable delay between the click and the effect (at least for me on my laptop). Then sometimes nothing happens at all. Trying to organize and manage your units is awkward and needs to be streamed lined. Especially when you have to do it quickly (Very Frustrating). Not to mention you have to indiviually select units to activate their abilites/magic/skills/powers which is very hard when they are in combat. Theres also some minor graphical errors, especially when the weather changes and in a couple of cut scene's where the character(s) slowly turns invisible and OHMYGODTHEIREYESANDMOUTH! Personally I find that last type of glitch hilarious as it's actually pretty common in a lot of games. Upgrades and improvements of any and all kind require 'premium' currency, walls for example require an especially large ammount and you have 4 different one's to build, but like i said about premium currency, it is obtainable in-game for a reasonable amout of time and effort so a somewhat moot point. Still I love this game and plan on continuing to play it for quite some time at a casual level, kill some time here and there, build this and that, do a quest here and there. This is a game that easily works with how you play games, hard-core, casual, it dosen't matter because it caters to any type of play style. I have only been playing for 9.3 hrs at the time of this writing but i can already feel that within 30-45 days, I will have an impressive city and army to boot and will be knocking down a few peoples walls! I absolutely, highly recommend this game for people looking for a RTSMMO with RPG elements that lets you play at your own pace, your own schedule, your own style, your own budget and actually rewards you if you dont want to play all-day-everyday and throw money at it. Even if you do throw money at it it still goes  far beyond  what any other game I have played or known will do for you for your investment. See you on the battle field and if you attack me, you shall feel the power and dismay of my elven arrows and Magical superiority!This review helpful in anyway?

												I would like to start off by saying that I am a big RTS\RPG fan.  I am also a big fan of MMO games.  I have played this game with an open mind, as I suggest anyone else who tries this game, do without having any pre-conceived ideas or expectations.  The game mechanics are very user-friendly and easy to become accostumed to.  I have read many comments regarding the graphics.  Being an older gamer (over 40) I found myself getting a little nostalgic, which I really liked.  The game is excellent.  The concept is great.  The experience is one of the best I have had.  The most appealing aspect of this game, in my opinion, is that it is Free-To-Play.  Keep in mind that it is a RTS game and it will take time to do all the great stuff there is to do in this game.  So without further ado, good luck building your Kingdom and forging your Empire!			"

												Now color me surprised when i find out there is a FTP MMO RTS that does not take after facebooks track history of special in-game currency that only money provides, color me when more suprised when it turns out to be a game remarkably simular to my childhood favorite Age of Empires.Kingdom Wars is a MMO base builder Real time stratagy game that takes after Age of empires. It takes you into a wonderfully colorfull and well groomed fantasy land that is gorgouse to look at the more you adventure. Aside from Peasents and their endless offers of potato's you'll find a colorfull collection of unit types and specials that all races can use.Thats right. you can be a human race, and have elven archers with orc brutes as your spearhead force. Whats more cool then that?Oh right DRAGONS!!! You Can Have Dragons at your beck and call!!Kingdom Wars brings to life THE entire fantasy adventure, dwarfs, elves, giant treeents, rampaging warg packs, ogres minotaurs and more await you in this well packed game. And its all Free to play. Additionally you can enjoy the entire game without having to spend money into it. Not that the fancy customization options wont tempt you.As this is still a growing game, there are to be expected issues here and there, but with a lively staff, and friendly active in-game moderators anything that does happen can be worked out and solved so you can return to rasing your kingdom and adventuring across the world.

												Kingdom Wars is a very nice game with many interesting things. I play it for a very long period und it still motivate me to play more and more. It is fair to all Players. No pay to win. You can have all the things in the game without pay with your Money. I personally think it is boring to read such reviews. So click on that green button in Steam and Launch the game. You will not regret it.... and sorry for bad english. :)			"

It's almost like Total War campaign in multiplayer! And there's units that's immortal like your hero so that's great. And daily rewards :D  I highly recommand this game for people who's got a strong love for strategy games.			"

												Having grown up with the Stronghold series, this is a must try for anyone following in similar footsteps.There are several features that I love from Kingdom Wars that gives it that little boost:Firstly Resources are gathered when you are both on and offline which help greatly, especially when you are trying to raise funds to buy crowns.Decent F2P Model. While there are always the Cape-Crusaders who will nitpick at every F2P and say how P2W it is, even though they aren’t, KWs is a Play to Win as opposed to Pay to Win. While there are of course boosts and the ‘premium’ currency, all of this is earned in game and is rather pay for convenience.And one of the best things I have seen on here is the fantastic moderator team they have in game.

												Kingdom Wars is a great game if you like city building and rts games. I have spent over 100 hours playing and love it.  The game does have bugs and crashes once in a while though.  You can use ingame money to buy pvp protection if you do not like pvp.  You may notice that the game has a cash shop and think that the things the packages gives are overpowered like 100k gold and 5 minotaurs and so on.  That amount of gold is easy to get after a day of playing and minotaurs are only good if you know how to use them.  The game is not pay to win in any way since the amount of bundles you can purchase is limited and everything you get from the bundles can be killed or looted.  I have personally destroyed people with bundle troops with some of the weakest troops in the game because they did not know how to use them.Overall a great game that I recommend.			"

												You know what would be ♥♥♥♥ing great, if the game actually launched. Or if the e-mail I sent about the issue, got responded to. Or if my account wasn't deleted, or EVEN if they just brought it back again. That'd be great. Unfortunately, and obviously, none of the above have come to fruition. I really loved this game when it got 're-'released. I'd love to be able to play it again now. I'd love the jump on and see what my kingdom has become and rebolster it to what it was. But I can't even get past about 10-15% loading time in the start-up. This isn't just game breaking, there may as well be no game at all if the loading screen is the only thing I see. Please fix this waiting room simulator.			"

												Not a free to play - This is not a free to play game, and it is easy to see that it is not. Most games that are MMO city builders like this rely heavily on users buying boosters. This games does not. First of all, there are only three boosters in the game, and you can not use more than 1 of them per in-game account/city. The boosters that are there give you resources that are helpful to a beginner, but if you build your city up a bit, they can easily be aquired.PvP - When I first started, I was afraid of going into the PvP part of the game. I was afraid that people who have already made giant cities and huge armies could walk in and take all of my things; this is definitely not the case. They have balanced the game enough so that you can only fight people within 10% of your army strength. 10% is so little, that it makes you rely only on good tactics. It makes EVERY siege/co-op/defence really fun and actually a really good match. Also, most of the online playing is co-op, which is honestly one of the most fun parts of the game. You can raid AI cities or do quests with your friends, and it makes the gameplay really fun, without getting completely screwed over. Also, if you REALLY do not like PvP, you can buy the single player campaign for only $1.99, which is honestly a good deal for how fun this game is.Building your city - It is hard to build your city at the start, since resources are scarce. This is the point where the co-op takes place and is a big help. You can do quests with your friends and fight armies, and take all of the resources off of their cold dead bodies. This part beats every other city builder into dust. You can actually command your armies, instead of it being auto resolved for you. The game features 3 different races: humans, elves, and orcs. Each race is very balanced, and it would be a very hard decision on if you were to ask which race was the best. This lets you face other online players (or play WITH them) without worrying that their units are SOO much better than yours.Raiding cities - Later on, once you have a big and tough army, you can start raiding AI cities. There are 30 (from my knowledge) cities that you can siege and either loot or make your vassel. Looting can be helpful, and gives you a lot of resources; while vassels give you resources over time.Do not be turned away because it is an online city builder. Most of this game is co-op, instead of facing other players. You can join a clan and help each other out by sending each other resources. My in-game name is Enki, for anyone who has any more questions or wants to raid some AI with me! :)			"

												This game has been a roller coaster. I first bought it on GameStop because of the promise of a single player mode which did eventually happen. I noticed MAJOR performance hits on Steam and Reverie's developers suggested using their OWN client which users reported provided a MUCH better experience in terms of performance. THEN Reverie discontinued their own client, and even on this I7 rig I have, this game lags and stutters while games like Supreme Commander and Supreme Commander 2 - develpped around the same time and with MUCH larger worlds and literally thousands of units runs beautifully. This game has has a troubled history and a visit to the HeavenGames forum for this game will reveal that history.The single player risk like portion of the game has been removed. This is strictly a PvP type game. If that's your thing, then you will like this game. I prefer single player and coop PvE. All of that said, I really hate writing this somewhat negative review as Reverie seem to be a stidio that really wants to make this game something special. The problem however - and you'll note other users have expressed the same concern in the Hub for this game - is that Reverie keeps releasing mega-patches but fails to address core game issues. When, as a company, ypou get rid of something that improves performance while simiultaneously releasing more and ""bigger"" stuff is really taking one step forward and two steps back. If you'll pardon the trope, this COULD have been the RTS fantasy strategy game to rule them all. It isn't unfortunately so it's back to playing Medieval Total War from the physical discs for me. I am sorry Reverie, you tried but you lack focus.			"

												Extremely horrible game. I thought it would be like Age of Empires II but it's even worse than Age of Empires I. The movement is clunky, the interface doesn't work well and you have to level up/upgrade almost everything. It is way more similar to a click-farm like maybe Clash of Clans / Utopia. This is a city-builder, not an MMORTS.PROS1. UnsureCONS1. PvP Protection?You can build it later in the game to buy PvP Protection. You can build a building to buy PvP Protection.2. CrownsAlmost every good building is limited by Crowns, which you get on quests. 3. MovementExtremely slow.4. AIYour hero just runs off and attacks the nearest creature within visible range. You can't move the hero away with a right-click because there is some attack-move encoded.5. GraphicsHorrible. How could a game have worst graphics than an older game? e.g. Age of Empires II "

Be prepared to lose armies to crashes and weird void bugs or a common one is where the walls will be going but you dont have them. If you try to build there you lose all the resource and the building isn't built.There is no pay to win and most of the stuff being sold is cosmetic or one time buy for resource per city (Can only have one city unless you pay for more) It is rediculously fun and it would be a game I would pay subscription for if they fixed the bugs and tweaked a few things.All in all it is an awesome game and well worth your time.

												Feels a lil glued up in the unit tasking, but other than that looks good in my mind and instantly had a lil bit of a Black and White feel to it. I like that units are in platoons, but a more Total war approach with unit orders in battle would be nice. I give it a personal 8/10Edit 1:So now that Ive gotten some more time in the game, I must say Ive been gladly surprised with Kingdom Wars. However, as with any game, there are problems, and Ill try my best to be the most helpful I can to new players and to the devs in ideas I have. 1. units orders: The manner in which units are ordered around the battlefield is good to a point, but seriously sucks in combat. Basically, if you arn't used to normal RTS games and using those command groups, then be prepared to be annoyed. The forming of solid lines of defense/attack are simple to the point of insanity. You either just run everything up at once, save for cavalry and archers, and hope you win or you take too long to form proper lines and risk taking huge damaged from enemy archer or crossbowmen in the process. The way to fix this in my mind would be to rip the current system and add in a more Total war type of battle system, making for a more fluid experience (Or just add in the ability to lock different formations to a hotkey, Idk)2. The economy: This games economy surprised me for the better in some areas, but I found lack luster in others. The dominate reliance on wood is good, but the ability to build houses out of stone instead of wood would make for the bigger projects and upgrades coming faster, and make the city look better if they had the textures to match. The crown system is amazing, being a resource that you gain from gold instead of a bought currency for real money, and making it essential to manage your crown total very carefully so not to leave you without that one vital upgrade. The food resource in this game also makes for fun play in that there are not just farms but also animals to use to produce and it just adds a much greater sense of life to your city.3. The combat: The full on combat of this game is the biggest complaint I have. It seems that the battles try to simulate tactics, but in the end it seems all that is needed is to have a direct line to enemy units and just be a Russian as possible (Quantity wins) I would recommend changing it up to make it so certain units like the crossbowmen would do so much damage that it basicallly one hits units. Another this is the special units. Through the quests I recieved a Dragonslayer, which in my mind, would be fairly good agaisnt Dragons. But when I sent him agianst the Dragon that spawned as part of the quest, well, lets just say the rest of my army was quickly heading that way. I believe that some of the special units should be very, very good against what they are meant to go against.This is my current review, as I discover more of the game and figure it out for myself, Ill let every one know what I think, still a 8/10.A video review will be uploaded within the next day or two, will post link with this written one.

												Without Question the best game ive ever played full of great quests and the races are amazing i play as an elf as i love the way the can transmute resources. The race of men is good as it brings a traditianol style to warfare. Orcs are savage as you would expect and can build many small towns the combat is good and requires planning and reckless thinking can get your army killed. I like the daily rewards as they help me save up for that wall upgrade or unit one. I have played this game for 42 hours and are still learning and need a boost of crowns to help me and are stuck on the elven quest of defending the princess.			"

												I have played this game for a few hours now.  It does need some work, its sluggish in areas, and it can be unforgiving.  The game has tons of potential!  I have enjoyed the time I have played.  If I knew that the game plays the way it does then I would have got it when it was Dawn of Fantasy and you had to pay for it.  Thats how much I like it right now.  If this opinion changes I will update.Ok.  I still really like this game.  I am noticing some bugs.  I have an issue when I try to start a quest on the world map it will not load correctly and I have to restart the game.  Also there seems to be some sorta disconnect between what happens on the quests and what my army is like when I get back to the world map.This game has awesome potential.  The devs. are working to make it more polished.  After a few fixes and maybe a graphical overhaul (not horrible but could really be better) this could be one of the best fantasy empire building games I have played.			"

												Without Question the best game ive ever played full of great quests and the races are amazing i play as an elf as i love the way the can transmute resources. The race of men is good as it brings a traditianol style to warfare. Orcs are savage as you would expect and can build many small towns the combat is good and requires planning and reckless thinking can get your army killed. I like the daily rewards as they help me save up for that wall upgrade or unit one. I have played this game for 42 hours and are still learning and need a boost of crowns to help me and are stuck on the elven quest of defending the princess.			"

												Game is fully out but still feels like a beta, here are some exemples of what i mean.- it is slow.- units dont attack when they should be.- doen't have the pay-to-win aspect (as they claimed), but man does it feel like its there. Real money to buy in-game currency to upgrade, speed up, and get resources faster. Also theres a flashing icon that annoyed the hell out of me for me to join ""membership"" which is based on real $$$.- Glitches and breaks half the time.To simplify, its free but don't wast your time with this game because it seems broken and/or badly done.

												The best I can say about it: a pretty gameOtherwise Other games beat it from almost every point of view (possibly less from the claimed unique siege point of view)EXTREMELY aggressive on pushing the player on spending cash. Contrary to the developers statement this is a VERY pay 2 win game. Unless you are prepared to spend a constant amount of cash be prepared to not be able to upgrade your units or buildings, nor will you be able to get tat group of units which can actually put up a fight and you will be stuck with VERY basic units.

												This game so full of bugs that i'm surprised bugs aren't flying out of my computer smacking me in the face. There nothing that isn't bugged in this game it has bugged quest that get so bad that it just breaks your whole town forcing you to delete it, and start a new. Like the first quet for the orc race which wants you to lore a orger into a spike trap after completeing it the spike trap suppose to disppaer, but it doesn't an everytime one of your workers or warriors walks over it it completely kills them everytime, and the orger respawn in your town killing you workers, and warriors everytime you reload your town. Then there pathfind bugs siege units get stuck on walls units get stuck climbing siege ladder or just stop moving for the reset of an instance if they some how survie a spike trap. Then Fire really annoying your troops will run into, and try to attack it for some reason, and even when it gone your unit still take damage when there in the area that was on fire. There some werid gather bug that just start in the most recent patch it took me 3 hours to collect 2 pieaces of wood when i had 10 workers try to cut wood. It should be 3-15 wood every sec depend on research or amount of workers. There also a bug with the ingame currency were you'll just randomly lose all of it for no reason so don't pay really cash on crowns cause you will lose them for no reason. Also you can gain crowns from PVP/PVE, but that also bugged 60% of the time your not reward with them after a match. An this is only about 1/5 of the bugs in the game there many more like treants bugged movement speed sometime they have a movement speed of 9999 they'll be so fast they just teleport across the battle field other time they have a movement speed of 2 they move so slow it takes them 3 hours to get across a map. There also a bug with the single player were it will say your cheating, and are unable to play the single player. The best bug so far is this extremely annoying bug that will just roll back your whole town to what it was when you started it when you get attack by another player, and the devs say this is a very rare which is Bull-**** cause it happen to about 15 people everyday which compared to the fact that 1000-1500 people login every day it about 1% of the population. So after 20 days 20% of the population town has been completely rolled back to the begining.  An the Devs are useless they don't fix bugs they take forever to post on the forums, hell there was one time were the devs didn't post anything on there website for 6 months striaght. People just started saying the game shutting down on there forums, and they didn't reply to any of thos post what they did do was delete thos post when they started posting on there site again. An for some reason the Devs are ban happy as it stands banning people for no reason at all. So overall don't waste your money on this game if you want to play it to see how buggy it is your self then just wait for it to go F2P/P2W.			"

												This is not worth your time, at first glance a ""MMORTS"" sounds fun. But there are huge problems with pathfinding, ever see a army you spent hours building up walk into siege fire and die? this game will do it. most of your battles will be farming the same area of the map repeatedly for ""crowns"" a currency you can farm or buy from the shop. I spent two days building an army and had no way to get any more crowns, the minimap in your battles is horrendous and isnt even working in real time, it ♥♥♥♥ing updates off of refreshes every couple of seconds. the graphics are so poor you sometimes cant pick out smaller units from the terrain. I dont even know how to structure all of the problems. If it was one or two big things fine, its an indie dev. But there are so many small things wrong with the game that the act of playing the game forces you into a battle with the game itself, you have to fight the bad game design to play this. and thats a real shame, i want to love it.

												This game is built in such a way to make it take easily a month to be able to have a structured castle and armys and in my oppinion this game has alot of talent and will become even better the more they add to it iv played just about 95% of all RTS games and this would be probly number 1 from design and structure of the game's build and just the way been put together makes me very happy to be a member of this game. I recomend this game to anyone who likes a RTS game that lasts more then 3 hours, also i wont lie it has a few bugs but the Dev team/Mod team have been working so hard to fix this game so it runs at 100% without any bugs which im glad they are. which i give this game a 15/10 lol its excellant in my honest full oppinion out of all the hundreds of games i have this is definitly top of list.Graphics: updated graphics like Battle for middle earth 2.Design: love it xDvoice/sound: brilliantly done made it very much like the medievil age which is a bonusWild fires: love the fact you can create bush fires and catch people and anything except rocks on fire.resources: love the way they set it up to calculate resources per minite.Units: they have literaly put all medievl units in this game plus dwarven/elves/orcs so its got lots of variaty which gives the game more choices.All up love the game recommended to anyoneAlso sorry for any miss spelled words.

												I noticed that a lot of people are not recommending this game because of the feature, ""Pay to win"", is in the game but that is entirely optional. You don't have to pay. You only pay for the game with everything in it. Nothing forces you to pay. Not sure if that feature is still in the game though.Also I saw one review saying that you have to join the game by signing up on their website. That is not true although You have to register ingame and then receive an confirmation email for you to complete the registeration. This process do not take more than two minutes. You are required to do this in order to play the game online with friends and others. That's it.Anyway my review...Overall and ongoing, it is a fun game. I enjoy playing against AIs enemies as well as players whilst doing the storyline. I use the term, storyline, very loosely because it is almost very direct but you can do the quests whenever and in your own time. Yes, the game can and should have been better than what it is at the moment but I don't complain because it is a decent game.However it can be ugly due to cutscenes when you have conversations with some certain characters in the ""storyline."" The characters, by looking very closely, they look like they came from 90s games like Castle Strike or the old Warcraft series unless I forget to improve the graphics in the settings lol but that is manageable anyway because you don't look that closely often.Overall, I would say this is 7/10. Better than some games but could have been better.			"

												Kingdom wars is a great game that I would totally recommend. The gameplay is fun, and slightly addicting, yet its also enjoyable to log off and next time you log in you have the resources, gathered by your peasants while away, to get right back to work at building your kingdom. The graphics aren't the best but their plenty good in my opinion. The combat is enjoyable, sieges are fun, and sometimes costly to your army, and overall, its got loads of enjoyable content. Also, I sent an email to support and recieved a super quick and super kind response plus was generously compensated once the issue was fixed, and they fixed it in no time at all, quite impressive.

												Well i may not have played for a long period of time in this game and it seems like i cannot login into the game now due to some bugs. I still think this is a good game overall, which is why even after i encounter a rare bug which still have had yet to be solved and the developers are working on it. The pros and cons are much like what other players have posted out in the reviews. I personally think the most attractive thing about kingdom wars are the pvp system and city protection shield. Unlike other games, this city protection shield only tickles when you are online on your kingdom and playing. When you go offline, your shield will be the same as when you login again. That is extremely attractive for players like me who are busy at work with little time to play games everyday. In other games, you will normally get sieged and lose resources or even the whole kingdom and you have to restart again which is very frustrating. Here, you can take things slowly as you want, explore the maps, conquer some npc cities or co-op siege with the community. If you have the time and army, you can just remove your shield and get onto some pvp for more fun.There are no worries on how you play and whether if there are overpowered players that pays to win as everyone is more or less the same depending on what strategy you use and time spent to experience the game. I hope everyone finds it fun to play too.			"

												To be clear, the game is free; payment only gives you access to two one-use-only-ever chests of resources which you don't need one bit. There are also a couple DLCs, but if you look at development/patch notes you realise the vanilla game is rich and you won't want to pay for the stupid DLCs even into late game (e.g. there's a SP-only dlc - for the incompetent only). Please read on.3 races to choose from. Build your city, your army, your garrison, whatever labour forces you may want. Two very important factors that I find separate this game from those you may think this is similar to (involving MMO strategy games with building a settlement):1) You can't be attacked when offline. If you're not logged in and playing, you can't be attacked - meaning you don't need to worry or dedicate ANY time to this game. (You also have a cancellable 24hr-game-time-only battle protection for noobs, after which you'll have a great base. Additionally, battles are always between similar-strength forces).2) Your buildings can't be destroyed beyond 1% health. No conflict you will ever have will reset your city. Your buildings will be repaired over time and you'll just lose a token amount of resources, from what I understand you'll even get a few crowns (useful for upgrades or renaming units etc).I recommend, if you have any interest in a forgiving MMO RTS game with visual battles and really quite rich content, you should download and try a couple of the races. Read the descriptions to see what you'd be interested in and have a go. Just be wise on how you spend your crowns in the beginning as they're earned through quests (story line), battles, daily-gift of 1 crown if you login and trading in gold. P.S. you will want to make gold one of your primary mining operations, because if you shop around at some NPC towns/cities, you can usually buy more than 100 of any resource with 100 gold.I first tried the orcs (about 8 hrs), which I liked but I didn't do very well with.. Then I went to try the elves (now 14 hrs) and I love them. I don't get to design my city layout because we build in trees... but it's fun enough. Check out some of my woodelf screenshots.			"

												Greetings steam comunity,5cents on why this game is recommendet by me and why you should waste a part of youre precious livetime playing it.First of all - why should one play it?- its fun- its free- its got castels- its got dragons (some of them slightly three headed)- its got mad magics- its not a pay2winTo give this a more serious aproach - the pro stuff:+ The game is a fine mixed castle building, army training and stuff wrecking experience(, a little of what i wanted as a stronghold fan :) ).+ Three playable races - elves, man and orcs.+ The gameplay of the battles is well done. Whyle the overal controling mechanism is rather simple one may invest some energy into the micromanagement of unit stances and rotations to gain the best from the troops efforts.+/- The castle is limited to a few number of designs and placement spots - which are nicely done to alow the player a rather wide range of tactical options.+ The Armys consist of up to 60 units, including sige engines and workers to get all those shiny coins from the corpses. As the units gain experience they may be upgradet to fit the players needs.+ The KI citys are chalanging and differ greatly in theyr designs+ The pvp system seems promising, presenting some late game challange, interesting battles and army compositions and the rather easy and fair mechanics of avoiding it by paying a part of ones ressources to the attacker.+ The overal unit ballancing seems to be sound and while its not perfect the developers are working to improve it.+ The comunity is alive and quite friendly.To play it is a little like....One may upgrade his camp to a formidable stronghold. While the walls rise high the troops may march to complete the first quests and plunder some stuff on the way. By doing so one aquires the in game currency of crowns - and even if there is a rather great heap of those in the in game store, the number one may get there is limited.In time the army will get experienced and gain enough power to take on the great citys of the world. The choice between looting a vanquished city or taking it on as a vassal is rather rewarding - more so if you just managed to gain a victory inside the walls of the capital :).On the dark side ther are a few things to be said:- The KI is just not up to the task. While the unit KI is ok with only some minor *whydoyoustupidhealersengagetheogersinmeeleagain >.<* kind of problems the KI troops on the battlefield remain stationary until engaged, most of the time. Most of the movements an enemy will do are rushing his remaining troops into the keep, if you break don its gate, and some counter charges if this gate did not belong to the keep. The odd exeption is a charge of the reinforcement troop. Those apear after half an hoer into a KI sige and are pathetically easy to block, by disengaging your troops from the city and mincing the reinforcements. - The ballancing of the fractions is not finished yet. The orc race seems to be a little on the downside, in the overal army performance.- There are few end game challanges out of pvp matches. If one has put some thought into the army composition and the upgrading of ones troops there will be next to nothing left to stop this army.-/+ The game is still in the making. While not essentialy bad, one may get slightly annoied by a few bugs and gliitches. Also ive experienced two mayor bugs up until now, of the *dude where is my castle?* kind. On the other hand: those where solved in a matter of one or two days and the mods did theyr best to recompensate the losses. Also one may hope to see some further improvements to the gameplay and some more content to come.oh, and cookies, because.... you know....In summa summarum i recommend this game.Hope to see you (try) torching my city some time :),best regards, Cyraion.

												An excellent game overall, that will immerse most RTS players for at least a good few hours.Its fairly simple, with a very traditional setup of the three factions with strenghts and weaknesses. such as the Humans being the most durable overall, the Elves essentially having the strongest units but with greater weaknesses, and the Orcs being oddly enough the most frail but boasting the ability to quickly amass an army of considerable size at reduced cost.(Please note: This is more of a quick run-down of some of the features in the game, than an review. The idea is that you can more effectively decide if its features appeals to you, rather than read someone trash n praise it)Leveling up your units!:This game relies quite heavily on the concept of your troops not simply being something you purchase enough of, in the right combination but actually take into skirmishes to level up or train at friendly strongholds, to then tailor suit what stats you want to improve, such as more health, damage mitigation, health regeneration, stamina, and so on. Eventually you will pretty much max out all the stats but at that point you have spend quite a lot of gold on that unit, and considering its still very likely to get inconveniently killed while you look the other way you learn to pay special heed to keeping your investments alive and well protected. Special Units:Every faction has an array of faction specific units available to them, but theres also a common pool of special units available to all the factions. These units have roots in all three main factions, but theres also units from unplayable races, such as Dragons and Dwarves. These units almost always costs you Crowns, which is a measure of wealth and influence that you can spend on recruiting considerably attractive units to attack your enemies or defend your homeland.Quest line:Theres an rather involved lore in the game, and its often very nicely attached to the characters you interact with while playing the main quest line. As you go through the main quest of your faction your tasked with defending your homeland, your kingdom, and waging war against the two other factions in the game, and often also your own. Due to the somewhat sandbox-like nature of the game, the senarios you find yourself in is often rather interesting and gradually gives you useful rewards that greatly benefit the construction of your homeland, giving a smooth progression of your homeland, the story of the game, and your involvement in the game overall.Traits and RegionsIn the MMO portion of the game, after choosing a faction you will be asked to choose a region and two traits.These are important and should be chosen to match how you prefer to play the game. If your a ""turtle"" and enjoys defensive gameplay then naturally you may want to choose the most defensive region and traits, but if your more into siege and conquest than naturally you would do well to take a region that reflects that better.Either way, your choice of region and traits will play an immense factor in the performance of your strategies.Choose wisely. :)Non-Mandatory PvPIn the online MMO portion of the game you may be attacked by enemies at any time, but you need to actually accept the battle. Should you choose not to, or let the timer run out you will forfeit a small portion of your resources as a tribute to be left alone. Even if no resources are available fighting PvP is never mandatory. As you start out with a new homeland you will have 24 hours of real time protection against PvP attacks to get you started. Notice that this time is only ticking while your in-game. Additionally, every time you pay a tribute or conclude a PvP match you will be given a small PvP Protection time.It is also possible to purchase PvP protection for Crowns.The graphics, performance, and the gameplay itself have gradually improved over time, with updates coming out frequently enough for a game you only pay for once. (Not including the micro transaction-like boosts available in the market, and additional features) The gameplay in singleplayer, whether in the online MMO world or not, is very stable but once you have an actual fight not against the AI, but another player it soon becomes a bit of a mess.(This includes co-op aswell) Reasonably playable, yes, but still very annoying at times. However, they have worked hard to improve this game and the future update expected to come out this month, which will apperantly overhaul the entire thing onto a more stable engine will hopefully bring back much of the player base and thus hopefully bring some more life back into this, in all honesty, very awesome game.(If you wish to know more details about the game, i have found a wiki with more details for you)http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Dawn_of_FantasyYes, it does have some problems now and then but this game does deserve a chance if it calls out to you in general.Regards,Brandt.

												I've played for almost 7 hours and still don't have an army big enough to lay siege to another town, making for a boring experience. (The ""Very Easy"" opponent is still twice as strong as my army.) Starting out, resource-gathering is agonizingly slow. The UI is a mess; there are actually elements that overlap, and some elements aren't explained, so I don't even know what clicking on them does. Certain resources, like deers for elves, you can't count, or delete, but there is apparently a limit on how many you should create. The graphics are low quality, even on max settings. At times, it is difficult to actually see what I'm looking at.I've been an RTS gamer since the original AOE and SC. I've played Total War, Stronghold, C&C, Empire Earth, etc. I love the genre, and I love the concept that the developers are trying to implement with this game, but it's just very unenjoyable to play, even though I really wanted to like this game.

												Kingwom Wars I still remember my thrill when I heard about this game being released. If I had to explain this game in one sentence it would be: The game is like Travian, Tribal Wars, ... but in real time 3D RTS mode.I have little play time on steam, that is because steam release was buggy at start, it payed off more to play using official launcher, meaning not using steam. The gameplay is simple, you start with a town which you upgrade. It has no deep depth of techology, it is rather simple and straight forward. You do not even need super strong economy to get decent army. I mostly play Elfs since I find their economy and troops most suitable to me (Archers :) ). Game has single player and multiplayer side which do no differ too much. You can play singleplayer offline with no problems, multiplayer gets you closer to other players. Multiplyer is same as singleplayer but you can go into CO-OP battles with other players, either with or against them. Maximum players inbattle are 2v2, which is kinda limiting. Guild/Clan/Alliance has meaning in terms helping each other during attacks. Game itself looks like Total wars series where troops and cities are managed on global map, while battle itself is in spirit of total war series where 2 armies clash. Combat system is same as with total war series archers(mounted, foot, crossbows), infantry(heavy knights, pikemen, swordsmen), cavalry (one type mounted knight, elfs have mounted archers), monsters with orcs etc. Each unit formation could lvl till 20 and had stat points for you to manually upgrade which provides decent ammount of depth. Each unit type has its special skills, where some have to be researched using crows, which are acquired with battles and quests. At start it was that simple, during time game developers kept close contact with comunity and invested great time to fixing bugs and providing new content. At release time game was once time purchase, now it is free to play model with premium. New content added mages, dragons, dwarfs, new heroes/special units, sieges but for all of it you need massive ammount of crowns which arent easy to get. There are also some bugs where you spend 250 crowns, but s*it happens, server reverses your upgrade and town state and u lose 250 crowns which finally made me quit game. Game itself is fun and worth playing, developers are moving forward and wont forsake the game, but KW2 is comming and you can feel that they are more focused on that release. Have fun it is nice game.			"

I especially like to mention the wide variety of play style to choose but this game could use some improvement. In the future I belive that Kingdom Wars should edit the ways to get into a co-op with a friend because that is one of the few things that it took me and my friend a while to get going but other than that and some various bugs I see nothing else to get this game a bad review 10/10.

												I played Dawn of Fantasy back in its early closed beta. It was...horrible. So many game breaking glitches, errors, units disappearing, the hero disappearing...just so many things. Luckily, the developpers are always on the prowl so they listened to everything we had to say...and they still do today. I've rarely seen developpers being so active, especially for such a lengthy amount of time.Now...I have yet to find a single bug. It took some time, but the game is in a great functioning state. There are a little jitters here and there, but they don't cause any real problems. This game has three races: Orks, Elves, and Humans. There is also the rumor of the possible coming undead race, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. (See...See what I did there? Ahead? You know...un...undea-Headless Horseman...)Unlike many other RTS games where the differences are just aesthetical or very minor, all three races are heavily different from eachother. Where humans use peasants to mine, chop wood, and kill livestock, elves need wood spirits to gather wood. And the other races do not have the same form of livestock as the humans. Elves have unicorns and Orks have a type of 'boar'. Both can be used in combat and, while the boar can be killed and have its meat taken, the unicorns give a steady trickle of gold (and can be used to protect your gatherers from wolves).When you create a new race, you have the option to choose from three different regions of that race's territories. The only thing that changes, I've noticed, is the landscape. This affects the placement of your soon-to-be walls and will create different kinds of tactics when attacking and defending players/npc towns. Afterwards, you have the option of choosing between different traits that will become permanent for that city, although the region you choose already possesses a few natural traits that will be added to your two choices. This makes some strategic decisions on developping your region change, as the traits affect ressource income, training, building, and stats of units. Units are also varied. Where humans have a good balance between unit types (melee, range, siege, cavalry), orks are more centered around melee, health, and anger issues, while elves are more centered around range and speed. I might be mistaking, but this is how I've percieved all three.Some units have abilities specific to them, such as human knights being able to heal nearby units or the elves ranged cavalry being able to use an arrow volley (accelerates their firing rates).For you, the player, you are represented by a 'hero' (that you can rename with crowns. More on those later). This hero allows you to interact with NPCs on the maps, allowing you to buy and sell ressources, buy mercenaries (this is the only way to get units from the other factions), or train your troops (including your hero). To travel on the world map, you need your hero to lead the army that you create. Depending on what units you bring with you, the amount of ressources you can carry with you increases. You can only carry a certain amount of wood, meat, and stone, so be cautious. As for your gold, you can carry however much you want! Except 'thieves' will start stealing the amount that exceeds your ressource cap. This also happens in your town.You have several options when travelling on the world map. You can set up a camp (with three defensive levels depending on the ressources that army possesses) which allows you to attack player cities. These camps can let you mine for ressources (if you have gatherers) and recruit units from your race to bolster your sieging force. You can also fight on the map, allowing you to see what is in the region. If you do it from a camp, you'll have a place to retreat to if you're overwhelmed. If you have no defences, well...This is a great way to see the regions without towns or cities. Sssilistra, for example...Nah. Why would I spoil that for you?You can also siege the npc towns on the map and conquer them, they become 'allied' with you. Plus, you get to loot the corpses on that map if you have gatherers and won. Hooray for corpse desecration! Otherwise, there's not much use with allying with npc towns apart from trading, but that only gives you a fickle amount of ressource income.Sieging can be slow, especially with the accuracy provided by your trebuchets/siege catapults/ bolt throwers, and with the many defenses that can be placed in a city or town, you best be wise on where you go to fight as you can be annihilated in just a few seconds. The fun part is when you enter the city after tearing down the walls and the defenses.Now, there's the matter of crowns and special units. Before you ask; No. The special units do not cause a pay-to-win situation. They can killed just as easily as any other unit...sometimes. It depends on the unit. First, let's talk about crowns. Crowns are the special currency bought with in-game money, but they can also be obtained in-game via combat and completing quests. These are used for research and constructing certain buildings. The demands for the buildings are minor and will certainly just take you a single trip on the world map and 'entering the region' to get the crowns needed. A few bandits and there you go. You got your building plus some extra. You might've gotten enough for the beginner's research too!Now, for the special units. Before the game became free to play, you just needed enough crowns to buy a dwarf unit or a dragon from the market. Now, you need not only the crowns, but the building as well, and these take a CRAZY amount of ressources to build! Not only that, but you have the crowns that are eaten up by the buildings. This prevents everyone from having too many of these units seeing how powerful they are. I find it both logical and crippling when thinking about the research needed to unlock the spells for the three mage types (provided you even manage to recruit one). You can no longer get tons of dragons or hydras as, to do so, you need to build several of the buildings dedicated to recruiting them seeing as only one beast cage can sustain one dragon or hydra. This is a good thing as, before the regulation of its power, a dragon could annihilate entire groups of units with a single fireball, not to mention the fire spreading in the town and destroying everything but the walls.Now, it's reasonably powerful, but cannot do anything on its own. It can't. Don't even try. I'm serious. Don't make it walk over there on its own. Because of these extreme limitations on the special units, you're still depending heavily on your regular units. Not only that, but player towns might harbor a dragon, so I would advise you to carry a dragon slayer, if you can get him out of the tavern.Another feature related to PVP is the protection time. You can buy this from the barracks for crowns. There's a large amount of different times, so don't worry. The timer does not keep going when you've logged out. It resumes when you continue playing in that town, however. Building and ressource gathering continues.As for the simpler things, I cannot percieve graphics the same as other people, so, for me, these are still pretty good. The music fits the time period this is set in and doesn't disappoint, although more variety would be needed.The game isn't perfect, but perfection leads to stagnation.			"

												Hi everyone, Read take some time to read a review on this fantastic game.Firstly, there is 3 factions (Races) Orcs, humans and elves. All with there unique units and buildings including walls.They all have there only special abilities too.-------------------------------------Gameplay--------------------------------------In terms of gameplay it is very fun and challenging. You are in a persisnt online world whereby you build up a colonly get resources and make armies to not only defend but engage others to become the best of the best in the game. Even when your offline your workers are gathering resources making life a little bit easier and somewhat less time consuming. There are A.I regions and bases that you can take over and when done so, can either directly controll it or make it a vassal in which you can manage the encomy of it the more the better really. Pillaging other peoples bases can be quite profitiable but on the other hand quite devestating to you if it happens, of course this after you have your battle protection off (24 hours, only counts when online)----------------------------------------------------Bugs-----------------------------------------------------Unfortunaly every game has bugs and this game has its bad moments, however it has drasticly improved and it 10x more funner than it ever used to be. TO BE CONTINUED.------------------------------------------------------------Cons-------------------------------------------------------------The battle's may get hectic as the units all colide together, though i think this reduces lag (not sure)			"

												Let me tell you a thing or two;  How many games had you played, That is based on Real Time of stragegy?  How many games had you played, Like Starcraft 2, And you hates having to rebuild everything? How many games had you played, Where you just want to control your own soldiers into battle How many games had you played, Where there is no actual pay to win features? [Like path of exile!] Well, This is one of those game, And It's free.After years, Not alot of players get an opportunity of a decent gameplay where everything does not prevent them from trying to advance in the game. The best thing is currently about this game is;- The developers do interact with the players once the while, thus making the game much more enjoyable for the players- Instead of going the dull ol' fashioned where in Starcraft 2, You have to rebuild from ground one, You can skip that.- There are three races in the game; The human, The Elves and the orc. They have their own way of survivals, Learn it.-  Got dwarves. All race can have 'em. Dwarves. Dragons too.- There is no literal pay to win feature. Those who do think there is, is just thinking pessimistic. The reality is the Crown systems does not prevent pay to win, rather Crowns can be obtained via having vassal towns, Players Versues Players, completing quests, and clearing reigons of NPC. The crowns are essential to many mechanic of the game to unlock better equipments and building upgrades that will determine the player's activity in PvP and PvE. In addition that the only two things that are locked are Skrimishes and Single Player Campagin, but those two do not influence the direct gameplay of original. becuase Single player campagin will be the same as MMO-verisoned, The difference is no player versues players and does not requires internet connection. Skrimishes on other hand is a 'Testing Ground', Where you trains your tactic and you can use said tactics to your gameplay, but It won't influence the gameplay via units, resources or any means. rather just a training ground.- CO-OP Player versues Environment, Your best friend can help you take on Dagbor!The downsides, however. . . The Downsides only not so permanent and may be gone in next updates, and some downsides are from the player's gamestyle.- The game have bad server hosting, Meaning you can accidently lose connection or reception to the server. The worst to experience is a rollback, however you can solve it by validating the game via Steam, And If it does not solve, then you can go to game's file and go to the game's forum, then place down the Log 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 into the techinal support thread and state what happened to you.  - The players will alway use a wizard of the Deep. The Wizard of the deep is the wizard designed for player veruses players combat and will wreck most of your army. It's expensive immortal [Immortals unit cannot die, They will lose a few level, but they cannot be killed permanently.] unit that cost at most 120 crowns, excluding the cost to get the spells required. The Wizard of the deep can be a major turnoff for many players who are forced to face them in combat because It's designed to destroy majority of army before wizard get defeated.  - Lack of players also make community small. only 150 players strong per day, and sometime peaking 200, and lowest is 95. The community is not average toxic, and can be friendly at most time. Some players are willing to assist you in understanding the game mechanic, but most are usually quiet and/or the chatbox is not working for them. It's the common issue in the server host connection that Chatbox servers does not connect successfully to the other players sometime and breaks, Not allowing the players to communicate with the community.

												Greetings steam comunity,5cents on why this game is recommendet by me and why you should waste a part of youre precious livetime playing it.First of all - why should one play it?- its fun- its free- its got castels- its got dragons (some of them slightly three headed)- its got mad magics- its not a pay2winTo give this a more serious aproach - the pro stuff:+ The game is a fine mixed castle building, army training and stuff wrecking experience(, a little of what i wanted as a stronghold fan :) ).+ Three playable races - elves, man and orcs.+ The gameplay of the battles is well done. Whyle the overal controling mechanism is rather simple one may invest some energy into the micromanagement of unit stances and rotations to gain the best from the troops efforts.+/- The castle is limited to a few number of designs and placement spots - which are nicely done to alow the player a rather wide range of tactical options.+ The Armys consist of up to 60 units, including sige engines and workers to get all those shiny coins from the corpses. As the units gain experience they may be upgradet to fit the players needs.+ The KI citys are chalanging and differ greatly in theyr designs+ The pvp system seems promising, presenting some late game challange, interesting battles and army compositions and the rather easy and fair mechanics of avoiding it by paying a part of ones ressources to the attacker.+ The overal unit ballancing seems to be sound and while its not perfect the developers are working to improve it.+ The comunity is alive and quite friendly.To play it is a little like....One may upgrade his camp to a formidable stronghold. While the walls rise high the troops may march to complete the first quests and plunder some stuff on the way. By doing so one aquires the in game currency of crowns - and even if there is a rather great heap of those in the in game store, the number one may get there is limited.In time the army will get experienced and gain enough power to take on the great citys of the world. The choice between looting a vanquished city or taking it on as a vassal is rather rewarding - more so if you just managed to gain a victory inside the walls of the capital :).On the dark side ther are a few things to be said:- The KI is just not up to the task. While the unit KI is ok with only some minor *whydoyoustupidhealersengagetheogersinmeeleagain >.<* kind of problems the KI troops on the battlefield remain stationary until engaged, most of the time. Most of the movements an enemy will do are rushing his remaining troops into the keep, if you break don its gate, and some counter charges if this gate did not belong to the keep. The odd exeption is a charge of the reinforcement troop. Those apear after half an hoer into a KI sige and are pathetically easy to block, by disengaging your troops from the city and mincing the reinforcements. - The ballancing of the fractions is not finished yet. The orc race seems to be a little on the downside, in the overal army performance.- There are few end game challanges out of pvp matches. If one has put some thought into the army composition and the upgrading of ones troops there will be next to nothing left to stop this army.-/+ The game is still in the making. While not essentialy bad, one may get slightly annoied by a few bugs and gliitches. Also ive experienced two mayor bugs up until now, of the *dude where is my castle?* kind. On the other hand: those where solved in a matter of one or two days and the mods did theyr best to recompensate the losses. Also one may hope to see some further improvements to the gameplay and some more content to come.oh, and cookies, because.... you know....In summa summarum i recommend this game.Hope to see you (try) torching my city some time :),best regards, Cyraion.

												Kingdon Wars is a fun game when it works. I spend hours in the world. it's lore is very deep but could be further made aware to the player. Building your city is fun but once you ""get"" everything you need you won't need to do keep track of it. Which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you play. The units are interesting and can be upgraded to increase their armor and attack. Combat is fun but if you play with someone else the lag can kill your game experience. Overall the game is a fun experience that you can get lost in for hours at a time. 8/10			"

												An excellent game overall, that will immerse most RTS players for at least a good few hours.Its fairly simple, with a very traditional setup of the three factions with strenghts and weaknesses. such as the Humans being the most durable overall, the Elves essentially having the strongest units but with greater weaknesses, and the Orcs being oddly enough the most frail but boasting the ability to quickly amass an army of considerable size at reduced cost.(Please note: This is more of a quick run-down of some of the features in the game, than an review. The idea is that you can more effectively decide if its features appeals to you, rather than read someone trash n praise it)Leveling up your units!:This game relies quite heavily on the concept of your troops not simply being something you purchase enough of, in the right combination but actually take into skirmishes to level up or train at friendly strongholds, to then tailor suit what stats you want to improve, such as more health, damage mitigation, health regeneration, stamina, and so on. Eventually you will pretty much max out all the stats but at that point you have spend quite a lot of gold on that unit, and considering its still very likely to get inconveniently killed while you look the other way you learn to pay special heed to keeping your investments alive and well protected. Special Units:Every faction has an array of faction specific units available to them, but theres also a common pool of special units available to all the factions. These units have roots in all three main factions, but theres also units from unplayable races, such as Dragons and Dwarves. These units almost always costs you Crowns, which is a measure of wealth and influence that you can spend on recruiting considerably attractive units to attack your enemies or defend your homeland.Quest line:Theres an rather involved lore in the game, and its often very nicely attached to the characters you interact with while playing the main quest line. As you go through the main quest of your faction your tasked with defending your homeland, your kingdom, and waging war against the two other factions in the game, and often also your own. Due to the somewhat sandbox-like nature of the game, the senarios you find yourself in is often rather interesting and gradually gives you useful rewards that greatly benefit the construction of your homeland, giving a smooth progression of your homeland, the story of the game, and your involvement in the game overall.Traits and RegionsIn the MMO portion of the game, after choosing a faction you will be asked to choose a region and two traits.These are important and should be chosen to match how you prefer to play the game. If your a ""turtle"" and enjoys defensive gameplay then naturally you may want to choose the most defensive region and traits, but if your more into siege and conquest than naturally you would do well to take a region that reflects that better.Either way, your choice of region and traits will play an immense factor in the performance of your strategies.Choose wisely. :)Non-Mandatory PvPIn the online MMO portion of the game you may be attacked by enemies at any time, but you need to actually accept the battle. Should you choose not to, or let the timer run out you will forfeit a small portion of your resources as a tribute to be left alone. Even if no resources are available fighting PvP is never mandatory. As you start out with a new homeland you will have 24 hours of real time protection against PvP attacks to get you started. Notice that this time is only ticking while your in-game. Additionally, every time you pay a tribute or conclude a PvP match you will be given a small PvP Protection time.It is also possible to purchase PvP protection for Crowns.The graphics, performance, and the gameplay itself have gradually improved over time, with updates coming out frequently enough for a game you only pay for once. (Not including the micro transaction-like boosts available in the market, and additional features) The gameplay in singleplayer, whether in the online MMO world or not, is very stable but once you have an actual fight not against the AI, but another player it soon becomes a bit of a mess.(This includes co-op aswell) Reasonably playable, yes, but still very annoying at times. However, they have worked hard to improve this game and the future update expected to come out this month, which will apperantly overhaul the entire thing onto a more stable engine will hopefully bring back much of the player base and thus hopefully bring some more life back into this, in all honesty, very awesome game.(If you wish to know more details about the game, i have found a wiki with more details for you)http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Dawn_of_FantasyYes, it does have some problems now and then but this game does deserve a chance if it calls out to you in general.Regards,Brandt.

												Great Game! good way to spend your time growing an empire and meeting new people. Mechanics are simple build and destroy but with lots of quests and different options to spend your time so your not always waiting on resources theres always something you can do. :)) And who doesnt love to build your own castles and slap peasants and tell them what to do. ^.^ highly recommend this game			"

												Hi.   Ok, I'm a newb, just a few hours played.   Look at it this way, I have over 50 games in steam, haven't played more than a day in most of them, this one, I'm on my 3rd day.  I like the art.  I like having quests mainly because I'm retired and old and don't want to think too much.  I seem to have a little trouble with losing workers somewhere and haven't figured how to find them yet.  I'd like more tooltips with more info, I'd like to pause without logging out if no one's attacking me.... just because going pee (I'm old, it takes a while and often) and you come back and whatever you killed quest-wise has resurrected (it took me a while to figure out you gotta finish any quests you start before logging out, I was thinking I was having a senior moment and never really did what I thought I did -- which is scary)  I do feel like I need LOTS more direction and explaination.  Any way to move that chat box?  I like to listen in but it's in the way.The music is nice but I find myself nodding off.  This little box is filling up.  Oh, soon I'll be vulnerable... does a guy joining this late have a chance of survival if attacked?  lbattros@hotmail.com.			"

												Kingdom Wars is a very unique and addictive MMORTS. You attack, defend, and manage a kindom with the option of three playable races each differning in their own unique ways. You start off with a simple kingdom, but in time it can easily grow and prosper into a epic empire. It is not a pay to win type of game either. With both time and skill you can easily succed in this game. I definatly recommend to strategic players.			"

												This game is amazing with the community helpig out, it has a great quest system with 3 factions to play as each having its own special play style. It includes resource gathering and unit recruitment with pvp battles and sieges with a campaign map included. this is a great rts game and its completly free but you can buy some things for astetics on your hero and what not. I highly recommend this game for people who enjoy strategy games.			"

												I reccoment this game because although as people have said below me, although the game is slow to like and get started and the combat and unit cordination isn't that good I like it. It brings a wonderful way you can build your forces and strageties to defeat enemys at the same time adding fun quest you can do and provide a challenge to your way of game play. And the best part about this game is that it's FREE to PLAY which is AWSOME in my oppinion. So all in all I reccoment this game to any one looking for some fun.			"

												Having played several ""free to play"" games, this one actually delivers on not needing to pay to win. The in-game currency called ""crowns"" is obtained through multiple ways from questing to pvp. With premium, gains are doubled but even without a player can amass wealth from sieges and quests in a matter of two or three hours. City management is simple and straightforward as resources are close at hand and placement of buildings is set by building plots scattered around the landscape. Time and crowns are all that is really needed to construct a powerful castle and the time goes by quickly as you fight to gain crowns. There are a diverse number of troops to choose from. Recruitment can include the troops of your own race as well as mercenaries when camping in foreign lands and dwarves and beasts from special buildings. Only three playable races are available: elves, orcs, and humans. Hopefully dwarves will be added in the future and possibly dragons (please). Battles and troop management are split between the world map and specific battlegrounds and are fairly easy to grasp. The only complaint towards troops in battle is their refusal to listen to certain orders. When you send cavalry in to feint an enemy into charging and the cavalry doesn't retreat when you tell them to, your strategy gets ruined and you are forced to en masse charge or risk losing part of your army. Aside from the troop command issue, the game is both fun and addicting as one could spend hours trying to earn crowns, conquer cities, and improve his/her own. Coupled with the game actually being fair and not requiring real money to be good, I would recommend it to any seeking a fun, free-to-play strategy game.			"
