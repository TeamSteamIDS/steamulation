												Pretty much the only modern game even trying to replicate the execellence of Tyrian or Raptor. A recent patch (28 April 2015) addressed the early game slog by having the player start with a second weapon slot so there is at least a semblance of customization at the beginning.pros:-multiple weapons-actual hp bar so the game plays more like a shooter than a mouse avoider-online co-op multiplayercons:-waits way too long to actually unlock the 5 weapon slots and a good selection of weapons (it gets good, but still)-Tyrian is 10x better, if you haven't already played Tyrian so many times that you just can't play it any more go get it insteadVerdict:If you long for a Tyrian or Raptor styled game and have played out the old classics, get this.

												This game is a must for people who like shooters with an army-style. The style of the game is there are two types of targets: Ground and Air, which can give extra challenge if you're not careful with the situation. There is a shop to spend your scrap collected through the levels for weapons, levels to unlock perks and weapon slots, and even a versus mode. For those who want simplicity or simplicity with a little more on a shooter, this game should be in your collection.Pros:-You don't die in one hit. You have two things: Shield that regenerates and protects your health, and health.-Shop to buy new weapons and equip-Perks(buffs) that you get when you level up.Cons:-A bit tough at the beginning on killing enemies, but at least it walks you through on situations.

												Revolution Ace was an interesting attempt to build a shmup in the Unreal Engine, which was not at all designed for the purpose.  The resulting game isn't a disaster, but neither is it a compelling success.The appeal of shmup games typically comes from hectic action; your weapons are typically devastating, killing the weakest foes in one hit, and your fire rate is intense.  Challenge in a shmup typically comes not from any deficiency of your avatar, but the sheer numbers of enemies it sends at you, the intensity of their fire, and the speed at which they move.Revolution Ace departs radically from that standard shmup formula.  You and the majority of your foes move slowly, even sluggishly.  Your weapons are uncharacteristically weak, requiring a good second or so of concentrated fire to take down most normal opponents, who are comparatively few in number.  Instead of a hyperkinetic frenzy of ducking and weaving through enemy fire while opponents explode in dramatic fireballs all around you, Revolution Ace feels more like a slow, stubborn push through the enemy forces, hoping to make it through to the final boss before your armor is depleted.The addition of true 3D modeling, switchable air/ground fire and recharging shield to the genre are interesting, but don't really make up for the loss of the speed and destructiveness that is the hallmark of this style of gameplay.

												This is exactly the kind of game that I miss so much. A sidescrolling game just like ""Sonic Wing"". I used to play it every time I went to a gaming shop, with my stepfather. This is very nostalgic. It's challenging and has a retro style for sounds and music (and even kinda visual). There are bosses and different kind of enemies, weapons and upgrades. You'll have a good time playing this with friends.10/10 ♥ ""This is Skyrim with planes!!!""			"

 The RundownRevolution Ace is definitely NOT one of the best shooters in its genre. It has frame rate problems, the bullets blend in with the background, and generally it's a bit of a mess. But somehow when I was playing it, something made me look past all that and I really did have a good time. It has an upgrade system that definitely helps with the sense of progression, a fun but challenging boss at the end of each stage, and a neat system of air bullets vs ground bullets, forcing you to pick between whether you're shooting in the background or in the foreground. But by far the best part of the game is the multiplayer. It takes all the problems I mentioned and kinda blurs them out of your mind, because, at least for me, I was more focused on playing a game with my friend and the issues became less glaring. There's also a cool multiplayer versus mode, which I've never seen implimented into a top-down shooter before. It works pretty well.As a whole, Revolution Ace was like a fat guy sitting in front of you at a playoff game. It's annoying at first, sure, but if you can look past the problems, you have a great game in front of you. It's a fun experience, and you should definitely consider picking it up if you have some friends to play it with.

Builds on the foundation of the old and classic with fresh novelty // Recommended for those of inventive mind and quick reflexes~Full Disclosure: This game was reviewed with a key given by the developers~+ Missed enemies that return for a second pass are highlighted, indicating a drop in value; this is a useful feature that encourages target prioritization, although this feature (strangely) seemed to make few appearances after the first level+ User interface, while not aesthetically sensational, is functional and unobtrusive+ A combination of unlockable perks, a straightforward leveling system, and myriad upgrade components available for purchase make for a refreshing level of customization+ Gameplay and ship customization does much to reward forward-planning and a tactical mind-set+ Boasts an attention to detail uncommon for the genre, such as ripple effects when firing into bodies of water, or trees being felled when strafed by machine gun fire+ Though few people seem to be taking advantage of it at the moment, the multiplayer is excellent; in particular, the 'Battle Chains' option is absolutely ingenious, and incredibly addicting (this mode lets the player run through a stage, then challenge a friend to the same stage, at which point their progress will be compared to yours and a return challenge issued, building to potentially better and better matches)+ The combination of air/ground combat is a breath of fresh air for the genre, and adds immensely to the challenge+ Agreeably lengthy campaign for an arcade shooter - not too long, not too short+ Healthy variety of enemy units that introduce new patterns and weaponry, building on top of those from previous stages, keeping the game fresh throughout+ Between ship modules and unlockable perks, the number of combinations at your disposal for tackling enemy units is staggering+ Visuals are par-for-the-course; they are a bit lacking by today's standards, but they are far from disappointing- There are occasional, and seemingly random drops in frame-rate (although they are, admittedly, very minor drops, and more casual players are unlikely to be offset by it)- Music, while not inherently terrible, suffers from a lack of variety; none of the scores really stand out, and they quickly fade into the background during gameplay (sound effects, also, were somewhat uninspired)- No aesthetic customization options; this wouldn't normally count against the game but, as there is otherwise an overwhelming emphasis on ship customization, this ended up standing out as a mild disappointment- While there is a plot, it's poorly presented, and it's clear that there was minimal effort put into it, whatsoever; there may as well have not been one includedLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												An OK upstart of a game, but...1. Difficulty is all over the place. Even on easy it gets unenjoyable - fast.2. The game tries to be a lot like ""Raptor: The Call of Shadows"", a true classic. Tries, and fails miserably. You do get a shop for changing loadouts, you do get a smartypants shop owner, you do get a plane with shields, you do get the top-down scrolling... and not much else.3. Weapons are ridiculously underpowered, requiring a lot of stay-on-target time.4. The game still requires polishing, even without the balance issues. Music lags constantly in all the menus, sound design is mediocre at best, and it all requires an old version of nVidia PhysX just to run (builldings falling into pieces? planes dropping out of the sky? we could do without it at no gaming experience lost).All in all, a disappointment. Even if you see it at a bragain price somewhere, bear in mind that it might be not worth your time. Pick Jets'n'Guns instead if you really are a SHMUP fan.			"

												Revolution Ace is a shoot 'em up game that takes inspiration from the classics.My favorite thing about it so far is the fact that there is room for customization, maybe not right at the beginning but with the inclusion of perks I'm free to make my jet fighter thing the way I want to! I get to play in my own unique way and so does every other player.  The UI and soundtrack are good for what they are and I didn't run into any flaws minor or major, and the levels are interesting enough to keep me playing, though not distracting me from the gameplay. The enemies all have something that is unique about them and all have different patterns, because of this the screen can become a cluster of enemies and bullets if you're not fast enough at clearing them out, so watch the shield regen.Speaking of shield, missed enemies do come back so sometimes if you missed an enemy or two you won't have the opportunity to regenerate your shield in an area that otherwise would've been clear, so if this happens you'll be left in a situation where you're being attacked without shields, which adds to the intensity to the gameplay.My only gripe with the game is that the bosses are too easy and too predictable, at least in the few first stages.I recommend this game and shout-outs to senpai studios for giving me a free key for this game.

												As a kid, I enjoyed playing games like Tiger Heli on the NES. This top-down, side scrolling gem brings us back to those days, but with a modern twist. Not only are the graphics decent for a 2D top-down, but you can collect scrap which is then used to purchase upgrades for your ship, making you a true Ace of the skies. Fight against entire air forces in campaign mode, play with friends in a co-op game, or choose skirmishes and dogfight it out with both air and ground targets, Revolution Ace also allows you to pit your skills against other players, in side-by-side, split screen fashion. A great buy at a relatively low price, with progressively difficult settings to give you a challenge, This is a pretty good gem I would recommend.			"

												So, I was gifted a copy of this from the developers publicist in exchange for a fair and honest review.I've put about an hour into it so far, which given the nature of the game seems like a reasonable amount of time to draw some conclusions. I will update this review if I reach different conclusions later.Anyway, this game seems fairly accessible at first. It is a pretty basic shmup that also later on features some lite bullet hell aspects. The actual movement of your ship is a little slow, and at first, your weapons arent very powerful either. However, as you gain credits via finishing missions and generally blowing stuff up, you can buy upgrades to your weaponry and shields that make this a bit more effective and a bit easier EXCEPT the games difficulty scales more quickly than you can upgrade, and so this actually becomes a pretty challenging game after the first couple missions. I'm level 7 right now and have wrapped up something like 8 or 10 missions so far. At this point, I'm dying pretty quickly even after my upgrades (which you can swap out between missions as well btw) and even though powerups are readily available. Still, I havent reached the point of frustration yet, as I feel the right combo of upgrades is really all it takes to get past the levels despite the fact that they seem scaled beyond your present capabilities as you progress.As you level up, you also occasionally earn perks, which are basically permanent upgrades to your ship. There is actually a wide variety to choose from, so you will need to choose wisely here. The graphics are pretty much on par with what you expect. They arent mind blowing, but they do look nice and fairly well represent the genre and the era the game hearkens back to. Speaking of....the music is also well in line with this. It gets a bit repetitive but still remains listenable throughout.All told, I would normally give this about a 5.5 out of 10. However, the game is presently featured for under 30 cents, and it has trading cards as well, the value of which pretty much are equal to the cost of the game. So...despite the 5.5 out of 10, it's still pretty much a must own if you make use of the marketplace...and lets be real...for 30 cents or so, you will end up owning this at some point anyway.			"

												Revolution Ace is a top down Shmup in where you fight enemies from both the air and the ground simultaneously. There are two keys that fires your weapons. One is to aim your projectiles in front of you and the other to fire at the ground below you. It can be confusing to tell on what plane an enemy is on and I would often times find myself shooting over an enemy. After a bit of practice and knowledge of the enemy it becomes a non-issue. Before getting to the gameplay you may want to tweak around with the graphic settings but be warned, turning on CSAA anti-aliasing will immediately crash the game for some reason. There are four modes in this title. Campaign provides a story and unlocks more levels for the other modes, Skirmish is to replay any mission you want and even some exclusive ones and versus has you and another player going through the same mission competing for score while introducing some new power-ups that hinders your opponent.The last mode is called BattleChain that works similarly to versus though you play alone and later send the ghost data of your playthrough to the person you challenge. Campaign mode is where you'll want to start as it does it's best to introduce you to the mechanics of this game. The story of Revolution Ace has an interesting beginning in which the nations of the world built machines to fight their wars instead of wasting any human lives and the robots eventually stop fighting each other to launch a devastating attack against humanity. It has a very interesting premise but goes nowhere as they went for the “funny redneck” vaguely explains what you are doing on each mission route. No one expects a story from a Shmup though it did feel rather disappointing to start off with one and promptly forget about it. Throughout every mission you will be facing a horde of hostile robots in your cheap cobbled together jet in a last ditch attempt to retaliate against the enemy. It starts off as a suicide mission though after many successes you start gathering scrap that allows you to build much better equipment on your craft.The more enemies you destroy the more scrap you collect once successfully completing a mission. You get much more scrap if you kill an enemy before it leaves the screen. If it leaves and comes back for a second barrage it will be worth far less. Scrap will be the most important thing in this game since Revolution Ace features RPG like progression in where newer unlocked weapons you can buy in the armory are better in every way compared to your meager starting equipment. You also level up by gaining experience and unlike scraps you still get experience even if you fail the mission. Leveling up sometimes means that you get to choose from one of many perks that increase damage for a certain weapon type, allows your shields to recharge faster and one that increases your overall health to name a few. Sometimes instead of being able to choose from perks while leveling up you will instead have new equipment available to buy in the Armory. You will be needing all the help you can get as this game is brutal and I barely managed to beat it even while playing through the entire game with someone else.This would be a good time to mention the online multiplayer. It is great and I couldn't notice any lag or hiccups during 6 or so hours of playtime on two very poor internet connections. I wish more shumps would include online play as most have the option for two players but many of us can't take advantage of it. Funny that a 2 dollar game should include it and it's a feature I must applaud. This is one of the most graphically impressive shmups on the market as it runs on Unreal Engine 3 and features cool effects such as the water rippling when shot at as well as fancy explosions. It is a very nice looking game but there is nothing interesting to look at as most of the game is either in a bland desert, the sky or over water. Enemy designs are decent though this is where the game suffers the most due to the RPG system of this game. From start to finish the enemies felt very bullet spongy making the combat feel unsatisfying and utterly devoid of any flow as you spend way too much time on a single enemy while there are dozens more coming for you.That makes it feel like a game designed around grinding instead of skill. It is possible to beat the game without any grinding, however bullet spongy enemies make it tedious task. Leveling up also unlocks weapon slots for your ship allowing you to place a few more guns on the side of it to shoot horizontally. You unlock the left weapon slot first and it takes quite a while to unlock the one on the right side making it feel like very artificial progression. We are the last hope to destroy the robot menace and the mechanic won't install another gun on your preferred side of the ship because we are not level 18? The RPG features of this game aren't subjectively bad as those that like the feeling of becoming more powerful and being able to take on more difficult tasks are sure to enjoy it but for those of us that prefer Shmups to have everything we need to stand a chance from the get go and skill being the determining factor in whether we are victorious or a pile of debris on the floor.Weapons variants range from bullets, lasers and explosives. Each unlocked weapon has different effects even if they are the same variant so make sure to carefully read the description as some weapons can't be shoot at ground enemies. Fighting ground enemies is kind of clunky as you have some type of auto lock feature while shooting at the ground so you may fire at the wrong target from time to time. It is very cool seeing a buggy riding around down in a desert shooting up at you and those add some strategy to game as you decide whether to fight the enemies in front of you or the ones below you. The projectiles on screen are shot by the dozens and is near bullet hell levels of crazy. Unlike Bullet Hells your ship's hitbox is pretty huge here and you can take quite a bit of punishment before meeting your demise. You have both a shield and hull health to protect you from exploding. It doesn't matter much if the shield takes damage as not firing your weapons will recharge its energy back, hull health on the other hand you do not want to take any damage to . The only way to heal hull health is via a semi-rare powerup that enemies drop and if your shields are completely down that means things have gone really wrong.Shields can also be bought and replaced with different types such as ones that take more damage but recharge slower. The whole not shooting to recharge your shields gimmick is rather weird and will more often than not cause you to get overwhelmed as more enemies enter the fray. It makes for some rather intense moments where you have a split second to decide if you stop firing and try to hold out until some of your shield is recharged or to hold your ground and risk it all. These moments would be a lot more fun if the enemies weren't so bullet spongy and you could go out in a blaze of glory though there is no denying it will still have you on the edge of your seat. One complaint I have regarding projectiles is that some enemies shoot dark brown projectiles that are really hard to see in most cases. There is also this weird gimmick in where your ship randomly rises higher to the sky or lower in certain set points of the level. Bosses are giant enemies be they fortresses or battleships that will do everything it can to shoot you down. It is rather cool seeing them get desperate as their health is low and launching an all-out barrage of projectiles. In the end of the day this is a content packed shmup with online coop, some levels in Skrimish mode that randomly generate the game and many handmade missions to blast your way through. It is by no means a game that will take the world by storm but for its low price this is a game that any fan of the Shmups should at least take a look at.			"

												A truly fantastic nostalgia trip back to the world of jet fighter games.Had a brill run through on this game, got to Campaign +2 in about 10 hours, then went ahead and started challenging people. If anyone has played the SNES game Super Strike Gunner, then this game is for you, it feels exactly the same as SSG did when I played it all those years ago.There are some very nice ideas in this game, the verses and battle modes where you can compete against players are very fun indeed, along with the customizing of your aircraft, perk system, leveling system and NG+, it does give the game some replay-ability, although when you reach later levels (20+), I found the game just turned into level-grinding to get those extra perk levels. There are some arguably minor bad points I got from this however, the main one being how short the game actually is. While I personally don't mind a nice casual game to pass the time, a little more content and a more challenging difficulty would have helped a bit, (you can easily go straight to the highest difficulty setting and ace the game).Another point I would like to mention is how easy the achievements are to get, while some may see this as a good thing, some hunters might not enjoy the lack of challenge in acquiring the full set of achievements, again though I think this is more about personal preference than anything.Overall I was very happy with the game, even at full price I would have still bought this when it came under my radar, so 96% off was a total bargain for me. Putting the minor issues aside, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a nice casual game of this genre without a doubt, especially if you enjoyed SSG and the like all those years ago.In conclusion, my personal rating for Revolution Ace is :8.5/10 "

												Later on, mankind uses AI driven machines to wage war, yet this invert releases when the machines turn on their masters. To fight this risk, your top of the line pilot takes to the sky in an old travel to counter. The machines are summoning the land, sea and air so your battle won't be straightforward. At first I felt that Change Expert didn't much issue with a story as the elucidation for why you are controlling an old stream against bleeding edge foes is simply revealed several levels into the beguilement. It doesn't have any kind of effect nonetheless, as no reason is relied upon to partake in some old school, level shooting movement. Disregarding the Shocking Engine controlled visuals, Change Master seems like it was detached straight from a nineties arcade machine. Unmistakably time has been spent on making the ground look fascinating with effects like trees affecting in the wind and mountains that climb up into the screen however the general effect is somewhat frustrating. It could just be my own slants, however the sensible style visuals essentially look a touch too much troubling for an over the top style entertainment like Bombshell Expert. I can't accuse the contrasting qualities in any case, as the delight takes you transversely over unsettled areas, mountains and oceans, with a couple levels shrouded in haze or solicited in snow. There are irrefutably minutes where the diversion benefits look and there is emphatically no nonattendance of enemies to shoot at, yet there is nothing that really isolates the visuals from the pack. Change Master is a genuinely coordinate shooter, yet there are a few novel things that make it worth a minute look. Firstly, enemies attack from both the air and ground and you use two separate fire gets to attract them. Weaving through shots while shooting on the right plane can be questionable at in any case, yet it soon ends up being second nature. Completing levels compensate you with experience centers and shrapnel. Experience centers are tallied up to fabricate the level of your fly, which prompts to prizes, for instance, more weapon spaces, new weapons and a liven of your choice. The preferences keep running from better covering to speedier slugs or strong laser and there are lacking levels to pick each one of them so you have to pick carefully. The shrapnel is your cash and is used to purchase the programmed rifles, rockets and bar firearms and moreover shields and exceptional strikes that make your specialty so significant. There are more than 20 weapons to peruse and the position on your fly matters which makes it diverting to mix and match to see what the results are. The campaign mode felt to some degree longer than what you generally find in the class and upon fulfillment you can start a harder, New+ playthrough. There are similarly three inconvenience settings to give everyone a sensible shot at beating the entertainment. Enemies attack in substantial numbers and on Run of the mill or higher, the ones that you miss returns for another go, however the way that you have a shield and protective layer meter makes things stunningly less requesting. Shooters with one hit executes can perplex, so Uprising Master is a conventional introduction to the class that won't drive off newcomers. If you understand blazed on the fight mode or feel like you need some extra experience and shrapnel you can explore different avenues regarding the Engagement mode. In Struggle you find the opportunity to pick a level from any of the ones that you have viably opened to practice or farm experience and shrapnel. Fundamentally more fun is the Versus mode where you play one beside the other with another player and can mess up their entertainment by sending enemies to their side of the screen. The Battle Chains mode works the same as Versus however rather than playing against some individual dynamically you challenge their recordings. If you complete the test you can send it back to the principal player who then need to fight with all the extra tumult that you brought on in the midst of your playthrough. The test increment quickly and this mode can end up being exceptionally addictive, however finding diverse players is not that basic right at this point. I had a lot of fun with Change Master however this may be a result of me playing shooters since the start of the arcades. More up and coming players might be less thoughtful about the dull visuals and rather non particular sound. The controls regardless, are responsive and the preoccupation most likely packs a test, however isolated from the versus modes it doesn't by and large rise up out of the pack. I really favored the thought so in a perfect world LGG can make a turn off, which genuinely increment the era values.

Really cool!Old times Arcade Style Action. Totally worths every cent as it delivers old school feel & action. I recommend it since there are fewer games like this one left and the devs have worked on it, it feels nice!Buy it, won't regret if you're into oldies but goldies style games.			"

												Decent Shooter game.The pace is moderate playable unlike many shooters that leaves you little to nil breathing room.The Battle Chain system is quite interesting where out of no where, you find yourself in a challenge with someone back and fro vying for score to overtake.Upon exceeding level 16, the game would get more fluid and enjoyable with the elite weaponaries.Occassionally freezes my screen and crash out of the game especially in Battlechain mode tho.But overall it works fine.Had more fun in this than the others in the Hyperspace Pack.

												Pretty much the only modern game even trying to replicate the execellence of Tyrian or Raptor. A recent patch (28 April 2015) addressed the early game slog by having the player start with a second weapon slot so there is at least a semblance of customization at the beginning.pros:-multiple weapons-actual hp bar so the game plays more like a shooter than a mouse avoider-online co-op multiplayercons:-waits way too long to actually unlock the 5 weapon slots and a good selection of weapons (it gets good, but still)-Tyrian is 10x better, if you haven't already played Tyrian so many times that you just can't play it any more go get it insteadVerdict:If you long for a Tyrian or Raptor styled game and have played out the old classics, get this.

												This game is a very nice shoot'em up ! It's easy to pick up, and yet hard to master, but very enjoyable if you like old-school shoot'em up.The difficulty is fairly balanced, and you can improve your weapons (by buying some more at the armory) so you can keep up with the waves of ennemies coming at you !If you're skilled enough you can finish the campaign quickly, but then you can try the skirmish mode or increase the difficulty to find more challenge.All in all, it's very fun if you've got a few minutes to spare, or an hour to grind.You can also try a well-thought multiplayer that allows you to send challenges to people around the world, and they can try to beat your score.Pros +- Easy to pick-up- Interesting concept of both ennemies on the ground and in air- Old school- Customization of your arsenal- Several tactics and playstyles depending on what wepaons and perks you choose- Interesting delayed multiplayer challenges- Controller support- Skill-based- CheapCons -- Old school- Graphics (not bad, but not so appealing)- Repetitive			"

												This game is just.... awesome!Bear with me now and let me explain. First of all the trailers on the store page dont do justice to the game at all. I bought this one by just looking at price. Turns out it's as good or in some areas even better than Jets'n'Guns which is my favorite shooter. Did not expect this at all from such a simple looking shooter. A bit about the mechanics: game has a leveling system and scrap (money) you get from doing missions, multiplayer battle challenges etc. With these goodies you buy new gear and in the spirit of Jets'n'Guns it is pretty much mandatory to test things out and find the best setups. Skirmish missions can be done if you wish to grind for some extra scrap. Configurations do matter as the Campaign start becoming harder bit by bit but the real test are the awesome battle chains where you or someone lays out a challenge to others in form of a level completion replay. Others will try to beat your score and you will see in a replay how they did it. Fun starts when someone rips the score so high you really have to think how will i beat this. You might need to re-think your setup to beat the score. (Your opponent see how many times you tried to beat his score so dont humiliate yourself too much by trying a strategy that just doesnt work)  Eventually the score will climb very high as the same challenge is bounced back and forth until either side just gives up.  Multiplayer system is very good - though be warned that it is quite confusing to use at first.  Check forums.Game also sports a interesting notification system where you get a message to your steam notifications bar that someone has beaten your score and it's your turn to try to beat the opponents score. In order to not just praise the game there is a bit of criticism too: Lack of feedback everywhere is annoying. menus are unresponsive for some time too yet not greyed out. In missions hitting targets does not yield much of reaction. i'd also like to see a bit more animation frames on certain enemies for a more flowing visual game experience. And just what are those really tiny white walkers that fire missiles at you? No big things but give a rough feeling to the game.			"

												+ Retro, top down, arcade shooter+ Mouse or keyboard gives you differing play style+ Good weapon selection, actively makes you feel more powerful+ Sound is decent with explosions and gunfire+ You get rewards for partial level completion+ Multiplayer options+ Devs are addressing issues and making improvements~ Enemies use the same attack patterns~ Graphics are somewhat low-fi~ Some bullet hell mixed in- Sudden ramps in difficulty- Random mouse lag in the menu screenFull disclosure, was given a key to review the game. While top-downs were never my fave genre I'd sling a  few quid into an arcade at the local chippy while waiting for my order and this game takes me right back. The retro graphics could use a polish but then it does capture the feel of arcades of the 2000's well. The mechanics and weapons are fun to try and every time you fly you progress.Conclusion: 7/10. As a work in progress it's worth a budget price.			"

												January 12, 2017This is a basic Shoot 'Em Up, I played through the entire campaign in Co-op with a friend. We also did a couple of random missions for more cash and xp to upgrade our ships. We bought this game on sale for CDN$ 0.25.THE GOOD:-The weapons are pretty diverse and all work differently, from homing rockets to sweeping beams.-The perks system allows you to customize ur ship even more, with bonus damage to bullet guns and stuff like regenerating shield on plasma weapon kills.-I didnt have any performance issues.-The enemies had a lot of variety.-Both ground and air targets make for a more interesting gameplay.-Easy co-op joining with the steam friend list.THE UGLY:-The random missions are... random. From bosses spawning off screen to insanely hard levels.-Not enough unique bosses and most of them just dont move and throw bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥at you with turrets.-After each campaign mission the 2nd player has to manually rejoin the lobby of the host.-The game has a ""Game Launcher"" that serves no purpose at all.-No color customization can make it hard to recognize which ship you are.TLDR: We had fun with our time with this little game, it was fun for a 25 cent game.Considering the price: 7/10			"

												A fresh modern american styled shmup with online co-op. Online Co-op! More shmups need to be on steam and they also need to have online co-op.Very good upgrades and weapons customization. Your ship has slots in which you can stick weapons wherever you want. Look at the community hub for screenshots of the shop. You can place weapons on the wings to shoot sideways. You have ""scrap"" (money for shop), experience points for leveling up your rank (which opens more weapon slots), and perks.The levels move slow and it may seem like a walk in the park towards the beginning, but don't let that fool you since you can find yourself easily overwhelmed all of a sudden. It's not a ""bullet hell game"" since there aren't 1000 bullets on the screen, but that doesn't mean you won't run into a bullet infested screen. This is definitely apparent in the later levels. The level of challenge is perfect with this one. It's not too easy and it's not too hard to make you stop playing altogether.Besides it having campaign co-op, you can split-screen battle a friend to see who ends up with the higher score. There are a few power-ups specific that appear in this mode which will affect the other player. It can either be positive or negative so that you don't just grab every one you see.You have one life to beat a level, but you have two lifebars. One of them recharges when you stop shooting and once the other one is depleted, you die. Very neat feature.Bottom line: If you're into shumps, this one needs to be in your library.			"

Product received for free
												In the future, humanity uses AI driven machines to wage war, but this backfires when the machines turn on their masters. To combat this threat, your elite pilot takes to the sky in an old jet to retaliate. The machines are dominating the land, sea and air so your battle will not be easy.At first I thought that Revolution Ace didn’t even bother with a story as the explanation for why you are piloting an old jet against futuristic foes is only revealed a few levels into the game. It doesn’t matter though, as no excuse is needed to engage in some old school, horizontal shooting action. Despite the Unreal Engine powered visuals, Revolution Ace looks like it was ripped straight out of a nineties arcade machine. It is clear that time has been spent on making the ground look interesting with effects like trees swaying in the wind and mountains that rise up into the screen but the overall effect is a bit underwhelming. It could just be my personal preferences, but the realistic style visuals just look a tad too drab for an over the top style game like Revolution Ace.I can’t fault the diversity though, as the game takes you across jungles, mountains and oceans, with some levels shrouded in mist or covered in snow. There are definitely moments where the game does look good and there is certainly no lack of enemies to shoot at, but there is nothing that really sets the visuals apart from the pack.Revolution Ace is a pretty straightforward shooter, but there are a couple of unique things that make it worth a second look. Firstly, enemies attack from both the air and ground and you use two separate fire buttons to engage them. Weaving through bullets while shooting on the correct plane can be tricky at first, but it soon becomes second nature. Completing levels reward you with experience points and shrapnel. Experience points are tallied up to increase the level of your jet, which leads to rewards such as more weapon slots, new weapons and a perk of your choice. The perks range from better armor to faster bullets or strong laser and there are not enough levels to choose all of them so you have to pick carefully. The shrapnel is your currency and is used to purchase the machine guns, missiles and beam cannons as well as shields and special attacks that make your craft so formidable. There are more than 20 weapons to choose from and the placement on your jet matters which makes it fun to mix and match to see what the results are.The campaign mode felt a bit longer than what you usually find in the genre and upon completion you can start a tougher, New+ playthrough. There are also three difficulty settings to give everyone a fair chance at beating the game. Enemies attack in droves and on Normal or higher, the ones that you miss comes back for another go, but the fact that you have a shield and armor meter makes things considerably easier. Shooters with one hit kills can be frustrating, so Revolution Ace is a nice introduction to the genre that won’t scare away newcomers.If you tire of the campaign mode or feel like you need some extra experience and shrapnel you can try out the Skirmish mode. In Skirmish you get to pick a level from any of the ones that you have already unlocked to practice or farm experience and shrapnel. Much more fun is the Versus mode where you play side by side with another player and can mess up their game by sending enemies to their side of the screen. The Battle Chains mode works the same as Versus but instead of playing against someone in real-time you challenge their recordings. If you complete the challenge you can send it back to the original player who then have to contend with all the added mayhem that you caused during your playthrough. The challenge ramps up quickly and this mode can become quite addictive, but finding other players is not that easy at the moment.I had a lot of fun with Revolution Ace but this may be due to me playing shooters since the early days of the arcades. Newer players might be less forgiving about the bland visuals and rather generic audio. The controls however, are responsive and the game certainly packs a challenge, but apart from the versus modes it doesn’t really stand out from the pack. I really liked the concept so hopefully LGG can create a sequel, which really ramps up the production values.			"

Thanks to my good friend, LockeProposal of the highly insightful Curator Page named LockeProposal’s Big Day Out, I was able to take a look into this-aptly labeled-bullet hell title. At first glance, Revolution Ace is simplistic yet charming, with simple graphics and exciting gameplay even on the lowest of difficulties. After completing the first level, however, I knew I was in for a wild ride similar to that of Tyrian (as you will see this title being compared to all over the internet, and for good reason.) I do have a few offline hours in this game, so please do not be evaded by my lack of logged time.Here are some things that really caught my eye when starting up and throughout:Graphics - I’m not really a stickler when it comes to graphics, so some of the simpler textures in this game didn’t bother me; I actually enjoyed how the game presents itself, as it is pretty much all you would need from a game of this caliber. Besides, why bump everything into the graphics when the only thing you will be looking out for is enemy fire? All joking aside, the graphics in this title actually surprised me, looking into how the defeated enemies scar the landscape and at the intriguing water physics. I understand some individuals are only interested in games that present themselves with AAA graphics, but that mindset should really be looked past with this title.Controls - From the beginning, you are presented with two modes of fire: air-vs-air and air-vs-ground. These two modes of fire can be accessed separately by clicking LMB or RMB, respectively, but can be remapped if needed. Movement remains standard in Revolution Ace, with your classic WASD keys or Arrow keys representing the various direction. I know I cannot speak for everyone with this, but the craft in this title controls quite nicely as dodging enemy fire while utilizing quick reflexes becomes more important as you progress. You will learn what MMB is used for later. I don’t want to spoil the fun.Gameplay - There’s a reason it’s called bullet hell. Revolution Ace is a side-scrolling (for lack of better terms) shooter with the objective of scoring enough points to ultimately better your ship and-subsequently-bring more pain to the bombarding enemy forces. As stated previously, the ship controls nicely from my perspective and the gunplay is fantastic. What I found of particular interest (described in the next segment) was the customization, which allows you to upgrade specific components of your ship to fit the scheme of play you want. For instance, do you want to stick to the classic missiles and guns on your ship and use the basic shield? or would you prefer utilizing an automated laser turret mounted on your craft with a chain-gun mounted on front and heat-seeking missiles primarily for enemy aircrafts?Upgrade/Customization System - Here’s where the game really shines. Remember the mention of only starting with a basic gun, missiles, and shield? As you progress through the campaign, both Experience and Scrap Points-which acts as a currency-are gained. Starting at an early level, ship upgrades-such as improving damage by 10% as your ship drops below 25% hull-can be chosen to better customize your level of play; be warned that once you select a ‘Perk’ you cannot reselect, though you gain more as you progress. Along with these permanent upgrades, you also unlock Slots on your ship, which allow for even more guns and other attachments-such as the aforementioned automated laser turret. From where I am in the game, this system of upgrades and customization has really impressed me, as I have been intrigued enough to switch my style of play so that I can buy different weapons. What also sets this system apart from others is that each gun, though different, is necessarily better than another so it really just depends on how you use each one. Did I mention there are things known as Super Weapons that can be used when clicking MMB and are cooldown based? Those are also really fun.TL:DR - There may be things I left out, but I have not been able to play the various game modes as of recent, which-by concept-are very intriguing. Though I did not mention it in the base review, I did enjoy the fact that there are no Achievements in the game pertaining to beating the Campaign at multiple difficulty settings, which allows the player to go at their own pace. At this stage, I’d highly recommend Revolution Ace for its fast-paced, over-the-top gameplay. Just remember: you will get hit. A lot. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews? Please visit my Curator Page at  Spearpoint Reviews	.			"

			My review of ""Revolution Ace"", an arcade jet fighter game developed and published by Laser Guided Games. ------------------------------- Like on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/EnjoyTheGaming...		

Game: Revolution AceGenre: Arcade Jet FighterDeveloper: Laser Guided Games Publisher: Laser Guided Games Copy supplied by developerRevolution Ace is an arcade jet fighter game developed and published by Laser Guided Games.GRAPHICSThe game, developed with Unreal Engine 3, looks just fine: there is a good amount of particle effects, enemy variety and high-quality textures, but, as with many of these games, the background gets really repetitive really fast. Still, the performance is quite good, with solid 60fps even with multiple explosions on the screen.GAMEPLAYYou control a customizable ship, and your objective is to get to the end of each map and defeat the boss. There are two types of attack: one to destroy flying vehicles and bombs, the other to destroy land vehicles and enemy bases. You can also acquire powerups and new weapons (as well as ship upgrades)through the shop using the money and XP that you gain at the end of each level.If you like this genre, you will love this game: it is formulaic but fun. If you never liked this type of games when they were popular in the arcades, I find it hard that you will enjoy it now.CHALLENGEThe game is very challenging on every difficulty setting, and it can get really frustrating the more you play it: sometimes dodging enemy fire seems impossible, and some of the boss fights will require more luck than actual skills.SOUNDThe sound effects are very good and each weapon and ship has its unique sounds. The soundtrack fits the game and, while it is forgettable, it does give you enough strength to keep going.REPLAYABILITYEven though there is small amount of Steam achievements (only 19), multiple difficulty settings, online leaderboards, local and online multiplayer will keep you coming back to this game more than once.While it lacks in a story and the gameplay is very formulaic, there is much to enjoy in this game and you will spend mutliple hours trying to improve your ship and get higher scores. I highly recommend this game to fans of the genre and to those looking for a challenge. If you are new to the genre, I recommend waiting for it to go on sale.Story: n/aGraphics: 7Gameplay: 8Challenge: 9Sound: 7.5Replayability: 8ENJOYMENT: 7.5FRUSTRATION: 7Follow me on Twitter: @nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on Facebook{LINK REMOVED}Check my official websiteJoin my Steam group "

												Yes! Yes! Yes! :)This game is really fun and addictive! Never expected it to be that nice, especially for the price paid (compared to other games that were priced this low). You can play either in single-player mode, or in multi-player. And the latter mode is so great, you can compete with other players and try to get your score higher and higher every time :) Sometimes there's literally a hell on your screen, but it's fun to survive that :) The game gets updates and is very well designed, so it gives you hours of gameplay unlike some more expensive titles.Definitely recommended!

												The general idea and systems are great. The scrap system with unlocking weapons slots is works well. The regularly upgrading item shop will keep you changing out and trying new equipment each level. The sheild system is one of the best Ive seen in this type of game. It also sports a cool perk system which allows you to further customize the experience. While the technical and paper design is fairly strong, where the game falls short is the execution. The UI is challenging and you will more than likely accidentaly purchase a weapon twice or salvage something you want before fully understanding  the shop/equip menu. The art is quite bad overall with uninspiring visual designs in enemies, VFX and environment. There are a few really good boss encounters and some of the enemy patterns keep the gameplay feeling somewhat unique throughout.  The majority of the regular enemies and the bulk of levels are fairly bland and the pacing feels flat. There are very few highs and lows which makes the game start to feel boring too quickly.  Ground enemies shoot up at you and its very unclear when you will get hit so it can feel cheap at certain points. Overall: Good design + Mediocre gameplay execution + Bellow par visuals.  I will give this a very soft thumbs up, but I only reccomend this game to hardcore vertical shooter fans that have a lot of free time on their hands.			"

												Great game.The graphics is simple, typical side-scrolling shooting game. But there're some good points here,1. It's not that flashy and crowded (e.g. too much lighting, flashing bomb, etc.). I personally like this.2. I dont know about many other game like this nowadays, but in this game, when a ground unit shoot the missile,artillery, bomb, it actually getting bigger when it's closing in, not like some games who have ground+air units, yet the projectile still looks the same no matter they shoot from different angle/height/distance.Gameplay,1. Leveling system. Few games of this genre have this system, and with this, we can get the perks system and open some weapons slot2. The perks system (some call it mastery, passive, etc.) works well in this game.3. Customized arsenal (YES, I LIKE IT A LOT). Remember in some games like this, when you accidentally took 1 single weapon powerup, and your current maximum level weapon got replaced by lvl 1 new weapon? We dont have it in this game. We set the weapon right from the start at the armory. We can choose what we want in our plane, and we have 6 (AFAIK, could be more) weapon slots.Finally, the support from the developerTHEY ARE AMAZING!!!The response is quick,and the explanation is simple (the solution worked immediately).

												This game isn't the prettiest of 'em all. In fact it's more like ""Brienne of Tarth"" of shoot 'em ups. But if you can look past the poor visuals - some qualities await you. The qualities being:Solid, fast paced gameplay.Great progression system, including ship upgrades, leveling up and some sort of skill tree (being depicted as a simple list, though).Surprising and interesting visual effects that get the job done pretty well, despite being of mediocre quality.All in all, a fun shmup worth playing. It's now for €0.19 which is hilarious. I'm not sure I'd be completely happy if I got it at full price, but any reasonable discount should justify the purchase.			"

												This is very interesting game which for some weird reason looks horrible on the store screenshots. Actually it has nice graphics with recognizable enemies and enviromental effects(like water ripples. It looks especially fun after nuclear strike. Yeah, this kind of game takes attention to detail) which makes experience organic and skill-based without some weird unexpectancies ruining the ride. Bosses are kinda fun: those are simple enough in terms of mechanic, but as I said - no unexpectancies: new enemies require adaptation, but learning ways to counter them is fun enough. Levels show interesting ways of indicating change of pace - zooming in or changing direction of flight. Leveling system is grindy sometimes but it provides good boost in case of hard level as loosing it makes XP accumulate regardless.It is also notable this game has enormous amount of additional gameplay capabilities: versus mode and stuff which should make it really good investment for prolonged amount of fun. Especially, considering current price.			"

												It's 19 cents.It's an old school shooter with purchased upgrades. (in game purchases, not micro-transactions)It's fairly difficult, but not stupid hard.Nice graphics.I'd reccomend it, but I really wish someone could make a decent modern SHMUP that ""feels"" like the old school games as far as the intensity of action and level design.It's still a nice little shoot 'em up that will give you a little bit of Raiden or DonPachi style action.Edit: After spending more time with this game and beating the campaign, I can say it's a definite reccomend!There is a lot of extra stuff tossed in, like randomly generated skirmishes, a level up and perk system, and tons of weapons to try out and equip.

Revolution Ace is a really well done throwback to shoot-em-ups from the good old days of gaming, clearly inspired by games like the Raptor and 1940 series. It has everything that you could want in a modernized aircraft shooter, all of the aspects you know and love from back in the day with hints of more modern features such as customizable weapons, upgrades, a perks system and some cool multiplayer and challenger features brought to you by the ""Battle Chains"" mode. The lengthy singleplayer campaign is also a very welcome addition. Graphically, Revolution Ace isn't anything ground-breaking, but it's still pleasant to look at and is sufficient for the gameplay it re-introduces. The game is only really flawed by what feels like some overall polish and optimization issues here and there, FPS drops tend to happen somewhat often during later levels in the campaign, this can be helped by lowering the graphical options in the settings menu (though it shouldn't be necessary as my machine is capable of running games like Portal 2 with maxed out graphical settings). The user interface isn't fantastic either, it feels somewhat rushed and amateurish compared to the game itself, but the gameplay more or less makes up for some small graphical issues.Overall, this is a game I would happily recommend to anybody who enjoys some casual Shoot-Em-Up action. It's not a groundbreaking game, but it succeeds at what it sets out to do. Revolution Ace is worth it's price and is guaranteed to keep you entertained for hours.			"

												Disclaimer: I was given a Steam key for this game and did not pay for it.I don't really play bullet-hell or top-down shooters very often, but this one has been fun so far. The progression of upgrades and weapons is nicely paced, and there's enough variety to keep things interesting (new weapons/armor, perks, leveling up, etc). Boss battles are challenging but fair, even on easy difficulties. My only real complaint is that there's a very, very tiny delay (think mouse smoothing or something like that) between moving the mouse and the ship moving on screen. This looks to be a feature, but it took me some getting used to. Other than that, the controls are intuitive and responsive. Every time I died it was earned.The graphics are much nicer than the screenshots make them out to be. The music and sound effects fit in nicely with the action and don't become annoying at any point that I've reached yet. I haven't made it very far into the game, but I'm interested to see what else it has to offer. The price is right on point for something like this.If you like bullet-hell or top-down scrolly-shooters, then pick this one up.			"

												Cool take on a bullet hell shooter. But the lack of in game temporary picks ups makes the usually visceral experience provided by the genre absent.  Levelling up and being able to customise are good additions though. Having two seperate fire buttons for ground and sky enemies would have surely looked better on paper than it feels in game. Would prefer all guns blazing and coming into contact with the first enemy they hit vertically on the screen. As someone who accidentally flips through text based tutorials I did not figure out that there were ground and sky buttons until around the 3 or 4th game. Fire originating from ground enemies is hard to judge as it is in a 3d space when the view is 2.5d or potentially isometric.Well worth a look if you are into the genre but it is kind of a mixed bag.

												This is an inept Raptor: Call of the Shadows clone released 20 years after the fact. I could deal with the flash game graphics (static objects that pan and rotate whee) and Fischer Price: My First Soundtrack if the gameplay wasn't so hopeless. Popcorn enemies are bullet sponges, your weapons are varied but mostly feel impotent, and your gigantic hitbox extends generously past the visual border of your plane. Still, it's largely challengeless because the cheap hits are offset by a huge health bar and recharging shield. It's actually easier to beat many levels without shooting at all. Crazy.I only paid 25 cents or something, but it would have been better spent on a gumball. I'm mostly just irked that I wasted my time.			"

												Revolution Ace is an Indie Shoot'em Up reminiscent of other, older, games like Tyrian or Raptor. The game is made in the Unreal Engine so it has some quite nice features, one of which would be actual game depth as opposed to a ""drawn"" background. Graphically speaking it isn't the top, but it isn't the worst. Some projectiles look nice, while then you have others which look like a brown Big Bullet Bills which could've and should've been handled differently. The music is mediocre, but it could get boring after playing it for a while. Some of the things that disturbed me the most was the lag/skipping of the music in the Main Menu, which didn't happen in-game but as well the fact it takes so long to unlock weapon slots and for some Achievements did not unlock. Some ground units seemingly just passed through impassable terrain making it a lot more confusing and for some reason some of the air units look like containers, furthermore confusing me about which projectiles to use because of the way they all look alike. Sometimes the combat feels clunky and slow, while the enemies just rush past you(most of the time you won't clear the waves, even when the enemies return). Shields will also regenerate only when you aren't shooting, but the whole point of the game is to shoot and destroy enemies, so that might need a rework. I also noticed the first two bosses were easier than normal enemies. Overall this game has high potential but it need some polishing, or so I believe. One of the most fun things is the upgrades the game offers for your Aircraft. I'd suggest buying it on sale, probably.>I'd give it a 4/10>Pros: High customization, destroyable terrain(buildings), nice depth perception, some parts of the graphics are nice, solid UI, multiplayer and several game modes, has cards and achievements(though the achievements didn't unlock for me)>Cons: Buggy, confusing enemy patterns, feels somewhat clunky and slow while enemies are too fast(most of the shots will miss because of that), first bosses weren't that challenging(I don't know about the rest)Copy supplied by developer.

												This game,  is a pretty fun shooter, enemies attack from both the air and ground and the completing levels rewards you with experience points and shrapnel. Experience points are tallied up to increase the level of your jet, which leads to rewards such as more slots and new weapons and a perk of your choice. The perks range from better armor to faster bullets or strong laser. The shrapnel is your currency and is used to purchase the machine guns, missiles and beam cannons as well as shields and special attacks that make your craft so strong. There are more than 20 weapons to choose from and the placement on your jet matters which makes it fun. "

I definitely recommend this game to anybody who enjoys the the genera or those feeling nostalgic yet still want the ability to increase difficulty. One criticism I have is the lack of a timer beyond determining your bonus at the end of the stage.

There are four difficulty settings to cater for players of varying skill levels.The menu system is well laid out and easy to use.The sound tracks are great metal riffs providing a good audio adrenaline pulse.  Game sounds are well sampled and well synchronized with what is observed on screen.Stages have beautifully textured terrain and plenty of variety.  There are a good assortment of units to destroy including air units, ground vehicles and turrets.  Buildings and terrain take damage too.  Floating collectible bonus spawns on destruction of certain units or buildings.This game is well polished and has a good replay value.Rating  9.5 / 10			"

												A fun top-down shooter, despite some rough edges. Game mechanics offers some depth due to availability of variety of weapon characteristics, air vs ground attack difference, multiple slots (that actually makes a difference) and perks. As for the background music and graphics, I think they are OK, although not outstanding. However, bullets are sometimes difficult to distinguish from the background, and I've experienced some rare cases of framerate slowdown. The starter weapons feel underpowered, fortunately this becomes less of a problem as player buys weapon upgrades. It also helps that the game is divided into many short levels instead of few long ones, and player gains XP (and can level up) even if he/she fails to complete a level.			"

												I played this game for almost 3 hours now and I think its time to write a review and move on. I think I payed 0.24 cents for this which is a steal. If you can find it for 0.50 it is still worth it. It is not a game which you play for hours in a row but it is something which you come back for to do a few missions. You can upgrade your plane with different weapons and you can unlock perks by leveling up. It's more then just flying around and shoot everything there is also a little bit of ""RPG"" things going on with the perks and weapon upgrades which you unlock by leveling up. I can say, I could play this game even more but hey, it was 0.24 cents and I have other games I could play. So time to move on, but not because the game has become boring. I could go in the game right now and be stuck for 30+45 minutes in it playing missions and unlocking things.Gameplay Video:

-Quick Review-Revolution Ace is a throwback to old Arcade Bullet Hell game play that many experienced on the classic NES console. Revolution Ace lets you chose your own difficulty, and offers a great deal more entertaining game play; without the controller throwing and raging that I experienced with the classic Bullet Hell games.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: There isn't much to say about the story in this game... as you play through the game occasionally some text pops up speculating on why you're shooting down all these enemy planes.Game Play: You have two ""shooting"" buttons, one for flying vehicles and one for ground vehicles/buildings. The rest of the controls are simply movement controls, up, down, left, and right. As you progress through the game you get ""Scrap"" from your various missions that can be use to purchase upgrades for your aircraft in the Armory. There are plenty of upgrades to chose from; bullet weapons, laser weapons, rocket weapons, shields, and super weapons.Achievements: There are 19 achievements within the game, all of which are quite obtainable, the last 3 achievement do need a few tricks or repeatedly playing through certain levels to meet the required objectives.I earned close to 50% of the achievements on my first play through. It's also worth noting that all the achievements are able to be earned by yourself. So this is a nice easy ""100% Achievement"" game.Price Revolution Ace is priced at $4.99 that's a fair priced for how much time you can spend playing the game. I put in 7 hours before I had all the achievements (05/19/15), and if you really enjoy playing these types of games, it's definitely a good genre to add to your steam library.Conclusion: I can't remember the last time I played Bullet Hell game, but this one was definitely a winner, I recommend this game to anyone who misses playing old classic Bullet Hell games, however with less difficulty. Unless you like difficulty, in that case you can simply play Revolution Ace on a harder difficulty.			"

												Many dubious elements make this game to be far from correct:User interface is not very good: very little text font and not very well situated armor, shield and combo panels. Shop could have separate windows for air, ground, shield and superweapons, and show you precisely how the weapon works in another window. Instead of this, you have the not very handsome shopkeeper looking at you.Inicial firepower is ridiculous. Enemies gather on screen even on later stages.Has two separate buttons for air and ground shotting. This is the worst idea ever! At minimum firepower it becomes frustrating: you shoot at the ground, air enemies get you; you shot at the air, ground enemies overflow you with bullets. There are even some bosses which can only be hit by ground weapons, which have usually the less damage.Game probably expects you to grind money for weapons.Enemies and scenaries seem to repeat themselves instead of being separated by theme or appearance. The result is monotonous levels, all of them very alike.Bullet patterns from enemies and bosses do not seem to be very polished. There are moments where you will simply take damage whatever you do.Enemy waves do not seem to have a lot of thought behind them. They seem random and sometimes they stay on screen until they are destroyed, whith at early levels can create an extremely tough situation.Sometimes the game zooms in and you have less space to dodge bullets with no apparent reason. Also, when the screen turns ninety degrees it doesn't look very dinamic or game-like.Your ship is not very pretty.Story is just some scattered paragraphs.Yes, this game is cheap. But mainly it lacks some more mind work on its gameplay.			"

												A very good classic shooter.  The graphics won't blow you away, and the sound is OK, not great, but all that doesn't matter when the gameplay shines.The mechanics are simple.  One fire button attacks air targets, the other attacks ground targets.  Don't fire to charge shields.  If you miss an enemy they will be back a second time with a yellow border.It is the combination of all of these factors in the escalating mission design that makes this a top shelf shooter.  Plus, you can send enemies at other people in multiplayer.8/10			"

												When I was little, I used to play those aircraft shooter games at the arcade machines. Those can be fun, just moving the joystick, rapidly tapping on the 1, 2 or 3 buttons, destroying everything and picking up everything. Then when you die, you just insert more coins and continue the game. One simple playthrough. No headaches.Some may like it that way, but some might find it boring. How about this: an aircraft shooter game that you can play in the comfort of your home, with elements of customization; change weapons, upgrade armors. Gives you all the more reason to pick up drops than just aiming for the highest position on the highscore board.That is what Revolution Ace is. It is an arcade aircraft shooter. But it isn't just any aircraft shooter. It is 30% shoot anything that moves, 30% strategy and deciding what weapons to use for which mission, and 30% grinding for experience, levels, and the currency to upgrade stuff. The other 10%? Oh, that's reserved for the multiplayer capability.So if you like all the elements that make out the 100% of this game, get it, but only if you're a fan of aircraft shooters. It's not the top notch game in the market, but it's not all that bad either. I can definitely recommend this.Hikumi gives this game, a 5 out of 10.			"

												I have been gaming, one way or another, for over 30 years. My favourite genre is twin stick shoot-em-up`s. Having watched some video of this game in action, I decided to take the plunge, was it worth it?My God, yes it was. This game contains everything I love about the genre. Masses of different enemies, many many weapons to unlock and equip, colurdul, detailed levels, and so much more.....  I think the Devs were trying to recreate the shooters from the old school, and they succeeded, and them some. The love and attention that has gone into this game shines through, and it makes playing the game even more pleasurable.One of the best features is the multi-player aspect, of sorts. If you get a good score on a level, you can decide to upload that level to the online leaderboards. It then becomes a challenge, and anyone who sees it, can have a go at beating your time/score. If they manage to do this, they can the re-upload the challenge, and send it back to you. I have been having a challenge with another guy for about 10 days now. It is so satisfying to beat their score, and send the challenge back to them.In closing, if you are in ANY WAY interested in this type of game, you really cannot go wrong. For the price, you are getting a game that is going to take you a fair while to actually complete, and then you have bonus levels, and the afore mentioned multi-player challenge system.I whole heartedly recommend this game.10/10			"

Back in the days we had 3 (three) alphanumeric digits for our highscores at the arcade and still knew who everyone was.We also didn't just ditch a game (or write a bad review) if there was a problem, without even checking if there's a solution.

It's got cards and achievements, mappable controls and controller support. Gameplay wise as a Shoot'em'Up it does many things right, which will, over time, make you look past the not too shiny graphics. It's Unreal Engine but sometimes you might wish it was hand-drawn 2D instead.To keep this short, there are extensive positive reviews by other people on here that I mostly agree with.One last thing FYI: You might have to manually free some ports to be able to find games online.

												Revolution Ace is an Old School bullet hell inspired game, but with a couple modern twists.The core gameplay itself is basically the same, lots of enemies and lots of bullets, and you gotta shoot them all down.And at the end of the level there is a lovely boss battle awaiting your arrival.If you are a fan of bullet hell shooters, this is a sure go for you.Especially since this game possesses a few extra things to it.Like ground targets, a level up system, bizarre water physics, a nice co-op mode, a versus mode, an ""offline"" versus mode(basically like a highscore system, where you challenge your friends to beat it) and Hank your trusty engineer.If your not a fan and got some spare cash, you might just give it a try, it is a nice and fun time killer.But the main campaign does drag itself a bit, possibly due to the leveling mechanic.The game can also double as a nice bonding experience with a brother of friend due to some stages an insane mode being quite challenging, thus possibly requiring the aid of a partner to best them.All in all it's a solid game, but it haves some issues, but it stays true to the genre besides it's added components.I'd recommend it, but don't expect a masterpiece.

												Revolution Ace is basically a spiritual sequel to Raptor: Call of the Shadows, which is neat because Raptor was one of the better non-Japanese scrolling shooters. Unfortunately, other than being in HD, it's basically worse in every way.The graphics may be in HD, but they're not nearly as well-drawn, and I frequently found myself losing track of enemy bullets against the background. The Raptor-esque ship customization is mostly retained, but weapons generally are limited to either air or ground targets, and don't lose much power when you take the ones which can hit both - to me, this meant that the four or so weapons that could hit both air and ground targets were the only choices, since otherwise I'd be leaving tons of damage on the table against some or all targets.I didn't really end up with much else to say. It wasn't a terrible effort, and the core mechanics work well enough, but ultimately it was just a knockoff that I didn't feel had anything to really say for itself or any reason that you should play it. I recommend just replaying Raptor or Tyrian instead.			"

												""Revolution Ace"" is a great indie shoot 'em up similar to the classic ""Raptor: Call of the Shadows"". You fit your ship with a number of weapons to battle hordes of air and ground targets. Collect scraps to upgrade your weapons and gain experience to level up and learn perks for additional bonuses.Its core gameplay is by no means unique, but ""Revolution Ace"" executes the concept well. The variety of weapons, specials and armor allow for different playstyles. The different game modes allow single player, two player co-op, versus and online battles. The difficulty can be adjusted to suit both hardcore gamers and newbies to the genre.The graphics are fairly good, with interesting explosion and water effects. The music generally suits the mood. Not much in terms of story, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing for a shoot 'em up.Overall, I would recommend it to any player looking for a well made shoot 'em up game.			"

												A lot of fun, if you're playing by yourself or with friends.  For the price, you're getting a good game.  However, as expected, for the price, you're getting a lot of issues as well.  The online functions of the game need a lot of work as the connection issues it has can kick you out mid game, kick you from the party after the mission, or make simply joining the party a living hell.  The game also crashes rather unexpectedly for no apparant reason.  During certain missions, if you're not host, enemies may be entirely invisible.  Also as you hit higher levels it becomes a grind fest to get the scrap and experience to keep steadily progressing.  Nor do you get a reward for every level up which is a relatively minor complaint.  The most glaring problems are the multiplayer and I think with work it will be great.  If you get this game, don't expect to be playing it with friends.  It is a great time waster to play by yourself however.  The weapons don't feel imbalanced and the enemies don't really feel cheap or overpowered.			"

[NEUTRAL] - Solid shooter with some annoying flawsPROS: 1 - Several difficulty modes that can be adjusted anytime; 2 - Campaign that can be played in modes +1 and +2 with increased challenge. 3 - Graphics are nice. 4 - Achievements are not so hard to get 100%.CONS:1 - Perks (bonuses you get every few level ups) are forever locked after picked. And they are sometimes specialized for weapon types, becoming useless if you decide to change weapons later on.2 - Battle Chains mode is clunky. I only ever see the same 6 matches available online (all of them are too hard for me to tackle). The game often crashes while I'm creating a new BC match. If I am lucky enough to finish it and choose ""upload it globally"", I don't keep it local to replay and it never appears in the ""sent by me"" tab.3 - Can be grindy sometimes4 - Colored bullets - both yours and the enemie's - make it hard to know what is yours and what is theirs (in other words, what should you be avoiding and what you can pass through). a fixed color that's only used in your bullets would be a great addition.OVERALL: I finished the campaign 3 times (normal, +1 and +2) and got all achievements but have no patience to grind my level up to unlock all perks. As a completionist, it bothers me. And as I chose some perks for weapon types I'm not using now, they became useless perk slots that I cannot change - this could be the difference between being able to tackle on harder challenges or not. Battle Chains is a nice idea but seems to have a flawed execution. I stand in a neutral 3/5. You won't me missing much if you skip this one, but if you don't, yeah it can be fun.			"

But with nicer graphics, full controller support and local split screen.Obviously this isn't innovative game play, or a fantastic story.But it is good at what it does and it's really cheap, especially if you get it as part of a bundle as I did.Definitely don't regret spending a few cents on this to bring back some childhood memories.

												I just played another shoot-em-up right before this and what a difference the two games have. I honestly base shoot-em-up games mainly on the in game graphics.The gameplay's graphics were designed to be somewhat realistic, but the game suffers from this imo. It's not the good-looking kind of realistic, which annoyed me when I played the game since I couldn't clearly see the enemy's projectiles. In a game where I am supposed to dodge and shoot everyone up, not being able to clearly see (so you can dodge the projectile) defeats the purpose of the game. I ended up not giving the game much of a chance after the first few minutes of gameplay since I kept getting frustrated with the graphics. I did not want to attempt even harder levels where there are more enemies than the first level with these graphics. Overall, the game might have potential to be played. However, I couldn't bear with the graphics to keep trying. I suggest this for players that don't mind the graphics and just enjoy shoot-em-up in general. 5/10.			"

												When you have a game priced around a dollar or two make no mistake that it would be a budget title, but just because it wasn’t charging you an arm or a leg it doesn’t mean it had to be bad. What we have here is quite the contrary indeed.While the use of Unreal engine on a shoot them up might have been a weird choice, the action in itself is slick and fanciful, there wasn’t a moment where I felt put off by the graphics. The implementation of a physics system meant you can see you enemies explode in a multitude of ways as well, with debris causing ripples across the sea or scraps rolling down the hill.That said, the game did suffer from some pacing problems with awkward windows where nothing spawned screen for ages, ruining your combo. The boss designs also suffered from a lack of creativity too, with a few so mundane that made the battle felt underwhelming.The most noteworthy feature is the lengthy campaign, which has 18 stages in total spanning 4 to 8 minutes each. If that wasn’t enough to justify purchase, there are also procedurally generated challenges made with seeds, along with two multi-player modes. So if you aren’t completely sold upon first glance, you can always count on replay value instead.All that aside, you can definitely do a lot worse with 2 bucks on Steam, so there’s no reason not to give this title a try.

												When you have a game priced around a dollar or two make no mistake that it would be a budget title, but just because it wasn’t charging you an arm or a leg it doesn’t mean it had to be bad. What we have here is quite the contrary indeed.While the use of Unreal engine on a shoot them up might have been a weird choice, the action in itself is slick and fanciful, there wasn’t a moment where I felt put off by the graphics. The implementation of a physics system meant you can see you enemies explode in a multitude of ways as well, with debris causing ripples across the sea or scraps rolling down the hill.That said, the game did suffer from some pacing problems with awkward windows where nothing spawned screen for ages, ruining your combo. The boss designs also suffered from a lack of creativity too, with a few so mundane that made the battle felt underwhelming.The most noteworthy feature is the lengthy campaign, which has 18 stages in total spanning 4 to 8 minutes each. If that wasn’t enough to justify purchase, there are also procedurally generated challenges made with seeds, along with two multi-player modes. So if you aren’t completely sold upon first glance, you can always count on replay value instead.All that aside, you can definitely do a lot worse with 2 bucks on Steam, so there’s no reason not to give this title a try.

												I enjoy this game, I've always been a fan of shooter games like this. I started out on easy, it felt like a medium difficulty. By the Canyon Complex stage it felt more like hard/advanced. I agree with a reviewer who mentioned the weapons seem under powered, it really shouldn't take that long to shoot a tiny rocket out of the sky. Overall I enjoy the game, it would probably be a lot more fun with a friend by my side, lighting up the sky.Edit: While its on sale, I suggest buying a few copies to give to your friends so you can play co-op because there doesn't seem to be anyone playing. It's worth the 19 cents, I bought a few copies.			"

												Grinding in a Shoot-em-up? Yep, and not the fun kind either.For starters Revolution Ace is very unfriendly to new players. I've played for 2 hours and my weapons were just as useless as when i started despite numerous ""upgrades"".Also if you like playing this kind of game with a mouse, forget it; the sensitivity is way too low even on its maximum setting. There are a lot of dopey design decisions, chiefly:Power-up's having a delay between their appearance and their availability.Enemy ship types which are impossible to destroy on their first pass without you taking more damage than them.In-game power-up's which don't last long enough to be of any use.Super-weapons which are either ineffective or take so long to recharge that you only get to use them once per level. Ship and weapon upgrades that don't appear to make your foes any easier to kill or your ship any harder to damage.Level-up 'perks' which are so ineffective that one questions their inclusion in the game. There is an auto shield-recharge but by the time the game has realised that you're not shooting anymore, the screen has filled up again.And occasionally the game crashes on exit and prevents you returning to desktop. What's good about it? Some of the music is cool and I like the 3-dimensional landscape. Overall Revolution Ace is more frustrating than is really necessary. With so many excellent shooters available, there really is no room for this title; at least not for money.			"

												If there was such a category as ""casual shmup"" this would be itIf you look for challenging gameplay, look elsewhere. This game has no hitbox and  no complicated bullet patterns. It will not challenge your reflexes. It does not require a lot of concentration. The difficulty level is either easy(when you have sufficent upgrades) or literally impossible(if you dont have sufficent upgrades). Play if you are stressed and just want to shoot something without paying much attention to what is it that you're shooting.			"

												Ill keep this one shortThis is a nice game resembling a lot of the aspects of a very old (and quite awesome) game like Raptor.The online features give it some replayability and overall you can have some decent fun playing the campaign or modes in between games, also very reasonable price.While overall the game concept is ok and one can have fun with the game, i cannot completely recommend it due to some of the performance holes this game has. Particularly with co op or any splitscreen mode, the game fails to render properly and completely breaks the fps on high end machines. Also it can get jammed or it can freeze upon exit. Those issues should be addressed to be able to recomend this			"

												Okay wow this is an unexpectedly good game. Bought it randomly for $0.25 (ironically like inserting a single quarter into an old timey arcade machine).First of all my background: I played ~300 hours of Raptor Call of the Shadows when I was growing up (shareware version from a magazine, then I bought the full version that Apogee mailed to me on floppies).If you loved Raptor you'll love this.If you saw screenshots of Raptor without understanding it, or prefer Japanese-style bullet hell shooters, or side scrollers, you might not like this.The tactical combat is almost exactly like Raptor, right down to most enemies shooting yellow orbs at you (and the ""wave"" gun and auto-targetting laser). You will take damage, that's unavoidable, so shield/armor management is an important part of each level (just like Raptor). You can equip multiple weapons with vastly different weapon patterns. Target priority and order is very important, as is deciding between air and ground. Lots of neat enemies and some fun levels with your plane flying higher/lower or the view rotating.First some complaints I read, but didn't experience. Not sure if the dev just fixed them over time or if the original issue was wrong. Either way:- Grinding - There was grinding in Raptor. If you don't think so you didn't play Elite difficulty, where you had to farm the lower difficulties for money and upgrades. Even before the final Outer Regions waves you'd farm the earlier levels that dropped shields to have more than the max. So redoing some missions or a bit of skirmish here shouldn't be unfamiliar or unfun.- Performance - Ran fine for me. I didn't have an fps counter on, so maybe the framerate dropped, but projectiles were still dodge-able and there was no visible stutter. When playing the graphics actually look better than the screenshots.- Slowness - For the screen/view size the plane is almost exactly as fast as Raptor. Again, expectations.- Anemic Weapons - Depending on your loadout you might have to stay on a target for a bit. There are few one shots here. No surprises considering how long even late-game Raptor took to kill some enemies. This means you need to get used to how many shots it takes to kill an enemy, and not waste more than that.- Hitboxes - Your plane/ship seems accurately represented, and I've dodged shots by what felt like pixels. Sometimes enemies have deceiving hitboxes in regards to their shape, but that's pretty rare.- PhysX - Someone mentioned needing older Nvidia drivers for this game. I ran it fine with the latest drivers at the time.So basically a lot of the complaints can be explained as: that's how Raptor did it.If I DID have a complaint with the game it's that incoming enemies don't have shadows, which makes it a bit hard to be pre-firing at the right area. The backgrounds can similarly be a bit distracting/overwhelming at times. And the weapon and equipment could use better ordering or sorting in the shop. Not anything game breaking though.But that is balanced but a dozen pros, a few of which I'll list here:- Random Levels - I would have killed for this feature as a kid. You can choose a seed and get a random level complete with a boss. So fun and so replayable, and really adds enjoyment to any ""grinding"" aspect. In addition the campaign is 20 levels, plus another 4 unique plus 8 types of random for skirmish.- Shield Recharge - Shields have a recharge delay and rate which kicks in once you start shooting. Managing this is a lot of fun and adds a new dynamic.- Enemies Return - If you don't kill an enemy they come back later (and reward less scrap on death). So levels quickly spiral if you miss kills.- Ground and Air - Very fun switching between the two, and it's a bit more seamless than Raptor where you'd have to swap active weapons. Here you just hold ""Shift"" to fire any available ground weapons.- Builds - With perks and such varied weapons you get a lot of choice to each playthrough. You could focus on Plasma, or maybe go for rebounding missiles, or rapid firing machine guns.- Modes - Some really unique and imaginative modes outside the main campaign, such as competitive ""Battle Chains"". Great amount of content for such an inexpensive game.In summary the best way to describe this game is an underrated gem and spiritual successor to Raptor. I'm sad for the dev that it didn't get more initial praise and seems to be misunderstood by the majority of the community.Well I'm happy to say as a hardcore Raptor player this hits the EXACT right spot.(And if your time is worth anything at all, in the time you read this review you earned well over the price of the game			"

												Fun Arcade Style scrolling Fighter Plane Game. Best Played with a Friend. You can customize your fighter between levels with the points you earn. You also unlock weapon slots as you level up. Played with a friend pretty much 3 hours straight the first night and nearly unlocked all of the weapon slots. That really opens you up to tweaking your build to what works for you. The way it was designed you just about have to switch to some skirmish games between some of the campaign levels. You will find you just need a bit more points to unlock some things, so you can make it through the next campaign level. You have to complete a level to actually earn points to buy things, but you get to keep your experience. The game play is fairly fast paced compared to a classic like 1942.			"

												I tried to give this game a good rating, but instead, I found frustration.I'll be honest, the game pwned me within the first levels till I worked my way out of those weapons and made the perfect combo for my style, however, something that is unforgivable in this case, is low framerates on a bullet hell game. Hell, I loved the water physics that was promised, but at the first level you play at night, from the middle of the map and onward, the frames drop real low at a point I no longer have control of my ship nor can predict the projectile paths like I did in every previous levels, so yeah, the game disappoints me, it has potential but maybe it should focus on performance a bit more, in order to give the players a smooth gameplay.

You have to avoid enemy bullets and ships and get scrap by killing enemy units. You can use these scrap to buy new items in the armory. Whenever you are not shooting, your shields will regenerate back. You are able to kill enemies on the land and in the sky. If you have missed an enemy, then there is a chance that it will return with a yellow highlight but in the results of less money.  If you are levelling up and you are high enough, then you will unlock a perk at your choice.Music is okay.Game could be repetitive.Graphics is okay.You are able to level up.No Tutorial.Other things.Some of the bullets could be hard to see becaues of the background scenery.Grindy-------------------I Give this game a 6/10 "

												So many great ideas here completely undermined by awful art design. Your shots feel powerless and disappear into the background, it's hard to tell when you're actually causing damage to the enemies, and even harder to tell when enemies are considered ""on the ground"" (requiring a different shot) or not.If this game was re-released with a few competent art people doing a graphics overhaul, it might be one of the greatest shmups of the decade, but as it currently is, it's all potential with very little delivery, no matter how hard one tries to like it for the innovations it brings to the table.

Yes, I'm Looking For Some Computer Games? Something Like Solitaire? Maybe Pong? Do You Have Pong? - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Steam is home to an abundance of all sorts of games. Almost everything conceivable can be found there, from the latest big budget title to the most niche girls with cat ears hentai clicker game.While some titles can slip through the cracks, Steam's major sales can always bring some interesting things to the surface for pretty cheap. The Steam bargain bin is kinda like a box of chocolates though. There's good, there's bad, and the doctors say if I have any more they'll take my foot. And sometimes, there's stuff like Revolution Ace.Does your dad like to play the computey games? Maybe your grandpa? Do they talk about all the Japs they killed in The War? Are modern games too hard for them? Have them play this. They'll love it.Revolution Ace is an old-school shoot-em-up, in the same vein as classics like Raptor or Tyrian. Or like Xevious, you probably know what Xevious is. Space Invaders. Pew-pew? The games they used to play on big ♥♥♥♥ing stove♥♥♥♥♥things. Not a hard concept to visualize.You steer a ship around an auto-scrolling level and shoot incoming enemies. Sometimes you get power-ups, sometimes you don't. The communists would love to promise you power-ups guaranteed for everyone, but they're full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Commie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Revolution Ace is a decent shoot-em-up for a semi-modern take on MS-DOS classics, though somewhat slower paced than most.Not particularly original, as most of it is a revisiting of elements from older classic shooters, shooters that are freeware you can literally just download for free somewhere. But people love retro, that's totally cool. Most indie games are just rehashed retro games anyway, right? They got the jumping, the shooting, and all the stuff you used to play on your old Nintendo computer game system. Same thing, right? Just like grandpa used to play. Only he played in real life, and killed real people. Ha ha, good old gramps.Touting full 3D environments and all the marvels of modern graphics, complete with Unreal Engine power and real water physics simulation, Revolution Ace looks great. They put all those fancy words in the game description, just like a real AAA game. It definitely looks more modern and recent than any older shooter, which is really just common sense. It's not playing on a ♥♥♥♥ing calculator display. Of course it's going to look better. But there in comes the biggest gripe I had with the game.None of it is necessary, none of it improves the core gameplay, and at times it actually detracts from the experience. You don't need to put a pound of sprinkles on a cracker with some whipped cream on it. They won't all fit, and you won't even be able to see the cracker. And who the ♥♥♥♥ would put whipped cream on a cracker in the first place? There's no reason for that. There's no excuse. It really feels like their priorities were a little backwards.Bullets are near indistinguishable from the background on certain maps, the Call of Duty color palette melding together into a mess of movement that's almost dizzying at times. Sometimes entire enemies, or your own ship even, will get lost amid all the action on screen. There's just too much going on, everywhere, all the time. I don't mind the fancy backgrounds, but something to make the things you should actually be keeping your eye on more pronounced from the environment would've been really helpful. A more stylized approach probably would've went over a lot better.Revolution Ace's odd graphical quirks don't stop at its overly obnoxious backgrounds though. There's multilevel enemy placement, with certain enemies in the air, and certain ones on the ground. Different buttons will be your ground attack and air attack, so you need to make sure you know what you're aiming at. Which is kind of a ♥♥♥♥♥ when you can't differentiate what is what.Do you know the difference between a boat and a ship? Now imagine that same boat and ship, the exact same size, with almost no way to differentiate 3D space. That way, if you're fighting over a very plain ocean backdrop, they can still confuse you. Gotta make sure you're frustrated somehow. It's something you get used to, but a graphical oversight nonetheless.The game's graphical issues reach their height of absolute exasperation in the multiplayer modes, which shrinks everything down for split-screen action. There's just too much happening on screen and not enough room to display it all, especially when the backgrounds make seeing interactable objects as hard as it already does.I was able to work past the odd graphical design choices, but even then it's not a particularly great shoot-em-up. The slower pace is alright at first, but levels become a complete slog as you progress. The bizarre RPG elements don't quite fit. Upgrading and customizing your ship, I'm down with. Raptor had that, Tyrian had that. But the sluggish leveling and upgrading system in Revolution Ace almost requires you to go back and play older levels purely to grind for experience to unlock more weapon slots.Enemies can take a surprising amount of bullets for a shoot-em-up, so you're gonna be stuck letting waves of enemies fly right past you because it's impossible to take them down without sitting directly in their line of fire for a few precious seconds. After the early levels, the enjoyment factor drops significantly. There's a substantial hurdle before the game becomes enjoyable again, and even then it requires a ton of grinding in a game that really didn't need this kind of system in the first place.It's really not a bad game, just a significantly flawed game. It definitely tries its best, but ultimately falls flat and generally feels a little uninspired and dull. The multiplayer mode is a fun little twist, but suffers from the rest of the game's faults and can't really pull the rest of the experience up. Plus it's a game I bought for a nickel on Steam, the servers aren't exactly lit.I can't help but feel like they really just screwed themselves over with the biggest market that would actually pay for that game, and that's old people. There's too many bright colors and that hurts their eyes, they can't play this. They're gonna drop this faster than folks drop at the retirement center. They're gonna go back to playing cards and staring wistfully out windows at autumn trees shedding their leaves, taking in the subtle symbolic nature of death and renewal. And how much they hate the kids these days.Our view will pan to the lone leaf fluttering in the breeze, shaking loose and blowing away while they blissfully slip into a sleep they'll never wake from. They're dead. The caretaker will discover them in the morning when they go to sweep the dust off of them, and they will say ""Oh well"".That's how I feel about this game. Oh well.Oh well.			"

You end up fighting a building. (Weird right? :P) You can shoot at enemies on the ground aswell, destroying buildings awards you with powerups and points. This game is impressive, it's fun too. Its something you'd play at an arcade with your mates while getting drunk and having a few beers. 9/10 :D			"

												Interim review after about 2 hours.The game is not unlike Xevious.   Other reviews mention other games like Raptor, etc.   The last time I played games like this was either in the arcade or with some DOS games.  It does provide some nostalgia.  You can mount weapons that are air to air only, air to ground only, or universal.   As you earn points from killing full waves and also total number of kills, as well as the fortress or bosses, you gain both a chance for perks with your level and also you earn credits to purchase newer weapons or older weapons to swap into your various mounts.  You can store some in your inventory once bought, to be swapped in as the mission, in your opinion, dictates.  You can replay any mission via Skirmish, there is a campaign, and there is co-op, and a believe multiplayer.  I simply played single player through the first 4 missions or so and via skirmish.This is not exactly my sort of game.  Although I did play some of the earlier DOS games like this, enjoyed Galaga at the Mall, and especially enjoyed Xevious.  This game is not unlike them.   That's the main positive.The negative is that it is not that responsive and given that it takes a much larger footprint to accomplish the same thing, I think you might be, in some ways, better off playing older/similar games.  The graphics are not astonishing, nor are they necessarily better.    In defense of the game, I'm simply playing this on an Intel HD 2500 gpu, with an i5 rated around 3.4 GHz.   Still, this is not the most efficient program, but then, DOS and even Win95/98 were much more efficient to run on a computer for this sort of program.So, it is fun, but it is not all that responsive.  I found that, for me, the main issue, is that the keyboard response for the airplane is a bit less responsive than I like.  I had expected it to run more efficiently.If you have a decent video card, which I'm sure doesn't have to be that modern, you probably won't mind.  But I caution that this is a greater slowdown than I found in Skyrim, Bioshock, most FPS games in my library, and the like.   But games vary.   Where I had no problem running Dead Island with consistently good framerate, there is no doubt that Dead Island Riptide runs sluggishly, at least during the tutorial.Still, I'd expect better from Revolution Ace.  Other than that, the game is similar, although it seems a bit less fair than Xevious.   It seems you are challenged more from the lower part of the screen than Xevious and the like.   Nonetheless it is adequate, if you have the time to learn the patterns and have good responsiveness.  It's relatively fair, looks ok, and is enjoyable.I got the game on sale for a mere $0.19  , that's an incredible price.   For now, I'd recommend those with laptop integrated graphics to be prepared to be disappointed, although my set-up is a desktop.  But for others, the game should be adequate in performance.   It's nothing revolutionary or stellar.   But it does take you back to the arcade when you want it to.   If you have other arcade like games, reconsider before you pay much for this game.On sale for the price I got it at, it's impossible to complain.  If you have a decent video card, and you don't have some arcade game in the vein of Galaga, Xevious, Raptor, or Zone 66 -- it's worth giving it try.  But if you had already one of those and are happy with their look and responsiveness, I'd say so far it isn't worth adding to the library unless you simply want something new to fill in the gap in that genre.I'm going to recommend it, but again, this is a rather lukewarm recommendation.  If you see one of the older games and they look good enough for you, chances are high they'll be more responsive.			"

There are several options for weapons, plasma that are generally spread shots, bullets that are strong and narrow, missles that are slower and harder to hit with but very powerful, lasers that I haven't tried out and perks to improve these weapons. Most weapons you have to either choose to shoot at the level of your plane or lower to the ground to get air and ground targets.			"

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												It's an ""Okay"" game. If you're a fan of bullet hell games this one is worth checking out. It also *CURRENTLY* comes with a free copy of LGG's new game, Polarity. (enter email in launcher)You can tell after playing it for about 0.5 seconds that this is heavily inspired by Raptor: Call of the Shadows, and it tries to be a more modern reimagining of that classic (and still amazing) game. However, there were a number of things about it I didn't like, like the grind-festy nature of the game: where in Raptor you could only buy equipment between missions that would only last to the end of your current run, in Revolution Ace you gain levels and unlock perks and new equipment which can then be 'bought'.What this turns the game into though is a boring slog of levels that are entirely too easy for my ship, and levels that I can't beat until I farm more levels and get ever better equipment for my ship.Also, the physics/terrain was a cool idea, but I find it behaves strange in some situations.... for example detonating a megabomb over water often causes jello-like splashing effects that persist unrealistically until the screen scrolls past it. I've also noticed some huge FPS drops in a game which should be relatively light to run, in areas where really not much is going on (poorly optimized?). Random 10FPS stutters that don't visibly seem to be connected to any happenings on the screen can make it a rather troublesome bullet hell game.Still, if you're a fan of the genre you will probably get some enjoyment			"

												For the entire review, head to https://bryanrumsey.wordpress.com/2015/07/01/review-revolution-ace/""Revolution Ace attempts to breathe life into a stagnant genre and, for the most part, it does. A quick check on its Steam page shows almost 400 reviews with a “Mostly Positive” rating. However, this genre resurrection is paid at a high price as most of the systems that made the genre popular in the first place have been sacrificed in favor of grinding and a generic power fantasy mechanic. There is obviously a market for this type of gameplay but I don’t see much intersection with the fanbase of the older style of sidescrolling shooters.""			"

												TL:DR - This game is a horrible, horrible shooter.Enemies are bland and forgettable, do far too little damage, and take far too much damage to be killed to keep gameplay streamlined. Enemies that go off-screen coming back is a neat feature, but it's not implemented very well.Speaking of streamlining, the game interrepts the action to give you tutorial pop-ups during the gameplay. In a shooter, this is a sin.The music is bland, generic and does not fit the tempo of the action. There is no feeling that you're actually fighting a boss when you come to one.Bosses are laughable by the way.This game is bad.			"

												I think this game would've been great if some of it's flaws were addressed.Enemy bullets are sometimes difficult to see, let alone hard to dodge when the game is spaming enemies, and you having a somewhat big hitbox. Recharging your shields can also be a pain since in order to recharge it, you must not fire your weapons while avoiding enemy fire, or you can do what I do: use the shield recharge super weapon.Some of the level ups are disappointing, once you fill out the experience bar at the end of a stage, you may gain a new weapon slot, more items at the shop, a new perk, or worst... NOTHING AT ALL! Which makes you think, ""What's the point of that level up?""Maybe this game is worth playing with a friend, but it's trial and error, and feels like a grind if you're playing alone.			"

												Come take a trip back in time where the top down shooter was king, and jumping the pilot seat to take on waves upon waves of enemies as you try to fly your way through the campaign. Revolution Ace, by Laser Guided Games, takes you exactly there.Graphically this game looks crisp but also feels like a lot of free assets went into the game, I might be totally wrong but some of what I found in the game looked very generic. Speaking of generic, the actual plane that you'll be flying is actually probably one of the weakest assets in the game.I love the background music, it definitely fits in with the arcade theme feel that this game is going for. I do really wish that there was a little bit more sound outside of the background music, this actually makes the game feel a bit weird.My biggest issue with the game has to be the random crashes. I'm not sure what causes this to happen but there's definitely something odd going on when you're in the middle of the level and the whole game shuts down.Another issue that I see with this game is the armory/money system. I'm not a fan of the pricing in the game, and the whole store just doesn't feel all that right. Now that being said I was using a gamepad, as this is the type of game that I feel SCREAMS gamepad, but perhaps I might be wrong.This is a valiant attempt at making a top down shooter that has challenging gameplay, interesting levels, and some cool power-ups, but there's just something missing from this game that makes me want to keep coming back. I just think that this game has this unfinished feel to it, and maybe there's a lot yet to come, but as of right now this is a game that unless you are a DIE-HARD top down shooter, have to have every top down shooter known to man, type of person, this is a game better off left alone. This game gets a 5.6 out of 10.			"

												If you're having problems with the frame rate and controls, turn off anti-aliasing and dynamic lighting and shadows.Otherwise, this is just a classic Raiden-esque bullet hell fighter game with roleplayed upgrades and asynchronous multiplayer.  For 96% off, it's worth it for sure.			"

												First I idled for cards for 6,3 hours so my actual playtime is 11-ish hours. Got it incredibly cheap. Actually the four pack was on sale so I gifted two copies of the game to friends, got one for myself and one spare. So, this is a shoot'em up game, obviously, but it's the first one where I had to shoot both air and ground enemies. Really addictive. You earn cash and xp, unlock new weapons, can play local co-op, online or a campaign. When you beat the latter you unlock a +1 difficulty which has more enemies and they are also shoot more bullets than normal ones. If you are good enough to beat +1 you unlock +2 difficulty which is the max? Online mode is interesting. When you make a 5x, 10x, 15x, etc. combo some enemies spawn to your opponent's side. Some of the achievements are hard but somehow I got them all. The music is not irritating nor distracting so for me it was ok-ish. Has trading cards as well if you care about them. Cheap game with good quality. Even paying full price is worth it. I am glad I bought it and highly recommend it if you're into shoot'em up games.			"

												Revolution Ace is just like any other game from this genre, but it's still a lot of fun. I had fun playing it but didn't finish the campaign as I found it rather boring, as well as the ""story"", if we could call it like that. Other modes were more fun and challenging.Pros:-Fun-Challenging-Leveling up and adding new weapons in your inventory is balancedCons:-That framerate-The ""story""The controls are a pro and a con at the same time. I played this with the keyboard and with a controller, and I find the keyboard controls pretty ""slow"" if we can call them like that, and I enjoyed playing with a controller more.I will play this again perhaps, and I recommend it to anyone who is up for a challenge or likes the genre.5/10			"

												Well, it was nice for a few rounds, but became very frustrating. It all depends on your weapon of choice: if you take 2 quad homing missiles and for the rest twin machine guns, you'll tear through the enemies without caring too much about getting hit. This playstyle is too easy, so no fun. On the other hand, if you pick beam weapons, you'll be ♥♥♥♥ed. The ones with the strong beams which can aim at air and ground are strong, but bugged. They are likely to shoot at air though you are constantly holding down the ground attack botton.			"

												Why do I dislike an Unreal-Engine-crafted game I bought for 11ct as a product out of the ""Hyperspace pack""? Simply because ""Revolution Ace"" doesn't feel like being worth that little sum. I know it's unfair, but there are some other titles from the genre I have enjoyed more. If I made a list here, there would be more positive aspects than negatives, but two of them overweight. I don't really enjoy to dislike such a game, as I have been looking for good bullet-hell-shooters for a long time, so I will point out the things I like at first. There's the soundtrack, which is surprisingly epic. Orchestral synthesizer, combined with catchy melodies match perfectly the game's atmosphere. As music is an important element of the game, Laser guided games deserve my thumb up for their OST. The gameplay is pretty standart for such a game, but as advertised, the upgrade system is pretty attractive. Thumb up for that! Phantastic working physics, destructible buildings, there you go!Local two player... I guess there's no need to explain any further, thumbs up to you!A few things I neither like nor dislike would be...The story. Sure, it's good they made one but it's nothing special, pretty average to be honest.The gameplay, as said before, Revolution Ace has neither innovative nor complex abilities, there's HUD, two primary and a secondary weapon(s), one special ability, shields, powerups and stuff. I have seen all of that once or twice before but without those this wouldn't be a game. And now for the part which is important for my review: The things I dislike. There are three, two of which are directly related to each other. I will start right with the other one.Ground troopers. (...) Oh seriously, they are SO DAMN ANNOYING! The aiming is absolute garbage, ground unites are close to impossible to be hit. Maybe it's my fault, but because of the decrease of gaming experience I want you to take that thumb down, right between your eyes.So now you will finally be able to read the reason for my dislike:For usage of Unreal technology the graphics are a shame. They prove us that they used Unreal Engine to power the animations but the result is ugly as hell. I am especially disappointed of the effects. Even on high graphics, the quality is pitiable. Two thumbs down for that, there's no way I could do else.Directly belonging to this: Lags. Seems untrustworthy, I know, but I do really think that a GTX630 (M) should be able to take over this. It couldn't. While I had around 20 FPS on high quality, on low resolution settings this often framedropped horribly. Not a desirable condition at all, but in a game that requires close reaction, that is even worse. I can't explain why exactly that always happens, but until it's not fixed, this is absolutely horrible to play. I also give you two thumbs down for that, sorry, it has to be.Developers: I don't want to blame you. Wait, in fact, I do indeed. The thing is that not the bad graphics make this game bad, but it's your advertising. If you hadn't highly praised your engine, I maybe wouldn't complain. I wouldn't even consider the graphics being bad, as this isn't even necessary for a game to be good. But for unreal standarts what you did is unacceptable. And the performance issues mess with the fun the players should develop even more. If I am a single case, I am sorry, but this is still my opinion.			"

												Played as much as I could before getting disoriented as I'm not used to play these types of games, only when I was a kid, but there was less dynamic and more static movement.Played this game with mouse only, and in my opinion it had the feeling of being a bit stiff, tried to turn up and down on my dpi but alas, didn't change the stiffness.As stated earlier I played these sort of games when I was a kid, and I ate it raw, it's nice to see someone pick it up and mix it up with a little shop and dynamics, such as using your super-weapon bomb on a water level makes the waters turn insane :)The shop is quite limited and the developers made a minor flaw in it, you can sell your stock weapons.... You can be left with nothing, which isn't a good sign for areal combat :)Overall this game was enjoyable until they introduced an aerial type that shot zigzag, I had no clue on how to get onto them :I And in the end my eyes hurt from playing this...But I believe that someone out there will see this game as his favorite, also a shout-out to the developer for giving me the heads up on this game~7/10 Don't think I will return, but I think this game has potential to become something bigger than it is :)			"

												Revolution Ace tries to combine some old school formula with some new approach, but fails to become something that would be fun to play or 'even' to complete. As mentioned from other players, the gameplay feels too slow and clunky, the leveling, perks and choices of some better and more powerful weapons (from gathered scrap) seem nice, but it doesn't improve your efficiency towards the enemy as it should, which is really bad for a game such as Revolution Ace wants to be. I think this is the point when you stop playing, besides poor graphics, poor level design and poor story (did it really have a story?;-). Anyhow, it cost me only 19 cents on sale, so ... I guess it all came with the price. See it 4 yourself!			"

												There is a lot of work that was put into the making of this game but sadly the developers didn't put the efforts in making the game more fun before adding more content like a shop where you can purchase upgrades with scraps that you collect from killing enemies or to create online matches that you can play with friends. The fact that there's absolutely no efforts put into the bullets that are fired in all directions really send this game into the abyss of poorly designed games. You shoot the enemies with little pixelated pellets that go through your enemies without clear indications that you've done any type of damage to this unit. Enemies you miss go off screen and reappears after a short while with yellow outlines to indicate that this was the unit you didn't manage to kill earlier. It would be easier to kill them if the screen was longer than it is wider making you go left and right less often and if your ship could move a little bit faster it would certainly not cause any harm.I want to give this game a second try but the graphics are so bland that you actually have trouble understanding what is happening.4/10			"

												Does something strange to keyboard. I tested this before having to write this review, so it is something that should be looked into. Hopefully just a bug and not something malicious. After having it open for a while, the keyboard buffer starts sending a random key and there is nothing you can do to stop it except reboot. Even exiting the game won't stop the effect.  Just be aware of that. The game is ho-hum for the genre, I am just trying to earn the card drops at this point.  If you are trying to earn them too, make sure you are not doing anything important while it idles, or perhaps leave the computer on without doing anything else.  You will see what I mean after about 30 minutes of it sitting there.			"

												More than just a solid top down arcade shooter.Its essentially Raptor on steroids which was a fantastic game back in the day.Revolution Ace has done all that Raptor has done so well and more. The slight RPG elements are a nice touch. The new weapons and abilities are all cool. The whole Ground vs Air target mechanic is nice gives it some depth. The guns having different facings depending on the slot you put them is also really cool. The levels look nice especially the water thanks to the Unreal Engine used. The game can be challenging and there's plenty of levels and a difficulty setting and just overall a great selection of variety and options to choose from.There's even coop.A game so good it pains me that I got it for 19 cents. it was a steal.

												You know I usually can find nearly at least one good thing about a game but here I cannot. Revolution Ace is a Vertical shooter in the vein of Raiden,Aleste and Star Solider...Too Bad the game play isn't even a speck towards those awesome shooters...let me explain why ""Revolution Ace"" sucks. First off,  The weapons you have are super weak and too expensive. Personally at first I thought it was neat to be able to experiment with what works for the player and purchase weapons to wreck havoc on enemies. However here is the fatal flaw with this is once you purchase and item and it happens to suck,you can sell it and get next to nothing back for that weapon and you better hope you have more funds because if you sold your old weapon to get the new one that you thought would work....You're screwed to the point were you will have to delete your game and start ALL over again. The weapons absolutely suck and This is bull*#$*! I had to restart 3 times to get anywhere and the more I play the game,the more I hate it because the balance between enemy and player are too great, the enemy is simply too strong!   Who thought the enemy movement games development was a good idea? Their TOO ERRATIC! What makes a vertical/horizontal shooter fun is the set enemy patterns so that the player can memorize and use a manuever to ensure survival and keep going. You can't do that here. All the enemies comes from all sides and pummel you with bullets and given the weak♥♥♥♥♥weapons and the prices given, Your defeat happens far too often (Some will say it's because I suck but I've beaten Raiden and Raiden 2 on hard with 7 credits!). You may not see the end of the game unless you pick the right weapons and upgrade carefully. If this was a game disc I'd probably snap it in half by now... I suppose I should talk about the little this game has going for it.  Music is good and some stuff you may hum to or tap your foot at. Nothing special but still kinda nice. 2nd is the game looks pretty good with nice scenery,nothing looks out of place and it is satisfying when you can blow up a ground unit or structure.  This game uses the Unreal engine so this would explain the good graphics (good,not great) Water effects are ♥♥♥♥♥in! Sadly...that's all the positives I could find. Controls blow and they are hard to set up and if you are using a PS2 controller the menu is nearly impossible to navigate due to the speed of the cursor.. Have fun trying to select ""Campaign""!     I really wanted to like this game. I wish the developer would do his homework on what makes a shooter awesome but RA falls flat due to unfair balance, Weapons too weak and expensive (no way to grind to get more cash or ""Scrap"" to buy weapons), stupid enemy patterns that no one can get around.....It frustrates me because I LOVE SHMUPS and this has the potentional to be a sleeper/underdog classic but it's a wasted oppurtunity. Stay away from this!!! you'll thank me later!			"

												on the pressure of a very kind request, i want to put in more effort writing my review. see, since i only wrote 2 words in my original review, judging this game to be a below average product, it is quiet possible one might assume that i'm mentally challenged or at best ridiculously foolish in my behaviour. maybe cruel for seeing so little in somebody elses labour of love ... since i got a lot of time to spend while being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ *mentally challenged i enjoy communicating on the internetthis includes writing reviews from time to time so here we go ...i bought this game in some sales bundle i can't recall the name of, i basically had some steam cash left and found this bundle in some lonesome night.as i sat in my ♥♥♥♥ soaked seat, struggeling hard with my redundance *LOL* ... i tried playing this game. hey life's for us to enjoy; so i was keen to see what this crazy universe had to offer this time!first impression was kinda ""wow this game is kinda basic, it surely does not need to impress with astounding graphics or too much content!""so yeah you basically control some plane an shoot weapons at enemy planes, cars and buildings.if they hit you more than you hit them you're♥♥♥♥♥♥♥done, so better shoot that stuff flying towards you and reach the next lev0l! fun fun!!! but on the other hand playing this felt like a static waste of time, not even trying to hide the emptiness behind the facade anymore.

												The description says, ""as you take down more and more of the AI’s fighter’s you’ll unlock new technologies"" but what it means is, ""you will have to fail the same levels over and over until you gather enough experience to unlock new technologies."" Maybe they designed it that way and maybe it would even be fun if the levels were better, but they're frustrating to play.One of the problems is that there are two spaces enemies can occupy - the ground and the sky. When the forces on the ground shoot missiles towards the sky, the graphics are so bad that you can't tell exactly when the missiles will reach the right height to hit you and when they're only half way there.It's also a shame that after spending so long developing this game, the designers didn't even bother to check their spelling and grammar. It's full of errors that make me them look like illiterate children.			"

												When you first start to play this game, do your best to get used to the awkward interface, and you'll be rewarded with a fun experience.  The different weapons do a nice job changing the feel of your fighter craft, the scrap (in game version of cash) comes easy, and the action is fast paced.  For a dollar, I got about 10 hours worth of playtime that included 20 skill levels, an entire single player campaign, and a couple hours of local co-op with my son.  I call that a win.			"

												Revolution Ace is a PC Shoot Em' Up that, as far as I can tell, tries to reconcile the differences between old school western shmups, where the right equipment saves the day, and new style shmups where location is everything, and hits are incredibly hard to come back from. It also tries to modernize itself with a league of features, some good, some bad. To give a quick, and concise conclusion to this review? I would PERSONALLY rate RA as a ""Maybe/When Cheap"" where you're paying cheap for the game itself. I got it for 20 cents, and my friend and I enjoyed ourselves. But for the majority of that time, we were enjoying each other's company in Co-op and not the game itself. Unfortunately, since Steam has only yes or no as an option, and I feel Yes is too strong an affirmation for this game, I'm picking no. Now I'll explain the Pros and Cons:Pros:- The game has functional co-op for the most part, and while I'm sure the Devs might argue otherwise, I feel it was built with co-op as a main intention. I believe enemy HP is cut down somewhat in single player and the ship number is based on difficulty and not whether or not it's SP or MP. Also, the way the gameplay works, it has encouraged teamwork between the two of us beyond ""both of you shoot at it until it dies.""- The game's versus ideas are great. The idea of being able to do offline challenge modes that escalate between you and your opponent, while done before, seems competently done. Direct versus is fun as you watch your partner do better or worse than you in certain areas, constantly trying to outdo one another's score and take advantage of competitive-only upgrades and modifications to equipment. Kudos to the dev for making their random levels work with this system as well by supplying the same seed to both clients.- The game DOES fill a niche that we haven't seen met recently. At the heart of it is a game that wants to be ""Raptor: Call of the Shadows"" if it were made today, with technological and game design advances. However, it can and DOES need improvement, the sort a Revolution Ace 2 would hopefully present.Cons:- The perk system hurts the game because you cannot respec them, either grind ridiculous hard to have all of them or start over with another profile. It also directly gates off better weapon variety, weapon slots on your ship, and eventually, objectively superior weaponry/equipment.- Weapons (and WEAPON SLOTS) being locked off by leveling means you don't actually do as much damage as you need to until you hit those high levels. And even then, it often doesn't feel like enough unless you've properly specced yourself. Another casualty of this is the feel of these weapons. They have generic sounds and since they don't tear through ships HALF as well as Raptor's or Tyrian's do? They not only feel weak, but are confirmed so. Complicate this with a A2G and A2A system where you specifically have to choose between the two (EVEN IF YOU HAVE WEAPONS THAT CAN DO BOTH, UNLIKE RAPTOR!) and the game makes you dance to its tune more than it needs to.- A regenerating shield system that attempts to harp Raptor but falls flat because it requires you to stop firing, a bad idea for the following reason. It would've been better to just make it regenerate if you avoid being hit for a while to let you choose between staying in the fray and keeping it from getting out of hand or waiting for half to full regeneration in relative safety.- Enemies come back again. Depending on the difficulty they can come back once, twice or thrice, or infinite times. You WILL have moments that feel less old school American shmup like Tyrian 2000 and more Japanese Bullet-Hell Shmup like Crimzon Clover, without the tiny hitbox grace that the latter trades off for dying on hit. Being overwhelmed is not only a very real possibility, it's a very real likelihood if you're not doing so well.-Some enemies are incredibly annoying to deal with. Later levels involve enemies that quickly fly across the screen spamming bullets. I can only imagine the nightmare of Nightmare Mode, where you're trying to hit them knowing they'd stick around indefinitely if you didn't.-Very inconsistent artstyle means you'll be facing enemies that look hobbled together from a variety of artists...because the credits demonstrate they WERE. This also means garbage like white bullets hidden by clouds and bright blue bullets that nearly match the background sky.-A pointless storyline. Yes, shmups are usually games that don't need a plot, but the random blurbs you get every few levels hint at a mastermind and/or cause between the malfunctioning war machines...but doesn't at all elaborate, instead constantly presenting WHODUNIT? possibilities. Having no plot at all is actually BETTER than that.-Their amazing water effects sounds great until you drop a super bomb on it and it goes through the grounds. They wanted to make that a special note? I'll make it a special one here.Overall it's a game that I feel is playable, outside of a few bosses who apparently don't have synced up attacks in co-op. But it's a game you'll play through and occasionally pick up again for co-op purposes, not a game you'll keep coming back for more. Hence why I'd rate it as a Maybe, but since there's no Maybe and the cons outweigh the pros, a No is a must.			"

												I rate the game Revolution Ace 4/5.This game is extremely similar to the old Apogee game, Raptor: Call of the Shadows but is not implemented quite as well in some ways but it is much less expensive. The music and sound is mediocre and the graphics look pretty drab. The plot is insipid and uninventive. Cooperative (and uncooperative) multiplayer modes with another computer can be set up through steam but the process is unintuitive and a little bit tricky. Once you get it working however, the multiplayer modes work very reliably. The game's pace (and perceived rate of motion) is quite slow for the type of arcade-style action shooter game that it is. However, everything else about this game is very well done. The game has 4 difficulty levels and offers a more challenging version of itself to play after you beat the main campaign. Individual levels can be replayed easily. Playing any mode allows you to earn more monies for upgrading your airplane too and the upgrade and leveling system is well designed. The game also has a random mode which can give you a random fight above any terrain type you want. For just 5 dollars (without it even being on a special steam sale) this game is quite extensive and replayable.			"

												This is a neat shoot em up. However it does not really do anything new with the formula. The only unique or at least uncommon thing going on here is that you have to worry about air and ground targets. Also you can aslo choose where your focusing fire on groundded tanks and buildings or everything else that's in the air like you.I mean it's nice and even uses 3D maps for you to fly over.

Not even being remotely coy about how it's basically the pet project of a Full Sail grad who had really fond memories of Raptop but no real aptitude or willingness to spring for art assets.  I'd recommend it for a buy at the 19 cent price point but I certainly wouldn't at the normal $5 price point, so this is a non-recommendation altogether.			"

												When i started to play the game it felt like i was playing Raptor: Call of the Shadows again. Well this feeling was lost pretty fast. The game feels like a cheap copy of Raptor and does most of the things wrong.+ Game looks okay+ Didnt crash in the few hours it took me to beat it- Weapons dont have any punch to them, until you get the first powerful front firing beam weapon- Hard to tell if stuff is going to hit you when fired from ground enemies- There is 2 buttons to fire, one for air and one for ground targets, only one can be done at a time- Your ships hitbox is bigger than your shipTLDR: Get Raptor: Call of the Shadows and Tyrian 2000 if you want good games to play.

												This can be so much more fun, but it isn't.- Mouse sensitivity is waaaaayyyy ttooo looowwwww (this is an OBVIOUS bug that should have been picked up and fixed during testing)- Enemies are poorly sequenced and players can't kill them all, especially with the ridiculously weak weapons- Because of the poor sequencing and weak weapons, it's impossible to dodge all attacks and even with decent health and shield, you eventually die because it's such a grind- In campaign mode you can't replay levels to build up your XP and scrap to at least have a decent plane for killing enemies as the levels get harder- You don't keep your scrap supplies when you die, so you just end up dying on the same level all the time because you can't upgrade your plane, even though you keep gaining XP, but without scrap you can't take advantage of leveling up.- Separate Air Attack and Ground Attack is frustrating and takes away from the game. This wouldn't be so infuriating if you could launch both attacks at the same time and if enemies were properly sequenced so that you can get 100% kills- Time delays on super weapons are too long. It would be better to have shorter time delays or even better yet, the ability to stock up using scrap before each mission, so that you can use better timing during a mission to get more kills (providing of course that enemy sequencing is good) and for drops of super weapons to happen during missions.To me this game is unfinished because they built all of the elements, but didn't put them together very well. If they'd put everything together very well and put some actual thought into more cohesive level design and gameplay mechanics, this game would have been much more awesome. As it stands though, I can't really give it much more than a 4/10.			"

												Revolution Ace is a PC Shoot Em' Up that, as far as I can tell, tries to reconcile the differences between old school western shmups, where the right equipment saves the day, and new style shmups where location is everything, and hits are incredibly hard to come back from. It also tries to modernize itself with a league of features, some good, some bad. To give a quick, and concise conclusion to this review? I would PERSONALLY rate RA as a ""Maybe/When Cheap"" where you're paying cheap for the game itself. I got it for 20 cents, and my friend and I enjoyed ourselves. But for the majority of that time, we were enjoying each other's company in Co-op and not the game itself. Unfortunately, since Steam has only yes or no as an option, and I feel Yes is too strong an affirmation for this game, I'm picking no. Now I'll explain the Pros and Cons:Pros:- The game has functional co-op for the most part, and while I'm sure the Devs might argue otherwise, I feel it was built with co-op as a main intention. I believe enemy HP is cut down somewhat in single player and the ship number is based on difficulty and not whether or not it's SP or MP. Also, the way the gameplay works, it has encouraged teamwork between the two of us beyond ""both of you shoot at it until it dies.""- The game's versus ideas are great. The idea of being able to do offline challenge modes that escalate between you and your opponent, while done before, seems competently done. Direct versus is fun as you watch your partner do better or worse than you in certain areas, constantly trying to outdo one another's score and take advantage of competitive-only upgrades and modifications to equipment. Kudos to the dev for making their random levels work with this system as well by supplying the same seed to both clients.- The game DOES fill a niche that we haven't seen met recently. At the heart of it is a game that wants to be ""Raptor: Call of the Shadows"" if it were made today, with technological and game design advances. However, it can and DOES need improvement, the sort a Revolution Ace 2 would hopefully present.Cons:- The perk system hurts the game because you cannot respec them, either grind ridiculous hard to have all of them or start over with another profile. It also directly gates off better weapon variety, weapon slots on your ship, and eventually, objectively superior weaponry/equipment.- Weapons (and WEAPON SLOTS) being locked off by leveling means you don't actually do as much damage as you need to until you hit those high levels. And even then, it often doesn't feel like enough unless you've properly specced yourself. Another casualty of this is the feel of these weapons. They have generic sounds and since they don't tear through ships HALF as well as Raptor's or Tyrian's do? They not only feel weak, but are confirmed so. Complicate this with a A2G and A2A system where you specifically have to choose between the two (EVEN IF YOU HAVE WEAPONS THAT CAN DO BOTH, UNLIKE RAPTOR!) and the game makes you dance to its tune more than it needs to.- A regenerating shield system that attempts to harp Raptor but falls flat because it requires you to stop firing, a bad idea for the following reason. It would've been better to just make it regenerate if you avoid being hit for a while to let you choose between staying in the fray and keeping it from getting out of hand or waiting for half to full regeneration in relative safety.- Enemies come back again. Depending on the difficulty they can come back once, twice or thrice, or infinite times. You WILL have moments that feel less old school American shmup like Tyrian 2000 and more Japanese Bullet-Hell Shmup like Crimzon Clover, without the tiny hitbox grace that the latter trades off for dying on hit. Being overwhelmed is not only a very real possibility, it's a very real likelihood if you're not doing so well.-Some enemies are incredibly annoying to deal with. Later levels involve enemies that quickly fly across the screen spamming bullets. I can only imagine the nightmare of Nightmare Mode, where you're trying to hit them knowing they'd stick around indefinitely if you didn't.-Very inconsistent artstyle means you'll be facing enemies that look hobbled together from a variety of artists...because the credits demonstrate they WERE. This also means garbage like white bullets hidden by clouds and bright blue bullets that nearly match the background sky.-A pointless storyline. Yes, shmups are usually games that don't need a plot, but the random blurbs you get every few levels hint at a mastermind and/or cause between the malfunctioning war machines...but doesn't at all elaborate, instead constantly presenting WHODUNIT? possibilities. Having no plot at all is actually BETTER than that.-Their amazing water effects sounds great until you drop a super bomb on it and it goes through the grounds. They wanted to make that a special note? I'll make it a special one here.Overall it's a game that I feel is playable, outside of a few bosses who apparently don't have synced up attacks in co-op. But it's a game you'll play through and occasionally pick up again for co-op purposes, not a game you'll keep coming back for more. Hence why I'd rate it as a Maybe, but since there's no Maybe and the cons outweigh the pros, a No is a must.			"

												The level progression is too slow:- Each level you unlock new weapons, but for a long time those are worse than the starting ones- Even so, you can equip them in other slots so it's not a problem if they're bad right? You are adding firepower so it's good! Not, because it takes a lot to unlock other slots.- Each three levels or so you can take a perk, but they are underwhelming: after clearing 3 stages i can finally get a +10% to missile damage. Are you serious?I've played a lot of games like this, and this is the first one that I've not enjoyed playing.			"

												Wow, what a bargain.It felt like getting thrown back to Games which names i cant even remember, back on the GameBOY and NES. I enjoyed those...I actually have similar games like that, but they arent as much fun as Revolution Ace.One Reason would be that i got a lot worse at these kind of games with age...Also, you only have to complete map after map with breaks in between, you modify your plane in the Armory by your choices and go to Battle with your setup. You are not bound to get better weapons and upgrades ingame, while u have to beat lvl after lvl after lvl (oldschool)So apart from the real arcade legends this has a more casual and easy approach and encourages to keep playing for dat next gun/perk/weapon slot.This is an addictive mixture if you are a fan of the genre and you can even play it coop!

												This can be so much more fun, but it isn't.- Mouse sensitivity is waaaaayyyy ttooo looowwwww (this is an OBVIOUS bug that should have been picked up and fixed during testing)- Enemies are poorly sequenced and players can't kill them all, especially with the ridiculously weak weapons- Because of the poor sequencing and weak weapons, it's impossible to dodge all attacks and even with decent health and shield, you eventually die because it's such a grind- In campaign mode you can't replay levels to build up your XP and scrap to at least have a decent plane for killing enemies as the levels get harder- You don't keep your scrap supplies when you die, so you just end up dying on the same level all the time because you can't upgrade your plane, even though you keep gaining XP, but without scrap you can't take advantage of leveling up.- Separate Air Attack and Ground Attack is frustrating and takes away from the game. This wouldn't be so infuriating if you could launch both attacks at the same time and if enemies were properly sequenced so that you can get 100% kills- Time delays on super weapons are too long. It would be better to have shorter time delays or even better yet, the ability to stock up using scrap before each mission, so that you can use better timing during a mission to get more kills (providing of course that enemy sequencing is good) and for drops of super weapons to happen during missions.To me this game is unfinished because they built all of the elements, but didn't put them together very well. If they'd put everything together very well and put some actual thought into more cohesive level design and gameplay mechanics, this game would have been much more awesome. As it stands though, I can't really give it much more than a 4/10.			"

												Can you say ""conflicted""? This game will make you say ""comflicted"" in review. On the one hand, this is one of the very few modern shoot-em-ups that take its inspiration directly from Raptor - my most favourite shmup of all times (you may love Tyrian more - I forgive you, but I don't understand you). Not from R-Type, Gradius or other Japanse games which I mostly disliked, and which eventurally evolved into bullet-hell genre, which I avoid at all costs.On the other hand, while Ravolution Ace takes a lot from Raptor, it does not always succeeds in copying, and additional elements sometimes seem to make matters even worse.Firstly, this game is very hard. On Normal, it plays a lot like Raptor on the highest difficulty. Even the basic enemies can take a lot of punishment, and your weaponary is not up to it. You WILL skip a lot of enemies, even in the first levels, and you will probably fail to complete on of them. The solution, unfortunately, is grinding. New weapons cost a lot, but they matter. While they will never make you feel like an invinsible super-hero, they will, at least, make it possible to get to the next level's boss with enough shields and armor to take it down.Grinding is a cornerstone of this game. I don't like to grind, so this is a huge minus for me. Fortunately, there are a few ways to grind, which make it more interesting. Boss Attacks are the quickest: pretty soon, you can manage to grind Boss Attack I with your eyes closed. But they pay not very much. Replaying levels you already completed in Campaign also is not very lucrative. But Random levels can bring you a lot of cash! At 20 level, a pass through ""Random Skies"" will get you about 80K credits - about 1/3 of money you need to buy _any_ top-tier weapon. Also, since enemies (but not landspace) is randomized, it's slightly less boring to grind those.Another big problem with this game is enemies and bullets. In a way, this game deserves the name of bullet-hell much more than any Touhou title: in a lot of levels, the screen will be filled with bullets, but they will not be flying in any disernable pattern. It will be utter chaos, and you will NOT be able to eavde them all! Also, many bullets, especially from ground vehicles, are VERY hard to see, especially with all the explosions happening in the sky. You will often take a lot of damage from unseen sources before you understand what is going on.Enemies also do not have obvious patterns. Memorizing a level will only help you a little, this is not a game about memorization.The need to switch between firing at ground or at air enemies is sometimes frustrating. I'm not sure if it is a good idea at all. In Raptor, some weapons only worked on ground units, and some only on air, and that was enough, really.So, in the end:Pros:+ Raptor-inspired shmup+ Nice visuals+ Interesting, if somewhat unsatisfying weapons (it gets better at the top tier, it really does)+ Level-up system (Perks)Cons:- Very hard, probably endlessly frustrating for a novice players, but a bit too challenging even for me sometimes- Requires a lot of grinding (but grinding can be varied, so it's not as boring as it could be)- Bullets lack patterns and hard to see on backgroundFor some reasons, it also has a multiplayer mode. I never wanted a multiplayer mode in a shmup, but I guess some people enjoy it...			"

												Just got boring very quickly. You need to grind just to unlock more weapons which you still need to purchas with scrap. Even at lower resolutions, I had a hard time figuring out if the enemies were on the ground or in the air. The weapons early on are very underpowered and each enemy requires 10+ hits to destroy. Just seems like a very generic shooter that you can play for free on your phone or on Newgrounds.			"

												Revolution Ace is definitely NOT one of the best shooters in its genre. It has frame rate problems, the bullets blend in with the background, and generally it's a bit of a mess. But somehow when I was playing it, something made me look past all that and I really did have a good time. It has an upgrade system that definitely helps with the sense of progression, a fun but challenging boss at the end of each stage, and a neat system of air bullets vs ground bullets, forcing you to pick between whether you're shooting in the background or in the foreground. But by far the best part of the game is the multiplayer. It takes all the problems I mentioned and kinda blurs them out of your mind, because, at least for me, I was more focused on playing a game with my friend and the issues became less glaring. There's also a cool multiplayer versus mode, which I've never seen implimented into a top-down shooter before. It works pretty well.As a whole, Revolution Ace was like a fat guy sitting in front of you at a playoff game. It's annoying at first, sure, but if you can look past the problems, you have a great game in front of you. It's a fun experience, and you should definitely consider picking it up if you have some friends to play it with.

												For the price, its not too bad. It reminds me a bit of Air Attack HD only not as good. The graphics, music and mechanics are OK and it really plays up the 2 1/2D element, but the game just lacks the fun of similar games. It moves at a kind of pedestrian pace, enemies kind of fizzle and it isn't always obvious they're dead, and the level design is just OK. The dual attack system kind of feels in the way of the fun sometimes. Enemy attacks are sometimes inescapable which makes it seem frustrating. A little more effort in the design would make it more replayable. Local co-op play is a bonus, but it's no Crimzon Clover.			"

tl;dr: A good raptor clone featuring a lot of customization and different game types, with a huge replay value and it's not hard to 100%.  Also, it's cheap. A great game, certainly underrated. As some have already mentioned, there are some similarities between this game and Raptor: Call of shadows. This game may look the same, but it doesn't FEEL the same at all. Like Raptor, this game has a lot of enemies (both in air/ground), encourage a lot of customization (regular weapons, special weapons/nukes and shields) and the core gameplay feels similar.But that's where the similarities end. Some of the enemies may behave a lot like the ones in raptor, but most of them don't. Some of them are really unique and original, and need different loadouts and strategies to defeat. Ground bosses, for example, can't be hit by air only weapons, so you have to set your loadout to fight them. And that leads to the second point: Customization. In this game you have A LOT of weapons to buy and equip. To do that you'll need to purchase them and equip it in your ship, to a maximum of 6 weapon slots that open when you level up. When you level up you can also unlock new weapons to buy.  But the customization do not stop at regular weapons, you can also equip different shields and special weapons to set your loadout in a unique combination. For example, you could equip a bulky shield (high armor, low recharge rate) and the shield booster superweapon (recharge 50% of the shield) to have a huge shield and to be able to recharge it fast. Also talking about customization, you get perks to choose when you level up. Those can add damage to specific weapon types (plasma, beam, missile...), armor, damage to buildings and more.One downside that many have mentioned is that in the beggining your ship feel really underpowered, and I have to agree with that. But when you gain levels, weapons, slots and perks, that gets better.The game also have a lot of different game modes: Campaign (around 20 missions if I recall correctly), Skirmish (free play the missions and other stages), versus (2 people play side by side, whoever dies first lose) and battle chains (pseudo multiplayer with score attack).If you clear the campaign. there is the +1 and +2 campaign, that are way harder, so it have a lot of replay value.For the completionists, it's not hard to get every achievement. Even the ones that require versus and battle chains can be unlocked by replaying your own battle chains, so you don't really need multiplayer to 100%.If that's not enough reason, this game is absolutely cheap. I mean, REALLY cheap. And even get on sale sometimes.			"

Oh and get this, the proccess to Revolution Ace is called ""Shmupgame"". Really? It seems that not much love went into making it. No offence to the creators if in fact some love   did   go into making it.If it had a  better  story, or on the go weapon upgrades, then I would like it a little better. But as it is it's just kinda bland. I did like the challenge system of posting recordings of your runs and challenging other people to beat your score, and the abillity to send enemies over to your opponent when you do well is nice.That being said, I did have a little fun playing it, if my play time is any indication (nine hours as of writing).If you like playing every single shmup that you happen accross, then give it a go, otherwise can't recommend.

												Well, good example of a bad shmup:-fast, aimed, hard to see bullets coming from all sides. this is balanced by a huge amount of hits you can take before u die-every enemy takes quite some shots to take down-enemies are also hard to see at times-enemies shooting from offscreenIn sum: Boring, unsatisfying and stupid gameplay, bordering on silly.The stage ""random - space"" was especially hilarious: Ground based enemies (!) floating in space... also when trying the first time the game scrolled right passed the boss and I was unable to  hit him. had to restart.. second try: boss was a ground based type (space...) and also invisible xDGame has lots of modes, vs, coop, skirmish, boss rush and an upgrade system... but what does it help?Also when I finally couldn't take it anymore and quit the game... it crashed, of course, forcing me to hard reset my laptop.----------------------------------------------------The game is basically free but time is precious so its still a waste. 3/10If you want a ""free"" shmup, take a look at ""Saviors"", which is somehow connected to this but actually well made. Or you could google ""free doujin shmups"" or take a look at everything from ""Astroport"" here on steam. They make really nice, yet cheap, old-school shmups.o/ "

												Nostalgic. I have seen many better games but this I can say this one is good, in a way.The preview screenshots explain pretty much all about the game.My rating: roughly 3/10Reasons of playing:-    Bought during Steam Sale at a price where selling all the cards in the current market would actually profit by a few cent. (Now I see that as a a marketing strategy)My experience:-    At the moment, I am at +3. The real game started when I was around something-teenth level where all equipment slots are unlocked, and I got to get past x5 combo. Things gets harder and my weapons seems to have hit their limit and I can only rely on Perks.-    The split screen is something one has to get used to. It feels very different and makes those blend-in bullets and enemies harder to visually detect.-    I'm not very sure about this, but some weapons seem pointless or too useless to me. Carpet Bomb for an instance.What I like:-    The campaign does not end at final stage.-    Various weapons and builds to choose.-    The scenery is nice, and the graphic is good. So good that I sometimes fail to detect enemies' bullets or the enemies themselves standing right there.-    The game supports multiplayer, versus and co-op, local and global.What I don't like:-    Level. It makes this game seems grinding. (I know it's not quite but...) It also makes the early game so slow that you couldn't defeat many enemies. -    Perks. They come so early in the game that I didn't know what to do with them. They also matter so much that I want to reassign them without having to restart the game. Is there a way to do so, or can you maximize them all eventually?-    Scraps. They are harder to find at the beginning, where you will want to try out various weapons, but once you get all elite ones, they don't really matter anymore and just pile up.-    Replayability is very low. This means I don't want to play all over again because of all these grindings.-    A Bug where some enemies destroyed before their action still shoot. At that point, nothing can be done to them anymore because they are already 'destroyed'.-    Versus/Battle Chain Mode. While I do like the fact the it supports multiplayer, I don't like the fact that you have to play multiplayer for Steam achievements. It's not that I don't like the idea, but it is just not right with number of players who are still playing and participating. Also, from my experience, Battle Chain is still a little buggy. Sudennly the boss disappears and becomes invulnerable, thus impossible to win.-    To sum it up, pretty much everything else...Something else to say:-    Since the number of players in this game is not that high, expect difficulties playing globally.

												good thing i got this game on sale.even old top down shooters from 8bit computers are better than this.not mentioning things like raptor, tyrian, hell even old 1942 is way better.can't recommend this for many reasons.also using unreal engine and physX, while not even utilizing it's power? just bloating the game by unnecessary unused engine?and no steam integration for online play, although game announces multiplayer ...1/10 and that 1 point just because of sales price.

												If you drop the somewhat iffy Terminator-like background story and the hangar where you can customize your air vehicle of destruction, this reminds me very much of an old Sega Shootemup called Thunder Blade from the 80's - the game I liked a lot back then, even with all its home computer port clunkiness compared to the sleek machine of destruction that the arcade hall version was. The 3rd person perspective is missing, but the vertical dashes and objects coming towards your very face from the battlefield are  there, not to mention the overall feel plus both air and ground targets to be destroyed either with projectiles or missiles. Nostalgia aside, this mindless-but-fun intended little vehicle has more clunkiness than it should for the maximisation of said / promised mindless destructive fun. You choose your weapons (and buy more when you get cash and level up, increasing your weapon slots and thus firepower), you fly, you select whether to shoot air or ground targets with them, you fight the end level boss (sometimes mid-bosses too), you collect your exp and cash, next level, repeat, etc. etc. Despite of the vehicle customization options that grow rather nicely when advancing the levels and experience, the game still is tactically shallow and has frankly few winning weapon combos that are most probably used in expese of every other gun there is. What is the worst, it gets repetetive quite fast no matter ho hard it tries with the variation of enemies to shoot and weapons to shoot them at.  Granted, it looks, sounds and feels like a nostalgia time machine with some modern game design twists and therefore has some charm, and I can't complain of any bugs or bad controls. Still, I feel it falls short even in the retro destruction department. Blowing this much stuff up with heavily armed flying death machine really shouldn't feel this... dull. So far I have plodded through for around 15 or so missions of the campaign mode and I'm daft enough to soldier them all through, but only because I'm stubborn that way. For you, there are better and more versatile shooters out there.			"

												Revolution Ace is a Horizontal Scrolling Shoot'em Up game in Retro Style. A good comparison with one game of the 80's may be Foundations Waste, because of the similar setting in terms of story, enemies and landscapes. But, of course, a game that occupies 2000 times as much space should be claimed as an evolution compared to the games of former times. This is possible and justifiable. Speaking of the ship with its guns and shields, the game modes and the graphics, it's a pleasure to be part of the action. The sound is a mixture of patterns of games of the past and the difficulty levels allow the player to challenge his/her limit. Not so special for games of nowadays, but nevertheless interesting, is the battle chain competition mode, where two players fight against each other by creating a battle chain in sending more and more enemy units to the other player, who is obliged to destroy them quickly to counter strike his opponent. All in all, it's a solid evolution of a classical game type.			"
