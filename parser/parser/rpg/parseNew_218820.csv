												Let's start with the good stuff: Paul Robertson's sprite design is excellent. Much like Scott Pilgrim on the consoles, the character design is pretty sharp, and this is clearly a game he can cut loose on more that he did on Pilgrim. Of course, this also means his creative boxes of body horror and gore get checked more sharply, too.The main issue is that this is marketed as a Metal Slug-style game, but has none of the speed or energy. Rather than rewarding a run 'n gun style, you often cautiously stop to take down tiresome enemies with shields (their strength is in trying to bore you to death) and their ilk. It honestly reminds me more of the slow pace of early Mega Man games, only without the rad boss fights. The large, sprawling stages force you to grind through tons of enemies, and you better enjoy it, because you're going to be forced to visit each stage over and over and over.Crafting makes upgrading slow and unsatisfying. Though the gun design system is attractive and interesting at first, it's easy to maximize DPS in most situations with a high-damage, small clip revolver in my experience. Most other upgrade systems are perfunctory, but rely on tiresome grinding to get the correct ingredients.Boss fights are wearisome due to their implementation, similar to that of console hit Monster Hunter, where you have a limited window of time to defeat a boss, and then for some reason it runs away to another part of the stage, forcing you to grind over to its new location, or tiresomely set up in a new location to just wait for it to reemerge. Add in the fact that the bosses are clearly designed for multiplayer, so a single player has to take longer to beat them... and the stage overall has a time limit, so it's possible to fail the stage if your luck in locating the boss is bad.It ultimately combines the worst of the old (enemies spawning just off screen, long enemy patterns where you can't hurt foes) and new (repetitive fetch missions through the same area, tiresome crafting and collecting). That isn't to say it doesn't have some old-school charm to it, but you have to be willing to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze to get that little spurt of nostalgia you wanted from this game in the first place.

												I like the game but it is kind of a mixed bag.The story was way better then i expected from a game like this and even if you don’t like it the story sequences are easy to skip. The sprite based graphics are very easy on the eye and the animations look right.Gameplay wise it may look like metal slug but it reminds me more of the slow and precise nature of the old mega man games. You can’t take a lot of damage so its all about positioning yourself to easily take out enemies.  The locomotion of your character depends on the weight of your equipment, particularly your gun.The weapon system works like this, when you kill enemies they drop items, you use these items to craft gun parts and assemble these into guns. If you assemble enough parts with the same stats you can use special ammo, like shots that bounces all over the place or homing missiles. All parts fit together, i.e. you can combine a shotgun stock with a sniper receiver. Now all guns you build are not guaranteed to work well, most probably won’t, but finding one that does is very rewarding and easily my favorite part of the game.The level design is in general pretty decent. You progress in the game by doing missions, but  a lot of missions use the same map. This would not be a problem since there are several kinds of missions and those on the same map are generally different, but crafting gun parts require farming. This can make the repeating levels quite tedious. (mitigate; proficiency: medicine, slot 1: hoarder, slot 2: lucky penny )The bosses in the game inhabit specific places on the map and maps generally have multiple of those. Once you find a boss the mechanics of the boss battle itself is quite good. Easily the worst design decision in the entire game is that unless you are really fast some bosses disappear mid boss battle and appear at some other spot. If you are to slow finding this spot they might teleport again just as you get there. This can lead to some frustration. (mitigate; slot 1:computer, consumable: shock bombs)The question is whether or not to recommend this game depends on if you like mega man style platforming, farming for materials, experimenting with crafting and can work around a few annoying design decisions. If unsure wait for a sale. "

												Massively recommended for fans of Mega Man and other such games from the 1980s and 1990s.  Decently-paced, however at the same time could do with less completely unguided fetch quests before it is released properly (at time of writing this was purchased on Steam Early Access).  As for the Metal Slug vibe a lot of people got from this game, I personally do not see it, given that Metal Slug games are (for the most part) linear experiences, however Mercenary Kings allows the player to explore the map, not to mention Metal Slug's one hit and you're dead gameplay is not present in Mercenary Kings.

												When I heard the description ""Metal Slug mixed with Monster Hunter with Scott Pilgrim vs The World graphical art style"", and the screenshots that complimented it, I bought this immediately. That's my like dream game! How could you go wrong? Well, upon playing the first few missions, I realized it was *nothing* like Metal Slug. Unlike actual run n gun games, where combat is hectic and explosive, enemies are strategically placed and tend to be bullet sponges. Even the boss battles manage to be boring. This, in combination with the sluggish character movement, makes the game-play very slow paced at times. But hey, ""two dimensional Monster Hunter with guns"" ain't that bad of a description, so does that aspect of the game redeem it? No. The main problem of the game is that you can only use one gun for the entire mission. This little factor completely changes my opinion of the game; missions can take from ten to thirty minutes to be completed, maps are repeated constantly with different objectives, and enemies are predictable in style. I wouldn't mind these faults, but with only one gun, your customization and freedom can never be unleashed to use different play styles for each long section and thus it gets boring very quickly. You can equip different kind of grenades and melee weapons, but they are far from sustainable to make a difference.It's such a shame, because the game has got a lot going for it. The art style is beautiful, and the smooth animations and characterization add a charm to the game. The music is also very well made, although voice acting is cringeworthy. The crafting system is incredible, in every mission you can pick up materials such as iron or animal skins which can be used to craft weapon upgrades and items, and the gun customization is a great concept that allows you to use revolvers which fire grenades and other ridiculous variables, but it's overall executed poorly since only one damn gun can be used at a time. The main saving grace is the local co-op multiplayer, which is much more fun than playing it alone, but even that can get boring at times.Overall, it's a very pretty game, and can be a worth a try, but overall I can't recommend it. It's such a damn shame, because it has so much going for it, and one of the few indie games I bought at full price (£9) because of its concept, but once you get over the pretty icing, there's not much left of the cake.

												I really want to love this game.  I'm a fan of Paul Robertson, action rpgs, and weapon customization.But the game makes it so hard.  The very core design of the missions is just dull.  Over and over you are given a timer to search a giant maze like map for a randomly placed item or enemy.  Because the maps are large, even if you luck out by heading in the right direction it's still going to take you 5 minutes. If you get unlucky it'll take 15 minutes easily, and if you run out of time or die you have to start over.  It's like they greatly overestimated how much people enjoyed this, because constant navigation is built into things that don't make sense at all.  You spend 10 minutes searching the random boss spawn points to find which one is active, only for the boss to move to another part of the map mid way through the fight.  Now you spend another 2-5 minutes finding the new location, rinse and repeat, and hope you don't run out of time. The game actually expects you to wander through each map a hundred times at 10-20 minutes apiece.The weapons you construct have no creativity to them and are just not fun to use.  Sure they are creative art-wise, where you can create a toilet gun, but the moment you try to create a shotgun with more than 2 ammo the game cripples the damage so much as to make it useless.  The real potentials for creativity (piercing shotgun?) are completely unavailable, because you are forced to create a 100% sniper rifle to select piercing ammo.  So you are stuck with a few preset weapon paths, creating incrementally damage increasing versions of the same weapon.  The balance of it works against the mission design, because when you are searching aimlessly through a map of endlessly spawning enemies, making it take 3 seconds to dispatch each enemy (from either low damage ouputs or excessive reload times), it just makes the thing a chore.It's highly unlikely that this will be patched either, the devs seem hung up on this idea of a grinding time sink somehow being fun, as similar things were in scott pilgrim too.

												I really wanted to like this game and I love Paul Robertson's art style but the game itself has a lot of anti-fun aspects about it.  It's a 2D platformer in a run-n-gun style which I tend to love.  Here's where the problems come in:  You do missions most of which are fetch-quest style but locating who you're supposed to find or the items you need is completely ambiguous task and the map isn't much help.  Also there's time pressure and enemies that are purpose-built to slow your progress (like the guys with the shields).  Other than that, why is there a reload mechanic in this game?  Gears of War has it because it's a cover-based TPS where you have down-time while in cover and it fits the game style there.  Lastly, why can I not shoot diagonally?  There are plenty of instances where enemies are placed on diagonals and are attacking me but I can't fire back.What I expected out of the game was something more fast-paced like Contra/Metal Slug style game.  If you want it to be more  ""adventure"" oriented the time-limit is a big roadblock to fun exploration... the game would also need to be less repetitive enemy/level variety as well then.  Like I said, I really want to like this game so I hope you can take this review to heart and do your best to bring out the fun in the game before it's too late.			"

												Everything about this game is great, except for map and mission variety.  It's certainly worth about ten dollars for the first 10ish hours of play, but gets way too samey after that.  The developers gave it artificial length by making you play the same map over and over and over and over again, but this mission you kill a real easy boss, the next mission you collect materials, the next mission you kill all of a certain type of mob, etc.That having been said, the visuals are on-point, the controls feel like an awesomely perfect old school platformer/shooter, and music, while as limited as the map selection, is real good, the characters are cute and funny, and the gun-play is a blast (pun intended).  The crafting got boring fast, though ... I play games like this so blow peoples heads off, not to stand in front of my gun closet choosing which parts to put together for 12 minutes before each mission.Steam is going to ask me, ""Do you recommend this game?"" and only give me a Yes or No.Yes, with an ""if""No, with a ""but""I'll click no for now, just because I feel it's a bit too expensive for the content.

												KICKSTARTER GAME This is a kickstarter game and at the time of writing is not completely finished ( although there is a lot of content already present). It has a very metal slug esque feel in terms of both graphics and gunplay. It does have a very weird control system which takes some getting used to and I would reccomend a controler until they fix the keyboard layout or at least support a mouse.  This game takes the metal slug formula of platforming, crazy bosses and twitchy gunplay and adds customizing guns, collecting items, and quests (which are either fetch quests or go here- kill this quests) to the mix.While I would normally reccomend buying this game on sale, there are two reasons I will instead reccomend full price:1) They consistantly add more content as time goes on. This of course lends itself to waitin until the game is actually complete before purchasing but2) Being a kickstarter, these guys are a small indie (indy? ) studio and as such would benifit more directly for a full price purchase as a larger portion of the sale would actually go to those who directly made the gameVERDICT: BUY IT IF YOU LIKE RPG IN YOUR METAL SLUG. BUY FULL PRICE IF YOU LIKE INDIE GAME STUDIOS. GOOD ENTERTAINMENT VALUE FOR THE PRICE AND MORE CONTENT IS CONSTANTLY ADDED.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. This comes from the people who made Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which I loved and looks like it plays like Contra or Metal Slug, which I also love. Well, the graphics are very aesthetically pleasing in animation and both character and background designs. There are actually a lot of really cool looking enemies. The music is quite well done too. The problem is the gameplay. While watching videos it looks as if the game does everything right but the problem is: the game just isn't that fun. The game wants to be an old school run and gun but there's a lot of backtracking (which is even more annoying since the enemies respawn) and you have to reload every five or so seconds if you are run and gunning. The idea to put in a reload system was dumb but they way they did it (a time sensitive system) was actually kind of cool. Though it getting annoying fast. I found myself avoiding enemies so I didn't have to reload and then was wondering why I was still playing this game after avoiding the main game mechanic (shooting).			"

												First and foremost: No, this is neither Contra nor Metal Slug. If you bought it thinking something like that, you might have a bad time with this game. But hey, at least you get to write a whiny review like everyone and their mother.So if you think about buying this to get a quick action fix like aforementioned games, look elsewhere. "" So Crawley you rapscallion of a squid, what kind of game is this?"" I hear you ask. Well, it pretty much is Monster Hunter with Megamanesque mechanics. It's rather slow paced compared to Metalslug or Contra and features a whole lot of gun and blade customization. You want your combat knife to look like a pizza cutter ? Done. You want a Revolver with a shotgun Barrel and an SMG Stock firing Acid Bullets? This game got you covered. You get annoyed quickly by playing mission-based on only a handful of maps? Well..The thing is this: Like in Monster Hunter, you choose a mission and get dropped into one of only few maps, gunning down enemies and collecting different materials to upgrade or modify your Guns, Blades or  Body Armor. Yes there are not that many maps and yes, you have to grind for material. So if this easily irritates you, this might not be a game for you. However, I actually quite enjoyed my first few hours and because of this loot drops from enemies you make at least some progress, even if you fail a mission. Why? Because you get to keep everything you collected.In addition to that, there is a little reload minigame, where you want to hit the sweet spot on a reload bar. Contrary to what some reviews imply, the gun does reload nonetheless, if you do not.  If you actually hit the sweet spot, you get a damage bonus for a percentage of your clip, indicated by glowing bullets.So after talking about gameplay a bit: The music and artwork is superb. I instantly fell in love with it the first time I saw it, and after playing a while back then I was really disappointed, because I expected this game to be yet another Metal Slug inspired game.And I am pretty glad it is not, because I like this way better.TL;DR: No this is not Metal Slug. Its Mega Monster Hunter Man. It's obtainable via the Humble  Bundle for one Dollar right now. If you don't mind some grinding  or like either Monster Hunter or Megaman, it is definitely worth it. "

												As hard as I try to, I don't enjoy playing this game, even remotely. Every mission I attempt feels tedious, slow, and boring, aided mostly by the fact that most every mission is some sort of completely unguided fetch-quest through samey looking environments that are an absolute pain to navigate through. If the level design weren't enough to dissuade me from continuing, the limited ammuntion and active reload system makes the gunplay feel especially tedious, and just doesn't work well with the Megaman-style shooting/platforming, especially when the use of cover isn't as much of an option as in Gears of War, the game this particular mechanic came from. I can't count the number of deaths I've encountered after missing my target, only to be shot down during the short idle period in which I wait for the active reload to finish (assuming I successfully reload at all).The inventory/item system was another annoyance for me; switching between items feels clunky and slow in situations where speed is needed, and always feels like more of a hassle than is worth. As far as the crafting system goes, I honestly can't stand playing the game long enough to gather the items necessary to really try it out, so I don't have much to say regarding that. Perhaps after upgrading my weapons properly, the enemies will feel far less bullet-spongey, and I'll spend much less time standing in one place, jumping, and shooting in mid-air while I wait for an enemy to finally die (supposedly of boredom).I'm sorry, I want nothing more than to love this game, but this it's an absolute mess. Including modern game mechanics in an old-school platformer/run and gun sounds good on paper, but does little other than clutter the overall design and slow down gameplay. Perhaps if the level/mission design was a little less annoying, it might work.To take this game from its current state to something I would enjoy would require gutting the vast majority of the superfluous features, completely overhauling the level design, and possibly even overhauling the crafting system, assuming it is as much of a mess as the rest of the game.I don't really have any faith in the final product, and I kind of wish I had never spent the money.

												Honestly not really worth playing, it's nothing like metal slug at all and i'm glad they didn't called it ""spiritual successor of metal slug"" as a marketing line.the control is really limited and annoying, you can't shoot diagonally,  jumps have this little split sec before and after the jump that pin you on the ground as if you were carrying a bag full of potato unlike many retro platform game where you jump instantly and the reloading system that can mess your fingers if you play on a keyboard, it's seriously not intuitive.The missions are terrible fetch quests without any detail or explanation because many missions happen on the same map, so you can spend a lot of time wandering on the map trying to figure where's this thing you need to find, it's like those mmorpg fetch quests except you don't know where to go and it's timed.the whole game is very boring, boring and annoying, enemies pose no threat and at best they are just annoying at some part because of the control limitation, the only time i would fail is because of the mission's time out by trying to figure where the hell i have to go.Weapon crafting seems to be the only highlight of this game but i won't mention it because it's not even worth talking about it.I had hope for this game, but it's just a forgettable retro-wannabe game.just get metal slug 3 instead and play with a friend, no regret.

												I had high hopes when I bought Merc Kings, I was expecting a Metal Slug/2D platformer. It is very far from that. The concept that drives most of this game is fetching objects/seek and destroy targets. While it doesn't sound bad, the problem is that it uses the same areas while examining every square inch for anything that might get overlooked. There are boss fights in the game, but after awhile they will give up and leave, which equals a failed mission. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. You are already being timed on the stage, you have to find the boss, get fenced in and figure out the pattern, and they can ragequit. That is messed up.The art style and music is great, but the idea of replaying the same areas over and over again for minor accomplishments got old very quick. I enjoy games where grinding is a requirement, but the incentive to continue with Merc Kings seems too far away with no variety in between.			"

												Considering Metal slug series being one of my all time favorites I really thought I'd love this gorgeous game. However the multitude of flaws just left me disapointed.1) Missions are timed.2) Enemies respawn when you reenter the map chunk/sector.3) Enemies are bullet sponges.4) Backtracking5) If you want to kill (relatively) fast then your movement is hindered by the weight of hard hitting guns. HOWEVER, forget any skillfull evasion then, because in close quarters you will get hit no matter what. If you want to jump over attacking enemies, you are limited to peashooters which, guess what, take a long long time to kill all the enemies who are entrenched, shielded or immune to frontal attacks and are otherwise unavoidable like for example sniper or shield guy on a ledge where you need to get on. Prepare to jump over and over again in one spot until he's dead.6) You can't shoot up while walking.7) You can't change direction while attacking.8) somewhat unresponsive movement Combine 1 through 5 for constant and aggravating slog through enemies. Combine 5 through 8 for disapointing movement and gunplay. "

												The team behind Mercenary Kings are sat in that awkward in-between of not having a cult following from simply existing for a long period of time, like Final Fantasy, and not having the excuse of having never developed a game previously. As such, they're neither excused by rabid fanboys nor by simple naivety. In layman's terms; when they dun goof, no one's in their corner.For example, it's over a year old (two years if you count Early Access) and it's only just been fixed so that it doesn't crash when you talk to an NPC and try online multiplayer. It's a pretty big deal when such a massive component is unavailable.There are typos and syntax errors abound in the game text, something that should've been easy enough to fix in their numerous patches on PC. I do have to give kudos to Tribute's response to the concerns of the completionist demographic; when a kickstart-exclusive achievement made 100%ing the game impossible, they introduced a secondary method of acquiring it. That's gravy in my books.The controls feel a bit like a student's final practical. Need to duck? Nope, there's an item by your feet, you're taking that bullet to the face as the collecting animation immobilises you. Nope, there's a ladder a pixel to your right, you're climbing down now. Need to climb down that ladder? Nope, someone put C4 at the top and your backpack is full! You aren't getting down that ladder until someone picks it up or you make room to pick it up yourself.Furthermore, the game seems to favour the commitment route for control schemes. When you jump, there's very little you can do to influence the path you'll take once you've left the ground. If you're unfortunate enough to try your knife in a pinch, you'll get locked in an uninterruptible cycle if you press it more than once. You'll need to allow plenty of time for the animation lock to finish if you want to so much as turn your character.The graphics are the same as you find in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. Same people, y'see. The style's consistent and the animations are gorgeous, but it becomes clear that some of the spritework was drawn before they finalised the character designs. For example, Lawless' hat bears the wrong logo in her comm. portrait, and Ryack's expression is far too serious for his actual disposition.I cannot fault the music. It takes a lot of cues from the Sonic games on the Sega Mega Drive (Sonic 2, Sonic Spinball). Gives me dem nostalgia feels. One of the bosses even takes a pointer or two from the first Sonic game.The Steel Soldier, Titan Trooper and their recolours have an annoying habit of not telegraphing where they're jumping, and since you sometimes need to immediately dodge to avoid collision damage, it's a 50/50 chance of rolling in the right direction.Oh, and all bosses and enemies deal way more damage via contact than by their lasers, rockets, bullets and missiles. It's pretty much Hug The Wall: The Game for boss encounters, and Flee In Terror: The Horror Flick should you come into contact with the wildlife. Because you can be killed by rabbits. Guess you're allergic?Bosses randomly teleport to other areas of the map for no reason other than to arbitrarily extend gameplay. If it was purely to pressure the player into rushing the fight before he flees, there wouldn't be a time limit on every mission and its grandma.There are a handful of large maps that get repeatedly used. The enemy placements are (mostly) the exact same between missions. A room or two will open up sometimes, but in the end, you'll have quickly grown tired of the same recycled layouts and textures before you've even beaten the game.In later missions, some of the poorer design decisions become evident. For example, you'll leave a room and see a manhack to your upper-right. It's a perfect 45 degree angle. It'll automatically start descending diagonally towards you. If you jump to shoot it, it'll either be too close and hit you horizontally, stunning you for a second or two, or it'll be too high and it'll start moving horizontally early in response-- their AI is programmed so that they rarely become completely level with your gun if given the time and space.Your movement and jump speeds are decided by how encumbered you are; your gun, your knife, your consumables, things like that (your gun weight is negated if you holster it). It's a really neat idea when it's used exclusively for hiding secrets, but it's not. You have to leap defenselessly if you're too heavy, and the game has a nasty habit of placing enemies in the way of the finish line, and usually there's a threat for not finishing the ""jumping puzzle"" all in one go. Sometimes you have to do the entire thing again, sometimes it's a pit of spikes you can't get out of easily and will likely die from. The feature's great on paper but difficult to account for in all of their level designs, something evidently too difficult for Tribute.Design-wise, you can't shoot diagonally for two reasons; 1, you'd have to be incredibly precise with your joystick movements (you're not playing this with a keyboard and enjoying it, trust me) so as not to wander and fall. And 2, because each gun sprite would need a second diagonal variation. Remember, Tribute had a limited budget-- something I suspect shows in how some arts assets weren't updated for the final release.Gun customisation goes something like this in later levels: You built a sweet new gun! Does it have armour-piercing? No? Scrap it and take armour piercing so that you don't have to bounce around like a coked-up kangaroo. No, you don't have multiple gun slots while you're out on the field, so unless you have someone to play with, you're not diversifying your calibrations AND beating the missions in any reasonable time.I'll tell you something though-- crafting is so extensive and addictive, enough to make the constant grinding for materials almost worth it.I'd say Mercenary Kings has the making of a fairly memorable game, but it needs severe overhauls to give it the edge it needs. Maybe a bigger budget to allow for experimentation? Maybe a sequel...?			"

'You can’t be serious. Okay listen, this is a suicide mission. There are hundreds of enemies, we know nothing about the terrain and only have very limited suppli-…' – 'It’s okay, we’ll send in the KINGS, they can handle everything.' *Insert some dramatic music*________________________________________________________________________________'Mercenary Kings‘ is an interesting recipe: You take a portion of 'Mega Man‘, add some elements of ‚Monster Hunter‘ and spice it up with a pinch of 'Metal Slug‘ or 'Contra‘. This may sound like a very odd combination and the reviews are quite ambivalent about the qualities of the game but especially in co-op this game is a blast.The story itself can be told quite fast: The bad guys called „CLAW“ (they have the brilliant slogan „CLAW is law“) kidnapped a famoust scientist and conducted some evil experiments on a solitary island. To end this madness the military sends a super special unit – the KINGS. No, the story won’t win a creativity award, but it’s solid and full of humor. The crazy characters are quite likeable and several conversations are actually interesting and bring in some plot twists. But you can be honest: You won’t play this game for the story……you want these guns. And the knifes. And the ammo. All the good stuff. The gameplay can be compared mostly to a mixture of 'Mega Man‘ (jumping and shooting) and 'Monster Hunter‘ (crafting and grinding): First you have your own hub where you are able to buy items, upgrade your equipment and accept the missions. These jobs bring you into larger areas where you have to fullfill goals e.g. killing or capturing a boss, gathering materials or resucing some hostages. So you start running and jumping through the levels, avoiding obstacles on your way (like e.g. lava, needles and other evil stuff). Meanwhile you're shooting at everything that walks in front of your weapon while looking for hidden items and loot. The level design is well done, the different areas and layouts allow for some nice exploration and the amount of traps and enemy types really brings some nice variety to the quite repetetive goals. Of course: at the end of several mission there's a boss waiting for you and these buddies provide some nice challenging moments. Most of the time simple button mashing ends in an early death and you really have to understand the patterns and to find a good strategy. Though when you’re finally able to defeat that annoying difficult boss (I look at you 'Metal Woof'!) and he drops the material you were looking for – that’s some pretty great feeling.Talking about materials: On your journey you’ll stumble across many different ingedrients and materials that can be used to craft individual gun parts, knifes and bionic mods. The amount of different parts is tremendous and they can be combined to fit your playstyle, whether you’re the tanky dude with the shotgun or the spray’n run submachine-type. Crafting new guns, mixing the parts and farming for materials is the core element of the game – and it’s very entertaining.In terms of the visuals and the sounds I have to admit that the design and the style is gorgeous (I’m a huge fan of well done pixel-graphics). The environment and the characters are detailled, the animations are perfectly fluid and the overall picture is simply great. And in addition there is an amazing soundtrack, that features some really catchy tracks. I could go on talking about even more positive points, like the splitscreen multiplayer, the co-op mode or the omnipresent humor. But the negative points of the game can’t be hidden this way: the amount of different areas is very limited (there are over 100 missions but just like 8 different areas, so you will re-visit some rooms and places quite a lot) and after a short amount of time the missions can get quite repetitive (there are only like six different goals). Moreoever some time limits in the missions seem to be set totally random, sometimes you finish with half an hour left and sometimes with barely 3 seconds. That’s also due to the fact that some bosses 'escape‘ randomly after a short fight and then you have to search them again (probably not the brigthest gaming mechanic). Besides your characters appearance lacks some good customization aspects, aside from 12 different color schemes (approximately 75% of them look awful…) for the two characters there’s nothing more. Some unlockable characters (e.g. the 3 other members of the KINGS) and areas after finishing the main game would have been a huge plus.________________________________________________________________________________Yes, the reviews and opinions for the game have been quite ambivalent. I think the problem is that many bakers and players expected a ‚pimped up‘-version of 'Metal Slug‘ with all its core points and elements. And with these expectations the game may disappoint easily. I bought it in hope to get a mixture of 'Mega Man‘ and 'Monster Hunter‘ – and I’ve never regret buying it because the game entertained me instantly.All in all I guess the game would be a solid 7 out of 10 (or maybe a 6 if you dislike good old Mega or grinding) due to all the negative points (that are clearly there), but… I love the game. Sure I would have loved to enjoy even more areas and to customize my character to look different than my partners, but hey... -  I had a machine gun that fired some caustic missiles, which bounced of walls, splitted in little pellets and exploded on impact. That was one hell of a weapon. And I’ll never forget my shark-shaped-knife that shocked enemies on contact.These two things alone have to improve the score by at least two points. Because of… reasons! And explosions. And think of the knifes! And the dogs in mecha-dog-suits. Yeah, never forget mecha suit Doge – ‚Metal Woof‘ ready for action!			"

												it was fun at first, but it got really repetitive really fast. the music is really cool, it has a really deep crafting system in which you can customize each part of your gun, and the art is BEAUTIFUL. however, it just goes downhill from there. there's one or two maps that you play on for EVERY. SINGLE. MISSION. absolutely nothing is different; not the enemy placement, not the item placement, not the platforming, not the music, anything (unless it's a boss). i really, really wanted to enjoy this game, especially since i spent $45 on three copies of this game for me and my friends. but i just can't.

												No, Mercenary Kings is not like Metal Slug. If you want Metal Slug, just go play Metal Slug.Mercenary Kings is a 2D action-platformer with a variety of missions to undertake with generally non-linear level design. Yes, many of the missions share the same maps which I admit is a bit of a bummer, they could use some more variety since there is typically only 2-3 different maps per rank. Still, they're large and fun to explore and, with different types of missions including extermination (kill x amount of y), neutralize (kill boss), gathering (fetch items) and rescue (self-explanitory), among others, the different tasks do mix it up enough to keep it from getting completely stale.What? Grinding? Yeah, there's grinding. You will need to grind materals to upgrade your gun's parts and upgrade your melee weapons. You will end up repeating missions over and over for mats. However, after the first run or two on a mission, you'll memorize the pattern of where everything is, making it much easier and faster to complete, so it's not as bad as it may sound.The tunes are good, visuals are splended and charming, humor is amusing, characters are likable and the story works well for what it is.Controls are responsive and both my old PS3 controller and my Logitech F310 work perfectly...do NOT attempt to play this with your keyboard or you're gonna have a bad time. I cannot stress that enough, do not use the keyboard, use a controller. Game client is stable; constant 60 FPS and no crashes to note.The gun upgrade/mod system is fun and quirky, but could've been more refined and balanced, as the biggest changes to note are appearences, semi-auto/auto, clip size and reload time. While in theory this sounds nice since it boils down to preferences, many combanations lack fire-power so if you want major damage, you're limited to a few choice combanations. Considering this was one of the big selling points/features, it feels like it was unfinished and rushed.I wish I could comment on the 4 player co-op, but I've never had an opportunity to try it.Mercenary Kings isn't a game you can pick up and finish in an afternoon, it requires patience, time and investment. I recommend it, but it's not for everyone.			"

												Mercenary Kings is a nice co-op action platformer which has a lot to offer as far as challenges and customization goes.First off, there are 112 levels with more than 12 unique bosses which should keep you busy for a decent amount of time. Admittedly, the maps could use a little bit more variety. That's somewhat remedied by way most missions are structured. Each unique map is inherently large so each mission will cover only certain portions of the map (with the rest of it being totally optional).The game also makes you consider resource management. While you don't need to do every single mission to 'beat' the game, you do however need to plan which resources to bring and decide when to best use them. For example, infiltration or capture missions will require you to make the best use of your C4 charges and shock bombs. Wasting one or more of each item can usually lead to failing the mission. This becomes even more important when speed runs come into play.Another selling point of the game is the massive amount of gun parts and gun combinations available to you through progression. It opens up a lot of possibilities and it's amusing to see different combinations suggested on various videos and forum posts.With all these things going for it, Mercenary Kings is not perfect. I'd reckon that the average Metal Slug player will be able to finish majority of the game without even fully scratching the surface as far as crafting goes. I feel that there's a lot of room for improvement when it comes to content. Personally, I feel that the game was too short seeing as I reached the final level long before I even got to halfway on all the crafting achievements.My suggestion? Steam Workshop integration. This is another one of those games that will benefit a lot from workshop integration to add newly designed maps. BattleBlock Theater serves as a great example by giving the players access to the various blocks that make up the levels. A move like this will go a long way especially to reduce the boredom from having finished the game and moving onto crafting everything else.My initial impression of this game would be at around 9/10. It was definitely fun but it needs something to fill the gap at the end of the game. For now I'd rate this game as a 7/10 since it is severely in need of user-generated content. Nevertheless, it's still an absolutely fun co-op experience. I do recommend getting the 4-pack.			"

												I enjoy this game, but there are a lot of caveats.If you watch the trailers, it looks like a run and gun, a la Metal Slug. It's really not, though. It's more like Monster Hunter, where you gather materials and embark on quests with specific goals, as opposed to running through stage after stage and then beating the end boss. Mercenary Kings just happens to use 2D gunning/platforming instead of 3D action for its main gameplay mechanic.The problem with its emulation of Monster Hunter is that it took the worst parts and made it the bulk of the game. Too many of the quests are boring ""Kill 20 small minions, find 10 stupid items, reach this destination."" It's repetitive and not interesting.Even worse, Mercenary King's early boss fights are boring. They all follow the formula of duck, fire, roll under, repeat. There are 3 or 4 palette swaps per boss, who all receive the exact same new move. Why they chose to create 3 subspecies who all act identically is beyond me.With that out of the way, let's get to the good stuff.The late game bosses become much more interesting and varied. If more of the game were like this, I would give it a glowing review.The gun design mechanic is good and forces the player to make meaningful choices and decide between tradeoffs.Playing with friends is quite enjoyable.In summary, I recommend the game, but if any of the above sounds unpalatable to you, then definitely skip it.

												I really like this game for a lot of different reasons. Firstly is the music: the music is awesome i find myself listening to it all the time even well after i stopped playing this game. Secondly is the gameplay: its very satisfying and deliberate the controlls feel tight and the guns feel meaty with good sound effects and enemy death animation. There is quite a lot of content however you do spend your time redoing things quite a lot in a sort of monster hunter fashion where you go to the same levels over and over to get materials however instead of just killing a boss there are different objectives for different missions like destroy something with explosives or save some hostages things like that. As for the bosses themselves they are pretty good they have attack patterns which can be quite difficult to master fighting against making them satisfying however unfortunately there isnt that many bosses in the game so you will find yourself fighting the same ones or varients on the same ones over and over. This is a really solid game and can keep you going for a while if you enjoy it I spent a lot of time collecting different gun parts and trying different combinations however i eventually got bored of repeating the same areas over and over and moved on to other games. I would recommend getting it, and if you dont think it is your thing at least listen to the soundtrack because it is awesome!			"

												I'm going to preface this review that this game is by no means perfect, and I have yet to totally finish all of the missions avaiable. That said...This game is very *very* enjoyable. While the difficulty in later missions can be rather stress-inducing, the level of customizaton one can put into their guns allows you to feel like you're working to make your own private arsenal. Borderlands hands you the complete guns, and that's all well and good. Mercenary Kings gives you the pieces and lets you experiment. Do you put the pieces together to create a minigun that fires incendiary AP ammo? A shotgun that fires caustic buck? Or a 3 shot pistol that hits like a freight train with every bullet fired?The choices are up to you. If customization, old school run-and-gun gameplay, and classic difficulty are up your alley, then Mercenary Kings is for you.			"

												Playing Mercenary Kings this past week, since its official release, is the most fun I've had with any game in years. That's not to say I don't enjoy the other games I play and adore, but this just tickles a fancy like none other. The rewards offered through progression, the challenges when the enemies ramp up, or when a new boss is introduced - they make playing endlessly entertaining. Now, much of the criticism the receives is due to a popular idea that the game is similar to Metal Slug. I've personally never played it, shame on me and such, but if you're looking for that experience, then you ought to play Metal Slug. This isn't like another game I've played, while it shares elements with many, it's an entity of its own. For many reasons this will remain one of my top picks for this year, if not longer, and there's no reason not to play it. Oh, get a controller.April 10th revisions:Oh... yeah... I'll have to recall some of those statements. The multiplayer is pretty much dying since launch, and the game isn't really that entertaining once you get your best gun. That being said, I got 60 hours of playtime out of it at its $15 launch price, so I'll definitely still recommend it. I just don't know how often I'll go back to it anymore. Whether I return to actively playing M.K. is really going to depend on how the Devs treat the game - as a product that could still use some improvements / additions, or as a finished game. Kinda feels melancholy leaving it behind for now...			"

												After six hours, it just makes me want to play Metal Slug.There are a lot of cool ideas here that I want to like a great deal. The art and music is beautiful, and  the mechanics that they draw from Borderlands, Monster Hunter, and Metal Slug are very cool in concept. But, therein lies the problem. There is tons of character and tons of concepts, and they just don't really gel together in a satisfying way. The beautiful art is done injustice by how stiff the animations are, and by how creepingly slow variations in environments and enemies are introduced. While the music is good, the sound effects are flat, and don't provide any real sense of punch to the action. The guns are incredibly flaccid and static, feeling more like gussied-up number hoses than firearms. Customizing the guns doesn't really feel meaningful or fun. As in Borderlands, all the variety in the world ends up just being wallpaper for a different set of slightly different numbers. This is compounded by the fact that new weapons cannot even be found in the wild, reducing the excitement of their procurement a great deal. Action is plodding with neither the fast pace of Metal Gear nor the precision of Mega Man, but a muddy, fuzzy middle-ground that isn't satisfying. After playing through the same map for the fourth time, the massive list of missions begins to look more like a list of chores than a set of badass missions. When I set out to write this review I didn't mean for it to be this negative. After thinking about it, I've found myself terribly disappointed.			"

												Pretty boring and lacking in substance. Most of the weapon customization is pretty trash since the damage output is equivalent of shooting paperballs at foes. Boring fetch quests ahoy. You'll often be sent to the same areas with very little differences. Most of the challenge you'll face is seeing if your new customized weapon does any damage. Other than that. Enemy patterns and AI is pretty simple in design and easy to counter. It also has the same trash loot system from Borderlands. Which manipulates players into hoping of getting good items instead of getting a good experince from the game's combat and levels.Basically, the game is Mega Man with garbage enemies and bosses to fight, a  very low difficulty and forgiving gameplay, and some Metal Slug influences.

												Mercenary Kings on the outside looks like a really fun game, it has the Metal Slug aesthetics and it also has a passionate and supporting fan base. On that note I really did not enjoy the game and will be presenting the pros and cons in a list fashion.Pros.  Amazing pixel art by Paul Robertson. Lots of guns and gun combinations. A very lenghty campaign. Funny dialog. Great music.Cons.  Very tedious missions. You have to grind missions over and over to get materials . Bosses are bullet sponges and very unjustly so as a boss only has about 5-7 attacks each. Areas in the late game are very tight and damages you for the slightest wrong move. Most bonuses/ammo types requires you to grind making the game very lackluster and empty for people that don't like that.Now althought this didn't really affect my enjoyment/disappointment with the game, the story was reminiscent of Cave Story down to an almost identical last boss. All in all I probably would never replay this game again, as I did complete every mission the game offered.			"

												The positive:-Really nice pixel art.-Can be fun (mostly at first).-Good variety of enemies.-The concept of ""secret objectives"" is interesting, even though it's developed poorly.The neutral:-The story. It's kind of bland but it can be skipped without an issue (just keep pressing ""next"" everytime the dialog windows show up after some key missions).The negative:-Gathering materials is a chore. Even upgrading your armor requires grinding (example: one armor requires 2 of a material that's only dropped by one boss; to make matters worse, it's not a guaranteed drop)-There are a lot of missions but they are really repetitive.-Maps are quite big, which could be a good thing but you must check the map constantly to see if you are going to the right direction. Some missions actually don't tell you were the objectives are but luckily those are quite few.-Crafting is kind of confusing but the worse thing is being constantly constrained by having to find materials.-The food that can give you a boost on health (+ other temporary stats) must be grinded in the ""hunting grounds"" were you basically kill -mostly- harmless animals that provide no challenge. The whole thing looks like an unfinished featured that ended up being rushed.-""Profencies"" that you can get by crafting lots of stuff seem kind of nice but they are not worth the trouble of finding all the materials.-The special ""mods"" that you can equip to your character are mostly kind of useless (although the one that assures that every enemy drops a material on death is extremely necessary to be able to craft weapons)-Enemies have ""strenghts"" and ""weaknesses"" that you can learn about by talking to a guy in your camp and changing your bullets for each mission is so boring that you'll probably use the one with the higher attack number and disregard everything else.-Weapons have a lot of different stats but they really don't change the playstyle.-You can craft a lot of decorative stuff that serve no purpose except tempt you into wasting your materials. In my opinion it would have been better to see the base change as you completed missions.Conclusion:I can see a lot of potential in this game but it's full of really strange decisions that seem to be aimed at increasing the playtime of the game (but that's not the same as a game having a great replay-value).in my opinion the game would have been a lot better without crafting and actually focusing in making combat and missions more varied.

												On the surface Mercenary Kings is the regrettable result of a one night stand between Metal Slug and Scott Pilgrim (because at least having conceptual intercourse with a video game franchise is easier than dealing with Ramona's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t), but MK really does rise to the occasion to try and set itself apart from its lineage with a great deal of ambition and love from its creators. If there is a fault to be had with MK is that it may be too ambitious.Naturally, the first thing you notice about MK is the look of it, and anyone worth their government-provided meat-substitute recognizes the style as, as I said before, Metal Slug (in terms of tone and atmosphere) and Scott Pilgrim (in terms of art style and visual humor). For many, this acts as a barrier to keep them from wanting to try the game and instead ridicule it for being ""too much like a Metal Slug rip off!"" when in fact that couldn't be further from the truth, but more on that later. The art style is incredibly charming and fun, despite taking place on a militarized island populated with murderous COBRA rejects. Sadly, and this is where part of the over ambition comes into play, the environments repeat themselves a lot, a whole lot. This is not so much a fault of the level designs, but more due to the fact that you will play different (i.e. different objectives every now and then) missions in the same level over and over until you manage to advance in rank. If the level art was a tad more detailed and beautiful this would be forgivable but after so many hours it gets bland.Sound is nothing really to complain about or praise, but it gets the job done. Simple, appropriate, though like the art it can get repetitive as you listen to the same level music over and over and over again.Naturally the most important bit of information you want to know is ""how does it play?"" While some screenshots and/or videos may have led you to believe it plays like Metal Slug, it really doesn't all that much. MS had you going through a linear, left-to-right, level with occasional height changes. MK's maps are far more complex, the map probably even confusing some at first with the interwoven connecting paths, and should be looked at more like a Castlevania map - large and sprawling, with hidden alcoves, optional boss rooms, etc. You'll be jumping around a lot, ascending to reach a goal or carefully descending to avoid hazards. I would say it feels a lot like Spelunky in its controls, but how easily you move is dependant on what you have equipped.The real meat and potatoes of this game are the guns. You collect materials from fallen enemies and found crates and use these resources, and money garned from completing missions, to craft components for your gun. Here is where the game really shines, as it doesn't restrict which part can go with what component, and if you want to try and make a terribad gun, you're just as able to as you are to make an amazing gun. The elements of any gun really work toward tailoring to your preferred method of runnin' and gunnin'. You could take a huge gun with tons of stopping power and a low clip, or you can take a smaller, faster gun so you can dodge enemy attacks more easily. Elemental upgrades for bullets allow you to gain an advantage or disadvantage against a given enemy, and many parts take advantage of the art style by looking silly, fun, or just plain ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.Really, it's the gun crafting and shooting that keep this game from feeling too tedious (at first). However, as time drags on, you find yourself grinding levels for materials and money, fighting the same boss over and over, collecting X of that and Y of this, killing some of these and more of those. Honestly, if your main gripe with MMOs are the fetch/mob kill quests, this game may not be for you.The co-operative play really helps keep this game feeling fun, as your friends can split up and explore are area to finish the mission faster or you can operate as a time with one being the fast shooter for smaller enemies and attracting the attention of big ones while the other player with the bigger, slower, guns take the kill shot. If you have some friends who are interested in this game and you think they would enjoy the experience with you, this is not a bad grab.There are other crafting elements in this game, allowing you to customize your tent interior, or create body mods to gain a variety of pros and cons (like increased drop rate, faster speed, etc.), and meals before a mission to give you a nice HP stat boost.Overall, this game is fun, make no mistake, but it feels tired at about 50% (it's a very long game, surprisingly), and that's why its ambition is its downfall. The creators tried to do too much and ended up spreading their efforts too thin, giving us plenty of features but no major depth to any of them (gun crafting excluded). Had they taken some more development time to craft some more levels, think up better mission objectives, or polish up the scenery it would have been a perfect game.Still, I can still recommend it to anyone who enjoys action/platformers with a Metal Slug/Metroidvania/Spelunky/Scott Pilgrim heritage, though maybe wait for it to go on sale for around $10, at most.

Posted: November 3, 2016
												This is an occasionally interesting but really flawed action game. Several things about Mercenary Kings are great, but the whole package is ultimately bogged down by a series of odd and sometimes flat-out awful design choices. Let’s start with the good: the graphics are great and the art direction/character design work by Paul Robertson is awesome. It’s obviously not as gory, scandalous, or surreal as his usual stuff, but it’s still fantastic and it’s what first drew me to the game. Every sprite has tons of personality; I almost didn’t want to kill the bosses because they look so great (otherwise, interacting with the bosses isn't that fun, but more on that in a minute). The crafting system in the game is also quite deep and there are a lot of cool ways to create a wide assortment of unique guns and knives. If you’re into collecting a bunch of materials and creating your own gear, you should enjoy this feature.However, these positive aspects aren’t enough to make up for the drawbacks. The game looks at first glance like a fast-paced run and gun along the lines of Metal Slug, but it’s actually very slow, plodding, and even boring. The whole thing is really repetitive – you find yourself in the same jungles, mountains, and enemy hideouts over and over, facing a relatively small variety of enemies. Most of the common enemies are bullet sponges that can take a long time to kill, and they respawn extremely quickly. I mean, if you even breathe near the edge of the screen, everybody you just killed will instantly come back. The maps are really big and the game wants you to explore them – many of the missions are fetch quests or hostage rescue missions where you have to look all over the map for captured prisoners. However, the enemies have so much health and they respawn so quickly that I didn’t want to bother getting to know the maps.All of this respawning makes the maps really uninviting. This becomes a problem when you fight the bosses; at a certain point in the fight, the bosses run away, and you have to slog through the map, which includes all of the same old enemies that you just labored through, to track the boss down and kill it (unless it runs away *yet again*). It just feels like a chore and it wasn't fun at all. On top of this, every mission has a time limit. Couldn’t find that last hostage because the map is too big and every part of it just looks like the same generic jungle? Couldn’t find that boss again after already fighting it two times? Too bad – time’s up! I felt like the game didn't really respect or care about my time as a player.So yeah, I know the art looks great, but I'd recommend just appreciating it from afar. The game itself is annoying at best and aggressively boring in many ways. There are aimless fetch quests, repetitive stages, frustrating design quirks, and it all felt like a slog instead of a fun, fresh, compelling adventure. I'm pretty disappointed to give this one a thumbs down, but the problems are way too deep.			"

												The art style, setting and characters capture the mid-90s shoot 'em up feel very well. Crafting your first machine gun after being stuck with the sub-par starter gun is hugely satisfying, as is completing a mission with all bonus objectives and enough resources gathered to buy several upgrades.That said the gameplay turns out to be rather poor. On a regular basis players need to avoid enemy projectiles while firing at airborne enemies homing in on them and platforming, all at the same time. Sadly, the game lacks the silky smooth controls required to make this fun and instead just ends up being frustrating. The actual gameplay takes the form of missions, each one with their own objective. Between them players can visit their homebase for upgrades and supplies. There are two major problems with this. First: missions take place in large locations which get recycled again, and again, and again. Secondly: no information is provided as to where in the freely traversable levels the current objective is located. As a result players are forced to scour the same places over and over again, often with endlessly looping background music, too. Combined with limited time for each mission things can become rather frustrating fast.Other annoyances:The camera is not overly intelligent.Exponential grinding for better gear.Jumping has a noticeable delay to it.Jumping down larger heights leads to the character freezing for a moment upon landing.Some enemies can fire diagonally, which players flatout can't.Enemies may respawn the moment their spawn location is off screen.Health items are few and far in between, making the gameplay rather unforgiving.Health can be regenerated at field hospital, which act as save points. The health regen is slow enough to not be noticeable. The game doesn't bother mentioning that this health regen exists.It's impossible to jump while crouching, making destructable platforms the player has to fire at while standing on them and exercise in patients.Default grunt enemies on platforms above the players may randomly decide to drop down, giving no chance to walk away or kill them.The first boss decided to leave once he was on low health. He came back eventually but not soon enough for there to be time to finish him off, leading to a failed mission. Who thought this was even a good idea?			"

												This is a fun game with a surprisingly good plot. There's a lot of weapon variety, and is fun to play with a friend, but the netcode starts to fall apart with more than 1 friend. This game is what you would get if you crossed Metal Slug with Monster Hunter. You have a handful of prebuilt zones, with missions equivalent to Kill the Thing, Capture the Thing, Find the Stuff, Rescue the People, Destroy the Object, Go to the Spot, and so on. The Gameplay is reminiscient of Metal Slug or Contra, with a lot of weapon types and bullet types. There are numerous secrets on the maps that can help you advance your gear earlier (I hear people like sequence breaking) but it is all still a real challenge at the end of the game.			"

Looks great, doesn't play great.Mercenary Kings has a wonderful visual style that seems clearly inspired by the wonderful Metal Slug series.But the gameplay is more like Mega Man, except with less variety and more grinding. Respawning enemies, four-direction shooting, and a handful of large maps. The last five missions were on the same map, but Mercenary Kings is sending you back again to scour it for ten lumps of lead.If you're expecting a fast-paced run-and-gun shooter, look somewhere else.

												Up front, the largest failing of the game is that it never explains the Transceiver item, which pinpoints the boss and airdrops key items like C4, Shock Bombs, or First Aid Kits. I got to the final chapter of the game before realizing you could call people other than Miss Zero. A lot of complaints about the game can be solved outright by it. Also, the game plays a lot more like Megaman than Metal Slug, so expect that going in.It's true that every mission is timed, but with the exception of a handful of rush stages, you have plenty of time to explore and search for secondary objectives and hidden items. I ran out of time twice in the entire game, both times because I didn't realize you could just call in a C4 airdrop. Missions with specific objectives mark them right on the map. Bosses aren't marked until you find them, but appear in specific marked areas. You can call Cadillac on the transceiver to locate them, if you want. Bosses will move between arenas if you take too long to kill them (usually because you die), but their new location is automatically marked on the map.Gathering missions can be annoying, because there is no objective except to scour a level for crafting materials. They're always found in guaranteed chests throughout the levels, but can be completed faster if you get lucky drops from enemies. They mostly exist in case you want to grind for materials, because they add guaranteed items to the map.As for crafting, yes, there is some grind. A LOT if you're a completionist. Absurd, even. But if you're not dead set on getting every part of every weapon set, it's not bad. There are hundreds of weapon parts; some are incremental upgrades, most are just tradeoffs—more damage per shot, but a smaller clip. Better accuracy but heavier weight, etc. You might not get the materials for a part you want as soon as it's unlocked just by playing casually, but you can probably get something similar.When crafting guns, the big differentiator is weapon type and ammo. Certain combinations are better for certain levels; shotguns for levels full of mandrakes or bats, bouncing for levels with awkward enemy placement. Machineguns tear apart certain bosses, but their weight and low burst damage make them worthless in other levels. When in doubt, use Armor Piercing—it's (almost) always useful and has little downside. Elemental types are hyped up a lot, but make really no difference. Use Caustic if anything; it deals slightly more damage to most bosses, and chip damage to hard targets. If you're having a hard time with a level, try a new weapon type. Bringing the right class of weapon has far more impact than stubbornly grinding up a slightly stronger version of an ineffective weapon.Oh, and get the Dodger biomod. Invincible rolling makes things much, MUCH easier. "

												Every time I see Mercenary Kings brought up online, people get warned away from it for various reasons. Despite that, I'm here to say that it's gone down as one of my favorite games. Seriously, it's one of those where I'll play it for 2-3 hours and then have to force myself to play something else because I want to keep doing missions. It might not be for everyone, but let me share the good parts with all of you for a change.So if you've somehow glossed over this one, Mercenary Kings is a side-scrolling shooter in the vein of Metal Slug. Unlike Metal Slug, however, you have a persistent character that you upgrade with new guns and mods and stuff over the course of a hundred or so missions. And those missions take place in huge, wide-open levels with lots of paths and secrets to find. Missions range from beating bosses to saving hostages to recovering intel to gathering materials. Materials are very important, of course, because they let you build new guns and mods and stuff.See, there's something like 300 guns in the game, and you build each one piece by piece, using money from missions and materials from exploring and shooting dudes to unlock components. Those pieces can be mixed and matched to create monstrosities like a 32-round caustic shotgun. It's kinda like Borderlands if you could custom-build each gun. You can also build mods for yourself that give you major advantages, like speed boosts and regenerating health, or guaranteeing material drops and finding more money. There's also melee weapon crafting, cooking, and decorating your tent!There's also a surprising amount of goofy♥♥♥♥♥story, too. About half the missions are bookended with short character scenes like this that move the plot along. You have to rescue people to expand your camp, and once in awhile something will happen to them, like I had to go save my gunsmith at the start of the rank 4 missions. The design for the characters is by the same guy who did the Scott Pilgrim beat-em-up that sadly never made it to PC, and everything is beautifully animated.When the subject comes up, I've seen three big complaints about the game. The first is the bosses, and they're definitely one of the weak points. You have to actually find them in the level (unless you use the mod that shows their location on the map), usually in one of four locations, and they move around. Worse than that, they can run away while you're fighting them, meaning you have to follow them, though they're marked on your map after you find them once. They're not like Metal Slug bosses, either... they tend to be invincible until they reveal their weak point, so you have to learn their attacks and patterns. Once you do, though, they're not that hard. Capture missions ♥♥♥♥ing suck, though... you have to weaken the boss to a certain point and then hit them with a special grenade you can only carry like two of. I won't fault anyone who got stuck on a Capture mission and quit because of it.The second complaint is that you have to grind for materials, and I really don't get that one at all. The first few mods that open up let you control material drops; one guarantees a drop from every enemy but lowers the chance of getting rarer ones, and another makes rare drops more likely but reduces the cash you get from missions. There are no real rare drops, either. Each enemy has up to three items they drop, but they tend to be spread around so that almost every material is a common drop from something. The only hard to get ones are boss drops, but you can find those hidden on most levels in secret rooms, and they're always in the same boxes so you can get as many as you want during missions there.The last is that it's repetitive, and really that's going to be entirely up to the player. There are ten ranks of missions, with 10-12 missions per rank. Missions tend to take place on the same 2-4 maps per rank, so if you get tired of doing different things on the same levels, then yes, it's going to be repetitive. After almost 30 hours I haven't really tired of any of the missions and still go back and replay old ones to get extra materials and try to beat the par times. It's not perfect, but I got absolutely addicted to it and I didn't even play it co-op. Honestly, it's not a Metroidvania game but it's scratching the same itch for me that the old GBA Castlevania games did. If you like item hunting and gear customization in your platform games, I think it's a blast.			"

												Not worth the $20. I was sold by youtube vids, showing great action, customization and metal slug like gameplay. I read that it was a 2D Metal Slug meets Borderlands type game. I feel like I was lied too. Every single mission has a timer, and the maps are confusing. The enemies are basically allowed to ""cheat"" in this game too. You can only fire/stab in D-pad directions, but of course enemies will shoot you at every different angle and lobs things through/over cover. Also, enemies respawn on the maps, so you can't even slowly/strategically work your way through difficult areas.  The ""customization"" isn't very exciting, and parts are tedious to collect in this game, not too mention, the weapons you finally do put together aren't even fun to use. Wish I could get a refund, but that's not how Steam works. I would rate this frustration simulator 4/10. Only die hard 2D shooter fans should buy this, and only at a price below $10.			"

												Nice presentation, but the gameplay is lacking. The control is awkward, clumsy, and slow. The 'slow' part has been defended as being deliberate, but I found it grating. Regardless, you'll frequently find yourself slowly picking up an item when you needed to slowly duck, etc. The animation is great, but being unable to interrupt those animations when you want to do something else is painful. The maps are sprawling and purposeless, and you'll be expected to play them over and over again to, for example, hunt down five snipers. With a fairly short time limit. They don't respawn, you have to find them, they're hiding. Is this fun?If you're low on life, you can go to a med shack in the level somewhere! And wait inside for your health to sloooowly charge back up. Again, I ask you - is this fun? I understand that they've created a penalty (time) to offset the benefit you receive, but who wants to just stop and look at their character's idle animation for a whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minute while their life ticks up?On paper everything seems good, but in practice ever part of this game is like a chore.

Review in English/Spanish Análisis en Inglés y Español: English:  It’s a decent game with badass pixel art and amusing plot yet I couldn’t bring myself to play for more than 4 hours, why is that you ask? the grind. In mercenary kings you’ll need to collect items to craft and customize weapons, rack up points to rank up and upgrade your base, it’s a fun concept but unfortunately you’ll just find yourself replaying the same map over and over again... so heads up fellas, game is fun but expect some tedious grinding.  Español:  Tenemos un juego bueno con pixel art muy trabajado y a pesar de ello no fui capaz de pasármelo, ¿Por qué? El grind. Gran parte del tiempo estarás buscando objetos para personalizar tus armas, o  recolectando suficientes puntos para avanzar de rango y mejorar tu base, si, suena genial en papel pero a la hora de la verdad significa que tendrás que jugar el mismo escenario una y otra vez.Quedan avisados, el juego es decente pero deberás someterte a un grind puro y duro.

												Clearly inspired by the Metal Slug and Metal Gear series of games, Mercenary Kings combines some elements of the two to create a rather mediocre action platformer. You collect tons of materials to create dozens of guns that feel more or less the same, spend a lot of time repeating same levels again and again, and read pointless flavor-text dialogue that tries to pretend there's some interesting story going on behind the scene.The pacing of the game is hurt severely by a slow progression, grind for materials and lack of variety in combat - sure, there's some items you can use but they take up a slot in the inventory and its awkward to find a right moment to use them. It honestly feels like a chore - in Metal Slug games you had a few neat tools to fight the enemies (guns, grenades, tanks), big interesting levels with tons of unique hazards, plus the pacing of progression was fast and exciting.MK managed to copy the face of Metal Slug to some degree, but not the core formula that made that series fun to play.

												It is amazingly fun to craft realistic gun parts, screw them together as you think, and see if the product is any good on missions. The Missions are cool too, you get various elimination, some gathering, some hostage freeing, and of course boss missions - including related sub-missions and secret goals.Regarding the moral side, it seems brutal to murder so many people, instead of robots or something. But then again, the description of some enemies clearly says that they don't just look the same, but they're cloned and bionicly modified abominations. (That's possible due to the mandrake formula, the plot key)Oh, and this games multiplayer works really nicely on local and LAN. I've hardly experienced noteworthy lag, and even if you encounter asyncronous enemies, it doesn't seem to matter - the instance you see is the instance that can take and deal damage, and syncronisation appears to give up eventually, which means no rubberbanding.All in all, awesome Arcade Fun for alone or with friends!

												Forget about Metal Slug because Mercenary Kings is here. Don't come into this game expecting a Metal Slug rehash. It's got guns and cute characters, but that's as far as the similarities go. It's retro done well, if Retro City Rampage is retro done wrong. (But that's another story, because I'm not reviewing that game.) Please play Mercenary Kings with one or more friends because it is a game best enjoyed through co-op. I guess it's a valid criticism that the missions are repetitive, but Mercenary Kings isn't really about the missions. This is game about the journey (but it's not Journey). It's fun to customize your guns and to slowly get better and better at killing enemies. This game is challenging but it's never really unfair. The reload mechanic is a deliberate design choice so you can't just ""hold shoot and win."" And even if you just ignore all that, you still have a game that looks and sounds great. The aesthetic is charming and the characters are kinda one-dimensional I guess (or are they two-dimensional?), but they're still pretty likable. Even the dialog is well-done. Bravo Zulu, Tribute.

It scrolls sideways (and up an down too!) and you both run and gun in a very pleasant manner. Meanwhile your visual cortex is being stimulated by the gorgeously animated pixel art. The one single negative thing I can think of is that you sometimes have to run back and forth across the level searching for whatever the mission objective happens to be.

In any case, please, this is certainly no Metal Slug, stop comparing it to that game).The customization mechanics do seem to add depth but that won't make up for the entire gameplay, sorry.Very disappointing considering the nice art, solid animation by Paul Robertson and his friends.Online co-op is based on an unconvenient matchmaking system which I couldn't make good use of but it may work better for you.Please note that the game probably plays much better if you are playing local co-op, because exploration becomes more efficient and fun through communication and exchanges.

Enemies takes several shots to kill.-Enemies respawn after you walk away, you may be killed by them wandering around.-Going through the map takes several minutes, if you missed something in the middle you may not have enough time to complete the mission.-The boss teleports between certain points, which could take you several minutes to travel.-The teleport happens every a few minutes, you get close to it, oh sorry too late, it's gone again.-And of course, collect meterials to upgrade equipments.I like the pixel art, the music is decent.

There is some re-use of environments, and some of the enemies can be a little cheap, but the humor, pixel art, and objectives will keep you hooked!			"

												Not a bad game, but sometimes feels like the whole is much less than the sum of it parts. Mercenary Kings came dangerously close to being great but stumbled near the finish line and crashed hard. Maybe it's me. I'm going to recommend, because it's not a bad game in any way and it features a pretty cool concept. Ultimately it's fun and i've been playing it longer than i initially thought i would. And i still want more. If you're into pixel art, retro styled action platformers, this is a very solid, if very uninspired game.Mercenary Kings has some good ingridients, but doesn't seem to click too well. It takes some pretty bland cliches of 80/90 over the top cartoons, villains and macho bs heroes but doesn't use them to create anything compelling. It rehashes cliches for the sake of rehashing cliches which is a shame because the game has some pretty good elements.Ordinarily, i'd expect a game to come up with a cool concept then ruin it by being lazily half-arsed or rushed, but Mercenary Kings actually has good art and sound. I can't blame the developers for lacking effort because it's certainly there. The characters are drawn and animated with style and their dialogue fits the brash and cliched design. But they're unlikable and almost ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I don't expect great depth but they're very ""cookie cutter"" and not very memorable, although i must begrudgingly admit the idiots kinda grew on me after a while. Animation and dialogues are well done, no complaints there. Maybe there's one too many generic clones of the generic villian soldier but that may well be intentional and it fits the theme.The controls seemed pretty weird to me, but they can be remapped. A simple run 'n gun platformer shouldn't be confusing, but it took me a while to come up with a control scheme that i felt comfortable with. Which is the same one i got used to in Risk of Rain btw. The controls are responsive and other than there being too many of them, there's really nothing wrong so maybe just attribute my control discomforts to the fact the game just refuses to ""click"" for me.Level design is, as has been noted in other reviews, very repetitive but once again, Mercenary Kings has many ingridients of a good game and while you're still interested in the RPG-like aspects of gameplay, or looking to concoct even weirder combinations of weapon parts to smash enemies with, you'll be able to forgive the repetitivnes. It may even help a little because the game is pretty difficult at frist, unless you're really good at action platformers.Speaking of RPG elements, there's leveling up, acquiring extra skills and abilities, collecting resources to craft both usefull and useless upgrades but i was kinda uninterested in them at first. Maybe they were not presented the way i'd like or i was whiny and temperamental or whatever but it felt like a bunch of possibilities were dumped on me all at once, and then i was told to grind away and eventually unlock the stuff. Grind is a bit unkind because gameplay is pretty fun and the concept of mixing platforming, combat, RPG progression and crafting is promising. But then again repetitive levels do make it feel like a grind, so and the promise kinda falls flat. As with characters, i never felt any connection to any upgrade or whatever. It very much felt like i was doing whatever to kill whatever, in order to rescue whatever so i can whatever whatever...Options are pretty sparse. There's volume controls, control remapping, windowed or fullscreen and... that's it. No resolution choices though reportedly you can scale the game down by using -windowed -scale=2 as a command line argument. It didn't work for me though.Havent tried multiplayer but it seems like it's well implemented. There's co-op in either split screen or online and you can set players to join only if they're on your friends list or allow all. Or you can invite manually.There is gore and violence but since it's done in a pixel art style, it isn't graphic in a way comparable to modern shooters or horror games. It is violent and over-the-top as much as the artstyle allows, so if you're concerned about that, then skip this game. It's fun and fitting and wonderfully old-skool and enemies explode in chunks of violence and gore. It's meant to be fun of course, but it definitely isn't to everyone's tastes.Repetition is fine for as long as you're having fun playing. -Recommended.			"

												So I see a lot of complaints about this game being that people weren't expecting the game they were given. This isn't a Metal Slug 2D shooter, this is a Monster Hunter-ish 2D shooter. Reason I say that is because it's core mechanics are very similar to Monster Hunter. So if you want Monster Hunter but 2D with a lot of guns then this is the perfect game for you			"

Unlike the classics of the genre, this game's controls are very sluggish and the action is poorly paced. If you're looking for a Contra or Metal Slug, this will be disappointing.			"

												Game has a very odd and quite flawed drop system which is really annoying as they serve as mission objectives and not just loot. You get a mission to collect, say, two pelts from foxes, but only 1/100 foxes drop a pelt so you run around and kill 150 foxes, only find one pelt and then the timer runs out and it's Mission Failed.Yeh, no thanks. I have better uses for my time than to grind for rare drops, especially as a timed mission.			"

												If you had of asked me if I would recomend this game a week ago, I would have. However since then I have gotten to the later stages and now I see this game is everything I used to hate about old school games. In the later levels the Devs decided to make it more challenging by adding jump mazes that require a high end controller to do. If you are trying with a cheap controller or a Keyboard.. good luck...  And the time limits imposed on those missions make it so you are trying to rush though which of course increases the chance you will fail due to missing a jump.  And mix that all with the fact that there is usually more then one way to go on the map to your objective however some ways are blocked by doors that require C4 and since you can only carry 1 C4 that means if you choose a direction incorrectly once then the short time expires and you lose because of that. its really to bad. The game is a ton of fun all the way up to captain with a few annoyances here and there and then you just hit this wall of missions that suck all the fun from the game and induce extreme frustration.

												As a big fan of Metal Slug-style 2D shooters, I was really looking forward to playing this. The pixel-art is fantastic, the gunplay is great and modding your weapons can yield some interesting results. But sadly, the game just starts to feel very dull and repetive after a while. I can't quite put my finger on it, but after a while it just didn't pull me in anymore. It feels like it lacks flair or intensity. Coming back to something like Metal Slug, the action feels very kinetic and constant. Mercenary Kings tends to feel very slow and meandering. It can still be fun and maybe I'll give it more a chance someday, but at this time? I don't think it's worthwhile.And if you're going to try it, get it on sale because it sure as hell is NOT worth 20 dollars.			"

												I haven't delved too much into this game but from what I've played I really like the old school side scrolling 2d aspect to this game. I think the most common description of this game would be something along the lines of Metal Slug x Borderlands. Where the gameplay is obviously like Metal Slug but the be all end all is to upgrade your weapons, armor and mods through pickups. I think at most that's where this game kinda diverts from the two games mentioned and probably falls closer to the gathering games found in MInecraft or Terraria. There is no leveling method from what I've seen and the only way to increase your health and weaponry is by increasing your money by doing missions and picking up material drops found during those missions. At first, the game may seem difficult like most shooters will but once you get a decent upgrade going the game will start feeling like classic shooters from days past. I think what sold me on this game was when I was rolling with another player online (4 player co-op) and she was carrying around the spread gun. That's right a spread gun from Contra!			"

												You'll probably hear this compared to Metal Slug a bunch, but the only similarities are it's a side-scrolling shooter. Maybe the comparisons come from how good the game looks, sounds and plays. It's a lot of fun. There's a really cool gun customisation system where you pick and choose parts from a heap of different weapons, all with their pros and cons, leaving you with so many options for how you want to kill things. As I mentioned before, the game looks awesome, the sprites and animations are great, The music is so damned catchy, and the controls are solid, controlling your character just feels good.It's in early access at the moment, so it's still missing about 40 out of the 100 missions it's supposed to have, so keep an eye out for when it's released.Oh yeah, it's 4 player co-op, 4 player online AND splitscreen, and both work really well, and it's definitely a lot more fun with more people.

Loved this game so much that i also brought it for several freinds!This game reminds me so much of the old arcade classic ""Metal slugs, in regards to format, graphics, and even playstyle. But this genious game offers so much more with crafting, rank system, upgrades, multiplayer, mission types and even with enemy types.When i first started playing, i fully expected to just run through a one direction level blasting everything without much thought, but it suprised me. Firstly, each level can be ""explored"".  You can go up, down, left, right.. there is a full map to traverse!Each enemy has vantages that can make you think as you approach it. It's not all mindless blasting ( well you can try, but you get beat up a fair bit ). Then there is the bosses. They each are challenging and have unique weaknesses.Pro's:Wonderful arcade style graphics.Many hours of playtime.Great fun with a few friends on online multiplayer!Challenges around every corner with enemy types, bosses, objectives, items and gear setups.Many missions and a few different mission types to keep things interesting. I Personally Love this.Each ""mission"" has side objectives and even secret objectives. Keeps things more interesting while giving you a chance to earn some extra dosh. So it's not always a single minded objective.. you have the choice to take things further.Crafting! Craft you own weapons, be it automatic, semi auto, bladed, single blast, double barreled.. so many possabilities! You can even install bullet types for different effects. I Had some fun mixing weapon parts.Upgrades! Upgrade your armor, install skills & effects and some camp vanity. Just to make things more interesting.A Large map on each mission to explore. ""where am i suppose to go? Oh hello... there is a map! D:  ""Just addictive!Con's:Initial keyboard setup can be frustuating initially. ( Though remapping or plugging in a controller makes it excellent ).Some missions that fully require certain items to complete it can become depleted thus making the mission void.There is no option to ""cancel mission"" or ""return to camp"". So you are forced to exit to the game menu to cancel a mission mid-mission.Lives are shared in multiplayer. So if you have a reckless friend who plays like a lemming, you will see the lives dwindle thus Failing the mission once depleted. Quite a few skills (mods) seem to have some negative effects that overwhelm the positive.I Would recommend this game 110%. I Would even encourage multiple purchases so you can share the fun with friends!!""Now waiting for Mercenary kings 2"" "

												If you're looking for a good ol' fashioned SHOOT 'EM UP game, this is the one you're looking for. A mixture between an already perfectioned platform shooter Metal Slug, and the RPG element of Borderland as the cream on the cake makes this game the utmost best platform-shooter I've played in a long time.There are some cons about this game I'd like to add, so here's a list I put together after playing this game for 5 hours straight.    PROS:+ Fun gameplay with a lot to do and master.+ Awesome pixel-graphics with great details for violent man-slaughter.+ The replay value is there, and with multiplayer you can bring your mates to join up the massacre.+ Huge maps to explore and conquer.+ Fun characters with a lot of personalities and hilarious slap-stick humour.+ The price for the game fits for what you get.+ IT'S A MODERN & UPGRADED VERSION OF METAL SLUG.    CONS:- The missions are quite repetitive.  - Also, ALL missions have a time limit, and with random missions on random maps, it can easily be overwhelming about what            to do and how to do them, not to mention WHERE you are supposed to be (a minimap would be helpful).- It takes some time to get used to the game mechanics and the weapon-builder system.   - If you don't bring the right weapons to the right missions, it's easy to botch yourself.- Tends to turn a bit tedious if you play the game alone.All in all, this is a motherhumping awesome game, and I'd rate it 6/6 within a heartbeat. But this is a game that is enjoyed best with some company, so make sure you got some pals that'll join you on the task to save the world!			"

												A nice indie pixel-art platform game.I would say the gameplay is a bit reminiscent of Mega man : huge complex levels, you have a gun weapon and a ""slide"", and you fight enemies which are quite strong, but also have an exploitable attack pattern. The game bring new ideas to the table though : mission objectives, crafting ingredient farming, and the customizable gun building are the main ones.Outside of gameplay, the game makes you think of classic action heroes like Rambo. The evil organization CLAW makes me think of a James Bond villain's gang. This makes the setup quite enjoyable.I recommend this game and my number of play hours is testimony. Being a 2D pixel art game it ran great on my old laptop and this has been the game I played in transportation for quite a while.However, I believe this game also has a few annoying aspects that could be a deal breaker to some people. Il try to summarize it all in a list of pros and cons.The Pros :Crazy amount of gun parts to craft. Lots of ingredients to loot.Nice ""Megaman meets Rambo"" platformer gameplay.Levels are very big and quite complex. The map is mandatory to not get lost!There are several ""missions"" for each map. You get to explore each throughly as the objectives are in different locations for each mission.Missions have appropriately varied objectives (collect ingredients, kill a boss, save hostages...). There are many of those missions, making the game quite long.It will take you dozens of hours to craft the rarest parts, get the achievements, and unlock all the rewards.The Cons :There is a very annoying mechanic with the bosses : they can flee. Sometimes they flee to another arena at the other side of the map, and you don't have time to get there before they flee and change location again.There are several missions for each map. Despite different spawns, goals, and how huge the maps actually are, it can be repetitive to see the same level 5 times in a short time span.There may be many ""missions"", but aren't that many maps/levels in the game. The mission objectives don't modify the maps much either.To farm some ingredients, you'll have to play the same mission many times. This makes the issue above even worse.Weapon parts are all a fragment of a ""complete gun"". These ""complete guns"" are all very powerful (at the point in the game when you can get the ingredients to craft their parts). This actually discourages you to experiment with gun building, since those ""default guns"" are very good.Overall, I recommend playing this game in smaller sessions, so that the repetitive aspect doesn't feel as bad, allowing you to enjoy the actual qualities of the game. Getting better at killing those bosses before they flee is also a great way to make this game less frustrating.			"

												TL;DR: Mercenary is a 2D platforming shooter that's reminiscing the classic such as the metal slug with a hint of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World to it's art style. If you're a fan of metal slug you should definitely try this title. If you're not a fan of metal slug that's probably because you've never played it before then you should definitely try this title to see what you're missing out on *wink* *wink*I do however have a few criticism to make on this title. Keep in mind that these elements are, for the most part, optional, therefore, it's completely possible to avoid doing them and just focus on the core element.Firstly, the concept of boss arena. In short, some of the later bosses that you must kill in order to clear the level. However, they could spawn at any one of the several spawning spots, which forces you to track them down, dish out as much damage as you can, then maybe watch helplessly as the boss decides to move to a different location which forces you to track them down again. Thankfully, the second time the boss is marked on the mini map. On top of that you can take on a mod chip that marks the boss for you. Which takes up a valuable mod ship spot. Which leads me to my next point.The Grinding. There's a lot of weapon in this game. Which in turns required a lot of materials to build them. Which in turns requires a lot of grinding. Again, if you're one of those people who hates grinding. You can simply Google one of those top weapons guide. Focus on acquiring a set or two that works for you and forget about the rest.To sum it up. The grinding is a bit tedious. But it's mostly optional. To enjoy the core experience you probably just need to acquire one or two sets of weapon and probably won't use anything else for the most part. A must buy. 8.5/10.			"

												This game feels like watching paint dry to chip it away after it dries and then you repeat. Let's get past the fact this isn't metal slug. This game is a grind, and a pointless one at that. If you love mundane boring fetch quests that require you to get ""X"" amount of ""Y"" then go ahead. This game offers nothing new or really interesting in it's gameplay and in the end you are just doing the same mindless stuff for hours on the same maps. I would say it was fun if it was only a few times, but this game finds a way to really make you regret buying this and insults you with the reuse of levels, not only that but enemy placement. This game could have been so much fun but it just falls flat. And again, this isn't metal slug. As a game on it's own merit with that in mind, it is just not fun.

												this game is AWESOME. the learning curve is a bit steep. and it seems to be developed with a controller in mind (which is how i normally play anyways), so after about 30 min i felt completely comfortable with the gameplay and all the other elements that complement it. this game is VERY addictive and once you get a feel for customizing your weapon you'll want to keep pushing that ""one more level"" to perfect it before logging off... and of course its just not quite right so you keep going, and going, and going. im about 10 hours in and am probably around the 1/4 point as of right now. in terms of percentage anyways. difficulty has just begun to spike so im expecting the remainder of the game to be much less forgiving, but despite this, it never ever feels cheap. at the time of this review (early access through day 1) i havent been able to successfully join an online coop match, but so far the game seems to be solo-friendly anyways. so im not too upset about that. at the very least we still have local, split screen coop anyways.i'd reccomend this to absolutely anyone. wether you want to be serious, or just have fun with it. you'll enjoy it. and if nothing else, these types of quality throwback titles need to be supported so we can see more of them in the future.

												Modernized Metal Slug with style.There are a lot of throwback games nowadays, but this one just brings so much to the table that it’s worth checking out. Not many games have made use of the delicate pixel art that Metal Slug introduced us to. Why you might say? I think it’s because it requires a lot of work and the style has a lot of detail and could be daunting for the developers. However this game is just beautiful pixel art throughout the whole game, never getting repetitive or unfulfilling.The game takes the shoot-em-up game, arcade style gameplay and mixes it with metoridvania free-roaming and item-gathering concepts to pimp up the Metal Slug-like gameplay to a more modernized version. With hundreds of mission, carried out on several map levels, with endless of materials, gadgets, tech, armor and weapons to build and customize this game has shown us what the shoot-em-up genre will look like in the future.  With all its content and lots of hard to catch achievements, this game will keep you coming back for more, for a very long time.I could not recommend this enough.One note: Gamepad over Keyboard, any day.

YouTube™ Video: Mercenary Kings: Impressions 

			Views: 447		

			Mercenary Kings: Impressions We go Mercenary Kings, a side scrolling action shooter. Recently taken off of early access, and released as a full game.		

Above is my video impression of the game.Mercenary Kings is an great looking side scrolling shoot'm up.,Inspired by the likes of Metal Slugs, Megaman, or Contra. The game is pretty damn fun and addictive. It has an interesting custom / upgrade system for your gear, where you have to farm for materials and cash to create new gadgets.Though the game play is fun and challenging, it can be a little repetitive at times.Pros:- Great audio and visuals- Interesting and unique style- Great upgrade system- Lots of replay- Controls are deliberate and responsiveCons:- Can be repetitive- Map could be more streamlined- Some times can be hard to find a random online game/player			"

I have really mixed feelings on this game but at the end I would give it a 4/10 (10 is the best).Pros: Graphics Weapons-you-can-personnalize: I like to find powerfull combination adapted to new enemies Reloading: brings a bit of strategy in fights Enemies: many different enemies and bosses, each with their own weakness to aim.Cons: Repetitivity: you have a lot of missions in the same environment then you change of map, but it's the same kind of missions with a higher difficulty. Difficulty: rises slowly then there's a gap I haven't managed to crossed. I couldn't finish the game. Enemies: seriously, what's this idea of enemies coming back when you just left the part of screen where you've killed them? There should be a timer before they come back because it's really painful. Dialogues; the story is not bad but dialogues are bad. Humor may vary between people, but I think the one in dialogues is bad. Characters: for a game you can play up to 4 players, why is there only 2 caracters you can play? Is it laziness or lack of time/money? When I saw the introduction video, I thought the 4 guys in it would be available.In the end, it's not a bad game, I had fun with but it leaves me a bitter taste. In terms of gameplay, I really prefer Broforce (you have to give it a try with friends) which offers more variety, fun and modern mechanics.			"

												Mercenary Kings = Metal Slug + Monster Hunter (with just a dash of metroidvania). Unfortunately as good as this combination sounds, Mercenary Kings doesn't live upto any of those games, instead it seems to awkwardly straddle the divide between them. If your expecting a fast paced sidescrolling run and gun game like Metal Slug or Megaman X, you will be disappointed. Movement is in no way terrible, but in comparison to games that excel in the genre the characters will seem sluggish (I know that running speed is affected by equipment weight) and the controls will feel loose and a bit unresponsive (especially jumping). Also being unable to shoot diagonally seems like a big oversight for a game like this. Don't be expected to be oneshotted by enemies but at the same time be prepared to spend more taking enemy grunts down. Once again though this doesn't make Mercenary Kings a bad experience, you just need to manage your expectations.Anyone familar with Monster Hunter will be right at home with the way that Mercenary Kings handles missions and crafting. Missions are selected from an npc in the hub basecamp, mostly fetch/kill quests which take place over a handful of levels (encouraging you to explore new areas of each map) with a few boss battles sprinkled through each tier. A new tier becomes available after completing specific missions which usually involve the introduction of a new boss, which can be captured or killed depending on the mission and/or your preference. Enemies(and Bosses) will drop items needed to craft new gun parts and knives. Just like Monster Hunter to get your favourite equipment you will find yourself grinding. All though this formula worked great with Monster Hunter, unfortunately Mercenary Kings doesn't pull it off half as well. Although maps in Monster Hunter were reused in every mission, you didn't have to wade through 15 min of the same pattern of enemies to get to your objective, you could generally just run there. Weapons in Monster Hunter varied greatly, feeling very different to use and with very different stats, in Mercenary Kings it really just boils down to dps. I also feel like there are some real balancing issues with the different gun types. Who wants to grind for gun parts when the guns just feel like reskins of your current weapon. For grinding to be viable gameplay in a game like this bosses really have to be something special, with random attack patterns and unpredictable AI, every fight needs to feel different. This is also something that Monster Hunter gets away with but Mercenary Kings seems to struggle with. I don't know if this review will help anyone and I really have just scratched the surface on what to expect but overall although there a lot of questionable design choices in Mercenary Kings, I HAVE enjoyed my time playing it, especially with my friends. It may not compete with other games from similar genres, but what it does do is provide a enjoyable unique hybrid experience, and for that it was worth my money.			"

												While the first words out of most reviewers mouths regarding this game are ""metal slug"", my impression is that it has taken just as much inspiration from the Megaman games, with a lot of emphasis on careful platforming, learning the patterns of enemies (especially bosses), and choosing the right weapon for the job at hand.Unlike either Metal Slug or Megaman, you go into each mission with a single gun, knife, and set of passive 'bionic mods', plus whatever limited-use equipment you choose to bring or find mid-mission and passive 'proficiencies' which can be changed at will.  This means planning ahead; while at the home base / lobby you will spend money and materials gained during missions to unlock new gun parts, knives, and mods, and outfit yourself as you like;  Do you set yourself up with an optimal plan for your next mission, or just go with what seems fun? Either way, you have a LOT of options to choose from.Another unique quality to Mercenary Kings is the large and non-linear qualities of it's maps;  While each of the different levels gets reused for multiple missions, each one is HUGE with numerous interconnected rooms.  Some missions task you with exploring these maps at large on the look-out for specific enemies or materials, while some give you a clearly marked point to reach (or numerous potential boss locations) and you simply need to navigate a favorable route.Whatever the individual mission objective, it becomes easier and more fun to accomplish with friends.  The co-op REALLY shines when done locally, with two to four friends together in split-screen.  Equally viable is to invite friends online, using steam voice chat or skype for communication.   Public, auto-join online co-op is also available but it's far less ideal, as your only means of communication are a series of quick voice-macros, and there's no way of knowing if the player in charge is thirty missions behind you or thirty missions ahead.   No matter how you choose to do it, the game encourages you to split up and comb different areas of the map, trying to reach or search for your objective, and then meeting up to take on tough bosses together.Speaking of which, the bosses are another area where the game truly shines.  If you've played earlier in the beta, you'll be amazed at how much improvement was made to the game's varying bosses;  each has a wide variety of different attacks and patterns it will follow and each is equally deadly, enough to challenge the most hardcore action-platformer fan.In summary, Mercenary Kings draws inspiration from a LOT of things, but it's as new and original as it is nostalgic, and worth checking out.

												This game is...actually pretty boring.I loved the visual style of the game and thought it would play close to a Metal Slug or Contra like game with customizable weapons. Though from what I've experienced it seemed more like a watered down Mega Man game with some mild RPG mechanics.It's not a badly made game in any sense, but it feels a bit too sluggish for an action junkie to enjoy.  The fact that it's mission based and most of the time you'll be farming materials to make new guns parts and what-not adds to that.Pros:-It has very appealing aesthethics and animation-There's a lot of customization options for your gun (though not right out of the box).-It has online multiplayer (up to 4 people)Cons:-You gotta farm a lot to be able to get better gun parts (which is bad for those who just want to get into the action).-The Action itself is pretty slow paced (it also doesn't seem at all challenging)-Playing with friends doesn't make it any more hectic and actually slows it down even more since you have to wait for each player to catch up to go to the next area of the mission.In Short:If you like a action based games that play similar to classics like Metal Slug, Contra, or Mega Man. This is probably not the game for you.If you happen to like farming and don't mind slow pased action and find quirky and bouncy artstyles a good enough reason to buy a game. Then go ahead and get this title.Either way I recommend you wait to get it on sale before grabbing a copy for yourself or a friend. I honestly did not like the game enough to recommend a full price purchase.			"

												I have around 30 hours on PSN.  I don't know why I bought this for PC.  Only an hour and a half in, I quickly remembered all the things that made me stop playing this on Playstation.  The game seems fun at first but quickly descends into a repetitive grind.  The missions are long and tedious and the time limit means you'll often be repeating them because you ran out of time.  You will replay the same level so many times, you'll start to hate them all.  The guns are fun to unlock but the parts come at an agonizing rate, forcing you to wait forever or grind grind grind, exacerbating the repetition.			"

												I normally don't write reviews but mercenary kings is an exception for me...So, I've had this game since it's first early access release, but only started playing it now, I went through a couple ranks, and so far I have a positive opinion, let me describe you the gameplayMECHANICS: ISN'T FULLY DISCOVERED FOR ME YET So the core part of the mechanics, is that you have 1 map per 1 rank, the maps are big, in different missions you must roam the map to complete the objectives. That's the missions part, now let's get to the camp part. The camp is a place you roam between the missions, it's split into two parts: 1) The main camp2) Hunting grounds (You can go here to get animals' food, and harvest fruits) The whole point of the camp is that it consists of different members, that do different functions, you can go here to customize your weapons, cook yourself a meal, forge yourself a knife, choose a mission, search for games, customize your tent (Your bragging place, that you can show to different players that join you, here you can have a banner, and ornament, and three of your favourite weapons sets created by youself shown), upgrade armor. Although I didn't play through the game fully yet, this is probably all of the functions that will be available. At first not all of these functions will be available, you must get them through specific missionsGUNS N' KNIVES. THEIR STATSThis part feels very entertaining, you can create a bunch of variations of EVERYTHING, quick advice though, negative stats can make your gun better, depending on what you're trying to do. About knives, you can't customize them, but there's so much of them, that you wouldn't want to.PLATFORMINGVery good, uhh, I think that's all I can say, there's a weight system though, it's determined by your knifes and guns.

												This game isn't awful. It's just a weak Metal Slug ripoff. The missions all take place in the same locales, and the objectives are always kill x of this enemy or collect x of this item. Some times you have to capture a boss, but there is no explanation beforehand as to how you do this. I'd battled through the stage only to mistakenly kill the boss because I'd ran out of the item needed to capture him. Both yours and the enemies projectiles are painfully slow. There are only two directions you can shoot in whilst not jumping. Up and left / right. This makes fighting certain flying enemies a major pain in the balls. Especially when they knock you off of a ladder or a zipline when you're just trying to get from A to B. The boss fights are rubbish too. You do so much damage to the boss and then he walks through into the background and appears at a random location on your map. And unless you pay for one of your people to spot the boss, you're left running through the stage blind. Battling the respawning enemies. The worst are easily the slow moving flying drones. Slowly followed by these little jumping turnip headed ♥♥♥♥ers. They are very difficult to hit unless you have a shotgun, due to them springing about all over and your projectiles being telegraphed.I haven't enjoyed my time on this game at all. And would only recommend it to somebody who is bored of staring down and punching themselves in the♥♥♥♥♥♥4/10			"

												When I first saw Mercenary Kings, I became very interested in the game and it looked very exciting to me. The graphics and the gameplay strongly resemble those of the Metal Slug series. There’s the side-scrolling and 2D platforming that old school gamers have appreciated.The plot of Mercenary Kings is about a mercenary who is part of a resistance group that is doing battle with a villainous organization known as The Claw. The narrative quickly becomes irrelevant as you start off in camp and learn to customize your mercenary character. There is no voice acting, so you have to read the dialog text to understand what is really going on. The lack of relevance the narrative has does not bring the game down since gameplay tries to be the strength of the game.Upon playing this game I first realized how awkward the keyboard controls are. There is no mouse to be used in the game, but the keyboard makes the gameplay feel like a drag. I firmly believe that fans of the Metal Slug series would be best advised to use a controller or gamepad to have any fun with this game. Another aspect of the gameplay that feels like a drag is the repetitive nature of the battles with The Claw. You have a limited number of lives and after each death you will have to face the same enemies and this feels quite tedious. Using keyboard controls is difficult when trying to press buttons to shoot, jump, and roll.The graphics are pixelated, but that’s not too bad for a game that’s trying to be an old school, 2D side scroller. If the game had more variety in its levels, the replay value would be exponentially higher. I really wanted to like Mercenary Kings because of its concept of being of resistance fighter battling an organization of villains and the various characters to choose from and customize. Weapons can also be customized so that your mercenary can leave camp for battle with better gear.  I can only recommend this game to those with a game controller or gamepad and do not care much about the quality of the narrative. If you’re a gamer who is accustomed to using the keyboard/mouse combination, I would not recommend Mercenary Kings unless you are willing to commit yourself to playing with a game controller or gamepad.  I give this game a score of 6/10.			"

												As someone who's first platform was a original NES I found Mercenary Kings to be an excellent experience.  I think the experience is a little Contra, a little River city Ransom, and a great deal of fun.  It's nice to see that mercenary Kings supports multi player as well, my friends and I liek to try to race eachother to the objectives and treat each level like a speed run.  The gun customization is satisfying especially for a 2D side scroller experience.  I recommend hooking up a controller and playing this one on your TV for a great old school gaming expereince.			"

												Pixel art by Paul Robertson is the only good thing about this game. Apart from great visual style, it's a slow, repetitive platformer that makes you run through the same boring levels again and again, completing timed missions like ""kill N of enemy X"" or ""save M hostages"". You never know where to find them, especially the last ones, time runs out, and you have to do the same thing again. Weapon upgrade system is extensive, but pointless: all the weapons you can make are almost the same, and it takes a lot of grind. If you like intense shooting platformer with retro pixel look, better try this game's obvious inspiration, Metal Slug.			"

												Fun game, especially with co-op. If you compare it to games like contra I'd say it's a lot less hectic. So instead of relying on your reaction time constantly there's more of a strategic approach to combat. Also customization is nice. The modding of guns and other various things are simple enough that it doesn't bog down the game with a meta game of crafting, but adds a nice change up to the game. Definitely a great game for those that like side scrolling shooters and fun co-op.			"

												Mercenary Kings is a great mixture of shoot-em-up style arcade games of yesteryear and more modern shoot'em-ups. The game is simplistic in its plot, but its strong points lie in the strong mechanics and exciting gameplay. People say that replayability can become tiresome, but I beg to differ! Grinding against bosses to make that one special gun is part of the experience, and earning your way to better equipment is very satisfying! The game's selection of achievements also present a lasting challenge to anyone that plays, as getting them all is no easy feat!A fun, upbeat, and all around entertaining and visually impressive game, Mercenary Kings gets a 10/10 from me! The small details, incredible spritework and just plain old fun gameplay make this game a quality buy for any fans of the sidescrolling shoot'em-up genre!			"

Pretty fun! You can run on in guns blazing and shoot up all the bad guys. ALL OF THEM! Gun doesn't fit your style? NOOO PROBLEM! Go buy new parts from the in-game merchant with all that fancy shmancy cash you get for completing missions! Mix and match to make a weapon that fits your specifications! You also get to carry a melee weapon, and that can vary too! Knives, short blades, A GLAIVE! A FREAKING PLUNGER! A. FISH. GO NUTS! Add cybernetic mods to yourself to change the way you play your game! I personally like to dodge stuff and run fast. There are lots of ways to customize your character, and lots of enemies to defeat!

It's Just Okay To Be KingMercenary Kings = Paul Robertson - Anamanaguchi + Mega Man + Metal Slug + Cave Story + Repetition + Repetition + Repetition + You get the idea.Featuring Paul Robertson's lovely artwork (you may recognize him from such games as Scott Pilgrim vs. The World), this game glows with a Metal Slug vibe.  However, it would be much more accurate to describe this game as something very similar to Mega Man or Cave Story that is wearing Metal Slug's clothes.The plot consists of...  Um...  Mutant mandrake plants...  Some typical generic bad guys...  Doin' some stuff...  Bad stuff...  Something something elite team of super-juiced mercenaries are gonna kick some♥♥♥♥♥  Okay, so, the story isn't where the game shines.  That's really okay though.  The charm of the characters, the art, and various pop culture and gaming references is going to win you over in that department.A typical session consists of gearing up at the games's hub, Camp Crown, and then selecting a mission to play.  There are several different objective types, however all missions are mostly identical in nature.  Roam around a lovingly-created level, back and forth, for the umpteenth TIME, shooting the same handful of baddies OVER and OVER, picking up endless crafting ingredients, leaping through somewhat sluggish platforming segments, and killing a boss you've probably already fought 3 times before.  All before the time limit runs out.Then you come back to camp.  From here you get into the game's laborious crafting feature.  It is a straightforward collect-a-thon where you exchange various materials found from enemies and chests in order to build new melee weapons, armor, guns or bio-mods.  There is certainly a writhing mass of items to craft, more than I personally ever wanted.  You can create some pretty awesome guns by mixing and matching various parts (receivers, barrels, stocks, etc) and also...  Plenty and plenty of not-so-awesome guns.Rinse.  Repeat.  And repeat.  And repeat.  And repeat.  And repeat.  AND REPEAT.Accept this mission if you... REALLY love action-platformers.  I mean... REALLY love them.  Deeply. Can't get enough of Paul Robertson's bouncing pixelated boobies. Are looking for a content-heavy action game that you can sink a LOT of hours into.Take the first chopper off the island if you... Can't stand grinding.  Seriously, turn back now.  Run. Can't stand backtracking and repetition.  You are going to be running through the same areas OVER and OVER again. Are averse to action platformers with a hint of RPG elements.  Uh, why are you even HERE then?The Bottom LineI started off loving this game.  Then liking it a lot.  Then being okay with it.  Then just desperately wanting it to be over.  Was it worth playing?  Yes, altogther I am glad I played it.  However it definitely wore out its welcome toward the end and became very needlessly frustrating.Example?  Picture running around for 20 minutes trying to complete a boss fight mission, and just as you reach one of the boss RANDOM spawn points, it retreats to another location, leaving you most likely needing to slog back the way you came, kill the dozen or so enemies you just plowed through 1 minute ago, and hop through the maze of spikes, lava, pitfalls, etc.There is a ton of content to this game...  Too much.  I'm not normally the guy to say that, but its like being buried by stuff you can't bother with.  I have about 40 hours into this game but I've probably only unlocked less than a third of the junk to unlock.  The problem is that it can be so absolutely mind-numbing and frustrating to farm for the required ingredients that it's simply not worth it.  For the most part, the only worthwhile crafting you can do are the guns and I didn't even unlock half of those parts.  In theory it's a great system because you can mix and match different parts to create different effect and damage types.  A shotgun that shoots burning birdshot?  Sure.  An SMG that shoots corrosive bouncy balls?  Yep.  A rifle that fires wall-piercing homing bullets?  Indeed.  Unfortunately, MOST of these combinations aren't terribly useful and a lot are just absolutely useless.Another disappointment is that despite being influenced by games such as Metal Slug and Mega Man, there are virtually NO vehicles (with only ONE very mediocre exception).  In fact, there is little to nothing to break the monotony of running back and forth between areas and shooting the same enemies over and over and OVER.*sighDon't get me wrong.  I wanted to love this game.  I ended up liking it and still recommend it...  I just wish a lot of the redundant content was trimmed in favor of BETTER content.  The game could easily be 10 - 20 hours shorter, there could be a third of the crafting recipes that there are.  If getting rid of all that would have meant having some vehicles or missions with truly different mechanics then it would have been well worth it.  There could have been tank driving missions, a submarine boss battle that NEVER HAPPENS, or aerial segments where you shoot down enemies as you hang off the side of lovable ol' Choppy.  Instead, you are repeating a mission that you spent 30 agonizing minutes on because you couldn't find some hidden piece of junk before the timer ran out.The ending leaves open the possibility for a sequel.  I'd love to see one done proper with a lot more variety.  For now...  It's a lovely game with loads of personality and content that just really wears thin after the first 20 hours. "

												HEY YOU. DO YOU LIKE GAMES THAT INVOLVE PLATFORMING? How about platforming with guns? How about RPG elements? Perhaps you like weapon customization. This game? Has all of that. Pretty fun! You can run on in guns blazing and shoot up all the bad guys. ALL OF THEM! Gun doesn't fit your style? NOOO PROBLEM! Go buy new parts from the in-game merchant with all that fancy shmancy cash you get for completing missions! Mix and match to make a weapon that fits your specifications! You also get to carry a melee weapon, and that can vary too! Knives, short blades, A GLAIVE! A FREAKING PLUNGER! A. FISH. GO NUTS! Add cybernetic mods to yourself to change the way you play your game! I personally like to dodge stuff and run fast. There are lots of ways to customize your character, and lots of enemies to defeat! Pret-ty damn fun, if I do say so myself!			"

												I played this game for the first time with a friend, skipping the single player and going straight for multiplayer when playing a game for the first time (something I do often) is usually a hassle, but with this game it wasn't. simply speaking to the robot in the hub area will allow you to invite friends to play with you. We were using skype, so the in game voice chat was not needed, as decent as it was, and turning it off (a task which is usually a minor hassle) was as easy as a couple button presses. Controls are easy, you move with WASD, do the various actions with IJKL, and reload with the spacebar. The pixels are incredibly easy on the eyes and gameplay is simple and to the point.			"

												I have so mixed feelings of this game. If It would be possible, I would give this neutral.So this game is basicly 2D run-shoot-loot platformer, and it accomplishes it well. The gameplay works well, though the default settings for keys were a bit weird for me. The shooting though could be better, because there's no diagonal shooting, but otherwise it works pretty well. The reload ""quicktime event"" is a pretty cool touch too, but I don't understand the bad bullet thing (makes half of the damage).Looting and moding your skills are the main thing is this game, like if you want to get somewhere, you have to upgrade your guns (with many ways). This is nice idea, but every level has a timer, which sometimes makes the looting and gathering materials really hard. Also, the missions themselves are a bit booring.The enemies are mostly pretty okay. Not too easy to kill, neither too difficult to kill, but the placementof the enemies  feels a bit disturbing time to time. Like these flying robots appear while you try to platform to another place, guys with spears (a bit of more health than usual) are placed on small platforms, making it almost sure that you'll get hit etc. So far what I've stumbled boss fights, they're pretty okay.The graphics are really nice. The enviroments are kind of cool looking, the NPCs and the player itself looks really nice, the little animals look adorable, and the ballistics are pretty nice too. Only a bit annoying thing though is that levels are maybe a bit too repeative.Soundtrack isn't really special, maybe a bit booring if you ask me.The biggest problem of this is that it keeps crashing for some reason, which is really annoying.So, summed up:+gameplay+crafting and moding+graphics+/-guns feel nice, but should have diagonal shooting change too-timer makes gathering materials hard on some levels-keeps crashing for some reason7,8/10			"

Short ReviewThis game is like if metal slug and megaman had a baby.Mobs follow that set pattern of movement and attack like many platform games, but can still end up killing you. Boss fights are fun but don't expect a Dr. Wiley type of fight think more stage boss than mini or main boss. Game sports lots of weapon types,ammo types, and combinations of the two ,to be bought and used. Missions types though not in large variety provide enough fun and challenge with the paired game play of the environments. Maps are just right for being able to have a lot of gun shootouts though not as many as some might want since some missions take you back to previous maps.Online  MP is probably about the lackluster part in the form of no in game text/voice and no server list.You will randomly connect to someone if they have an open game setup which you can be paired with anyone no matter what rank they are or weapons they have. Other than if someone is jelly on a stick and used up all the shared lives resulting in mission failures this game is one of the few games where it is fun to play with randoms. The game supports up to 4 play local co-op as well. All in all this game is a gem and if you were a metal slug fan or not should be on any shooter fans have/get list.  Full ReviewReally love this game. Its like metal slug meets ironman. I say this because the way the mobs attack you and how they can be smart or dumb reminds me of megaman.The platforming also remind me of megaman there is a good mix or jumping,rolling,shooting,ducking,blocking,etc. Missions in the game are the following, rescue hostage,kill a boss,kill a certain # of a type of mob, kill all the mobs in a certain area, meet with and individual,find and destroy an item/s, or collect a certain amount of a item. Now this might not sound like many mission types but the game throws enough at you to not make the missions boring,at least for me.There are secondary objectives for each mission including secret ones not listed.The reward for the other objectives is typically more money and/or parts. You might say meh to that,but when you want to buy/craft that once piece those harder to find items you might get from  them might be worth your time. Thanks to a scrollable in game map the game makes finding your way to your objective pain free though not all objective types will be marked.Level time can be  a fun time or one that will make you wish for tons more maps.The game has a set number of maps that as you play through the game you will revisit area and unlock larger portions of the areas. This is not a bad thing because you will be more focused on the combat and your objective.Early on in the game it can become a bit tiring to constantly play on the same map,but as you get further along you get a nice variety.The maps themselves are not small and can take you a bit of time to travel around.The game is loaded with tons of guns. You can mix and match all of the pieces to make your own guns provided you have bought the pieces from the camp seller. How that works is the mobs drop material/parts: steel,polymer,wood,lead,etc . You need a certain amount to be able to purchase the part.After that you can use it as much as you want. There are full sets of guns, sniper/full-auto/semi-automatic rifles,machine guns,sub machine gunes,miniguns,shot guns,pistols,and I believe rocket/missile launchers. With each type there are also different ammo types for he different housing including elemental ammo (fire,poison,electric and cold).Now onto the controls, some people have experienced some pains in this area, but there a few guides on how to configure your controls to your hearts desire.If you use a controller that does not seem to work in the game, I suggest a program called Joy2key. I use it for any game that give me grief with my sony controller and it works wonders.Multiplayer in the game is a hit and a miss. No in game voice/text can annoy some people,but everyone in game that I have played with seem to play just fine, just sucks not being able to text chat at the least. There is no server list,no auto rank connections who you connect with will be completely random. All missions can be played by anyone provided the host has the mission chosen. The community for the game seems appropriate(maybe because of the lack of ingame text/voice lol)Game is fun, I have clocked quite a amount of time in it already for the short period of time I have owned the game so far enjoying it a lot. My only wishes are  more maps,more mission types and of course a level editor/mod tools. If you are a shooter fan get the game when you find the price what you desire. I hope mighty9 will be as much fun if not more, need more good platform shooters :3			"

												This game is, to put it very simply, Metal Slug meets Monster Hunter. You Run 'N gun your way through various large, open levels, gathering materials you need to craft new weapons, or upgrades back at your home base, which is also where you can gather a party for multiplayer or decide what your next mission should be.There's plenty of gun parts to make to customize your gun with, on top of several knives and other upgrades to craft, and even in it's current state there's plenty of missions to play through, with plans for the number of missions to be over 100 at release.Overall? If you like action games, this is definatly worth a look, especially if you're a fan Metal Slug, monster Hunter or games like them.			"

												Imagine what would happen if you took Monster Hunter, and then put it into a semi-retro 2D military setting.That's Mercenary Kings. Mercenary Kings is not Metal Slug and should not be treated as such. It's 2D military Monster Hunter down to the core.What does that mean? Well, for starters, there's a certain set of areas that you'll be redeployed to again and again and again, and larguely these areas will have the same enemies every time, but your goal will be different depending on the mission you take. You might have to gather certain items, destroy a certain object, rescue hostages, clear an area of enemies, kill a boss, and so on. All of these missions also have a time limit, so you can't just take your sweet time looking around, but you'll pretty quickly learn the levels and enemies as you run missions in the areas. All of these are elements pulled right out of Monster Hunter really.What's somewhat different is the crafting. Yes, you go out, gather materials, and them come back to base and cough up some resources and cash to get new equipment. That's the same as Monster Hunter. Where it differs is the depth of customization in your weapon. You get to mix and match parts of your gun to produce different stats and behavior, so you can take a magnum and stick machine gun parts on it if you wish to do so. That said, in reality, what you've really got is a pistol, a machine gun, a burst rifle, a shotgun, and a homing missile launcher, and beyond that you'll just be tweaking stats to manage reload times, reload ease (the game uses an active reload system that can give you a 10% damage boost if you do it perfectly), accuracy, damage, ammo capacity (before reloading, you have infinite ammo otherwise), fire rate, weight, and bullet propeties (homing, elemental, bursting into smaller projectiles, scatter shot, large size, and rebounding). It's actually pretty simple, but there's certainly some joy in tweaking your weapon to suit the situation or match your play style.Now let's talk about enemies. The enemies in the game all follow very simple behavior patterns, including the bosses, and there's not generally many of them on screen at once. The game certainly has some difficulty when you first encounter enemies and don't know what to expect, but once you learn them it does become somewhat repetative. After all, you're going to be fighting the same enemies on the same levels quite a bit. Nonetheless, I certainly find some joy in being able to rush through levels that I once had difficulty with. That said, as said, the bosses are pretty simple too, so while this game share a whole lot in common with Monster Hunter, don't expect to get the same feeling of accomplishment from downing a tough big bad, because there's nothing quite that scale here.In any case, the game is pretty fun, but just keep in mind that it's really a Monster Hunter styled game, and that means you're going to spend a whole lot of time looking at the same scenery and fighting the same enemies. If you want an arcade action game with a bunch of hectic levels, this isn't it.			"

												Do you like Metal Slug? Do you like Monster Hunter? Do you like Paul Robertson?Yes, yes, and yes, get this game. Finally finished after being worked on and tempered for quite a while, this game is the best we can hope for a 2d mash-up of shoot 'em ups and grind 'em ups. ==THE GOOD==Amazing spritework from Paul Robertson, or at least designs. Whether or not he did the full animating, it's still a very impressive job. The intro is stellar for setting up an actiony arcade game.Quick fun and good multiplayer capability. Grab some friends and rampage around! Loot is shared, where one person needs to pick it up and the rest of your group gets the rewards, so having someone branch off to look for supplies isn't a bad thing. Plus, with reviving teammates if they get in over their head, and no friendly fire, having a partner helps.Gun customization. Slap together your weapon with multiple options. There are sets, yes, and some parts don't work so well with others, but for the most part you're free to craft your gun with whatever you grab.==THE BAD==The grind. It's not as terrible as some games can be, Monster Hunter or certain other games considered. But to make some weapons, mods, or ornaments, be prepared to run a mission well into the double digit numbers. Completionists would do well to have patience for this game.Enemy repetition. Not until about the halfway point in the game do enemies become very varied. Not a huge problem though.Ultimately, great purchase and fun game.			"

												If you enjoy a healthy dose of dopamins with your friends, this is the game for you. The amount of content this game has is ridiculous. 25 hours in and I'm maybe 2/3 of the way through the missions, and it's just getting harder by the mission, so the last 1/3 is probably gonna take just as long as the rest. Not to mention that you get so many unlocks to buy that you end up redoing missions to get the materials you need for your upgrade. And redoing them to get them on a faster time for extra bonuses, or doing the side objectives.One thing I'm not such a fan of is the reuse of the same maps. There's just too many missions happening on the same map, some of them are pretty much equal to the previous one. There's also some issues with desyncing on coop, forcing you to remake the server.Over all though this is sweet game for the price with tons of content. Don't know if I'd recommend it for solo, but it's definitely fun in coop.			"

												I want to like this game.I like Metal Slug, and this gives at least tribute to it. But after a hour of it, I'm already done. It does nothing of what made Metal Slug a good game.Damage on contact from enemies instead of knifes+bullets only.Back-tracking with no clear information.Bosses you have no idea where to fight.Respawning enemies as soon as you go out of the screen.5 seconds load when you finished or start a mission before it goes to the brief/debrief screen (you can literally die in this period).I've been looking for 10 minutes for a boss in a level. It came once, but I can't find it anymore. I've tried--the boss came in some sort of arena. Finding another arena, I wondered when no boss appeared. And again, and again.The game is slow, tedious, the constant reloading is meh at best, the tutorial is not interesting and hard to follow (make it a straight line, not such a mess!)..Mercenary Kings is a game I'd like to like, but I can't.

Posted: July 26, 2015
												This game is almost good, but even after only a couple missions, I can see where the bad reviews are coming from. The shooting mechanics are decent, but not perfect. For instance, you can't shoot upwards while moving, which feels unintuitive and confining. There are also some irritating things about the way the menus work that should clearly be changed, but this stuff is minor compared to the main flaws...As much as I am growing sick of games about collecting and crafting, I think I would actually enjoy collecting materials in this game, if it weren't for the fact that enemies respawn in EXACTLY the same spot. And I don't mean the same spot every time you play the mission, or even every 30 seconds, I mean as soon as their spawn is off screen. This does two terrible things: it forces you to manage the screen's position or risk being mobbed by the same enemies repeatedly, and it makes material collection extremely trivial. For example, the first mission I played was in the hunting grounds, to acquire two pelts. This doesn't mean exploring the map like it should. What it means is knowing where one fox spawns, then repeatedly trying to kill it before it RUNS FIVE FEET AND DISAPPEARS FOR NO REASON. Then I move to one side and run back and do the same thing again until the mission ends.If I can bring myself to continue the game, I can't imagine changing my opinion later on. As others have said, this is a game that's ultimately about grinding for materials and crafting, but that one single design choice completely undermines that. Enemies need to spawn in random locations, and they probably need to NOT RESPAWN AT ALL during a single mission. Even if the overall amount of content in the game is limited, I believe those two changes would make the game infinitely more playable than it is. As things stand, I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone.If the game could be heavily redesigned from what it is, I could see it improving in one of two ways. The first would be to have more authored content, distinct levels that were meant to be played in a linear way from start to finish, but could be repeated to collect more ingredients, money, etc. In Metal Slug, I played those levels over and over for no reason except that they were fun. By comparison, I get bored of a Mercenary Kings level before I even finish it once, because it's so stagnant.The second option would've been to move towards heavier randomization, perhaps procedural areas that would mean not repeating content at all, but could perhaps result in less interesting levels. But even in its current state, the only thing that needs to change to vastly improve this game is the enemy spawns, which seems like a totally doable change to me, though it'd be a fair amount of work to rebalance objectives and alter the enemy spawns to suit it. But IMO, it needs to be done or the game is not worth playing. Which is a shame, because there is a lot of stuff to like about it. "

												this game difficulty is too high, even if for the first level, in the mission of finding 8 hostages we get lost easily, the map isnt helping at all because many obstacles that arent listed in the map and easily to get forget which hut that we already entered and saved the hostages, its become a frustating you should add or put the hostages location on the map. the other frustating element are the reloading system, and the control also bad, we cannot change the knive meelee direction when its still stabbing, so we must stop stabbing and facing another direction and began stabing again, but ussualy its already too late, the enemy already hit us.

												Mercenary Kings was one of the most disappointing games I've played in a while.  It looks great and the premise gives off the vibe that it's going to play like a Metal Slug, Contra or any other fast-paced 2D action shooter.  It doesn't and almost every aspect of the gameplay is poor.You'll notice immediately the intentional jump delay.  I don't know why the devs were so tied into this mechanic, it's terrible in this type of game.  You can get away with deliberate jumping in some titles, but not this one.  The jump delay makes the game feel so off.  MK also has reloading.  Why?  I don't know and having to reload constantly brings nothing positive to the game.  There's also the issue that you have to press down to pick up items, and you'll have to pick up items constantly and it breaks any flow the game manages to create.  I wish the whole crafting angle wasn't even a thing because it doesn't appeal to me in the least and from I've read, it's not any good even if you're into crafting.Supposedly the game is super repetitive and grindy as well, but I didn't last long enough to find out.  If you're looking for some fasted-paced 2D shooting action on PC, you're much better off with the Metal Slug ports, even though DotEmu didn't exactly do a great job on them.			"

												The movement and gunplay kills it for me. Went in expected fast moving action like metal slug but the slowpaced duck n shoot at every respawning enemy is just too much. take in mind that this is for solo play and only a few hours in but I'm already done. With the camera killing me when going into a new screen cuze the camera follows you 15 seconds later while you are getting killed in the next screen.Not being able to change direction and doing an action at the same time, actions not stacking, relying on healthkits,shorter cqc range than the enemys (and can't move while using melee(so far)),Gears of war reload, timed missions. Just feels like a sluggish metal slug with reload and resource farming, wich as i can tell so far don't do much gameplay change in the form of weapon crafting. Well take a look at some of the more detailed reviews here and judge if you might like it. For me it's just lords of the fallen of metal slug but with wonkier controls.			"

												First of all, let me say the game is really pretty. It has a great retro aesthetic that moves and feels like an SNK classic. The most obvious comparison being Metal Slug of course. The music is good as well and captures that same era perfectly and is generally catchy and unobtrusive. Missions are boring and styled after MMO/RPG cliches of kill so many of this, gather so many of that, etc. and the big kicker is you can't double up on missions. Each one must be completed separately which wouldn't be unbearable if the game didn't re-use the -exact- same map for 10 or so missions. Meaning that you see the same map, with the same infinity re spawning enemies, far too much. Especially since there isn't much in the way of enemy variety nor are enemies challenging or satifying to eliminate. Even bosses are a bit of a bore considering the slower paced nature of the combat and the GoW style active reload system. Which in a better developed or more fully realized combat system would be extremely satisfying. The game also makes a big deal out of the different gun parts and plethora of combinations possible but the sad truth is most are pretty worthless and to be frankly honest a base nearly unmodified pistol will do just as well as a custom designed toilet/saxophone/chaingun. Which sort of misses the entire point doesn't it? All in all what could have been an excellent 2D  hybrid of Borderlands/Metal Slug/Contra became a tired chore of repetition. Maybe the dev team will go on to bigger and better things, I can only hope.			"

Create a standard gun, or mix up your shotgun with some sniper parts. I've been having a lot of fun playing this and the couch co-op is perfect. You can play splitscreen up to four players.

												If you like Metal Slug- this is WAY better. All the old school charm, but none of the crappy controls. You get to build your own custom guns, upgrade your merc, and they didn't phone in the level content. I'm looking forward to trying the multiplayer.EDIT: Nevermind. This game is a chore. The gun thing is fine, but there is not as much customization as you might think. Most combinations just make crap guns. In order to use special ammo, you pretty much have to use parts wou may not want or that may take away aspects of the gun you like. I suppose this was done to keep people from making caustic longrang auto shotguns or something. The reload mechanic is alright. I still love the art and the gameplay is tight, but man the boss fights generally suck. Not the challenge or the pattern or the attacks! All that is fine! The problem is that they change locations. You pretty much get the first encounter to defeat them and if you don't smack them completely, in the first go, they flee to another part of the map, immediately spawn (if someone is there or not) and start going through their pattern. By the time you get to the location where they spawned, you get a few prescious seconds to attack them before they flee again. Now, you could leave the game running where they last spawned and eventually they will come back to that location, but that is boreing. So basically, it is a lame dynamic that greatly detracts from the game.This is not just one boss- but one boss they use over an over again.Also, the massive amount of levels are mostly repeats. I could have done with a more cogent/crafted set of story driven levels, one leading to the other, or an open world, or a big overworld map, but this constant revisiting of places I just wooped up on and finding them completely repopulated with bosses that flee and hostages and all that . . . jeez. This little war is being severely mismanaged. I understand that he is cloning soldiers and repopulating the levels, but come on! The same levels over and over again? Why not hit the cloning facility ASAP! Cut off supplies to the facility, sabotage the AA guns, drop some mercs in over the wall with that heli (or use a teleporter) and  de-CLAW the general! You have time to think about these things as you are running through a level for the 16th time chasing a coward in a jet. The fix? Make more of the repeat levels optional and make the bosses only spawn in their next location when a player actually shows up there. That should only require an if/then check to see if a merc is in the battle area! Again, the game could be a lot of fun, but it is a chore, and thus, not fun. The more I play it the more I am disapointed, but I'll eventually finish just becasue I like Paul Robertson's art style and the action is pretty good. Niche fanbase.			"

												This game is SO GOOD. It is like that cool game you heard about but never played. Like you cousin told you about the NES Metal Gear's plot, and you thought it would play like Contra. You also made it look cooler than it ever would on the NES. You made the perfect game a violent 11 year old would want to play in the 90's. Not one a violent 11 year old would make, but one they would play. This game is pretty polished, even though it has a little to much grinding. Also this game really is not like Metal Slug at all, it's like Contra. Sure the art style and sprites are similar, but the game play is more like Contra with slower (not slow) gameplay than Metal Slug. Also despite all the different levels, you will play the same levels with the same robots, and the same backgrounds over and over again. This makes the game loses a lot of its luster long before you can actually finish the game. Some of the ideas are interesting, the hunting, the upgrades to the guns, and the supporting characters. These all have flaws though. The hunting is repetative and gives few real rewards. The upgrades are confusing, with some bullets not working after you change one part of you gun. The supporting charaters are basically just fun one-liner machines, and while I like them they should have more lines, or somethings. Currently they just feel very repetative. That really is the main flaw of the game, how repetative it is.  It should have had a few things cut, or more levels and enemies. It should provide hours of fun though.			"

												This game is pure awesome. Think of it as metal slug, metal gear solid and borderlands combined and rendered in amazing style by author of Scott Pilgrim. You can run around and shoot baddies with your gun, collect random stuff that they drop and use it to craft some other stuff like weapons or mods to shoot more baddies. Enemies are too strong, or you took too many hits? Call your base using transceiver to request air support like medkits or air-strike, though it is limited use. Levels in this game are non-linear and pretty much open. You're given with an objective and a map of area, sometimes with locations where objective could be, so you're on your own there, only limitations are your health, items, skills and time (and level's absolute borders). Also there are online co-op mode present so you can kick♥♥♥♥♥together with friends.			"

												First, I can't completely understand the comparision with Metal Slug beyond the mercenary-war theme of the game, honestly... this felt quite original for me and nothing like MS -granted the visual and certain similarities between the main characters of each game caught me on the first try, but still-, so if you're expecting something like Metal Slug, well.. is not, it's different. MK is fresh and unique on its own terms, enough to stand alone as the great game it is ^^The gameplay and the story went all together smoothly for me, I just got caught in the action and completely willing to help the Mercenary Kings ^^ The music rocks and the animations are delightfully smooth even for a game that lurks intensively on the retro-look ^^ The gun-customization and overal RPG-like aspects of the game only place you deeper into the action, keeping it surprising and endearing, and this comes from someone who generally doesn't like RPGs ^^uTotally recommended =D			"

												Okay, here is the skinny.... Mercenary Kings... I give it a good 9/10it has the old school sidescroller feel to it, like Metal Slug series, Einhander (PS1 game, look it up), the Original Contra series, even in a sense of Castlevenia. I love these old fashioned arcade style graphics, and if you have a controller, its going to make you feel like a kid again (Ahem, assuming of course you where alive back then), the Music it gives, and its overall atmosphere. The options for guns is pretty damn nice, and you can make funky looking toys out of them, I havent gotten far (yet), so Im curious if I can make a Flamethrower with a SMG stock, or a Rocketlauncher to look like a pistol... the thoughts are there. well enough blather there, so I will give what I FEEL is the pros and cons (please let not my preception judge your decisions)Pros:Classic graphics, so its friendly for simpler systems (no not the original MAC, Microsoft, or Apple computers.. Get with the times!)The Music is pretty fair, not the best, but it fits the game styleMissions are pretty straight forward, no annoying long winded speeches (Aint no one got time for that!)Its not a total bullet hell, but enough to get your reflexes up (Keep away Ikaruga! you crazy!)Okay... and now the Cons... (and I dont mean the one sitting next to you, the guy whos reading this on a plane)Music, as I said is fair, but can make your head ring some with the repetition. (like your crazy mother-in-law whom screams alot)Controls are sticky at first until you get used to it then it gets easier.Some minor graphic issues (IE Helecopters blades on base is floating, not connected)Well thats all the pro's and cons there is to it, so its fun, and enjoy it!

												If Metal Gear (pre-Solid) invited Diablo over to have sex with Metal Slug while it filmed the action, you'd get Mercenary Kings.You shoot guys, guys drop stuff, you pick up stuff, you use stuff to craft better ways to shoot (and stab) guys, That's about as deep as the gameplay gets, some minor platform-y gameplay but ehh its mostly shooting and grinding craft materials. But its fun. Its not any one of the three games I just mentioned but it takes concepts from all three and mixes them together for a fun, retro-style experience.Also, this game hates any sort of overlays, it would crash on me constantly until I disabled the Steam overlay and the AMD overlay, and so far its worked fine; a lot of people also seem to have more luck running the game in windowed mode, evidently fullscreen causes issues for some people. Can be frustrating if it crashes on you after a mission, before it saves, and that specific thing happened to me A LOT before I turned off the overlays. I still run in fullscreen but that'll be the next troubleshooting step if it keeps screwing up.Lastly, I reallyreally like the music, it's a neat mix of 8/16 bit music and rock.  Might be minor to some, but when a game has a soundtrack that I enjoy enough to listen to on my iPod or whatever, that adds like 20 points to the game in my book. Hooray for the Humble Store letting you download soundtracks like the GOG store does ;)			"

												A fun Co-Op platformer with retro graphics and great music.  Near limitless weapon customization means more ways to stab and shoot things to death than even Borderlands can offer.  Somewhat repetitious level design is no worse than the grind you'll face if you are completionist but no matter your commitment it's worth one solid playthrough at the least. Waff waff!			"

												It certainly looks cool enough (metal slug, anyone?), but just doesn't hold up if you keep playing it.The start is pretty modest. You get some perhaps even above average plot about rescueing a scientist, lots of colorful characters and nice looking animations. The game itself starts out nicely as well. There are crafting materials to gather, people to rescue who can upgrade your stuff and even the reload mechanic is pretty interesting......but then it starts to show that the next missions take place on the same map, using the same enemies on the same locations. Worse: since gathering missions sort of have you search the entire place, going back to that very same map for a different item isn't just not fun but downright tedious. I can but assume there actually ARE more than two maps, but it really doesn't look that way. The enemies respawn a bit too fast as well, btw. As in: way too fast.Then I haven't even talked about locations where you can find C4 to blow up a door which the game practically assumes you know by heart (which, to be fair, is actually the case, since you'll be backtracking so often).So...since I got it in a humble bundle, I can't really complain. But I won't be playing it further. And can't think of anyone who would enjoy playing through to the end. It looks like it has many levels (about ten in the easiest rank, and there are quite some further ranks), but I sort of pity completionists here...			"

												At first glance, Mercenary Kings looks like a classic side scrolling shoot-em-up, a la Metal Slug. This is mostly due to Paul Robertson's (of Scott Pilgrim fame) beautiful pixel art. Though if this is what you're expecting, you may be disappointed. Instead, Mercenary King's hectic action is much more akin to classic Mega Man, requiring precise shooting and platforming. This is augmented with fully customizable weapons, allowing you to build custom killing machines. For example, you can attach a sniper rifle barrel and a submachine gun magazine to a magnum pistol and arm it with enemy-seeking missiles.What starts out as an arcade-style excuse plot rapidly becomes a very compelling story. Including mindless clones, body horror, and a dog in power armor. The game is full of humor without relying too much on it's subtle 80's film and arcade references, and the characters are compelling enough to make you actually worry when they're imperiled.The game can be played solo, but supports up to four player local and online co-op. I set the game up and got a few friends over to blast through the first 20 or so missions, and it's an absolute joy to strategize, team up against bosses, and explore the large and secret-laden maps.Using a Monster Hunter style drop system for the materials to craft your knives, gun parts, and biomods, the game rewards replaying missions. If you get bored of seeing the same enemies and maps multiple times, this may not be a game for you. In classic arcade style, almost every enemy will have 'pallette swaps' that introduce new elemental attacks and strategies.I've put a little over 50 hours into the game already, and I've been having a blast optimising my weapon builds, exploring and memorizing levels, and blowing away CLAW forces.One of your guns is a cat with it's own tiny shotgun.

												As much as I want to recommend this game, I find that I have a very hard time doing so the more I played the game.I picked it up on sale from the Humble Bundle (So, really, it hurts my heart to write a negative review) because it looks a lot like Contra or Metal Slug, and I played both of those until the bitter end. What seperates this game from those is that this game is not fast paced nor run and gun. As much as it tries to paint itself out to be run and gun, it simply isn't. Too often you're forced to stop to jump kill an enemy, or wait for 3 or more cycles of a shield trying to kill you while you try and kill it. A vast majority of the enemies are simply slow moving or didn't move at all. I felt like I was grinding the beginnings of an MMO with no story.Playing this game without a controller is hard and playing full screen hurts my eyes (that's less to do with the game and more the 2D medium.)The pros are the customizablity that comes with the game. It was an unexpected twist to an old classic.Sorry Tribute Games, I'm struggling to get past the first 45 minutes, and I doubt I'll give it the play time to see if it gets better. It might be a slow start situation, but with this kind of game, I almost don't want to find out...			"

												If you are looking at this, buy this game.Seriously, if you have interest enough to be looking at this page, I assure you this game will deliver. It will. It just will.Mercenary Kings is, at its core, a perfect blend of Contra, Metal Slug, and Monster Hunter, all represented with stunningly crafted sprites and an artstyle that is just amazing. The gameplay is satisfying and precise like Contra, from the shooting to the platforming and the controls. On top of that, it has the addictive collecting and crafting of Monster Hunter. You will find yourself unable to stop as you want to collect more items to personalize your character.The personalization is top notch. Weapon customization is absurdly awesome. There are tons of options to mix and match to create a gun that really fits your play-style, and all of them are very well-balanced. You could spend hours just trying out all of the combinations to see what you like best.The game is currently in alpha, but it has a level of polish like no other early access game I've seen. It is fully playable with seemingly no bugs in sight. Its truly astonishing - I really feel they could have called the game finished already, but nevertheless they are still cranking out updates for it, so don't let that ""early access"" label scare you off.All in all, I was pleasantly surprised at just how fun this game was. Playing this game has actually gotten me to say ""Wow, this is fun"" out loud, something that not many games can do. I was hoping for some fun, Contra-styled platforming - and this game did more than deliver.			"

												Great game! First of all I have'nt played metal slug ""don't scream at me"" but I can still relate this game to monster hunter which I have played. The game has amazing audio and the art style is great. I never say ""this music again"" or ""that drone is so annoying"". The concept is nice but the story is meh. You go on missions with various objectives which sometimes can be unclear but don't give up. As you complete missions you advance on to new tiers that unlock new gun parts, knives, and progress you through the story. The best part is creating your own weapons. The wepon parts are divided into 6 parts, reciever, stock, barrel, magazine, sight, and ammo. Also there are different types of weapons like smgs, shotguns, snipers, magnums, and so on and so forth. You can mix and match or you can make a 100% shotgun to craft unique ammo only for shotguns. If you get 100% or over on a weapon type you can craft new ammo for it. And multiplayer too! There is 4 player co-op and it is a ton more fun with friends. Sometimes this game can get rather boring though, as many of the missions are rince and repeat but it keeps me going because I am always looking to improve my gear and unlocking new areas. Over all this game is great and highly recommend this game to anyone who likes platformers.  7/10			"

												Mercenary Kings is a Metal Slug-like with material collection, equipment enhancements, and more specific mission goals other than simply reaching the end of a level and killing a big thing.Once you get past the issue of setting up a proper controller - which can currently be done by remapping the 360 controller to whatever controller you use in Steam's Big Picture Mode then playing the game in that mode, the game feels very finessed in terms of fine character control and movement becomes fairly fluid.The graphics are charming, the gameplay is generally fun, though sometimes it can be a little grindy looking for lots of a somewhat rare item to complete your equipment collections.Overall this game is badass and very much worth the cost.

Being mostly Monster Hunter in almost every aspect of the game, Borderlands because of the variety of guns and funny story/boss moments, and lastly Metal Slug being only the art style NOT GAMEPLAY.Much like Monster Hunter it has: - lots of collectible materials for crafting - sense of exploration (you need to find the boss/enemies/items/materials) - boss fights (you need to know how your adversary's moves) - boss capture feature (I think there was no need to copy this but its not a bad addition :P) - campsite resembles monster hunter village in a practical way even hunting grounds is similar to village farm - food system with buffs - you are better of prepared for a quest at hand - unlock-able progressionIf you think this is like Metal Slug IT IS NOT its far from it this is a exploration platformer.So if you like Monster Hunter you will like this game.A little bit overpriced but if you find a promo its worth it ;)pros: - Storry: rich and unpredictable events - Graphics and art style: verry detailed and funny animations and design - Gameplay: requires skill and timing to avoid enemiescons:  - Low replay value: after you finish the game you can cuntinue to upgrade your weapon but there is no point because there are no more missions - Unscaled multiplayer: all level players join in, meaning that you can randomly join a high level lobby with impossible missions in relation to your level			"

												Okay, I think I have a decent grasp of this game to where I can actually write something about it~ :3This game is amazing if you're a fan of Metal Slug-type platformers.  It has amazing graphics done by the talented Paul Robertson, who did all the graphic art for the Scott Pilgrim videogame, as well as making many entertaining videos featuring his sprite-work.  The whole feel is very retro and it really feels like you are playing an arcade game.  I personally donated to the Kickstarter of this game because I heard that guy was going to be in charge of the graphics team.I'm currently reviewing the build based off of the early access version, so I don't know if some of the issues I've noticed will even make it to the final cut, as this game updates almost every other day.  I've noticed the AI can be really dumb at some parts, but it does not detract from the game, because there have been dumb AI's in almost any game ever made.  This game is one of those games where you can end up spending a lot of time without realizing you just spent a lot of time doing things.Early on you're basically just grinding for parts while learning the game and getting a feel for the controls.  You start out at an early rank, and by completing mission objectives such as gathering x amount of items, hunting x person down, freeing x hostages, or killing a boss, you slowly begin to branch out into the meaty bits of the game.  Now the fun part is as you begin rescuing key people, they get added into your camp and you are allowed to use all those parts you have been gathering to upgrade your character, whether it be their guns, knife, or special perks.  This is where the game detracts from the Metal Slug genre, and into its own special category, as you can mix and match gun parts to create a weapon that you love to use.  Each part usually has a drawback, but they also usually have an advantage too, so it evens out (so no gun combination is really overpowered as far as I can see currently).Instead of finding power-ups like in Metal Slug, you just create your own weapon of choice.I have not tried the multiplayer yet, but it sounds like it could be really fun as long as latency isn't too much of an issue.  The game looks and plays beautifully and it's not even currently out of beta yet.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone that is looking for something different to play.  Especially if you like grinding for parts like in PSO or Sonic Adventure 2, but this time with Metal Slug gameplay.(I also don't recommend this to people who don't have an xbox controller, as the keyboard controls felt really awkward when I was playing it not at home, but it could work)			"

												This game is wonderful. It reminds me of many other games of its kind (Such as Metal Slug, Megaman, and Cave Story) while at the same time being incredibly different. The gun crafting is wonderful because you dont have to pick a gun type and stick with it 24/7 or even pick a set type at all. You can jam the barrel of a sniper rifle onto a shotgun with a pistol stock that ahs the magazine of a minigun. And it might even shoot missiles. Why? Why not. Also you can have a cat as a gun and thats awesome.			"

												Great game! First of all I have'nt played metal slug ""don't scream at me"" but I can still relate this game to monster hunter which I have played. The game has amazing audio and the art style is great. I never say ""this music again"" or ""that drone is so annoying"". The concept is nice but the story is meh. You go on missions with various objectives which sometimes can be unclear but don't give up. As you complete missions you advance on to new tiers that unlock new gun parts, knives, and progress you through the story. The best part is creating your own weapons. The wepon parts are divided into 6 parts, reciever, stock, barrel, magazine, sight, and ammo. Also there are different types of weapons like smgs, shotguns, snipers, magnums, and so on and so forth. You can mix and match or you can make a 100% shotgun to craft unique ammo only for shotguns. If you get 100% or over on a weapon type you can craft new ammo for it. And multiplayer too! There is 4 player co-op and it is a ton more fun with friends. Sometimes this game can get rather boring though, as many of the missions are rince and repeat but it keeps me going because I am always looking to improve my gear and unlocking new areas. Over all this game is great and highly recommend this game to anyone who likes platformers.  7/10			"

												Not a recommendation exactly, but more like my early thoughts on this pre-release game.Art style is like Metal Slug, which is what drew me in initially. However, it plays more like Mega Man. You have a life bar so you don't have to play perfectly, and there's a little more platforming than a Slug game. No insta-death traps or pits, which is nice. It's got that Gears of War reload action bar; can add tension or be a distraction in the heat of the moment. All around, gameplay's pretty solid if not easy to a Mega Man veteran.100 stages is misleading; it's really 100 missions spread over a handful of branching-path areas that are reused. You'll see the same zones multiple times. Good for getting familiar with the terrain, but revisiting the same places gets repetitive.Downed enemies can drop materials that're used for gun/knife/perk crafting. And there's lots of gun parts to craft. Some are interesting, others seem nearly identical stat-wise. Gathering rare mats can kinda suck, but it gives you more to do in-game than just run 'n gun all the time.Both local and online multiplayer available.  Haven't tried either one, but hear it's good.  When picked up, crafting mats are given to everyone (though the resultant item can be different from player-to-player due to individual perks) so no ninja looting required.There are bugs that need squashing. They'll be tweaking and adjusting gameplay/menus/UI. There's a lack of challenge for some.  It's missing a compelling reason to keep playing besides a basic story and unlocking new craftables.  But in an unfinished state, it's not bad and will only get better. Can't fully recommend it yet, nor would I discourage anyone to try it out if they like this style of game.  At the very least, it's worth keeping an eye on for the future.#1 tip: Utilize dat map!!#2 tip: Magazine size affects your gun's power. Big mags, low damage.

												""Borderlands, Contra, and Gears of War had a baby - they called it Mercenary Kings and it's pretty. Now go away, I wanna keep playing it.""Mercenary Kings is hand drawn pixel art at its finest, brought to you by the same folks who rendered the Scott Pilgrim game. The art alone is enough to gawk at, making expert use of animations, sprites, silhouettes and the like. What's important about it, and why it deserves such attention, is because that EVERY pixel was lovingly and knowingly placed to give Mercenary Kings a very distinct look and feel.The plus side is that when you start putting that much effort into every pixel, you start to care about where they're all going - the controls in this game are tight and responsive, especially if you play with a game controller. Layered on top of this are several fun and exhaustive features, including but not limited to active reloading, collectibles, and a unique brand of rocket jumping that involves a minigun.Where Mercenary Kings falls short, however, is in its pacing and length. The game has a lot to offer, A LOT, and one might even argue it has a bit too much. Grinding drops for better gear isn't always a bad thing, but it can get tedious mission after mission during the long campaign of the game. What's more, the formula doesn't change much over its course, so in time the game itself can feel like a grind.However, all in all, this is action gaming done correctly. While the metroidvania genre only recognizes two games, it's important to know that Contra, Megaman, and more added a worthy third style of game to the mix that involves a few more guns - Mercenary Kings is the pinnacle of that.

												I wish I could recommend this game, but I really, really can't.  The controls are sluggish, jumping is floaty and aggravatingly unresponsive, weapons either take too long to kill something or spend too much time reloading, and the entire experience is a slow-moving slog.The underlying issue with this game is that EVERYTHING is designed to take far too long or is intentionally tedious.  There are many missions with mission timers 25 minutes longer or more, with the goal of just scouring each and every room to find weapon parts.  If this sounds like MMO fetch quests, you're right, and these missions are just as grindy, made even worse by the fact that you will do them on maps where you have ALREADY been through the map 4-5 times already.Movement speed?  Way too slow, even with light weapons.  Even the firing mode is lousy, giving you a pathetic 4 firing directions instead of the bog-standard 360-degree joystick- or mouse-based method that has been around for decades now.  The view frame is much too zoomed-in, meaning you frequently can't see where you're going, causing you to blunder into enemies or traps, as well as triggering incredibly excessive amounts of off-screen enemy respawns.  Map layouts range from mediocre to aggravating, with a great many paths hanging just over your head that you can't access unless you walk halfway across the map to a ladder or something.The customizable weapons system SEEMED interesting at first, but it's both poorly balanced and based on grinding out items to get the items to make decent parts.  Machine guns have low damage and high magazines, making dealing with many standard enemies, and especially several bosses that have only limited vulnerability, very tedious.  Shotguns deal huge damage and have low magazines, with their ""balance"" mechanism being semi-auto firing; this means you spend HUGE amounts of time mashing the fire button, which is just plain ridiculous when they could have easily just left the shotguns as full-auto weapons for the simple sake of ENJOYMENT.  On top of that, many of the parts look different, but have minimal performance differences.  And even the bullet types are blocked off by forcing you to have the right level of compatibility with your current weapon parts, so custom weapon diversity is severely curtailed if you ever want to use different ammo types.There are also dozens of missions, but without much actual variety.  Go fetch these crafting items, kill X soldiers in area Y, destroy this thing, and hostage rescue is about it, with maps recycled CONSTANTLY.  There is a severe mission bloat, with you doing the exact same things over and over and over again on the same levels to make the game seem longer/bigger than it is.The perk system is also pretty poor.  Unless you enjoy scouring recycled maps for boss/target locations, you'll just end up slapping up on the perk that puts targets on your map, which, in other games, would be part of the standard game design anyway and you wouldn't need any sort of silly perk to see them.  The roll maneuver is almost entirely useless until you can get a perk to give it invincibility which, again, should've been a completely standard thing anyway.  I could honestly go on, but it would just be redundant.  The artwork looks solid, but the game itself is mediocre and entirely third-rate, suffering from a whole raft of fun-robbing design choices.  Basically, unless you legitimately enjoy grinding out item collection for MMO-esque ""make this weapon that is sliiiightly better than your current one"", skip this game and just get the Metal Slug games.

												Bit clunky but full of personality... it is a game you need to sink your teeth into. It is Metal Slug mixed with the Monster Hunter series so those quirks are there like learning boss patterns and grinding materials to make new weapon upgrades. It takes a bit of time to get used to the games quirks but it is worthwhile to get into if you like spending time learning the nuances. I can't recommend it to everyone but for fans of the ""Hunting Genre"" it might really be up your alley if you like the idea of grinding missions with some friends and constantly upgrading and farming (and you may need a few friends to get through smoothly). It is a fun take on those familiar with this gameplay.			"

I see a lot of complaints about the controls, which I can agree are troublesome with the keyboard, but if you have an Xbox 360 (or equivalent) controller laying around, it'll make your time playing this game much more enjoyable. The missions being timed can be a con for most, but having a 2 year old, it's great. I play a mission or two, parent for a while and come back to it. I may not have that much time invested into this game so far, but it's the one I plan to play a lot more of in the future.			"

												If you like Metal Slug, with it's nice scenarios and many interesting situations, nothing for you here.The game got nice art, good controls.What's the problem? It forces you to repeat the same few levels over and over again, grinding, doing ""different"" missions, with minimal variation. It quickly became a chore, rather than a fun experience. I tryed so much to like it, I wanted it to be good. Made myself play a little more, and the repeated levels just added up. It goes like this: you play the first level once, than the second twice, the third x3...They did the hard parts right and broke it where you least expect. They clearly wanted it to be longer but didn't want to make more levels, so they mixed some casual game mechanics and made us grind.Tryed the multiplayer but it changes nothing. It's a boring repetitive game.			"

												I really wanted to like this game - the pixel art (from Paul Robertson of Scott Pilgrim fame) is excellent, and the game looks like a Metal Slug/Contra type thing. In reality the game is pretty open, dropping you a large map with no guidance where to go. The missions are often fetch quests, leaving you to, completly at random, stumble upon whatever it is you're required to find. The in game map doesn't record where you've been, or where objectives are.Addded to this unfocussed gameplay, is the odd addition of Gears of War style 'active reload', which is just an annoyance, surprisingly bland and forgettable music, and a needlessly complex weapon upgrade system.It all just feels like a bit of a mess, and is simply dull to play. It's a real shame.			"

												When I first played this game I was definitely not a fan, but later I came back to it and really tried to get into it. I play with the keyboard and don't like the controls, they don't feel natural and so I really had to get used to them. The missions are not very challenging more so annoying if anything. You just go around the map and have to collect a certain number of this or kill a certain number of that. The maps themselves are the same ones over and over again, there are maybe three different maps in total. The game gets really repetitive at least for me. One good thing though is that you have a lot of missions, I've played for about 6 hours and still haven't completed all the recruit missions and that is just the start. I really like how you can craft weapons with the materials you pick up, allowing you to make some pretty awesome and overpowered guns. The knives aren't worth buying, they don't give you much more damage than the one you start out with, and you will be using your gun for the majority of the time anyways since there is no limit to bullets, you just have to reload. All in all the game is pretty mediocre, it's pretty fun for the first couple of hours but gets boring quite quickly and I can't help feeling like I could be spending my time playing something more enjoyable.

It is a neat amalgam of arcade-style platforming shmup mixed with level-fiddling RPG.The complaints I have heard say the game gets too repetitive and boring. The time I have already put in more than justifies the purchase in my opinion and I haven't once felt it's been repetitive. More importantly, I think the online co-op works wonderfully. My friend and I have enjoyed playing and strategizing through missions using Steam's voice chat. It works great if you're catching up with a bud and playing some games while at it.			"

												Mercenary Kings is too old school for my taste. It's one of the games I regret buying because I didn't enjoy it in the slightest. The graphics are wonderful, mind you, but the gameplay is like the old action platformers from the 90's, mixed up with some modern features, like crafting and tons of (repetitive) missions. The fact that there are timers in it didn't help either because it forces you to speed things up and in the process get yourself killed. Get yourself killed enough and it's mission over and you have to restart entirely from the beginning. I had no fun playing this and I probably never will, unless they change things up in the future. It's not a bad game per se, but it's just not my taste anymore. If you still like these sorts of games I'm sure you'll have a blast.[Rating: 63/100]			"

												Things I enjoyed: Artwork is fantastic (If you're into pixel graphics), music was engaging, and the bosses were pretty cool. The knife mechanics are interesting, the ability to deflect bullets with your knife certainly makes the game easier. I enjoyed the different load outs I could make with a gun, and the different ammunitions associated with them. I think I'll always love hot hearts.Definitely not Metal Slug, though. Things I didn't enjoy: wanting to build a particular gun, only to realize I need to craft it using materials I have to keep finding throughout the game. In that sense, the grinding gets pretty boring. However, the use of achievements (like speed running the levels) make the grinding arbitrarily less annoying. Personally, the use of a good gun renders the knife not very useful in situations.			"

												Don't touch this game until it's out of beta.The game so far is just a series of fetch and kill quests that have you exploring the same maps over and over again. It's easy to fail a quest for the lack of direction presented and the size of the maps. Some sort of blinking arrow or highlighted zone for the minimap would a huge improvement. But as it is, Mercenary Kings has a long way to go before it will be fun.			"

												To summarize right away; 8/10, it's fun and is beautifully crafted. Defeinitely gets repetitive quickly, though.  Right away this game kinda jumps back to some older gameplay styles, it's highly intuitive. It teaches you some of the base mechanics right away in the intro, but it doesn't really give you the whole bag, it kinda makes you figure the rest out, which I personally enjoyed. There were a lot of ""I can do that?!"" moments throughout gameplay. The platforming works really well, and the controls feel responsive enough. The design is a real eye catch, everything is gorgeous and so lovelingly animated. It's highly reminiscent of Metal Slug in a lot of ways. The actually gameplay feels a lot like MS, and the atmosphere is similar in a lot of ways too. I actually started to pick up a few silly references to MS, and other games similar, including Metal Gear Solid.Boss fights at first were kind of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ though once I got the swing of things, they again became very intuitive and doable. They brought a Monster Hunter feel to it in how you had to track the bosses around the map.Last good note I'm giving is the weapon crafting system. That♥♥♥♥♥♥s fun. Nothing gives a more personal feel to combat when you yourself had to scrounge up the pieces and put together your own weapon. Their are so many different pieces, and it's all together a very nice touch. It could have easily been replaced with weapon drops and no one would have noticed, and that shows the care put into making this.Now onto the negative: It's REALLY ♥♥♥♥ing repetitive. You have set stages per rank of mission and you keep going back to those same maps continuously. This was kind of my deal on Peace Walker, though it wasn't nearly as bad there since the maps cycled more frequently. Here, you end up dealing with the same map per chapter. Last thing I'm gonna mention, I saw a few rags on storyline. I kinda didn't feel like the story was all that important here, given you're a mercenary. The characters all had a bit of personality, and your actions felt like they mattered to the world, so it was good to me. To conclude, 8/10 would recommend. "

												This game is fun. That much is true, but there are parts that of play that are extremely tedious and annoying. Most if not all the missions are some sort of fetch quest that I've got to find something for. Neutralize mission? More like search the entire level fifteen times and you only have 5 minutes to do it and HOLY SH** WHERE IS THAT LAST SNIPER?! The gameplay is fun, cooperative play is fun as heck with friends, but the quests are massively just the same maps with different objectives, and the objectives are all fetch quests. Heck, you even have to search the level to fight the BOSSES.The gun customization is fun to play around with (Trumpet toilet cat guns, as well as stabbing people with plungers) but that's a fetch quest as well. Wanna craft this super-cool looking plasma ultra laser trumpet toilet pewpew gun? Well, go find 30 pieces of diamond, 40 scraps of my leftover sandwich, additional pylons, fireworks, confetti, and a cake. The gameplay itself is cool and all, but you need to find EVERYTHING TO DO ANYTHING. Go blow up this barricade. But first, go out into the jungle to find a random crate with C4 in it. I don't care if you have a full inventory, throw out those insanely overpriced first aid kits and grab A SINGLE UNIT OF EXPLOSIVES. And then go back and grab more explosives, because you can't have more than one at the same time.Ending the rant here and summing it up. Too many fetch quests. I still recommend the game, because it's amazingly fun with friends. But please to god, make more levels and get rid of most of the finding. Having to look for C4 to blow up a wall is pretty reasonable, just don't make me do it over and over and over again.			"

												This is a good game. But I only think I find it to be good because it feels like Metal Slug. Which just might be the only reason why you'll want to buy this. This games is a great nostalgic trip but that's all it really has to offer, besides some gun customization. So if you have never played Metal Slug, it's a great game. But better than this. So I highly recommend this to anyone that has beaten the Metal Slugs and wants another Metal Slug-ish game. But if you haven't played Metal Slug, buy that game first.			"

												The Good:- I grew up playing NES and SNES platformers, and so I truly enjoy seeing this art style popularized again. For what Mercenary Kings offers in terms of gameplay, the art style matches up nicely and makes the game feel cohesive.  - Mercenary Kings offers a plethora of weapon customization options. The abundance of options enticed me to spend hours mixing and matching parts across different weapon categories in order to perfect a gun suited to my specific play style. - Surprisingly, the game has a entertaining story with multiple twists. Mercenary Kings was definitely improved by this because it justified playing through the absurd amount of story missions (112 unique missions in total) in order to reach the conclusion.  The Bad:- I loathed how Mercenary Kings portrayed their women antagonists and protagonists. The overt objectification only served to reflect that the designers are out of touch with where modern audiences are in terms of gender relations.- The mission structures, goals, and levels in Mercenary Kings are extremely repetitive. While the goal might change between missions, you’re frequently placed in the same level to achieve this objective. Additionally, the objectives also lacked diversity - for example, often you’re collecting an object, neutralizing an enemy, or capturing a specific enemy.  Unquestionably, the central problem of Mercenary Kings is quantity over quality. In order to acquire the necessary number of parts to construct banners, ornaments, gun parts, knife parts, and mods you’ll have to grind far too much. Final Verdict:Mercenary Kings looks like a Metal Slug clone (this is actually the reason I bought it without first researching the game), but it is far from that. The gameplay is much slower, and the RPG elements take center stage as opposed to a straightforward shoot ‘em up action adventure. I can’t recommend this game at full price. I purchased this game for 1.00 (humblebundle), and I had fun, but after the first ten to twenty hours it became an endeavor to simply complete the game. However, because of what I paid, I didn’t feel cheated. 6/10.  "

If your a casual player who likes to run around and shoot things I recommend this game. There are many different weapon combinations, skills, customizations, ect so you and your friends can be unique from each other.			"

												In some things this game is good but the cons out weigh the pros . the good stuff is the way it looks and the qurky characters well the game play its ok  needs 360 degree of shooting you olny get up down left right  always got to jump to hit the bosses weak points and to many geathering missions there just boring  and the games a one trick pony the missions are repetive and later on they want you to plat form and thats not the strongest point this game has . theres time liment in mishions  a very out dated concept. also you get a map but you can see where you have been this get to be a pain for hostage missions you will keep checking the same place twice. it feels drawn out the game sould have ended by now and its still going on wont really spoil it but you will see what I mean. theres a lot of guns to mix and mach but most guns feel watered down a lot of the machine guns are slow to relaod and dont have a good bite as far as im concerned you want to know what I used the entire game pistols  but i was playing the reload game all the time . theres a weight system in the game where if you get to many inplants or mods for your gun you move slower and the things in your back pack count towards it . over all a interesting fusion but its not worth the asking price cause the repatition sould be taken in bit size chunks AND WHY OH WHY DO THE BOSSES MOVE! this game I want to like I realy do but its just to unfair and punishing out the gate so im going to do like the bosses and leave this crap behind.

												This game is amazing.I believe the ""small"" amount of positive reviews for this title (75%ish) is because people watch the gameplay video and think: ""This game looks like metal slug, since I like metal slug I'll enjoy this"".Only to realize this game does not play like metal slug at all.I would compare this game with something like Monster Hunter, due to the farming for parts and the timed missions.This game offers a gun customization system that requires enemy/boss drops to craft gun parts and knives. Want to make a machine gun that shoots wall piercing rounds or a pistol that shoots guided missiles that split on contact?Well... you can.The gameplay is really good, movement, jumping and shooting feels really nice. The jump in this game requires some commitment since its hard to change directions once airborne, kinda like classic castlevanias but not that extreme.The Bosses feel good to be taken down and have a nice variety (not counting color swaps), and thats nice since you will probably be fighting them more than a couple of times for its drops.This is an awesome game if you dont expect it to be a metal slug clone. The game is amazing, not as a clone of something but as something new. (that I'm aware of)=			"

The game doesn't start even after several hotfixes given out by users and even the developers!The art and the soundtrack seem beautiful (Robertson's work with Scott Pilgrim is still fresh in my mind.)

												It's not Metal Slug, so let's get that out of the way first. Mercenary Kings (MK) does borrow a lot from SNK's long running series (like rescuing hostages that say ""Thank You!"" after or the general look of the game), but it also borrows ideas from other games, like Metroid, Metal Gear Solid, and Contra. MK is best played through local co-op, at least so far to me. I haven't played it online with other folks, just my girlfriend and so far we're hooked. For a $10 game (on sale), I've squeezed 20 hours of gameplay out of it and we're not even half way done with all of the objectives. We're having a blast playing this -- splitting up on missions to accomplish multiple objectives efficiently or teaming together to take down a nasty boss. It's very fun.The music is really catchy as hell, too. Has that NES/Genesis vibe to it and you'll be humming the songs in this game at work every day because they get stuck in your head. The art direction is really nice, too. If you liked Scott Pilgrim The Game, this is up your alley. Even at full price of $20, MK is worth the admission. If you have a friend to play with, do not think twice about purchasing.			"

Challenging platforming action, hilarious writing, and cartoony graphics are all in this quality package.However, beware the way multiplayer is handled.  Enemies seemed to spawn based on the host player's location, so as a guest in the game, enemies would oftentimes appear out of nowhere or teleport around the area, resulting in free hits.

												Mercenary Kings is a 2D co-op pixel shooter, reminiscent of Contra or, more accurately, Metal Slug. An elite mercenary group conveniently named ""The Kings"" (and suspiciously led by The King, a generically light-skinned and dark-haired Übermensch) is called into action by a vaguely American-looking military to take down a self-styled dictator who has taken over an island paradise -- not the most original setup, but a solid gameplay loop, intuitive mechanics, and a deep crafting system keeps the player engaged, and art by the inimitable Paul Robertson makes every new enemy and locale a beautiful thing to discover (and subsequently destroy).

												Everyone making Metal Slug comparisons and judging it on those grounds went into this with the wrong expectations. Neither the steam page nor any gameplay video, now or prior to its full release, ever promoted this game as being similar to Metal Slug.With that out of the way, let's come out and say what it is: this is Mega Man x Monster Hunter. The controls, level design, enemies, and gameplay are all explicitly cribbed from Mega Man, while the mission design, gear crafting progression, and boss mechanics are lifted from Monster Hunter. You accept a mission, from something as mundane as killing a couple mooks, to hunting two of a particular boss, and you're dropped into the level with the supplies you've brought with you. Certain supplies can be gathered in the field, as can materials, and you traverse the rather sizable level completing your objective, after which you return to base, where you resupply, craft guns, knives, and skills, and select a new mission. Much like Monster Hunter, this game encourages cooperative play, so rev up the online or bring along a friend, or you're quickly going to find yourself frustrated by how long later missions take to complete.If that sounds at all appealing to you, by all means, pick it up. You could easily squeeze at least 20 hours out of it, and it's an excellent couch co-op title.			"

												It's essentially Contra meets Borderlands.  You have tons of gun, ammo, and melee weapon options, and if you mix and match gun parts properly, you can fire special ammunition from your weapons.  Highly enjoyable as a co-op game, but not terrible as a single-player experience.  Some levels can be a pain to navigate if you're not geared exactly right, but that's part of the learning experience I guess. "

												I want to start by saying I really tried to love this game. The problem here is that on most setups, the game is unplayable.Even after you shell 20 dollars of your hard earned paycheck (Hurts more if you work part time.) The game doesn't start even after several hotfixes given out by users and even the developers!The art and the soundtrack seem beautiful (Robertson's work with Scott Pilgrim is still fresh in my mind.) However the I can't speak of anything else because I paid more than I should have for a game that clearly isn't ready for distribution much less an open beta.This has potential but for now, I'd stay away. A shame really.			"

												It's not Metal Slug, so let's get that out of the way first. Mercenary Kings (MK) does borrow a lot from SNK's long running series (like rescuing hostages that say ""Thank You!"" after or the general look of the game), but it also borrows ideas from other games, like Metroid, Metal Gear Solid, and Contra. MK is best played through local co-op, at least so far to me. I haven't played it online with other folks, just my girlfriend and so far we're hooked. For a $10 game (on sale), I've squeezed 20 hours of gameplay out of it and we're not even half way done with all of the objectives. We're having a blast playing this -- splitting up on missions to accomplish multiple objectives efficiently or teaming together to take down a nasty boss. It's very fun.The music is really catchy as hell, too. Has that NES/Genesis vibe to it and you'll be humming the songs in this game at work every day because they get stuck in your head. The art direction is really nice, too. If you liked Scott Pilgrim The Game, this is up your alley. Even at full price of $20, MK is worth the admission. If you have a friend to play with, do not think twice about purchasing.			"

												The animations and soundtrack is all nice, but the game itself is both repetitive and unnecessarily complicated. The controls are a bit annoying, you replay the same stages over and over again (different goals, but still nothing new), you have a time limit on the levels and on top of that you have to collect materials to be able to craft/buy powerups of all different kinds. Now powerups are fine, but there's too many and it gets boring and complicated.I just wanted a nice platformer to have some fun, but this is a tedious grinder of a game.			"

												Not really as run-and-gun as Metal Slug. Merc Kings is all about grinding and completion. The difficulty picks up around 40 missions in (roughly 10+ hours or so), then you start to see how the reload mechanic contributes to gun balancing. If you're lucky enough to play with four players at once, the team power and gun variety is really neat. Solo play is just a pure grind.			"

												I had a fun time beating it, but I'm disappointed that I never got to use most of the weapons.  The only way to obtain the resources is by replaying certain levels, and that can get very boring.  And since I've already won, what's the point?  The game ought to have more that one way to obtain certain critical materials, or it should have difficult end levels that would justify some resource grinding.  The good (boss fights) outweighs the bad.PS- I notice a fair amount of reviewers calling the game difficult, but those ones are wrong.  I'm guessing that the option to grind for tons of gear draws in the wrong type of people, i.e. RPG fans with no action skills.  Don't be one of those.			"

												this game is amazing. played it co-op. the last couple bosses are super-hard, though.the weapon system can be hard to understand. sometimes, the effects of a weapon are not explained, and you will not discover them until you equip them. or sometimes you need a combination of parts to get an effect, even though nothing on-screen tells you this; you discover it on accident. or never do, and get disappointed that you can't seem to make an automatic weapon even though the weapon description says it's automatic.still, despite my paragraph of rambling, this is a small complaint. the game is HUGE fun; getting new weapon parts is exciting; killing bosses is rewarding; the music and graphics are great.don't be turned off after you realize you've been playing different parts of the same map for 10 missions now. you get a new map every time you advance in rank. the maps get HUGE and complicated and intricate. it's possible the designers baby new players a little too long, worried a big map would be too scary. but it's only a LITTLE too long :)			"

												3/10I absolutely love Metal Slug. This game is no Metal Slug. Despite the similar art style and gameplay, the game comes nowhere close to achieving what it wants to. Yes, there are countless levels to play. However, you will find by the fourth level you have already played all the game has to offer. They continually put you into the same couple levels and just mix up the objectives. The enemies, scenery, and everything else stay exactly the same. If they had designed 6-7 very unique and long levels like an actual Metal Slug game it would have been much better. As it stands now, $20 is a huge asking price for such a shallow experience. If it were $10 I would say consider it, but $20 is way too much. I regret this purchase.			"

												The Good:- I grew up playing NES and SNES platformers, and so I truly enjoy seeing this art style popularized again. For what Mercenary Kings offers in terms of gameplay, the art style matches up nicely and makes the game feel cohesive.  - Mercenary Kings offers a plethora of weapon customization options. The abundance of options enticed me to spend hours mixing and matching parts across different weapon categories in order to perfect a gun suited to my specific play style. - Surprisingly, the game has a entertaining story with multiple twists. Mercenary Kings was definitely improved by this because it justified playing through the absurd amount of story missions (112 unique missions in total) in order to reach the conclusion.  The Bad:- I loathed how Mercenary Kings portrayed their women antagonists and protagonists. The overt objectification only served to reflect that the designers are out of touch with where modern audiences are in terms of gender relations.- The mission structures, goals, and levels in Mercenary Kings are extremely repetitive. While the goal might change between missions, you’re frequently placed in the same level to achieve this objective. Additionally, the objectives also lacked diversity - for example, often you’re collecting an object, neutralizing an enemy, or capturing a specific enemy.  Unquestionably, the central problem of Mercenary Kings is quantity over quality. In order to acquire the necessary number of parts to construct banners, ornaments, gun parts, knife parts, and mods you’ll have to grind far too much. Final Verdict:Mercenary Kings looks like a Metal Slug clone (this is actually the reason I bought it without first researching the game), but it is far from that. The gameplay is much slower, and the RPG elements take center stage as opposed to a straightforward shoot ‘em up action adventure. I can’t recommend this game at full price. I purchased this game for 1.00 (humblebundle), and I had fun, but after the first ten to twenty hours it became an endeavor to simply complete the game. However, because of what I paid, I didn’t feel cheated. 6/10.  "

												This game is amazing.I believe the ""small"" amount of positive reviews for this title (75%ish) is because people watch the gameplay video and think: ""This game looks like metal slug, since I like metal slug I'll enjoy this"".Only to realize this game does not play like metal slug at all.I would compare this game with something like Monster Hunter, due to the farming for parts and the timed missions.This game offers a gun customization system that requires enemy/boss drops to craft gun parts and knives. Want to make a machine gun that shoots wall piercing rounds or a pistol that shoots guided missiles that split on contact?Well... you can.The gameplay is really good, movement, jumping and shooting feels really nice. The jump in this game requires some commitment since its hard to change directions once airborne, kinda like classic castlevanias but not that extreme.The Bosses feel good to be taken down and have a nice variety (not counting color swaps), and thats nice since you will probably be fighting them more than a couple of times for its drops.This is an awesome game if you dont expect it to be a metal slug clone. The game is amazing, not as a clone of something but as something new. (that I'm aware of)=			"

												To summarize right away; 8/10, it's fun and is beautifully crafted. Defeinitely gets repetitive quickly, though.  Right away this game kinda jumps back to some older gameplay styles, it's highly intuitive. It teaches you some of the base mechanics right away in the intro, but it doesn't really give you the whole bag, it kinda makes you figure the rest out, which I personally enjoyed. There were a lot of ""I can do that?!"" moments throughout gameplay. The platforming works really well, and the controls feel responsive enough. The design is a real eye catch, everything is gorgeous and so lovelingly animated. It's highly reminiscent of Metal Slug in a lot of ways. The actually gameplay feels a lot like MS, and the atmosphere is similar in a lot of ways too. I actually started to pick up a few silly references to MS, and other games similar, including Metal Gear Solid.Boss fights at first were kind of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ though once I got the swing of things, they again became very intuitive and doable. They brought a Monster Hunter feel to it in how you had to track the bosses around the map.Last good note I'm giving is the weapon crafting system. That♥♥♥♥♥♥s fun. Nothing gives a more personal feel to combat when you yourself had to scrounge up the pieces and put together your own weapon. Their are so many different pieces, and it's all together a very nice touch. It could have easily been replaced with weapon drops and no one would have noticed, and that shows the care put into making this.Now onto the negative: It's REALLY ♥♥♥♥ing repetitive. You have set stages per rank of mission and you keep going back to those same maps continuously. This was kind of my deal on Peace Walker, though it wasn't nearly as bad there since the maps cycled more frequently. Here, you end up dealing with the same map per chapter. Last thing I'm gonna mention, I saw a few rags on storyline. I kinda didn't feel like the story was all that important here, given you're a mercenary. The characters all had a bit of personality, and your actions felt like they mattered to the world, so it was good to me. To conclude, 8/10 would recommend. "

												Kind of a mixed bag.. the shooting mechanics are fun and very accurate, and the weapon customization is great, but the actual level structure is very repetetive and it can be confusing to figure out where in the maze-like levels you need to go to find your objectives.  Still fun though, and hunting down the enemy whose rare drop you need to make your next upgrade does help dimnish the mze-running feel.			"

												Played through the game beginning to end 2-player.  Can safely say it is a great multiplayer game with some actual balance between all the kinds of guns you can make.  Challenging platforming action, hilarious writing, and cartoony graphics are all in this quality package.However, beware the way multiplayer is handled.  Enemies seemed to spawn based on the host player's location, so as a guest in the game, enemies would oftentimes appear out of nowhere or teleport around the area, resulting in free hits.  Still worth it.			"

												The Good:- I grew up playing NES and SNES platformers, and so I truly enjoy seeing this art style popularized again. For what Mercenary Kings offers in terms of gameplay, the art style matches up nicely and makes the game feel cohesive.  - Mercenary Kings offers a plethora of weapon customization options. The abundance of options enticed me to spend hours mixing and matching parts across different weapon categories in order to perfect a gun suited to my specific play style. - Surprisingly, the game has a entertaining story with multiple twists. Mercenary Kings was definitely improved by this because it justified playing through the absurd amount of story missions (112 unique missions in total) in order to reach the conclusion.  The Bad:- I loathed how Mercenary Kings portrayed their women antagonists and protagonists. The overt objectification only served to reflect that the designers are out of touch with where modern audiences are in terms of gender relations.- The mission structures, goals, and levels in Mercenary Kings are extremely repetitive. While the goal might change between missions, you’re frequently placed in the same level to achieve this objective. Additionally, the objectives also lacked diversity - for example, often you’re collecting an object, neutralizing an enemy, or capturing a specific enemy.  Unquestionably, the central problem of Mercenary Kings is quantity over quality. In order to acquire the necessary number of parts to construct banners, ornaments, gun parts, knife parts, and mods you’ll have to grind far too much. Final Verdict:Mercenary Kings looks like a Metal Slug clone (this is actually the reason I bought it without first researching the game), but it is far from that. The gameplay is much slower, and the RPG elements take center stage as opposed to a straightforward shoot ‘em up action adventure. I can’t recommend this game at full price. I purchased this game for 1.00 (humblebundle), and I had fun, but after the first ten to twenty hours it became an endeavor to simply complete the game. However, because of what I paid, I didn’t feel cheated. 6/10.  "

												now that the game's finally out i can make another 1-sentence summary of it instead of actually reviewing it (but nah I feel like this game deserves some unbiased nitpicking instead of me ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on it and leaving)it's a game that really wanted to be contra mixed with monster hunter. It feels like the developers played and loved MH, but in the end didn't truly know why the features in MH made it what it is.When the kickstarter first went up one of the big things I laughed at was the fact that they wrote ""add in a little monster hunter and you got our game"" or something like that when describing the features. Now that the game's out, it's not immediately apparent, but it's true. Most criticizable aspects of the game stem from the fact that it wants to emulate Monster Hunter.The missions are stale, primarily because they use the exact same 3 modes that MH has: kill X small enemies, gather X items on the field, or kill X boss monster. Rarely, the game will also have ""talk to this NPC"" quests also but that's negligible since they're just preludes to one of the other types of missions. They're meant to introduce the level by having you navigate it for specific area.Additionally, upgrades and bonuses are gained through the same general ""luck of the drop"" system Monster Hunter is both rewarded and criticized for. This system is in place in Monster Hunter because the monster duels are not only fun but also dangerous enough to make players want to play it safe and stick to familiar tactics at first. Repeating the boss a couple times for certain drops, or changing weapon or strategy to try to get a drop that doesn't match your playstyle, are ways of making Monster Hunter more enjoyable. You get to see how the monsters are designed to act differently in different situations, plus with the tight combat already in place, it's a thrill either way.That's not in Mercenary Kings. in MK, you dodge the same 3-5 attacks over and over, shoot the weak point (usually the back) of a boss, and eventually it goes down or is left open to capture. These nuances are found in MH as well, but aren't put there for the same reason. The lack of health bars in Monster Hunter is to encourage awareness in the player. They want you to look for signs of weakness, signs of battle damage in the creature you're hunting. a health bar would ruin the point of that. In Merc Kings, the enemy constantly flashes bright red when they're injured enough to be captured, so with zero subtlety, it just says you're 2/3rds done already.Monster drops in MH were to indicate playstyle in a way. You could only get the tail of a monster if you were attacking its back. You could only get the horns if you actually were able to smash the horns off with a kill, or if you could capture it with the horns perfectly intact still (meaning no face hits). MK is just pure percentile chance rewarding you for the kill.I don't HATE the game, because I still enjoy the simplistic gameplay and item grinding to some extent, but I think it's fine to like a game while also knowing it's full of developer mistakes.For $10 I think it's a perfectly dandy 2D platformer monster hunter knockoff with full online co-op.

												Game would be great, if not for the horrible spawning and despawning. Enemies spawn exactly where they were previously, and for a lot of reasons that makes the game unentertaining and to be frank a bit routine. Also enemies that flee do so until they despawn about 5 meters from where they started.A better idea for the game would have been to set a certain number of creatures per level, and have them move freely around. Write scripts for aggressive enemies allowing them to hunt you with a certain range. Every enemy killed should drop a item (or maybe you'd have to kill a group to get something). Basically take the tried and true method from monster hunter - you hunt things, they hunt you, the victor gets some spoils. But none of this spawn farming (which admittadly happens in normal monster hunter).			"

												Short Version Below, just skip to PROs and CONs:I picked this little gem up when it went on sale. I figured ""Hey, it looks like fun, it's multiplayer, and it looks similar to Metal Slug"" In some regards it is, but in others, it's a whole other beast. First, I'll draw the similarities.When you first start up Mercenary Kings, you'll notice, ""Hey, this plays a lot like Metal Slug"" (if you're familiar with the series). Controls are a little strange at first, though I'd recommend changing them, but once you get down to the nitty-gritty stabby-shooty, you don't seem to notice as much. There's the familiar, arcade-style run-and-gun type gameplay that you'd expect from the screenshots, but what really makes this game unique is the differences from which the game breaks the stereotype.The crafting system is extensive that sometimes it can be overwhelming, but if you're the type that loves to tinker around and figure out what works best (which varies, depending on the mission), or if you fancy yourself a virtual gunsmith, then you will love this crafting system. A few RPG elements are added in that there are a few stats to keep in balance as you prepare for each mission, but other than that, there's not too much else to the game. I do, however, really like the way multiplayer (both local, on one machine, or over the Internet) is handled. From the in-game base camp, players can join their friends or find other players online and team up to accomplish missions seamlessly (think drop-in/drop-out style, but only for this one area).In short:PROS:Excellent and fun selection of weaponsFamiliar gameplay style feels freshSeamless multiplayer matchmaking - You can find a team rather quickly, and if they leave you, there's no penalties to you. (A big bonus!)Lots of pew pew pewCONS:Controls can be a bit awkward at first. I felt like a noob who never played arcade games beforeCrafting system can be a mite overwhelming for players who just want to jump into the gameMissions can be repetitive if you're grinding for crafting materialsOverall, I highly recommend this game, it was worth every penny.

												My unfortunate first negative review on steam.  Bought this game with the intentions of playing with a friend, but even from the get-go (And all the way up till the end boss) I had nagging issues that continued to hamper my experience with the game.The foremost offender is the incredibly awkward controlling.  Characters react based on how heavy their weapons are, but even with light equipment, jumps can be incredibly pixel percise with a slow reaction to pressing the jump button.   This becomes incredibly annoying on bosses that rush from side to side on the screen, and you think you press the button early enough only to have the wind up time keep you from clearing your foe.  Aiming can also be an issue when trying to shoot smaller enemies that move through the air (Not to mention chase you after the camera changes and moves them off screen), theres no way to shoot diagonally which means you'll have to constantly run under vertical enemies to hit them or lead them into your shots.As you get further in, you notice that the mission strcutres all fall into the same few catagories:  Find stuff or kill/capture stuff.  It becomes more tedious in the latter half of the game as the levels expand, leaving you and your friend(s) to traverse large boring structures with occasionally respawning enemies that even with high health and defense items, can still tear away large portions of your health.  And with limited carrying space for items, trying to heal in our outside the hospital zones can be incredibly tedious as there's no ingame way to speed up the hospital healing process.  I suppose thats why most missions have extra long times (Anywhere between 15-30 minutes usually), but it just bogs down the experience.  The bosses are far to repetitive too, having to face the same lot multiple times across the games ranked missions and an occaisonal unique boss at the end of most ranks.The weapon crafting is an excercise in patience, having to always constantly change out one gun trait for another, taking time in order to get anywhere close to a satisfying weapon.  More so, since the crafting system relies on the materials you find in the stage, you may be forced to run back into earlier levels and hope that enemies respawn AND drop the items you're looking for.If I'm pressed to say anything positive about it, the presentation has a nice psuedo-Metal Slug/SNK feel thats still unique enough to be a full rip off, and the music often catchy.  But thats not enough to get a recommendation here, its just not fleshed out enough to be fun either by yourself or with friends.			"

												This is a great game that unfortunately falls into the curse of ""gets good a couple hours in"". It takes a while for the mission structure and crafting to click, and not all the missions are super well designed; map checking is often required (but easy), and the map is useless for a couple of off-beat missions.The real meat of the game is building and customizing gun parts, but unfortunately since this requires materials, you can't jump right into making a gun, you have to play the first few levels, which are basically tutorials. And even once you can make a few gun parts, the guns don't get really fun until you start adding elements and special bullet types (freezing bullets, shotguns, bouncing bullets, homing missiles that pierce walls!) I feel the game would have been much better received if this were explained better and you got some materials to play with out of the starting gate instead of having to use the starter pistol for a few levels.This is, however, a great chill-out game, and if you enjoy grinding materials and crafting there's plenty of that to do. People call it Monster Hunter crossed with Metal Slug, but the gameplay is a bit more like Mega Man (with a single, customized gun rather than switchable energy-based weapons). Bosses roam certain maps sort of like Monster Hunter, though the crafting and mission structure are really where the Monster Hunter influence shows. Unlike Metal Slug you have health so you don't die in one hit, but health is still a fairly precious resource.The gameplay is surprisingly deep; gun weight affects how high you jump and how fast you move, you have consider how all of your gun's parts sum up into a good (or awful) weapon, and there's a bit of inventory management as you can only carry a couple healing/progression enabling items (but you can call for a couple more items mid-level).Co op gameplay is great--all players get all resources collected, so there's no fighting over drops. This also means playing online with randoms isn't quite as annoying as say Borderlands 2, because no one can swipe your rare drops.			"

												Mercenary Kings is a bad game, it has terrible and awkward controls (even after remapping them) and suffers from very bad gameplay. The main point of the game is to fire your weapon, but wait you cannot fire your weapon up or down while moving nor can you fire diagonally. The enemies also respawn once they leave your screen which is really annoying when you're trying to explore the map. When you die, you don't respawn near your death location instead you're teleported back to the last respawn tent you passed and you have to fight your way back through all the enemies that respawned. Lastly, the game becomes extremely boring and grindy due to the level/rank progression system which forces you to repeat levels over and over until you are able to unlock the next rank's missions.

												Mercenary Kings is not Metal Slug. You will not be fighting your way through the level to get from one side of the map to the other. There are no boss fights (that I've come across). You do not pick up weapon drops. You collect materials to take back to your base to unlock new weapon parts. If you think enemies are bullet sponges, then maybe you are using a weak weapon. You do not lose lives until you get game over. Losing all your health will restart you from the continue point, minus first aid costs from the mission reward. You fail the mission if you run out of time, or you spend all the reward on first aid (lives). If you are playing this game with an xbox360 controller then you will have a bad time (no wonder you think the controls are bad). The controls themselves are weird though (says me who can't stand wasd), but you can remap the keyboard to something playable. Mercenary Kings greatest downfall is that it is on pc rather than vita or 3ds.			"

												Here is my Mercenaray Kings Review in 30Seconds


YouTube™ Video: Mercenary Kings Review in 30 Seconds 

			Views: 1,154		

			You want this game? You can have a key to unlock it. For free. Just confirm your entry and you might win it… Or not. It’s like the lottery, only more attainable. From the good guys at Tribute.		

When you base your game’s aesthetics on Metal Slug, it’s easy to make a good looking game. What’s harder is to give it a twist that makes it a game of it’s own. In Mercenary Kings you craft weapons, armor and mods with loot you pick off of enemies. This is not just for giggles though, the game is hard and you need to craft your own chance at winning.Playing as a team of up to four is a lot of fun, but the scenery is repetitive and even annoying when you are trying to kill a boss and he runs off into another part of the map.Awesome art and funny dialogue in a somewhat monotonous gameplay. But it is still in development, so it has a lot of potential.7 slugs out of 10.			"

												This is a great game that unfortunately falls into the curse of ""gets good a couple hours in"". It takes a while for the mission structure and crafting to click, and not all the missions are super well designed; map checking is often required (but easy), and the map is useless for a couple of off-beat missions.The real meat of the game is building and customizing gun parts, but unfortunately since this requires materials, you can't jump right into making a gun, you have to play the first few levels, which are basically tutorials. And even once you can make a few gun parts, the guns don't get really fun until you start adding elements and special bullet types (freezing bullets, shotguns, bouncing bullets, homing missiles that pierce walls!) I feel the game would have been much better received if this were explained better and you got some materials to play with out of the starting gate instead of having to use the starter pistol for a few levels.This is, however, a great chill-out game, and if you enjoy grinding materials and crafting there's plenty of that to do. People call it Monster Hunter crossed with Metal Slug, but the gameplay is a bit more like Mega Man (with a single, customized gun rather than switchable energy-based weapons). Bosses roam certain maps sort of like Monster Hunter, though the crafting and mission structure are really where the Monster Hunter influence shows. Unlike Metal Slug you have health so you don't die in one hit, but health is still a fairly precious resource.The gameplay is surprisingly deep; gun weight affects how high you jump and how fast you move, you have consider how all of your gun's parts sum up into a good (or awful) weapon, and there's a bit of inventory management as you can only carry a couple healing/progression enabling items (but you can call for a couple more items mid-level).Co op gameplay is great--all players get all resources collected, so there's no fighting over drops. This also means playing online with randoms isn't quite as annoying as say Borderlands 2, because no one can swipe your rare drops.			"

												Extremely clunky to play and annoying mechanics. I like the style of the game and how its somewhat similar to metal slug but because of its controls and boring gameplay, I probably won't pick this up again.The reload mechanic is interesting but it becomes a chore. The enemies are also not very fun to go against and the gameplay feels slow and repetitive because of it.			"

												Mercenary Kings is not Metal Slug. You will not be fighting your way through the level to get from one side of the map to the other. There are no boss fights (that I've come across). You do not pick up weapon drops. You collect materials to take back to your base to unlock new weapon parts. If you think enemies are bullet sponges, then maybe you are using a weak weapon. You do not lose lives until you get game over. Losing all your health will restart you from the continue point, minus first aid costs from the mission reward. You fail the mission if you run out of time, or you spend all the reward on first aid (lives). If you are playing this game with an xbox360 controller then you will have a bad time (no wonder you think the controls are bad). The controls themselves are weird though (says me who can't stand wasd), but you can remap the keyboard to something playable. Mercenary Kings greatest downfall is that it is on pc rather than vita or 3ds.			"

												This is a 2d Platform Indie Arcade Side Scrolling Shoot 'm UpSoldiers.... MOVE OUT !!!!Background Info:-----------------------Genre: Action / PlatformerMode: Single-player / Local Co-opRelease date: 25 Mar, 2014Personal Info:--------------------These are the game I really like.Just basic 2d platform games with co-op function.I played the game like a crazy addicted person hours after hours.Founded the game in sale for a very nice price.Still little bit to expensive what I usual spend on these games.Never had any regret from it.Only thing I found can be annoying is that when you play alone you will have the same mission.So if you play with more players game wil go much and much faster.And you will need it because some mission are very boring after some while.About the game:-----------------------------------You play 1 of the 2 soldiers to beat the evil scientist and his evil plans.Just basic story you would espect with a game like this.Personally I love this basic story's.You will and need to collect items to level yourself and making new weapons to use.After a mission you complete you will get the money to buy an restock your items.Controls:------------Game play's very well and like a lot of indie game easy to pick up for everybody.Please use a xbox 360 controller that makes playing the game much better and more fun.I can not tell if other controller will be 100% supported.Weapons:--------------Weapons is what this games makes it totally wurth buying.You can unlock and buy new parts and make the game how you like it.So you can totally custom the weapon and makes it extra fun to collect parts and money.Enemies:-------------You have couple type of enemies the most are very easy to kill.Some will need more shots or a special way to beat them.And they will give you great challange in some stages.Multiplayer:----------------This game support offline and online option for this.I prefure the online version because offline you work with split screen.Sometimes this can be very annoying when playing with 4 players.Or just play the game on a big 40inch screen if possible.Online works with just opening your channel and you can be dropped in a game.Or people can be dropped in your game... I did not find a option to control this.Maby they made this better in the future ?? I hope so... Finally:--------- Fun Game, Online Co-op, If cheap give it a try !!I give it a 7/10 score.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I made the stupid mistake of buying this thinking that it would turn out to be good only to find out that it isn't even acceptable. The only thing good about this game is the artwork by Paul Robertson who animated for Scott Pilgrim vs. the Universe and Adult Swim bumps other than that the game mechanics and gameplay are absolutely terrible.It is worse than your typical game at Newgrounds and it tries way to hard to be a Metal Slug ripoff with so many Metal Slug easter eggs and references to it that it doesn't even emulate anything close a platform shooter.The controls are terrible and I spent about 1-2 hours trying to use JoyPad to play this game only to find out that it was made by people who never played a single video game in their lives not even the classic ones such as Metal Slug or Contra.The gameplay has unnecessary controls and features,the first level was confusing and terrible,the music is generic as hell,the voice acting is really awkward and has catch-phrases every time you reload,the enemies respawn every single time you go offscreen and are completely static and pathetic. The fact that if you come into direct contact with anything including the harmless foxes,rabbits and moles causes direct damage to your HP for no reason.I even livestreamed this game only to get massively dissappointed with the game company and I feel sorry that the artist not only wasted his talent and time on this garbage of a game. I am sticking with the game classics thank you at least I know they are available for free and already have a history at making successful games.Livestream:

												I don't understand all the negative reviews. Are you comparing it too much to Metal Slug? Because it's quite different, and you're going to be disappointed if you think that's what this game is trying to be.It's really quite fun though. The weapon crafting is really cool and will make you want to keep playing. The missions are pretty repetitive, but that's alright, because the combat and feel of the game is up to par. Honestly there isn't much to say; it's a fun, side-scrolling shoot 'em up. Try it out :)			"

												What cut the game short for me was pretty simple. I thought it would be a very Metal Slug-esque game. But it having contact damage on enemies, so they don't actually have to hit you to do damage pretty much ruined it for me.Granted, I can't recall if it says it tries to be like Metal Slug... but it's how I recall seeing it. So it can be entierly on my side.Can be a silly complaint. I don't mind it on the melee enemies, but it just took me out of it to die by landing on a enemy sniper.If you don't mind that type of gameplay, this game seems to have quite a lot going for it. Controls are pretty okay, and mission options are decent. But yeah, I just totally flopped on the game with the contact damage. Otherwise it seems pretty solid. But it is doing a bit much out of what it needs to. There's a lot to nitpick on, but also a lot to enjoy. But to me, the ""meh"" outweighed the good.""On times like these I wouldn't mind if there was a ""maybe"" option on the recomend box.			"

												Think Metal Slug, but annoying.The essential is here but a lot of problems become obvious very quickly : Every enemy you kill respawns as soon as his corpse gets off screen ; The controls are not on point, there's always a delay between the press of a button and the action, cant shoot up while moving... ; Missions of a same rank all take place on the same map, gets repetitive real fast.So there is still some fun to be had if you really enjoy the genre but a simple question comes up : Why play this when there is so much better ?

												Its a very fun side scroller with a large focus on its weapon crafting system.  While the beginning of the game and overall pace is a bit slow, the game  becomes very fun after you have created your first weapon.  The fact that you often replay the same environments with different objectives may become very repetitive to some especially given the length of the game.  It can come off as difficult to some depending on their previous background with games of similar fashion but overally the difficulty rises gradually although trading waves of enemies for respawning enemies who patrol their areas.

												Mercenary Kings is a style over substance game in my heart. Borrowing heavily on the Metal Slug formula, the gameplay has been updated to current ""standards"": added replay value, massive crafting system, customization or sidequests just to name a few. If those are not inherently bad, they are not well suited to an arcade-y scrolling shooter.If blasting through ennemy legions is your thing, be prepared to spend most of your time gathering materials by doing the same missions over and over again in order to get better weapons or equipment, some of which are not luxury items or hoarders' prizes but much needed firepower. Completionists will cry tears of blood.I would rather have had a two to three hours fun ride than having to grind my way through the game. If I end up recommending the game it's mostly due to Paul Robertson's amazing pixel art animations and the fact that the game is well designed. There is variety and fun in this game, too bad it's forced down your throat until you're full.			"

I played during 35 hours and I want them back principaly because I was so stupid I keep playing doing the exact same thing / objectives / levels / farm like a retard to buy knives or guns to get the achievements.Your character will not make any progress in this game. The weapons are weak, the controls are heavy boring and lazy and you will find yourself dizzy after doing the final boss 75 times to get enough money and adamantite to buy everything in this game.If you're an achievement hunter please stay away from this game, it's not worth the time you will pass on it and it's not worth your money neither.Can be a good catch on a 5dollars bundle if you have a friend to play with you but the actual price is way to high considering the fact that you will play the same 5 levels over and over and over again.Grade : D | What a piece of crap.

												The only thing good about this game is the art.     Boring repetitive game play traversing the same map over and over for multiple missions killing the same enemies that reappear in the same spots. A crafting system that doesn't give much of an opportunity to experiment or preview weapon builds before spending your resources and too many stats to compare, very little incentive to really use different types of weapons or ammunition when caustic bullets pretty much handle everything. Reload mechanic is frustrating and disrupts the flow of the game, game does not pause when your viewing the map leaving you vulnerable to the reappearing enemies that may lurk off screen. Retrieving items from your backpack is slow and also disrupts game play you should really be able to toggle through items with a single button click rather than having to hold down a button then navigating a menu and then select your item, you also have go through your backpack to get the walkie talkie out just to call someone so you can leave a mission so many clicks for such a simple thing.    I wanted to like this game but I just couldn't get over the frustrating gameplay mechanics. The comparisons to Metal Slug make no sense this is nothing like Metal Slug not even close, If you wanna play a fast pace action platformer play Metal Slug if you want something slow, repetitive, and grindy play this game.

												If you are a fan of having fun, this the game for you. Whether solo or co-op, this game hits on all cylinders and keeps you wanting more and more until its 4 A.M. and you have to go to work in a couple of hours. The pixel art will leave you breathless (Same guys who did Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World: The Game, if you're familliar!), and is very reminiscent of the Metal Slug series, in more ways than one. The controls are airtight and if you keep dying over and over,  you have no one to blame but yourself, and the jerk who put you down.The co-op is fantastic, and makes the game so much more enjoyable and lessens the burden of some of the more punishing levels, so if you have a friend to play with, do so!The gun part collecting is where the game truly shines though, every little mod added or taken away can either turn that ordinary shotgun into a fire breathing dragon, or break it so even your knives seem like a more viable option. (Sometimes, they are!) Do yourself a favor, pick up this platforming shooter today, and take the fight to CLAW. They need to be taken down. MOVE OUT! "

												Okay. Now to be honest, I haven't gone through the entire game as yet. But I figure that I've logged in enough game time on it to give some first impressions.Admittedly, what initially drew me to this game was the design itself. It was like Contra meets Scott Pilgrim-- similarly designed sprites, chiptune music and such... so it was something of a guilty pleasure.As a run-and-gun game, there's nothing TOO exceptional about it. The levels are fairly linear, even though there are plenty of nooks and crannies to explore. The story line is okay, though the characters are amusing enough that the plot doesn't plod on.The real challenge lies in trying to master the levels. Not just in the speed-runs, but also with the secret objectives. Things to help you earn the extra scratch and materials to forge new items to not only make the missions more interesting, but to also unlock hidden perks to get through some of the harder missions. Missions are basic in nature, but can vary in difficulty due to time constraints and game AI. And the game AI is basic enough to make taking enemies out both easy and frustrating at the same time. There's also the reload feature, which can boost damage, but requires you to pay enough attention to be a distraction at times.All in all, this is still a fun little run-and-gun, and definitely worth the look when it goes on sale.

												Getting players to play online with is rather challenging, sometimes all are wayting for just one to start a mission while he is afk or a rookie is acsidentelly pulled into a advanced mission beyond his level. It also takes time though to figure out the weapon upgrade system but the game is super fun and addictive once you get the hang of it. Bosses with own patterns are fun and the graphic is pure eyecandy for pixel art fans. The designs are lovable and the story is at most time great, i just dont like Barons faith being done too sketchy. Very well thought and each level gets more challenging. Definitely worth the purchace :D And it got PUPPIES!!!			"

												Okay. Now to be honest, I haven't gone through the entire game as yet. But I figure that I've logged in enough game time on it to give some first impressions.Admittedly, what initially drew me to this game was the design itself. It was like Contra meets Scott Pilgrim-- similarly designed sprites, chiptune music and such... so it was something of a guilty pleasure.As a run-and-gun game, there's nothing TOO exceptional about it. The levels are fairly linear, even though there are plenty of nooks and crannies to explore. The story line is okay, though the characters are amusing enough that the plot doesn't plod on.The real challenge lies in trying to master the levels. Not just in the speed-runs, but also with the secret objectives. Things to help you earn the extra scratch and materials to forge new items to not only make the missions more interesting, but to also unlock hidden perks to get through some of the harder missions. Missions are basic in nature, but can vary in difficulty due to time constraints and game AI. And the game AI is basic enough to make taking enemies out both easy and frustrating at the same time. There's also the reload feature, which can boost damage, but requires you to pay enough attention to be a distraction at times.All in all, this is still a fun little run-and-gun, and definitely worth the look when it goes on sale.

												I saw this game on Steam while back, I looked at the screenshots, and just scoff away.From screenshots, this game didn't look too much different than the old title: Metal Slug series.But somehow, I decided to give the video preview a shot, which I normally wouldn't, unless I was initally interested in the game, and about 85% intended to buy it anyways.After viewing the video, my mind was blown. This game was nothing like Metal Slug, except it's also a 2D side scroller. But this game brought me back memories, it felt more like the old school Megaman, rather than anything else. But best part? Customizations, that's what made this game even better.The personalizations, the mix and match weapons. Even to character boosts!Obviously there are a few more things I can see that it can be improved on, and wouldn't hurt to have some voice acting for the dialog lines. But all in all, I'm giving this game a 8 / 10.I am regretting that I didn't be part of the kickstarter. This game deserves so much more.			"

												Yes, Yes, Yes and more YES!I found about this game through my brother when I went to his house and we wanted a fun multiplayer game, he got this as part of a bundle and had never played it, thought it would be terrible, anyway we give it a go and loved it!Brilliant old style side scroller platform game, with fun additions such as being able to craft weapons, upgrade aromor with items you collect along the way etc. An added bonus feature of playing multiplayer on this game, which many others like it do not have, is the fact that you play on your own little screen rather than having to stay in the same area as the other player(s) meaning if there's a split in the road you can each go one way fulfilling the objective quicker or finding more secrets.The only downside I would comment on is the landscape of the levels is pretty much the same as the last mostly but that doesn't ruin the fun as the objectives change.Would highly recommend as a fun little multiplayer game.

												I bought it cause I'm a fan of the artist. Look him up. He's great.The game itself is a little too wierdly focused on craftables and revisiting areas to be good multiplayer. The stages are clunky and don't have the same nuances of megaman or metal slug. It's kind of an awkward, stillborn baby who never had a chance in this life.			"

												This is a hard one to describe. There are many complaints, but most of those complaints are about people thinking it's going to be similar to Metal Slug, which it's not. It takes inspiration from games like Monster Hunter and Megaman. And the reason I say a game like Monster Hunter is because the crafting system and online missions (Quests) are similar to Monster Hunter's. You have your sub missions and main missions, you must complete all the main missions to unlock your boss mission, or in Monster Hunter your ""Urgent Quest,"" to move on to your next rank or ""Hunter Rank.""         As for Megaman, the game's enemies and precise shooting mechanics are very similar to the Megaman franchise. So close infact some enemies have the same gameplay mechanics, examples are the Floor Spiders acting the like Springers, and Riot Shields acting like the Sniper Joes from Megaman.         Since Monster Hunter and Megaman are two of my favorite videogame franchises of all time, I love this game, but I understand how some people might go into this game expecting a Metal Slug type game. If that's the case, Metal Slug 3 and X are available on Steam, which I highly recommend as well.			"

												If you're on windows 10 beware of constant crashing. Sometimes right after you've finished a mission but before it saves said mission. Very annoying.The progression of ""unlocking"" the interesting stuff in the game is slow and doesn't feel rewarding. It's a bit too arcane to figure out how it all works together at first glance.About the best thing the game has going for it is Paul Robertson's visual flair (because, *ahem* bewbs). Unfortunately because of the gameplay hindrances and for me, the periodic crashing, it wears out its welcome quickly. Nice idea, crowd-funders, but please try again. I want to love what you're selling, but the magic is gone far too early.			"

												Mercenary Kings is a pretty fun game backed by charming pixel art and bigger than life characters. Sadly, the gameplay is lacking a bit, and the levels are basically the same repeated hills and hallways over and over again; due to the somewhat grindy nature of the game, this becomes irrating quite fast. Enemies are also not nearly as varied as they could be.			"

												While the graphics are really good the gameplay is just wrong as hell...In 1h30 I haven't succeed the FIRST mission! W - T - F ?!The characteres are sooo slow that it's really difficult to plan your shots or even to simply react to an ennemy.There is a slight delay before jumping (game puplished in 2014 : delay before jump! WTF ?)You can not fire diagonaly (again : 2014 : WTF?) which mean that every enemies coming from the air will hit you for sure...)Speaking of the ennemies... They ALL pop back as soon as you are 10steps from them... So sometime you kill an ennemy, then another one come from the air (so you step back in order to f*** kill him) but the first guy is suddenly back in your back and hit you... ok...I feel like the tutorial is too short and too ""textual""...It's a real shame cause this game sounds really cool (good design, multiplayer, customization, etc) but REALLY lacks in speed and fluidity (otherwise this game would be awesome !) but in this current state, it's just unbearable.Metal Slug from 1996 is far  more untertaining than this game...I'm really REALLY disapointed...Oh, the only good point is the music !

												Mercenary Kings or the revival of a long forgotten genre!To make a long storry short Mercenray Kings is what i expect from a good 2D-Platformer. A good Gameplay, a decent storry and a good Soundtrack (even if it sounds like  16bit).First things first: If you want a High-End 3D-Shoother you´re ABSOLUTELY not looking for this game. BUT: If you enjoy playing 2-D Platformers (like the famous Megaman games or the early Castlevania games on the NES or SNES)  you´ll definitely have a lot of fun with Mercenary Kings.The graphics look a little like the games back in the good old times of the SNES. But thanks since these times have passed its looks are more smooth and less edgy. The designers put a lot of time and thought into creating the levels and models.  8/10The storry itself has no big twists  and unforseen turns but the Characters are designed with a lot of love. 8/10The gameplay is simple and easy to learn (what´s not so surpising since we talk about a Platformer^^)A nice idea that sure keeps you going is the almost infinite gunsmithing possibilities. Every part you equip can change how you move and shoot. It takes about 15-20 hours to beat the game (15 if you rush through the game, 20 if you take care of all the small sidequest that alsmot every mission has). 10/10The soundtrack is as retro as the looks of this game and therefor a perfect match. No fancy orchestral sound, no incredible guitarr riffs but still an enjoyable and throughout the whole game well matched music. 7/10One of the greates features of this game is the co-op mode where up to 4 players can join the fight. It never gets old to play a game like that with your friends ;)Overall Rating, 8.5/10			"

												Alright, so this is colored two ways. One side is from me and one is from a 4 year old kid.Me, I think this game is brilliant. I love that there's no forced screen share. I can go do my own thing while my team mate secures other objectives. The art is amazing and the story is interesting and fun. The crafting system brings a new depth to this sort of console side scroller and I appreciate that. Being able to choose missions is great. Not a huge fan of my partner dying x number of times and mission failed. I was a glob darm rock star. I also played this split screen on a 36"" HD monitor and thought it was a little too little....a single group map would be fine or no map below would be even better.....I play 10 days on Don't Starve before I start thinking ""maybe I need a map...""Kid thinks it's crazy fun too. His big complaint is ""these bad guys keep beating me, are you kidding me?"" I personally like the challange but he'd like a throw back to the time when a screen is shared and the hardcore gamer in the group blasts the faces and he passes out the heals (he's a good TF2 medic and a good collector of crafting items....he also got me out of a few hairy situations where I was reloading and thinking I was about to die). He likes Metal Slug more.Overall a very positive experience and I look forward to playing more. So does he, he cried his eyes out when I told him it was time to stop playing and go home. Great game, hope there's some cheap DLC or a modders tool-kit around the corner.Hap Hollys			"

												The gameplay is basic but fun. The graphics are pixelated but pretty. The music is 8-bit but rockin'. I love this game.I grew up with the SNES. For you young whipper snappers, that used to be the console of choice before your beloved Playstation and Xbox - back in the glory days of Nintento, before they gave humourous titles to their consoles tThis game plays and feels EXACTLY like an old SNES game, and so I cannot help but feel a sense of nostalgic awesomeness when I play this game, even though it is a brand new 21st century release.Don't expect any new fangled next-gen additons to this game though:- Voices? Nope. - Memorable characters? Nope.- A nail-biting storyline? Nope.- Easy mode? Nope.- Changeable video settings? Nope.And I wouldn't have it any other way.Of the 174 games on my steam library, this is in my top 10.			"

												Worth the money, but its squeezing every drop from it's maps almost to the point of boredom.There are 10 ranks (Chapters) with around 11 missions each.  I am on Chapter 3, but have only seen 5 stages.  The data files have 10 stage BGMs suggesting limited locations.  Missions are repeatable and are very forgiving if failed (you keep what you collected).  You also pick up loot drops for weapon and item crafting. These features combined with the ""Hub"" between missions gives the game a co-op MMO feel.   Less Contra, More Borderlands.  Not at all bad, but if you are not expecting that, the game feels slowly paced.  Also be aware that weapon crafting feels like a crap shoot at first, as you can make underperforming combinations of parts.   Expect to make a bunch of parts and then experiment.  Tried to make a rifle and thought I wasted my money, turns out I didnt have a matched barrel and magazine to make it shine.Overall, I expected something closer to the arcade style Metal Slug, but this game is really, really fun.  It also has some fantastic chiptunes.  I have not tried Multiplayer yet.  Waiting until I can get a bettter Internet connection.			"

												Let me start by saying I love the idea of this game. It honestly reminds me of the old Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain where there is a mission objective and players can do their own thing to work together to accomplish it. The downside of this game is that every mission feels exactly the same, and I just got sick of the repetition. It feels like there are only 3 or 4 types of enemies total. More variety would make this excellent.			"

It seems odd to me that people didn't get what Mercenary Kings was before it was released. When I watched the gameplay footage, it was very clear that the game features mechanics as Monster Hunter such as collecting materials for crafting (a LOT of it), 3 lives per mission in total (especially important in multiplayer), and timed missions. Unlike Metal Slug, which is a really fast paced 2D game, MK is more tactical, forcing you to think your approach on enemies, or die and respawn at the start point of the mission (kind like Castlevania). This creates tension, and challenge. I don't understand why people complain about not being able to shoot in a diagonal direction, as you couldn't do it in Metal Slug either, but okay.  Gameplay variations come in bionic mods, which consist on equipping up to two ability enchaning mods, along with their respective penalties; then, there is the really extensive weapon crafting in both guns and blades. This is pretty much the core mechanic of the game. Gun parts will change your damage, ammo, firing speed, weight, element, bullet compatibility, etc. Properties for knives such as range, speed, element, and others also apply. Craft enough parts of the same weapon type, and you get proficiencies, which work as an additional mod, but with no penalties. If you have played Monster Hunter, Valdis Story or any other game which focuses a lot on defeating enemies to finally get the item you need, it's worth the time, because a new kind of weapon completely changes the way you approach enemies. Mission types go from eleminating enemies in a certain area, to rescue missions, hunting missions, capture missions, material finding, etc. etc. Yes, you may feel that you have to replay maps a lot, but factors such as time, starting points, and even enemies will change as you progress through the game. Backtracking and respawing enemies work in a way that you have to very careful about not wandering mindlessly and be on your toes, as enemies will be there again, but you will encounter them from another angle, making you think twice about how to kill them once again. This also works in your favor for material collecting purposes. The fleeing Boss mechanic, I felt, works as a time and ability challenge. It can work for or against you. The thing about Bosses escaping, is that you can open the map, and you will see the skull icons where the boss actually is, so it's about how fast you can get there and finish the job. Multiplayer is a blast, as you and your friends can tackle the missions from different points. You are not bound all together in the same screen, but can work individually when it comes to finding enemies or items in order to complete the mission. Also, if you pick up a material, all your friends will get it too, so it makes crafting a lot faster. If you hated going against a Boss solo, a multiplayer session will allow you and your friends to completely wreck those Steel Soldiers, Mechanic Hounds and many others. One thing of caution, though. I said that you have 3 lives in total per mission, not per player. So watch out for trigger happy companions, or loners, because if they day very far away from any support, ""Mission Failed"" is a highly likely scenario, so teamwork is never out of the question, and THAT'S the beauty of it. There are adrenaline shots to revive your comrades or yourself in these situations, but mind the inventory limit, as choices must be made, so once again, tactics is the word of the day.  There is also the platformer aspect of the game, so be careful about how hard you press the jump button. So, not only will you fight CLAW, but you will find the stages themselves. The reload mechanic is something you must master, as you must always be aware of how much ammo you got left before reloading. By reloading, you will see a black, yellow and green bar above you. If you time well your reloading and hit the green section of the bar, you will get a bonus damage for the amount of bullets your reloaded. If you miss, you'll be unable to shoot for a period of time, defined by the load time of the weapon you're carrying (So you better have a nicely forged knife to compensate). This mechanic adds even more tension to the game, because you won't always be standing still as you watch your reload bar, but you may be in a heated Boss battle, or sorrounded by enemies, so mastering your reload time for every weapon you carry is a must. For the enemy part of the game, there is a nice variety of them. Not to mention that some enemies will level up in a way, and be stronger and change their attack patterns. The same goes for Bosses, and you will encounter some powered-up ones, which likely make your day harder (if you have played Monster Hunter, this if quite familiar). If you get into trouble at missions, you can always rest at the infirmary, which works both as a healing station (kind slow, so watch your times) and a spawn point, so if you die, you will respawn at the last infirmary you entered. As I see it, people who really didn't like this game (and played for about 15 minutes of it), were expecting a super-fast paced shooting game, like metal slug. This is more tactical, as I said, like Castlevania, Metroid, Monster Hunter, etc. You can't be shooting endlessly or moving really fast with a full pleged machine gun in  your arms. Other were expecting things to be really casual and easy, but Mercenary Kings isn't that kind of game. If you can stand a challenge, and master the speed and mechanics of this game, satisfaction is a feeling that will get to you eventually. Also, after end-game, you can keep playing in order craft every weapon part there is, or just try the different kind of bullets and guns, just to see how you fare with them. Are you a revolver or hand-gun kind of person? Maybe shotguns are your thing. Maybe a Sniper Rifle, or a Machine gun. Maybe you like it close and personal, and your knife gets the best out of you. Changing a weapon type is pretty much changing your experiencie in the game, so give it a shot. Design and artstyle-wise, the game is beautiful. If you like pixel art, the character designs are stylish, both friends and enemies. The game plays really smooth, and the map details are very well done. I'm not picky with graphics in videogames, so for me this really easy on the eyes. When it comes to controls, I'm the rare kind of player who prefers the keyboard. The default keys are what I use, and at first they're kind of weird, but using your right hand as a second WASD actually makes sense in this game (at least for me). The thing to watch out for are the roll and the knife controls. If you don't want to trouble yourself with the roll button, you can enable the double-tap option to get that out of your way. Now you deal only with shoot, knife and jump. Of course, there is the reload button and how you handle your inventory, but all it takes is a button configuration or a controller set-up to better suit your needs. Anyway, that's my way of covering how this game does what it does. I can see that it's not for the VERY casual players, or those who expect really fast paced 2D shooters (which I also love), but I wouldn't call it hardcore either. It's about letting Mercenary Kings grow on you if the general idea doesn't fully convince you yet, but I can't blame you if this isn't really the game for you. Just don't go with the ""It's hard because I'm not super powerful"" kind of reviews. This is a game that rewards your intelligence and your ability more than it rewards your farming for materials in order to craft the best equipment. I hope this helps you out in that decisive ""Yes or No"" for this game in particular, and keep on playing.			"

												summary of this game:a half baked attempt to recreate the wonders that where contra and metal slug. cute and well animated visuals won't save this stiff and harsh (and very tedious) try hard.with every mission you go on, you have a stupid timer, with no real indicators as to where you have to go to find what you have to find (i only did 2 missions and gave up after a ton of stupid deaths).the controls are fidgety and there is no diagonal shooting, which doesnt make sense b/c the game it is trying to pay hommage to had diagonal shooting (as well as super tight controls).the one decent, though at the same time frustraing (and kind of stupid) concept is the weapon crafting system. you can customise every part of your guns... this would be fun and cool, but the resources are random drops from enemies and crates and you have to go over each item and 'duck' to pick it up, which sometimes puts you in harms way (dont forget that you have a timer as well and cant afford to die and/or do loot hunting).there is also a death penatly (cash loss) and you have to restart from either the beginning, or a random tent you find lying around, which doesnt make things any more fun imo.sound and visuals are decent, though nothing to write home about.this game was on my radar for a while b/c it looked like a faithful adaptation of a childhood favourite of mine (metal slug 3) but alas, it is just a half baked wanna be that has since been abandoned (it was hyped up so much before official release and crowd funding and now the team has disappeared).save your money or buy it when it goes dirt cheap (less then 50% standard retail would be good).

												Its an ok game, less metal slug and more megaman. That is not a bad thing but redoing the levels over and over again just with different missions feels very much like i am grinding for nothing. Its eh, not worth the price. The artwork is amazing and so is the music but the level design is so painfully boring it kills the whole game. Want to run around a level you know off by heart to kill a boss? Want to hurt that boss only for him to leave so you have to go to 1 of the 4 locations it pops up at? Want to fight different bosses on the same dang level that missions like ""save the captives"" is also done on? Want to rush a level over and over again? then this game is for you!I wish this game did not feel like it was rushed to hell but it does. The levels are so ♥♥♥♥ing bad that you might as well play any other game like this for cheaper.			"

												In the gathering mission, you're supposed to collect 2 pelts, which drop randomly. None dropped before the timer expired.You can customize your weapon a little, which would be kinda cool, except the combat is about shooting at people from 10 feet away without being able to aim; there's no particular reason to care whether a weapon's accuracy is 70% or 85%, or whether it does 275 damage or 285 damage.

												I wanted to really like this game, but it's just so buggy. It crashes regularly, and one time a level didn't load in properly, and the game stopped tracking whether or not I've beaten a mission before. The artwork is gorgeous, the weapons are awesome. The controls are ok, and the gameplay has repetitive issues. I just really wish the game was a little bit better and not buggy because then I would love it.			"

												So after 8 missions ive noticed that im playing the exact same levels over and over again. Really? no diversity , same enemys. Just different objectives that i have to spend 10 minutes finding on a map that isnt fun because ive played to so much its predictible. Honestly im tired of running around the same map looking for my objective.Also whats up with the weapons, cant i get a warning that i cant attach an assualt rifle clip to a pistol and maintain fire power, especially when it says firepower will increase but when i use it its actually a lot less than without the clip. Thats no fun man. Not much point of customization, you pick what you want wether its assualt rifle, shotgon, pistol ect. Then you pick addons such as crap, mediocre, and what you should buy in the first place but dont have the bloody materials.All in all its not very fun, nice music however it never changes. No voice acting besides grunts and a catch phrase for reloading.Quite terrible.			"

												You may seen this intro a lot in the review: I really wanted to like this game. Pixelated but colorful art, old school with a modern touch, etc... that's all truth and likeable. But I really had a problem with the gameplay, something that should be a star in this kind of games. First, this does not play like Metal Slug in an aspect. May look like it, but is more like a cheap megaman knockoff. Yep, I'm this harsh because the scenarios and platforming is filled with lame and boring challenges, timed repetitive missions and enemies that are just not fun to fight.Weapon crafting is still pretty good, and it may intrigue you what you can build with what you find, but honestly, this is the reason I usually don't dig in this kind of mechanic: I have to wade trough repetitive gameplay until it's grating. I might be compensated with building great guns and upgrades, but with such lame enemies to fight, what's the point? It's like playing XBlades in a Turrican-Megaman uninspired perspective.If you want to play Metal Slug, it's here on steam. If you want to meet the untalented son of Diablo and Megaman, get this.			"

												Merc Kings has a great art style as you can see and that can go a long way if you like it. I find it to be fun despite a little repeatativeness. You find yourself going to the same areas several times on different missions. I understand it adds some replay value but it can feel redundant. The gameplay, in general, is fun. Obviously there's numberous weapon upgrades and combinations, it's really interesting to mess around and tweak with those. What a lot of reviewers don't mention is that there are other mods like armor, health, melee knife, and bullet mods. You collect material found on missions for all these upgrades. I didn't find myself struggling too much to save up for the mods I wanted. Yes there's fetch missions but they are purely optional and usually offer big material bonuses.Pros-Fun quirky graphic/art style-co-op online and local-upgrades!-full controller support-moderate difficultyCons-several missions repeat map areas -fetch missions-zomg its not metal slug!!

												This platformer's level design very much reminds me of Mega Man.You play as a mercenary, doing missions for some army dude. The missions are: find this, kill that, rescue someone. You advance through the ranks by completing story missions. Every time you advance you get new gun parts in the store. You craft them by obtaining materials and money in missions.The gun crafting system is interesting, you can combine parts from guns with other parts from other guns. The sniper rifles are way overpowered. Their range is insane, you always shoot with 100% accuracy and your bullets will pierce infinitely throught walls and enemies alike.I did not pay much attention to the story. For me this game is about running around shooting at stuff and building the best gun.tl/drFun game for co-op or single player with lots of pew pew!			"

And with 7 hours played I'm only 'private'. I must be like 1/10th all the way through.

												The game has its flaws, but no game is without such things. To give a game grief for not being flawless is setting a standard bar well beyond realistic expectations and there for being unreasonable. Also most of the negative reviews have hardly clocked enough time to really get into the game.The short:This is a great time killer and if you like making prospect of making tons of whacky weapon combos and personal perks to enhance your character's speed, jump and other stuff then you'll love this game even if there are some spelling errors in text and the occasional bug.The long:This game is not a Metal Slug clone, it takes a lot of inspiration from it like character designs, setting, some minor game mechanics and combat from Metal Slug but its not a fast paced side scrolling shooter. The game actually reminds me more of the old Castlevenia games withwith its multi layered levels and hidden areas. This is not a game where you'll forever be blasting your way forward (like how Metal Slug games play) without turning back, you will need to take time to farm for materials to build better weapons and perks. The repetiveness of farming can be troublesome for players who just want to rush on ahead but for players who actually enjoy all the benefits of being able to craft more weapon parts it pays off in spades (90+ hours and I still haven't made everything or done all the side missions).This coop in this game is also really fun, my advice is wait till its on sale and buy the 4 pack for yourself and 3 pals.In fact as much as i love this game I don't think its worth almost 20USD, its a time sink sure but thats mainly if you want to make and try out new weapon sets and combinations (the farming can really eat up time). So do I highly recommend this game but not at full price and only if you can handle grinding for crafting fun stuff. "

												This review was a close call for me, but I cant recommend the game right now. I love the style of the game, of course it reminds of games like Metal Slug and so on, but that doesn't make up for the repetitive and frustrating gameplay. There is a hub with missions, merchants and weapon crafting NPCs and things like that, which is cool, but the missions get way too annoying after a while. Especially because they use the same maps over and over, making you explore it again and again to get all the objectives done. What also drives me crazy is that enemies respawn all the time in the way of super old games like Ninja Gaiden, go too far in one direction and the enemy respawns is just not a good way in my opinion. The crafting system is cool, but doesn't really adds that much to the game. I really really wanted to like this game, but the repetitiveness and dull gameplay just can't convince me at all to recommend the game. I know its in beta, but they would need to change a lot to make up for it, which just isn't realistic. PS: Make the god damn multiplayer work at least...			"

												S'pretty fun for a while, but after a point the grind just got to be too much for me. I don't mind grinding, and actually enjoy it in a lot of games, but make grinding faster, more convenient, easier, and fun. Not slow, hard, boring, tedious and mind numbingly repetitive. I'm going to give this a no, but if I could I would simply give this a neutral vote or both, and if you can stand the grind then it's quite a lot of fun I feel, and would highly recommend it to those with sufficient patience to enjoy this game. I'm only giving this a no cause I personally couldn't stand the grinding. Honestly, my biggest problem with this game is that some materials are just way too hard to get in any kind of significant quantities. To get around this problem I suggest having higher tier enemies drop rarer materials instead of the common materials I already have literally hundreds of that all the lower tier enemies already drop. Also, the netcode could use improvement. At the moment it's kinda not very good.			"

												Mercenary Kings is a cynical college art project masquerading as a videogame. In less than an hour of playtime, the game managed to show every possible hint of amatuerism in its design. A design based on games from decades ago that had better control schemes.The biggest flaw with this ""game"" is the incredibly poor design decisions. The first mistake was the addition of reload for what should have been a relatively simple run-and-gun experience. It breaks the flow of gameplay and often just leaves you huddling behind some barrels until you've reloaded. Not that taking cover matters; The enemies barely move and the barrels are always taller than you are, so you have to jump into enemy fire anyway. This is compounded by absolutely byzantine level design that makes backtracking endless and goals impossible. It doesn't help that enemies respawn faster than this game being pushed out the door. On top of that, the game often imposes time limits on your escapades. The result is endlessly frustrating. The ""developers"" clearly haven't taken much notice in the games they were so intent on emulating: You can't shoot diagonally. Even Contra, a game released in the late '80s, allowed the player to shoot diagonally. There's no reason this could not have been done here.Mercenary Kings is so bad I thought it was an Early Access title because it has no features and is overpriced. It looks like someone took a game with one level and no interesting game mechanics, gave it a nice art style and called it a day. Normally, I would cut the devs some slack, seeing as it's a Kickstarter and probably their first game, but the pricetag is just insulting for the amount of content (that I've read about; Apparently there's a useless crafting system). Only a Kickstarter could raise $100,000 for a game to be $20 and have the same content as a gif of the opening and closing animated sequences. The lack of gameplay coherence and common sense gives me the sneaking suspision that the game was mostly an ego trip for an art student.I don't recommend this game at full price. I don't recommend this game on sale. I actually got it on Humble Bundle for a dollar and I still can't recommend it. No, wait, my brother paid for that bundle, so I got it for free. No, wait, my brother owes me twenty bucks. I got paid to play this game and I still can't recommend it.			"

												Welcome to Metal Slug the job! Were you tired of playing Metal Slug with its good level progression and fun missions? Well look no further with fetch quest and grinding out the wahzoo! I've no clue as to why people find this fun so much as you enjoy going to the same stage, you will also fail most missions the first time on a map since the map system itself is quite horrible. And as for weapon crafting all I truly remember was the pure tedium of crafting said weapon that usually is very unfun to use so instead of having these awesome powerups in Metal Slug which freshened the game up all you are left with is a tedius item screen and one weapon that usually took you hours upon hours of grinding the same stage. At the point of which the game costs it seems you could just play an mmo or something else with your money atleast you can chat with your friends online in that instead of this.			"

												I can recommend this game, because I've been having a fairly good time with the basic gameplay... BUT.... a concession to the cautious buyer: the longer you play, the initial fun level begins to diminish as you begin to notice how the game extensively recycles assets and mission types. Mercenary Kings is perfectly content to repeatedly send you off on the same 3 types of fetch quests in one of the same 3 maps, over and over, again and again, for hours.Mercenary Kings is the equivalent of that FPS you play that isn't really outstanding, but also isn't bad, and turns out to be a really great way to just kill a half an hour. It's a game you can hop into quickly, and missions can take anywhere between 5 minutes up to 30 minutes. If you're just looking to kill some time shooting a couple dudes while looking at some great pixel art, then Mercenary Kings fits the bill marvelously.If you're a fan of old school side-scrolling shooters (e.g. Metroid, Contra, Gunstar Heroes, Cave Story), etc, then you're probably going to enjoy this game well enough to make it worth the purchase (especially at a sale price). There is **EVENTUALLY** (very, very eventually) a variety of ammo types, and it can be interesting discovering how different ammo types can have unique effects on certain types of enemies (e.g. when you shoot an enemy hiding behind a riot shield with caustic ammo, the riot shield melts away and changes the enemy's behavior).However, I specifically say AMMO types and not GUN types for good reason. One of the most loudly advertised aspects of the game---and definitely one of the most attractive---is the ability to pick up various ""materials"" dropped by enemies, which you can then sell for money or use at crafting stations to create new parts for your gun or various other perks. The game is very proud of these mildly RPG-esque and clearly Borderlands-derived elements, but the implementation is hit or miss. The ammo types are implemented pretty well. The gun parts... meh.After dumping over 10 hours into the game (and having a fairly good time, mind you), and experimenting with different gun mods, my honest opinion is that the vast majority of craftable gun parts and passive skills are more or less pointless. The game undermines upgrades and customizations in the vast majority of cases by giving an upgrade with one hand while stealing it back with the other.For example, suppose you currently have a clip size of 8 and a damage rating of 150, and you want to upgrade your clip size to fire more shots before stopping to reload. The game might let you upgrade your clip size to 12, but it knocks your damage down to 100 and slows your walking speed. Suppose you decide to skip the clip size upgrade then and just upgrade raw damage? The game might let you boost raw damage to 200, but it will reduce your clip size to 4 shots and slow your walking speed. Or it might alternatively lett you have the 200 raw damage while reducing your magazine size to 7, but the cost is your reload speed is now three times as slow. In short, most of the unlockable weapon parts aren't so much ""upgrades"" as much as they are like sliders that you can use to change CHARACTERISTICS of your weapon, but which don't really IMPROVE your weapon overall.Also, you CAN'T SHOOT DIAGONALLY in this game. Which is annoying, because enemies CAN shoot diagonally, and flying enemies will attack you from a diagonal direction. This is a terrible oversight. It might have been fine if being attacked from a diagonal angle wasn't such a problem, but the game makes you wish for that diagonal aim through enemy behavior suggesting that you should have it, and then for some reason, you don't. When I noticed that, I shook my head and I said hm. Just hm. Tsk tsk. What a shame.That being said, once you get several hours in and get up to about the third rank, you start acquiring weapon parts that make your gun compatible with elemental ammo. Therein lie the REAL upgrades. You can even get up to a point where you can have an elemental version of a specific bullet type. For example, you can create a gun that shoots bullets that are both CAUSTIC and also PIERCING. Caustic bullets burn away at enemies (and sometimes melt away their defenses) while piercing bullets can travel through walls and objects to hit unsuspecting enemies on the other side. Piercing bullets can also travel through several enemies in a line. And, of course, the damage is better. Now THESE are upgrades.In short, the various weapon parts don't add a whole lot outside of letting you use custom ammo. The custom ammo is the real game changer.There are other craft stations not related to weapon crafting, but these also don't offer anything that significantly improves your character or game experience. Some of them are terribly pointless. One of the better examples is the ability to craf better armor, which provides a definite and noticeable boost to the amount of damage you can sustain. The craftable passive skills, on the other hand, aren't particularly interesting. They COULD be, but are implemented poorly. For example, there is a passive skill that brags it can burst your speed, but at the cost of some of your physical defense. Again with the giving with one hand while taking with the other. If the benefits made the trade-off worthwhile, then it might not be so bad, but the ""speed boost"" you receive is so slight that I found myself turning it off and on again to test whether it was actually working. Not exactly the sort of ""speed boost"" I would sacrifice defense for.Some of the crafting options I even find downright ridiculous. For example, you can give a bunch of your materials and some money to the chef who will craft a meal for you, which gives you a perk in the next mission only. But the perks are laughably negligible. Things like a 5% increase to maximum health. Five percent? This kind of thing could just as well not exist and I wouldn't even miss it or notice it was gone.Honestly, I played all the way up through Corporal rank using the STARTING weapon. No mods offer significant enough changes to be worthwhile up until that point. I bought a lot of the upgrades to advance toward some of those skills that unlock with a certain number of purchases, but I didn't equip any of them. Didn't see the point.The game's hugest and most serious problem, however, is recycling. I have played the game for 10 hours and completed nearly 50 missions. All of these missions have taken place in the same 3 levels. I am very sick of the jungle.On the plus side, the boss battles are pretty fun (but also recycled).TLDR: Mercenary Kings  isn't going to win any awards, and it recycles too much, and its weapon customization is mostly talk, but if you just want to spend a few minutes shooting some 2-dimensional dudes while looking at some great pixel art, then Mercenary Kings is a great game to kill time with.

												I've bought this game maybe a year ago in early access. The graphics are cute, and it seemed like a metal-slug kind of game.The actual game is horrible, the gunplay tries to be smart with active reload, the jumping has a slight delay, and you receive damage from touching enemies - despite there being a melee attack.There's some kind of material gathering and crafting, but the basic controls and gameplay feel like a game for kids.It's not metal slug, it's not contra, it's not mightnight resistance, it's not even mario. I had very high hopes for this game, but even with a controller the game is just not fun at all.			"

												So, first off - the game is beautiful, the animation is fluid and funny, the game has a ton of character, it's a Scott Pilgrim nod to Metal Slug.  All those things are great... but the gameplay.  EVERY mission is a timed variation on a fetch quest, and most of the environments look the exact same.  Timed missions ALONE would dissuade me from continuing, but I kept at it because I really wanted to like it.  I figured weapon customization would save the game, but alas, unless you make very specific weapons, they tend to be pretty worthless.  I was hoping for a Loadout-esque customization system, but the game really just wants you to buy parts to make a shotgun.  Or a sniper rifle.  If you get creative in any way, the negatives are so huge that it's not worth the effort - I went from a standard magazine weapon with 6 shots to a larger magazine, and my damage dropped about 80% - so though I had more bullets to a clip, I was doing far LESS damage with each shot.  If you can handle mazey fetch quests, give it a shot.  It's a solid backbone, it has a lot of things going for it, but it just felt too clunky and grindey to me.  Such a shame, I'd been looking forward to playing it for a while now.			"

												Don't let the negative reviews fool you. Yes it isn't Metal Slug, but just because it looks like it, it shouldnt play like it. This a Metal Slug style with a Monster Hunter vibe to it. The ability to customize your gun into any shape or form is the drive to this game. Now unless you wanna unlock every gun part, yes it WILL be a grind, but if you know what you want, you'll blaze through this game. By want I mean, you know what kind of gun you'll want to make. Spread patterns are all the same (this aint Counter Strike son), so a gun with 90% Acc will be the same across all fields, is just the ammunition that affects the pattern (Buckshots will not follow the same predetermined path as a Magnum Bullet). The only downfall this game has is there is no seamless map, you'll have to do different missions to go to the different maps. You will be doing the same maps over and over a couple of times, but you will be doing different parts of it to complete objectives. This can be a good or bad thing, as the missions are planned out so you know where to go for the main boss of the area (As bosses can/will run away to different parts of the map, and will need to know how to get there from previous playings). I find this game enjoyable, as others not so much, and for vain reasons.PROS-Customized Weapons-Variety of Parts-4 Player Co-Op (Both Online and Local)[Unknown if it can be mixed]-Great Boss Battles-Rainbow Dog of Doom that craps rockets at you-Large Maps-Shared Items in Co-Op mode (When finding, not crafting)-Tougher Enemies in Co-Op modeCONS-Low Replayablity-2 Characters-Enemy Variety is low (In the beginning)-Farm to Unlock all Parts-Few Maps-You will hate Rainbow Dog of DoomPretty even list of Pros and Cons, but my experience with the game as been fun, and I have been playing Solo. I think the Pros outweigh the Con in my experiences, this not a game for everyone. If you want a Metal Slug game, then buy, its there in the store, just do it. If you want a nice Side-scrolling, Action Platformer, with Customizable Weapons, I would get this.			"

												holy♥♥♥♥♥♥what a bad gameFirst off the game is semi unplayable because some of the graphics were comepletely corrupted, and apparently thats not an uncommon issue. After fixing that a friend and I tried quite hard to enjoy playing this. But we kept coming across glitches and bugs and just plain poor/confusing design choices. Apparently reviving someone sends them back to the start of the level???? Bosses will sometimes just decide to leave the battle area. If you get downed in a certain way you'll be stuck like that forever, requiring a restart. The thing that made us just straight up stop playing was when we chased a boss accross an entire level, because every time we found it, it would run away. Sometimes it would even run away before we even got to it. We were sposed to capture it, so when we finally got it down to the point where it was flashing red (which we FOOLISHLY assumed meant it was low on health and ready to be captured) we throw the capture bombs at it andddddddd they literally bounce off and have no effect.:)			"

												DO NOT BUY IT! UNTIL YOU READ!! SERIOUSLY!!!If you are expecting this game to be like Metal Slug, Metal Assault, or Contra. Turn away right now. The game is better with Controler (HIGHLY RECOMENDED) With Keyboard, it is hellish to play.So this game seem to have something new to it's style, unlike METAL SLUG. This game offers Crafting weapons, buying items, character customization and varrious mission to play. Not to mention online co-op for friends to join. SO WHAT WENT WRONG?!Level Design choicesUNLIKE METAL SLUG, this game is a CHORE! Most of the mission is  fetch quest style mission. The first mission was finding ONE hostage. (seems okay) Then the game do the exact same thing for second mission WITH 8 HOSTAGES! By the way, it's on the same map. (OR it look very similar, which make the game feels repetitive)YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE A BADASS! This game is more difficult than Metal Slug, GOOD! However..., the game refuses to throw any retaliation! (I'm going to compare this to Metal Slug again.) In Metal Slug, you will encounter TANKS, 10+ Footsoilders, HELICOPTERs, and so on. This make the game fun, and give that satisfying feeling of destorying everything like any RUN n GUN game should be. But all you'll encounter in this game is just repetitive respwanable enemies. For example, sending 3 melee soldiers and die by 1 SINGLE BULLET. Or having 1 or 2 riflemen attacking you. Compare that to Metal Slug or Contra. SLOW EVERYTHING IS SLOW. The fact that this game force you to do search n destory, or fetching an objective. Forces you to wonder around the map trying to find that LAST GUY WHO YOU MENT TO KILL. Again, unlike Contra or Metal Slug, this game doesn't proceed quickly. Infact, it probably force you to GRIND. That's right, having a crafting system is good, but you need to grind for the materials. I don't want to do that, this is not an MMORPG. The game does give you in-game money allowing you buy items. BUT NOT MATERIALS. NOPE YOU GOTTA GRIND FOR IT. May I ask why!? Combat MechanicHonestly, very disappointed. I'll make this short. Why is there a reload mini game? Does it have any purpose? It was more like a punishment rather than FUN. I mean, reloading itself is already difficult. Or maybe it's not difficult in this game? BECAUSE THE GAME HARDLY throw enemies at you! While it adds abit of challenge during boss fight, I find it more... annoying. There's no real reward for hitting the right time for reload minigame, but only punishment when you hit too early or too late. I rather just hit reload and just wait. Other than that the mini game mechanic, is a waste of space.Final things I would like to add.WHY DO I ONLY HAVE A PISTOL!? Where's my nade? WHY IS THERE A TIMER!? WHY DOES IT COST MONEY TO DIE?! Isn't losing one life not enough!? For PC, IF YOU HAVE NO CONTROLER! DO NOT BUY!! Was expecting something like Metal Assault, which was an MMO but have a very good mechanic, you can use your mouse to aim, and shoot with LF-Click. SIMPLE!? Why didnt the developer think of this?!?! Buy, at your own risk. Good Day.			"

												Fun for a few hours of ""retro fix"", but ultimately, like many of the game it emulates, this game lacks the thrill of a responsive, empowering and progressive platformer.  It's not the sort of Borderlands-meets-MegamanX that I was imagining.The Merc characters feel clumsey and sluggish.  The guns (so far) are very limited ( ""shotgun type parts"" or ""machine gun type parts"").  It's common to sink missions-worth-of-earnings into building a worse gun.  There are no items or abilities aside that make you feel awesome, give any strategy or variety.  You're (so far) just a dopey run/jump/duck/shoot/roll character, fighting the same 10 enemies with predictable patterns and no real reason (i.e. relevant loot or an xp system) to grind through.Enemies feel like they're just in the way of the objective, fighting through the same stage over and over to complete their many missions.  A lot of time is spent hoping that the effort it will take to, yet again, trek through the same grid of caves, cliffs and structures, will be worth a few lines of character dialogue and the assumption that all the stuff you've been picking up will be useful some day.The story, characters and artwork are all very pleasant, but the game mechanics/design makes most of the game a chore to slog through, unfortunately.  No randomized content.  One stage of the same stuff for hours.  Beyond that, I can only guess the formula repeats itself.Perhaps after only a few more hours, something along the lines of interesting/useful weapon options, character abilities (wall jump?  double jump?  wall slide?  crawl?  lock on/aim? Grenades? ect.), more stages, or anything else that feels like a reward will emerge.  Until then, it's just chasing repeat bosses that move before you even get to them for hours, and grinding through armies of annoying bad guys for obscure matterials.			"

Many times i have managed to scape the level twice or three times to find my objective just for the timer to run out and start it all over again. I can't believe how anyone would spend over 10 hours playing this game without boring themselves to death. But, i have to give them credit for the artstyle, it's very charming and a throwback to ye olden days.			"

												If someone says this is a Metal Slug rip-off, they must be complementing the game, because from what i saw, it's still far from perfect. The crafting system is a big thumb up, but coming with it is a bunch of useless stats ( like weight, reload, elements ... ) which is kind of making this game more like a roguelike platformer with unlimted farming, and the reload mechanic is annoying. The map is big, and mobs are unlimited respawn, which can kill you when you wander around, or slow you down, like a lot, when you missed something in your mission. And also the control is just uncorfortablein short, if you are looking for a fastpace bullethell 2d platformer like Metal Slug, this wont make it. but if you love farming and crafting for many different guns, then this might worth itgameplay : 5/10art : 7/10 ( shout out to Paul Robertson )control : 5/10idea :  7/10			"

												First, I'll start by addressing the cons many people mention. This game does revisit the same areas. What it does right about this mechanic is that it will often lock certain areas of that map until you clear specific missions, and the variety of the missions more than make up for this.The crafting and customization that a person can use to suit their playstyle is varied enough to suit anyone's taste. Homing guns, projectiles that explode with shrapnel on impact, piercing rounds, elemental rounds, and even player buffs that can make a melee build one of the most lethal.The multiplayer co-op is the most fun feature of this game. Whether local or online, the players are free to explore separate areas of the same map, versus locking you in the same screen (as does Metal Slug, a game that cleraly inspired this one). The only negative part that players may find is that local co-op is split screen, so plan to be close to the screen if it is not a large one. Also, players can leave whenever they feel like it (even the host) without forcing other players to quit, and players can join at any point in between missions.The most impressive ascpect of this game is the commitment that the developers have to ensuring that it is a great game. Their persistence in ironing out bugs is rare for an indie team. This is reason enough to buy the game, and to buy future titles from this team.Graphics are one of the last thing I care about so long as the game works, and it does. On that note, the art style in this game is fantastic.TL;DR: Lots of crafting and player build customization, varied missions, drop in/drop out co-op campaign, great art style/graphics, dedicated developer team.9/10			"

												Disclaimer: I might not ""get"" the game.This game is hard to love, it's one of those games that has the promise of combining all the best parts of old skool games. I'm sure at some level this was what the developers are going for, a nostalgic game they would've liked to see, indisriminately taking the things we all loved about platformers etc.Sadly, it's more like the best and the absolute worst aspects of games from the 8bit and 16bit era. It's as if the developers have learned absolutely nothing from modern game design. This game is extremely frustrating, and most of it comes down to horrible design and core mechanics. The biggest issue I have apart from the bad overall design, is that while the developers have tried to combine many different elements from successful games, the overall experience is worse off than any of those individual games it tries to imitate.Some gameplay choices don't play well with each other and their attempt at syncretizing these becomes detrimental to the overall experience,I tried playing this game with multiple friends, and it's hard for me to insist on it when it's obvious no one is enjoying a single second of it.A real shame, but the era for frustrating pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥that you just love to hate are over.However, if you're one of those people that is scourging through the reviews to find reassuring confirmation of why you'd love this game, and are desperate for the possible potential it might have I would in fact recommend this game. You might not play it for very long, but it does have an allure of enjoyment, one that it doesn't really deliver on, but afterall, like the developers, sometimes we like the idea of something over the actual thing itself.

A delightful Metal Slug type game with the slow methodicalness of Monster Hunter and the gun ♥♥♥♥♥♥s of Borderlands 2. If you aren't patient or hate indie games get the hell out. This game will tear you apart. Cats guns too.7.5/10			"

												Mercenary Kings is a good side scrolling shooter, but that's not the problem.  This issue is that this game and other ""Early Access"" games are making money from unfinished games.  They're charging full price for games that the consumer has no guarantee tha the games will ever be finished.  The mass promotion of these ""Early Access"" games is getting out of hand.  There are many complete games out there more worth this price.			"

												Fun for an hour or two, then gets repetative and a bit dull.  Not enough variation in guns and parts.  All the levels are essentially the same.  If you can get it cheap (like under £5) get it.  Anything more and I would think many people would regret it.			"

												I thought I would pretend it was like one of those 80s movies, you know, the really bad ones, like top gun bad, yeah that's right top gun was♥♥♥♥♥♥ and so was the over used ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ song. You know the one.  I wanted things more along the lines of a bad 80s flick, like motel hell, or 555, chud etc. It's really sad that things can't just be awful in a good way anymore. I actually hate video games. Every time I play a video game it's like I'm being castrated by a woman using only her teeth , don't get me wrong, there are still good games out there, very far and few between. Games nowadays want to chew the fat with a bunch of saggy♥♥♥♥♥bull dykes and limp♥♥♥♥♥♥men, who want to change the medium even though they don't even play videogames. I guess it's easier than going on to fight real oppression, you know, like the women of the middle east, that actually need feminism, nope, you have these fat faced hoebags arguing about weather some fictional character makes them feel inadequate in real life. Lets not forget the degenerates who dress up in women's clothing and want to pretend they are indeed woman, no, you are a ♥♥♥♥ing buffalo bill, or in the case of Brianna Wu, you are the living spawn of Nosferatu. It's all a joke, just one big joke, comedian was right, the movie may have had ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dialog, but that line rings ever true.Oh, and the dude who made mercenary kings should go back to doing his movies, and porn. This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I like the vision this has, i like the idea of a 2D Monster Hunter Game. I like the pixelart. I like the arcadey atmosphere. And i like a challenge.But EVERYTHING in this game is either made to eat your time, slow your progression and/or make you grind in the most repetetive and unfair way.Especially eggregious:Enemys with movement patterns that make it neigh impossible to evade their attack and hit them because the movement is to stiff to work for that without frustration. Wich means they want you to grind things out for gear so you can take the shots or utterly oneshot everything.Stupid and frustrating timelimits for most missions. Enemys actually respawn THE SECOND the screen passesthe place they have spawned the last time making it an utter grind. For example there was a room with two basic grunts in it and some platforms. I killed the grunts and tried to get some loot on the platforms. The MONENT the floor these goons had been walking on, was just a second out of frame the enemys respawned, and i was able to rerpeat that ad nauseum. Just that many other enemys aren't that easy to beat and it's utter♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when they spawn DIRECTLY behind out you just barely out of frame and hurt you from an area you just had cleaned from enemys.Especially the last point makes it a drain to play the mission because you often need to search for certain bosses, items persons and the imidiate respawnspams spams you with enemys killing any fun the progressing through the mission might have made by making it a slog..

												This game is toted by its fans as ""2D monster hunter""The problem is monster hunter? 99.999% of that game is fighting large monsters, that only makes up about 4-5% of this game, the rest of it is fetch quests, find 8 of these, rescue 10 hostages, blow up this generator etc etc, very little boss fights take place.A game that's almost the exact same as this, which not only looks/sounds better than this, but plays infinitely better and has about the same upgrade system (Find new parts, buy them, modify all your guns and armor etc) is Shoot Many Robots, and its half the price to boot.

Levels are a mess because of having to rely completely on memorization which sucks when the level layout makes all areas look identical.The thing that kills it though is that the game runs horribly, constantly lagging and having slowdown lag from I would suppose poor coding.

												Metal Slug meets Monster Hunter? Oh hell yeah!If you're a Monster Hunter passionate, such as myself, you will definitely LOVE  this title. The feeling you get is very close, and a lot of mechanics are present in both games: Weapons can be forged, and they come in various shapes and colors. Not only that, but weapon parts are divided in categories which alter the way they work. The main area is a small village, where all the NPCs live. Many of them also resemble ones from Capcom's franchise: the general who gives you missions, the cook who... erm, cooks you food (which gives fixed AND chance-based bonuses), the gunsmith who forges all your gun parts from monster materials, and so many others.  Areas work similarly to how they do in Monster Hunter, being divided in zones and having enemies indigenous to them. However, in this game most enemies tend to respawn as soon as they leave your field of view. Oh, and I didn't talk about boss fights yet! Bosses can be killed OR captured, and overall the pattern-learning process behind defeating them for the first time feels the same.Then comes CoOp. You can play together with up to four people, and you all share the same lives. There's a built-in voice-command system, too. I could go on, but I hope you get the point.If, however, you're considering buying Mercenary Kings for the Metal Slug part, you'll be slightly disappointed: while it mantains all the glorious 2D shootin' goodness, it lacks a bit of the fast-paced and action-packed gameplay that makes Metal Slug what it's well known for. Also, there are no power-ups scattered around the map or dropped by your foes, for instance.Overall? I don't even know where to begin: some great but not overly complex pixel-art, an amazing soundtrack, interesting characters, an addicting gameplay and the CoOp mode are all important points that give a strong first impression. Maybe it's not really worth €20, but you should totally get it if it drops below €15.			"

												Hey, I put a thumbs down here cause I really didn't like the game. I played very little though, and I don't think it's terrible, but the reloading seems completely unnecessary, and so do many other design choices. Level design wasn't fun.Usually reviewing a game after so short time should be too little, but for a 2d shooter I expect to be enjoying myself from the start.The game isn't terrible, but be aware, this is not a Metal Slug/ Contra Clone. This is a very different much slower paced and more complicated game than that. And that's really not what I wanted, and I don't think the way they made this complicated added any value to the game. I have nothing against complicated games, I play them all the time, but just for the sake of it? Not thanks.			"

The Short Of It"" If I want to torment myself and grind for levels & mats, I'm going to play an MMO or an RPG.Note: This game is NOT an MMO nor an RPG.The Long Of It: Oh, where to begin...Oddly enough, this game has something of a story; namely, some evil organization plans on causing a big ol' ruckus (in this case, eternal plant-based warfare). Fair enough. Not much to speak of, but there have been dumber plots.Once you get into the game, expect to grind, grind, grind. You grind for mats to make better gun parts. You'll grind missions for money and mats. You have to grind crafting to make parts and unlock proficiencies (I guess it was just too easy to kill stuff to unlock bonuses, wasn't it, game?), which will make you better at grinding missions for money and parts. Its a big ol' circle of grindiness. Combat is a right♥♥♥♥♥♥as well. There's only four directions to aim in (while some enemies have eight >:| ), and you can't aim down unless you're jumping because holding down while standing makes you go prone. Additionally, some enemies have far too much health. Nevermind the poor placement and dumb-as-rocks AI. I can't tell you how many times that ♥♥♥♥♥ in the drill tank thing ran me over before I managed to kill one of them. Oh, and enemies respawn the INSTANT you leave the screen, so expect to get stabbed, bitten, and shot multiple times passing through the same area!I'm not going to claim that I am the best at these kinds of games, but it really feels like this one just wants me to stop playing it...Honestly, some of this game feels over-engineered. The crafting system is unnecessary -- just let me buy my parts and guns, dammit! -- and the respawning enemies are especially galling unless you have the map memorized. As stated previously, if I wanted to grind, I'll go play an MMO or an RPG, not an action shooty platformer.I do want to love this game. It has a great aestetic and seems like it could be fun, but there's just so much that feels off for being a finalized product. If you really must have your Metal Slug, then go play Metal Slug (or maybe Broforce). If you really feel like grinding something, play an oldie RPG. Just don't play this game. :(			"

												The game is Monster Hunter, meets Metal Slug, except that grinding ""wyverns"" isn't fun, and you have to grind things that aren't wyverns, plus level design that punishes you for not carrying light weapons (ie, 25% of the weapon loadouts possible)Also, about half way through the game, the missions start moving toward requiring very specific loadouts to even be able to complete them, or sending you back to the beginning of the mission instead of the nearest infirmary.TL;DR  Take all the bad things about Monster Hunter, Megaman, Action Platformers, Customization Systems, and add in 4 player coop and Metal Slug art and you've got this game.

												let me get one thing perfectly ♥♥♥♥ing clear. this isnt a terrible game. if it were on a console it would certainly be worth playing but the fatal flaw is the controls. the keyboard controls are absolutely terrible and changing the key bindings doesnt help very much. it has about all of the effect of using a bandage on a broken leg. the controls are absolutely horrid on PC. its fairly obvious that PC controls were a definite afterthought for the developers. if you are willing to put up with controls worse than resident evil, way too many pointless steps to begin a mission, some flawed mission design, an incredibly annoying reloading minigame and a bit of overcomplication in the weapon loot system then i would reccomend it but as it is i would just look for a port to a console of your preference because the keyboard controls are broken as hell. i wouldnt reccomend this lazy PC port.

												Mercenary Kings. The game that could have been good. Metal Slug meets Monster Hunter, how could that be bad? Easy. The development team is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.The game mechanics are slugish and unresponsive making the game slow and stiff. This becomes an issue durring the many glitched boss fights, fights that are nearly impossibly without a second players help to exploit the boss' patterns.  This is to say, the game is hard. But not hard in a way like Dark Souls or Mario, where it is your fault when you die, but in the most unfair of ways. A good example is a later level where there are falling platforms over spikes and offscreeen enemys fire at you durring your jump arc from one falling platform to another. Your options are get shot and take damage, or fall and take damage. This is my issue with the developers. Between being too lazy to fix old content before adding in things nobody asked for like pizza statues for a tent that serves no purpose and pulling bull♥♥♥♥♥♥like making art and stories for each member of the playable characters team only to tell the players who bought the game excited to play as them that they are all dead in the story and the guy and girl characters are the only ones you can play and you should be happy about it. Oh, but they had enough time and money to make the sprite art for their own personal sprites for a circle jerk achivement at the end of the game. All developer ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t aside. Is the game good? No. Any of the Metal Slug games are a better purchace for the same or cheaper price. The only thing this game does new is blend RPG progression with a slow and stiff side scrolling shooter, and it doesn't even do that well.			"

												I thought this game would be fun. I was wrong- It is slow paced. - The enemies respawn as soon as I leave the area. So I go to my right and then quickly go back and I am hit by the same enemy I killed a few seconds ago.- I cannot kill the enemies unless I shoot them (something like in metalslug where you could kill an enemy with a knife if he was too close).- The reload takes a long time. - There is no running I have to go at a brisk pace all the time. (except when I roll)It's just not a fun game.			"

												Desperately bad gameplay, technically garbage pixel platform shooter.There's no words to express how sad, frustrating and unfin this game is.Just to give you an idea of why this is worse than explosive vomit in your face:80% of the game difficulty is in the fact that enemies appear everywhere... but you can't fire diagonally, and your shots from below don't rail through the geometry they're standing in...so you have to jump repeatedly in the face of every shooting enemy to kill them.Additionally, once you move 5 meters away from their position and get back, they respawn.Steer away from this pile of rubbish on fire.

												Many of you are probably leery (as I was) about dropping 20 bucks on this game. I hope that this review will help you make your decision. The game is certainly not for everyone, but I will go into it's pros and cons shortly.First, I would like to adress many of the complaints I have seen in other reviews. Many seem to think that the controls are clunky. This is true- at first. after 30 minutes or so of gameplay, the controls seemed natural to me. If they really bother you, you can always remap them quite easily. I also read many reviews which stated that the jumping seemed unresponsive. The only time I have noticed this is when I have attempted to jumo when in a prone position (laying down). Otherwise, the jumping mechanic seems just fine to me. Some also complain about the reusing of maps. I can certainly see why some people may become irritated by this, but it doesn't bother me. Since you're always completing a different mission, the maps do not seem too repetitive. Let me just say that Mercenary Kings is a fantastic game that deserves a lot more attention than it is currently getting. The retro-style gameplay combined with the endless weapon customization makes for one of the most enjoyable gameplay experiences I've had. The character animations are worthy of an award, and the maps and backgrounds look fantastic. I'm not too far into the campaign, but so far it has been fantastic. At first, it may seem overly difficult, but if you just do some part swapping with your gun, you should be fine. I will update this review with some of my favorite beginner weapon setups soon.The only thing I have found irritating about this game is the lack of a chat menu in multiplayer games. This is extremely minor, however, and will most likely be fixed in a later update. Overall, I would highly reccomend this game to anyone looking for a great retro-style gaming experience. It's well worth the $20. I hope this review was helpful to all of you ladies and mentlegen. 13/10Let's kick some CLAW!			"

Weapons can be customized and can range from ak-47's to toilets that can shoot lazer beams. Sky's the limit to what you can craft, and with a slew of missions and wonderfully designed characters as well as a story traight out of a saturday morning cartoon; the team that brought us the Scott Pilgrim game have worked their magic once again to deliver another neo retro hit.

												Ok.. so since this game became available for sale, I was thinking ""Yeah that game looks pretty good, kind of like metal slug... which I really like.... hmmmm to get it or not to get it...to get it or not to get it..""   So it comes on sale during the 2014 summer sale.  It was the last purchase I made during that sale, and wow am I glad I did!I absolutely LOVE this game, the gameplay totally reminds me of the old days playing megaman on the NES/SNES.  I'm totally loving this game, there are only a couple tiny drawbacks for me.  They are almost insignifigant but I guess being that nothing in this world is perfect, here we go with MK's.  The local Multiplayer screens make it kind of hard to see anything as it shrinks things to 1/4 of the regular size... not a huge deal to me personally, the only time it bugs me is if I'm playing the game with my wife on our living room TV.  It's still totally fun to play, I guess the solution could be -GET A BIGGER TV!!  Lol.. not a big deal so whatever.  The other thing... HAVE MORE PLAYABLE CHARACTERS!  Yeah, the two they have are great, I love them, but I'd have loved to see more selectable characters... All in all, its an absolutely WONDERFUL game.  The pros (in my opinion) FAR outweigh the cons and had I known it would have been so much fun I would have bought it for full price a while back, but I'm not complaining that I got such a great game at a discount!!PLEASE make more games like this one!  I'll be all over MK2 if it promises the same great experience as this one did! "

												A reboot of those old-school action packed platformers. But with RPG elements, like crafting your own prefered equipment. Sounds good right? Well this game is not very good. It is boring.The problem is threefold:- you now need to ""grind"" materials for upgrades. And then you need to build a bunch of random stuff to unlock proficiencies. I got bored with this system and the available options about 10 missions in. Surely late game stuff might be nice and all, it is an unattractive system early on. Especially because you have no idea where you should be farming in the first place.- the maps are the same, over and over again. Same enemies, but that is not all, they are applied in a very repetetive way as well. Sniper on a ledge where you need to get close, rifleman jumping down on you, spearmen attacking from above, drill in a hole, metal drone when you zipline down. Repeat 20 times every stage. There, spoiled the first 3 maps, on which you do at least 3-5 missions each. Boring and annoying.- the ""quests"" you get to do are boring. Gather 10 of this. (random drops or in boxes, so walk around the entire map. Again) Go to this NPC. And even the Boss, which could have been interesting, is annoying and boring. He moves from the scene at random. So you have to go through the level you got to know by heart by now, AGAIN to find he moves away after just one attack, so you have to track him down AGAIN.Oh and it gets worse: Then you get to do that boss AGAIN. Same map, same fight, but now you have to finish with a shock grenade. Which is the first time you get to use these, they are hard to use, you get only three, so then if you fail to get it right 3 times, you can just as well go and restart the map. After two runs so facing and beating this boss 3 times I had enough.No more waiting in an infirmary for 50 seconds (!?!) to heal up, no more cleaning up / skipping the same enemies 20 times over and finding that you have 50/9 for one craftin component and 1/2 out of some random rare drop you never can seem to find.3/10, would not be bored by again.

												Cute and fun game that's an awesome experience in co-op. Takes a lot of influence from old classics (Contra, Mega Man, Metal Slug), but also includes features inspired by newer titles. There's lots of background and secrets, and the crafting system is pretty extensive (though I agree with the disappointment of some other reviewers of the locked gun-type paths).One critical thing I have to note though, to be able to enjoy this game, you're definitely required to have compatible gamepads!

												I highly recommend this game to anyone who was, or is, a fan of metal slug. This game uses similar mechanics, but also does away with intsa-death, for you and your enemies.It also adds further depth with customization options, such as knife-type, gun-types, ammo-types, and bionic mods (akin to passive boosts).Although the campaign does run a acceptable length of time, some people may find the levels repetitive - you are required to do several missions (about 7) per area, and you will revisit the same areas. There are 108 enemies, so enemies repeat. The music is great though, I certainly didn't mind listening to the same track often. Overall, I'd say that even though the game has some repetitive elements, I found it very enjoyable, completed the game, and did not regret a single hour of my time. If you're a fan of 2D platform-shooters, this is definitely for you!			"

												An amazingly welldone game that has proven to be quite enthralling in my view. The platforming wasn't too much of a challenge but can get tedious at parts, but I never gave up. The story was interesting, and kept me hooked on it. I rarely skipped missions just to rank up and feel like it was well worth it.Corresponding with the levels, the music was truly amazing to hear. Never did I try to turn it down to listen to something else. Co-op seems balanced, but can add much more a challenge for those unprepared. Sharing lives can become harsh and the HP buff for the enemies can be a bit ridiculous compared to the overall damage players can spew out, so be warned when playing with 4 people.My one problem though is farming the materials you need for certain weapon parts, sometimes you have to farm for hours to get what you want, but will only make you feel more accomplished after you achieve it.Overall, this is truly a great game, with hours of gameplay to be put into it. Go and defeat CLAW once and for all!			"

												Crafting is one of the worst plagues upon modern gaming, and here is one of its worst itinerations.  The missions often take place in the same few maps, merely putting the start and finish lines in different areas.  The reload mechanic is completely out of place in a game like this.  Boss fights are the worst because said bosses will randomly leave the area and require you to track them down anew.  The music is a confused mess, unsure of whether it wants to go full chiptune or not.  The overall goal is also muddled; the game rewards you for speedrunning missions, and also for taking time to explore and fulfill extra objectives, leaving players wondering if they should just play all the missions twice.  The gun customization is really lacking; most ammo types are unavailable unless you specifically build you gun to accept them, and nearly every combination slows your character's movement to an unplayable crawl.It says a lot about the overall quality of the game that I can still recommend it, despite these awful downsides.  However, this is a very tentative recommendation; I bet there's plenty of people out there that would take those as enough red flags to stay away from Mercenary Kings.  Just download Cheat Engine and hack yourself a huge stockpile of crafting materials, and you'll enjoy the game so much more, I promise.			"

												This game is like a Metal Slug Platformer with a Health bar and lives. I love it!The Sprites are done by the most awesome guy, Paul Robertson who also did the Scott Pilgrim vs the world sprites.The Music sounds very 16-bit mixed with modern Instrments, I could be wrong!The Bad guys are all creative and have a different ways to try and kill you!I haven't played the online mode, but I'm sure it's fun!The downside I have the is the boss units stay while in certain area and dissapear as soon as you get there It's Annoying!But overall I give this Game a 9.5/10 Grab some friends and kill some people! This game is AWESOME we need games like this!			"

												I don't know if I'm just bad at this game or it's just how it's programmed. Right off the back, the game's art style is the major thing that caught my attention. This game's art style is very well done, one of the few positives of this game. Now the gameplay functions and works fine. It takes a while for you to understand the controls completely before going into action. Now my biggest gripe about this game is the gameplay and level design itself. For starters, the first missions prove to be more difficult than I'd imagined for the first ones in the game itself. The game gives little to no indicators of what you're doing and where you're supposed to go; so you have to back-track over and over again. The first level itself is terribly bland and average in design, and enemy placement is a whole other story. Sometimes enemies will be placed in the most inconvient places, and will force you to take huge amounts of damage. As an insult to injury, you will lose a chunk of money you will earn by completing the mission. When you die too many times the mission will end and you will be taken back to the main hub. It seems like the game is punishing you by not giving you any variety of weapons to buy, even at the first three missions, making it incredibly difficult to beat any of the missions. I don't know how the game is further in deph, since I dropped my controller and turned it off after attempting the first three missions and failing all of them at least twice. Overall I do not recommend this game to anyone who will play it alone, it is clearly meant for co-op, if they can even manage to scrape the surface of the first three missions.			"

												Boiling it down to ""Metal Slug meets Borderlands"" is a pretty good way to sum it up, though not perfect: while equipment (namely, gun) choices can have an insane level of variety and custimation, there's no random generation involved like borderlands. Each gun part has specific stats, the parts needed to craft them consistently drop from certain foes or items boxes in a given mission. The only RNG involved is hoping a monster will drop the material you need from the 2-4 predefined drops in their loot pool.All in all, Mercenary Kings takes old school, tough side-scrolling shooters of the past (think metal slug, contra) and blends it with more modern RPG customization elements. Gear selection in a sidescroller isn't all that new, just look all the way back to river city ransom, but the incredible level of customization you can access to make cool guns definitely gives it a modern touch and adds a lot of depth. Add an enjoyable semi-retro 2D sprite art-style, a fun story/setting that doesn't take itself too seriously, and last but not least, local and online co-op,  and you have a well-rounded game with a lot of replay value.

												A solid 2D action game.  Some may describe it as a run and gun, but it has a much more deliberate pace.  While the learning curve may initially be a bit steep, the game provides a moderate challenge all the way through.  Rush or play carelessly and you will be punished.  The game expects you to learn the patterns of your enemies.  Positioning and purposeful movement are key.  The controls are crisp, but a controller would be highly recommended in this case.  I played using a Wii U Pro controller.It is broken up into short missions which can usually be completed in 5-10 minutes each.  These missions are on a timer, but for the most part these timers are very generous.  However, if you are the kind of player who cannot stand having time limits you may want to avoid this game.  The missions come in a number of varieties.  Collect materials, kill a boss, clear out the enemies, or reach a destination.The art is incredibly well done, the entire game looks great.  The sound track can be quite catchy too.  The presentation is superb in every way.The gun crafting system is can be quite entertaining for those who like to tinker.  While initially the options are limited after completing a few ranks you can start mising and matching.  Machine guns that shoot bouncy balls, fire based shotguns, and electric homing missile machine guns are all possible.  You can find a weapon to suit your style.  While Shotguns and Sniper Rifles are a bit dominate in the early game as you progress pretty much everything becomes viable.If you are willing to put in a little effort to learn the game it will be a solid experience.  However, you need to be ready for a game that can be a bit challenging and does not hold your hand.			"

												Highly recommended to fans of Paul Robertson's work, especially the ""Kings of Power 4 billion %"" video.The crafting (guns, mods, and knives) is suprisingly robust; when you start to figure out exactly what gun part you want to enable which ammunition it immediately starts feeling like shades of Monster Hunter games, trying to figure out which armor part you want to get that skill at 100%.Jumping and movement feel clunky by modern standards, and the pacing and overall design of the later levels can be tedious and lead to a lot of fustration; again, by modern standards.  They seem to have taken cues from games like Megaman in their design choices, such as enemies that respawn when you leave the screen or levels that require a lot of precise jumping with awkward control.  This obviously can be good or bad, depending on your personal preference.			"

												Mercenary Kings is a pretty weird game in how it mixes the old and new in game design. Side-scrolling 2D shoot-em-up? Check. Gorgeous, elaborate pixel art? Check.

One minute i'm using a tried and true machine gun design, next minute i'm blasting my enemies away with a toliet shotgun. Only real gripe is the standard control setup which is aqwardly mashed together on your keyboard, though once I remapped the keys from the main menu I could more easily blast away the adorable puppy dog tank boss.9/10 Do Recommend			"

												Pretty good game. At first I was incredibly impressed by how polished and wonderful it looks (because it does - it has that fantastic Metal Slug feel to its presentation), and by how fun the simple gameplay is. It's a lot of fun to traverse the non-linear levels, and most enemies are pretty fun to fight and kill.However, after playing for a few hours, I started to realize how much content is recycled, and how tiring it got that every mission is just a fetch quest. On the same couple of levels. This hit especially hard when I played a mission where you have to hunt down a boss that keeps escaping to different points on the level, making him almost impossible to find let alone kill (I had to find him four times in random spots before I was able to wear him down). A few missions later, they recycled the *exact* same boss and level, with the only difference being that you had to stun and capture him or something.I really wish the game didn't have so much excess padding, because it could've been one of my favorite indie titles ever. I have a few other gripes, such as the fact that it's pretty bad at explaining how all the customization works, and if you finish the main objective in a level you get no chance to finish the secondary before leaving. Also, the reload mechanic slows down the pace a lot, and makes single-shot guns very unfun.Still, it's a strong game at its core, and tons of fun outside of the annoying moments. It's not worth its full price because you're gonna get sick of it pretty fast, but on a sale for like 3-5€? Sure.			"

												Mercenary Kings is one of the few games that depicts how only a few mechanics can throw a monkey wrench into what could have been a great game. From the start you are given a game that is a mix of Monster Hunter,Metal Slug, and a dash of Gears of War. In theory this sounds quite awesome! In practice it shows how each one of these mechanics can work against each other.      Starting with the Monster Hunter mechanic of finding loot to craft new guns, this forces the player to grind in a side scrolling shooter. At first it dose not seem to be an issue up until you face the 2nd boss in which kill you. Or in most cases, will time you out. Causes you to replay stages for better weapons because bosses in the game can run away from you if you don't kill them fast enough. Next is the two other mechanics described in which can work against each other.    Due the reload mechanic you will be taking shots and you have no way to defend yourself. This could have been fixed with an instant reload rather than the timed reload. Adding another layer of frusteration. I tried going in wanting to love it. Even through the time on greenlight I tried holding hope. Sadly I can't say it is fun sadly. I give Mercenary Kings a 6.5/10.			"

It was fun to see all the work that goes into polishing up a game for it's finished version.If you enjoy 2-d platformers and fun & unique games, definitely get it. It takes it roots from old school games like Metal Slug and Contra, but brings its own personality and style to it so that it's not a rip off. It's easy to see where Mercenary King comes from, but it's definitely it's own game. The crafting system is a lot of fun and allows a player to set their own difficulty level by creating weak or strong guns as well as carrying a lot of weight, which will slow down and hinder the player.

All joking aside this is a good action platformer, but it's RPG elements are a little lacking, these same RPG elements slow the game down, and were at time very confusing, before I stopped playing, there was one element of the customization that left me scratchinng my head and that was the ammo capacity of my guns affecting the damage each shot does.  On reflection, I would rather play Contra or Metal Slug over this game as it stands.			"

												Fantastically fun, delightfully addictive, visually charming, reasonably challenging, compellingly deep. The gameplay is very reminiscent of side scrolling action games like Metal Slug, but with material drops on enemy kills and in chests, etc. Rather than build levels in the traditional sense, your ranking and what missions you have completed determine what missions are available,  what areas are available, and what weapon parts become available as progress is made; Therein lies the sense of progression and accomplishment. You’ll find yourself repeating missions to farm certain materials, but the grind never really feels repetitive. Building new gun parts and outfitting the new crafted weapons with new ammunition is always fun. The build your own weapon mechanic is surprisingly deep as there is no one right way to build. Same goes for crafting the knife weapons, though they are a little more straightfoward. Fun all around, no complaints, would recommend.			"

												If you liked the metal slug series, I bet you that you would like this.  It is a platform arcade shooter, similar to metal slug, but with RPG elements.  You start in a hub, and you can select missions where not only do you complete objectives, but gather amterials enemies drops.  These materials you could use to upgrade armor (health), build mods (add effects to your character), and craft gun parts which you could then customize the look and functionality of your gun.So far, it's only early access.  It only has 60 missions, but later will have 100.  Hopefully we get to see more options for your gun, like choose the shooting tiype (like rapid fire, spread, etc).  There is local coop, and online coop.  Idk if onlnie works, it seems to hang on ""joining...""  It's probably just me though.  Wish there was more character customization.  So far you can choose male or female, and color scheme.  Would be nice to be able to just change colors of clothes, hair and skin seperately, with more color choices.It's still a great game to pick up  though.			"

												This game isn't what you think it is.  You probably think it's Metal Slug with customizable guns, which sounds fantastic.  I'd love to play that game.  That's not what this is.  You're not going to run around like a maniac blowing up everything around you.  What you're actually going to do is move carefully forward so you don't get hit, explore every corner of the map over and over, and ultimately get tired and give up.  The main gameplay loop is that you have to move carefully or take damage, which is *very* expensive to repair, and many of the missions involve finding 10 of something on the map...and there's only 10 to find.  And they're not listed on the map.  So you end up exploring the map over and over until you have 9 of 10 collected and you can't find the last one, so you end up going over and over the map, taking damage and dying until eventually you either run out of lives or out of time, and these missions aren't short.  You will put a HUGE ammount of time into these missions and fail them over and over.  Plus you can't alt-tab out of the game, so you can't even look at FAQs or maps to help you.  The game doesn't make you feel strong, it makes you feel like a chump.  The grind takes forever and unless you enjoy finding items scattered and hidden all over the same map over and over, you'll eventually grow to hate it.  I did.  I can't recommend this game.			"

												I just love how someone finally took what Metal Slug was and built upon its gameplay while customization to the weaponry and characters and on top of that it allows you to save those things at last.

												A reboot of those old-school action packed platformers. But with RPG elements, like crafting your own prefered equipment. Sounds good right? Well this game is not very good. It is boring.The problem is threefold:- you now need to ""grind"" materials for upgrades. And then you need to build a bunch of random stuff to unlock proficiencies. I got bored with this system and the available options about 10 missions in. Surely late game stuff might be nice and all, it is an unattractive system early on. Especially because you have no idea where you should be farming in the first place.- the maps are the same, over and over again. Same enemies, but that is not all, they are applied in a very repetetive way as well. Sniper on a ledge where you need to get close, rifleman jumping down on you, spearmen attacking from above, drill in a hole, metal drone when you zipline down. Repeat 20 times every stage. There, spoiled the first 3 maps, on which you do at least 3-5 missions each. Boring and annoying.- the ""quests"" you get to do are boring. Gather 10 of this. (random drops or in boxes, so walk around the entire map. Again) Go to this NPC. And even the Boss, which could have been interesting, is annoying and boring. He moves from the scene at random. So you have to go through the level you got to know by heart by now, AGAIN to find he moves away after just one attack, so you have to track him down AGAIN.Oh and it gets worse: Then you get to do that boss AGAIN. Same map, same fight, but now you have to finish with a shock grenade. Which is the first time you get to use these, they are hard to use, you get only three, so then if you fail to get it right 3 times, you can just as well go and restart the map. After two runs so facing and beating this boss 3 times I had enough.No more waiting in an infirmary for 50 seconds (!?!) to heal up, no more cleaning up / skipping the same enemies 20 times over and finding that you have 50/9 for one craftin component and 1/2 out of some random rare drop you never can seem to find.3/10, would not be bored by again.

												Cute and fun game that's an awesome experience in co-op. Takes a lot of influence from old classics (Contra, Mega Man, Metal Slug), but also includes features inspired by newer titles. There's lots of background and secrets, and the crafting system is pretty extensive (though I agree with the disappointment of some other reviewers of the locked gun-type paths).One critical thing I have to note though, to be able to enjoy this game, you're definitely required to have compatible gamepads!

												I highly recommend this game to anyone who was, or is, a fan of metal slug. This game uses similar mechanics, but also does away with intsa-death, for you and your enemies.It also adds further depth with customization options, such as knife-type, gun-types, ammo-types, and bionic mods (akin to passive boosts).Although the campaign does run a acceptable length of time, some people may find the levels repetitive - you are required to do several missions (about 7) per area, and you will revisit the same areas. There are 108 enemies, so enemies repeat. The music is great though, I certainly didn't mind listening to the same track often. Overall, I'd say that even though the game has some repetitive elements, I found it very enjoyable, completed the game, and did not regret a single hour of my time. If you're a fan of 2D platform-shooters, this is definitely for you!			"

												Mercenary Kings is like Metal Slug combined with Monster Hunter, executed to near perfection. Gameplay is tight, visuals are gorgeous, and the customization is top notch. The only negatives are that enemy variety is certainly lacking, and sometimes the pacing can drag. It's got local and online multiplayer as well and is an absolute blast with friends. Amazing game all around.			"

I'm talking nice gazong zongs and an even more impressive booty. Well, I decide to book it to class as fast as possible so I can sit down and hide my hard-on. I round the corner to the class room real fast, to fast to notice said hot teacher bending over picking up some papers she had dropped near the door. What transpired next was the single most memorable one pump dry hump of my life as my boner collided with her pertruding booty. This is a good game!			"

												This is Metal Slug shooting meets Risk of Rain level-crawling with a hearty helping of Loadout-style weapon crafting. Slightly difficult to get used to the controls at first, as the character takes a brief second to jump, and you only have 4 directions you can aim. The levels feel a little repetitive, as the levels have multipule missions within a single area to complete, ranging from killing certain amounts of specific enemies, to collecting crafting materials, or simply talking to an NPC on the map. Some minor annoyances are enemies respawning the moment they leave the screen, and the limited aiming range, but for a side-scrolling shooter with up to 4-player multiplayer capabilities, there's quite alot to offer.

The pacing of the game is all around perfect giving you enough time to explore the worlds they make but still haivng a time limit give a sense of urgency. There are so many NPC's to talk to and get new items such as food that gives you temporary boosts, a place to buy usables in a mission such as healthpacks, a place to buy mods that help your character, and much more. Of course the best part of this game is the ablity to mix and match oarts for your weapon to make a gun that truly fits your playing style. Want a gun that acts like a shotgun but has a machinegun clip go ahead, want a gun that looks like a trombone, why not right. And of course you will get to use all of these varied weapons on the extremely varied enemies and bosses in the game that are too many to count. Play this game by yourself or with friends either way will be a challenge that you can enjoy.			"

												Can't currently recommend this game.  Way too many flaws, but the first few (oh so generic) missions are very poorly timed, in my opinion.  The core game play should and could be better with some tweaks, such as giving 8 direction shooting and holding a button down to stand still and shoot.  I bought it early on a recommendation from a friend, but this is certainly no Metal Slug.  Not even close.  Perhaps the final build of the game will correct some glaring flaws, otherwise it was NOT $15 well spent.			"

												I bought this game in Early Access and quickly played through all the available missions. At one point I was disappointed at the lack of new weapons as the game progressed but when I checked back again even that problem was solved with an update, the weapon count had probably doubled. So I made myself a couple of Magnum-shotguns (not making this up!), a pistol that would shoot armor-piercing shrapnel once the ammo was possible to obtain (It needs a material that doesn't drop yet, Quality Steel or something) and Anti-Materiel rounds that have yet to see a weapon that can fire them. Can't wait for the full game, I'll probably 100% it.TotalBiscuit described this game as ""Metal Slug meets Monster Hunter"" and I agree. The Monster Hunter part comes from all the crafting. Biomods, melee weapons, guns, ornaments... everything apart from your supplies has to be crafted from materials that drop from enemies and crates scattered across different missions and especially with some materials you WILL have to farm them. (Like those surprisingly special ""regular pins"".) The magnum shotguns I mentioned before required parts that only drop from big story bosses. Speaking of bosses, they are as classic as they get. Very punishing if you don't know what you're doing (the first time always hurts) but once you have their patterns down with some good reflexes it's as easy as breathing.The keyboard bindings need some work but luckily you can bind any key to whatever you want. I recommend using a controller, though.			"

												If you have friends, local or online this is a pretty fun game to just play. The grind for some drops in this game is awful if you wanted to get a specific part to make a certain gun build work in the early game. i recommend you beat all the primary missions as fast as possible to unlock all the better gun parts that are compatable with different ammo types and weigh less. The fun mostly comes from making crazy gun combinations that can destroy everything, but you can try to challenge yourself by using the first pistol receiver you start with exclusively and play each primary mission like it was a metal slug game.

												So far so good!  For the old school gamers who came up on platform shooters like Contra, you'll LOVE this.  It's as if Contra, Metal Slug, and Loadout made a baby.  I know I often mash up games like this for my review, but I like to be as vivid as possible to make sure you fully understand.  The basics of Contra, the humor and style of Metal Slug, and the customization of Loadout is what you will get.  Unlike platformers I've played in the past, this one allows each player to take their own path!  No more compromising on which way to go first so that the other player doesn't get killed or stuck by the edge of the screen.  The only downside to it so far, is the time limit for each mission.  There's so much I want to explore within the level, and it's easy to forget about the time limit on completing your objective.			"

												Light recommendation. The game itself is awesome, and the idea of making your gun out of just random crap is actually really cool and works very well - especially when you start unlocking crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's a light recommendation because of the fact that there are SOME missions that are just downright stupid. When I have to speedrun a huge level in four minutes just to find a door that I NEED to use my C4 on (which takes up one of my limited two item slots), it gets sort of annoying. The game is good, but some missions are going to infuriate you. But it's still worth it.			"

												Mercenary Kings is an interesting game. It takes Metal Slug style graphics and gameplay, introduces an almost Monster Hunter style crafting system, and a fun skill-based reloading system that can jam your gun or give you extra damage. I love the soundtrack, sounding at times like a cross between Mega Man and Doom. I love the variety of guns and builds. I had a ton of fun playing this game and you may too if all this sounds appealing to you.However, the game is not perfect. As many have stated, the levels and missions can be very repetitive. Much of the game consists of exploring the map, collecting items, saving NPCs, and fighting mini-bosses. There isn't really much storyline or variety in gameplay at all. The price is a bit steep for what you're getting here, but I personally love the game regardless. Wait until it goes on sale or goes in a bundle and try it out if you think the pros outweigh the cons.			"

												I got this in the July 2015 ""Humble Bundle"" and was pleasantly surprised at how much fun this game packs in.  It's essentially a mix of Metal Slug and Mega Man with a crafting system thrown in.  The levels are fun, the RPG elements of upgrading and creating gear keeps things interesting, and the overall experience will keep you playing.  The missions are timed which turns off most new players... but you'll grow accustomed to it--and, ultimately, the timer provides a necessary sense of urgency to the game.			"

												I got Mercenary Kings during the current Humble Bundle. I've never given the game thought. So, I looked at it and said that I would try it. I was honestly impressed that I haven't tried it before. The interchanging guns, the humor, and the artwork really stands out in my eyes. Seeing pictures and playing the game are two different perspectives, I hope to see another game the studio who created this in a simliar fashion. It's a must play in my book.			"

												Really wanted to like this game.  Unfortunately the time limits sap the fun out of playing missions at your own place to discover items, and the positioning of the attack/projectiles fired from your guns make it bothersome having to do too much just to figure out the geometry when landing shots on enemies.  Hard to explain but it just isn't as fun as it looks.			"

												Once this thing is out, this game could be my jam.  Right now, it's real early access and needs a bit of polish, but the fundamentals are there.  It's a side-scrolling shooter with a randomly generated hunting ground kind of thing where you collect loots for crafting and whatever, but none of that was really completed by the time I got into this game.  The music and visuals are fantastic, and I'll be checking back in on it regularly to see how it's coming along, because this game has a lot of potential.			"

												This game is basically Contra + Monster Hunter.  If that sounds interesting, give it a chance.  It's definitely a game I had to get used to and wasn't what I expected at first.  After you learn the game's mission structure and figure out how to customize your gear (which is fun), it gets pretty addictive.  It does seem weird how enemies respawn at first, but then you realize it's by design.  There's also some other minor annoyances, like not being able to change sound volumes in a mission, or having the reload system explained, or even being able to just ""restart mission""?  If these things are available I just didn't find them.  Regardless, I like how Tribute tried to make a unique title, and I feel they succeeded.			"

												I want to like this game. I found the first level quite fun, it reminded me a lot of Metal Slug, and i was told that the gun part system is really quite cool. But here's the main issue: it just doesn't work for many people, including myself.After the first level, i found the screen flashing black, and elements of my hud turning completely black as well, as if my graphics driver was crashing, but it wasn't? And now, everytime i launch the game, i find a new graphical error. Once, the title screen was suddenly a black and white spritesheet. Another time, it was flickering in a way that made it look like an Old CRT TV before going black. ETC. And if you check the forums, many others are having a similar problem. Some people say that running it without the steam overlay and in windowed fixes it, but it honestly didn't for me, or for many others. According to the devs they ""can't replicate it on their side"" meaning it was probably ONLY tested on their hardware, and this bug is really purely luck based as to if you'll have to deal with it or not. And, because of this bug, the game is basically unplayable. If the devs figure it out, then i'd probably recommend it, but in it's current state of flip flopping depending on your hardware, i can't.			"

So you already know it's got awesome sprite works and animations.Now take into account it's heavily inspired by Metal Slug, and then add in a bunch of exploratative and RPG style elements, weapon customisability (literally building guns by sticking random parts together), various crafting systems for new weapons) and missions which go beyond just 'go from A to B and kill everything in between oh and don't die'.Now imagine you can get that game on Steam and it's amazing.Well it's all true and it is amazing and why aren't you buying it now.

												The bad:- Controls are really clunky. The response time from jump button pressed to actual jump happening takes a second. You literally need to see into the future in order to jump over bullets.- Reload system is the bane of this gameSeriously, having a Guitar Hero ""Press reload as the cursor hits green"" system is just distracting. I have to dodge 4 bullets in a row and if I don't press the reload button my reload time will get longer, and if i press wrongly my gun jams? That's just punishing, no matter how you debate this. And this happened on the first mission already.- Item pickup. I see the need to share the crafting materials amongst friends but isn't trading after battle more intuitive? What's more, you have to go over to the item, press down to pick it up, and risk getting shot at from a one-eyed joe from far. It really is punishing to collect items for crafting.- Confusing. Map. System.Many of the rooms exist in the game to pad the gametime. Really. 6 rooms that exist for no good reason are there just so they can hide a hostage in one of them. And the map doesn't really help considering that the map doesn't indicate clearly which doorway links to the next map. It serves to confuse.- Confusing. Objectives.I know your testers have played this game a million times, but at least let a first timer know how a HOSTAGE looks like? When was the last time you saw a commando take off to save the President without knowing how he LOOKS like?And while we are on the missions, why do I need to go over to the helicopter to start the mission when the Colonel already yelled at me to start the mission? Isn't that a wrapper within a wrapper of a candy? And its always a conensus in multiplayer that when someone starts a mission, everyone wants the mission to-go? You already did the ""press A"" confirmation at character select, you can always do it again for mission selection.- Some scenary really stands out. Too much.Some of the wooden pillars blend in too well with the foreground so much so that I mistook them as platforms. And died. This becomes a game of memory rather than a platformer reflex shooter.The Good:- Artstyle.The lighthearted style gives you the remniscent Metal Gear nostalgia: Light hearted fun, run 'n' gun, nothing much to think about.- The Gun.The RPG style of upgrading your gun and your knife gives you the warm fuzzy feeling every RPG player has known and love. Though the ingredients farming can get grindy at times.Overall, this game lacks the polish of Metal Slug that it clearly is inspired by. The gun upgrade adds flavour to the game but as a reflex Run'n'Gun player, this game fails to live up to my expectation mainly due to its lack of responsive controls and disruption of flow of the gameplay. Mainly, the reload mechanism. Seriously, remove it. The boost isn't even worth hitting the Green Area.			"

												Fun action platformer for both singleplayer and co-op.Positives:- Most of the overall gameplay and design- Graphics- Local and online co-op- Feel of achievement- Soundtrack- Setting/""story""- Crafting system (for the most part)- The game has a good amount of different enemies and customization availableNegatives:- Somewhat annoying spawn system. Sometimes you can get hit by a enemy coming from behind the screen when you are avoiding bullets that way...among other things.- To get everything, you might have to grind a lot - this can make the game repetitive- Achievements that probably require you to repeat MANY missions (unless you were going for them from the start)- Some achievements do not register correctly.- It can be hard to get some materials for crafting (usually the boss ones = more repetition) and if you make ornaments or banners, they don't really show off much. you are basically making 20+ different ornaments and 20+ different banners just to place 2 of them in AND on your tent (1+1).8/10 - has a bit too much repetition for 100% completion, spawn system can be unfair (you often get blocked by spawning npcs just because you moved a little bit to the other direction before jumping somewhere, taking damage)			"

												4.5/5Couch-co-op on 1 computer is a big plus!!Metal Slug meets weapon customization and persistent gain.Overall pace is less chaotic than Metal Slug, allowing for a little more forethought and a lot more freedom of movement. IMO this is a nice pace and the game has more depth than simple arcade how-far-can-you-make-it.The weapon customization is balanced in a way that encourages trying different types and changing your playstyle, while still allowing you to choose what you like (2 shot hand cannon? homing AP machinegun?)Most levels are fun singleplayer, though few can be frustrating and would be a lot easier with more people (1-4 player)I'm using Better DS3 and 2 ps3 controllers to couch co-op with my roommate.

												Modern Contra, Metal Slug call it as you want its nicely done oldschool game with crafting system... <3On the other hand time limited missions which repeats maps + enemies spawning at your backs, falling on your head taking more of your time. But its still an apetizer for Hardcore gamers. One thing though... Missions with catching the boss... I dont know who thought this might be good idea but its not. It was soo far most infurating moment of the game, if you have to walk through whole map to catch god damn random spawning boss. You may get to the place where he is in one minute but then he will just disappear and spawn on the other side of the map. GJ you just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me of with that.Soo far game has much of a lost potential.			"

												A dastardly cross of  gameplay from Metal Slug and Contra, with more RPG typical features like persistent equipment, crafting, and character upgrades. Interesting gun mechanics, and pretty slick 16-bit (ish) aesthetics make it a delight to play. The story is pretty minimal, but the writing is very funny, and continual references to other games make for great ""AH! I GET IT! THAT'S FROM _____!"" moments. Also: local and online co-op. It has both. The game doesn't change at all between solo and co-op play however, so everything becomes much easier with others.BUT: somewhat repetitive. There are over 100 individual objective based missions, but they take place on a much smaller number of actual maps, and going around the same maps many times can get boring. Add in the farming that inevitably occurs when you're trying to get parts for a specific gun part or implant or knife, and it can get a little tedious.Overall great game, especially for fans of old school run and gun sidescrolling shooters.

												Highly reccomend this game, especially if you have atleast one friend to play with. I picked this up in a humble bundle but i honestly could and would pay full price for a game of this quality. Art, music, and the gameplay are all amazing, and complement each other nicely. Also, it is a game that allows you to upgrade everything almost, which i am a huge fan of. Definitely worth buying.			"

												When I first saw the game, I thought it would be quite similar to Metal Slug with focus in customizable weapon. I couldn't be more wrong. The game could have been great, but little things pile up and inhibits me from actually enjoying th gameFrom little I have played, the game will require♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of grinding. The weapon you start out is complete utter garbage and it is really unsatisfying. I tried to modify it with little resource I have, but I think I made the gun worse some how. Vast majority of the enmies take 5~10 hits which contradicted with what I expected from arcady style game. While that is perfectly fine, enemies respawn for no reason. There is very little incentive for me to kill enemies. Why bother? They are going to respawn anyway. Also, why do I have to pick up items by pressing down? Was it necessary to force players input to pick up items on the ground?? Lastly, I am disappointed by the animation quality during game play. While I am not a huge stickler in graphics, but come on! The designers should be better than to have characters 'freeze' while bullets fire out from their guns. Bad animation combined with utter lack of damage the guns are so unsatisfying to shoot with. Overall, if you want to purchase a game similar to Metal Slug, this game is NOT it. You might enjoy this game if you can survive the grind the game forces you to go through and understand the overly complicated gun customization.			"

												Light recommendation. The game itself is awesome, and the idea of making your gun out of just random crap is actually really cool and works very well - especially when you start unlocking crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's a light recommendation because of the fact that there are SOME missions that are just downright stupid. When I have to speedrun a huge level in four minutes just to find a door that I NEED to use my C4 on (which takes up one of my limited two item slots), it gets sort of annoying. The game is good, but some missions are going to infuriate you. But it's still worth it.			"

												The review that mentions about this game is not Metal Slug is the most accurate description of this game. However, if that doesn't stop you from thinking about buying this game, then there is a decent amount of fun to be had. While some parts are quite a grind, and once you get past the earlier levels the game really opens up and allows you to figure out your own playstyle. Some of the guns can be quite fun for if you want to have a toilet gun you can, or if you want to have a shotgun that shoot ice spikes you can. The draw back is that you might have to grind alittle a bit to unlock those guns.			"

If you love Metal Slug style gameplay but wanted a RPG elment to your weapons and character leveling up this is for you.I would say the mission can get reapative but the grind for loot and upgrades is one og the elemnts that can keep you coming back. That and once you do level up you can go back to old missions to try beat them in the fastest time possible anding another challenge to the mix.Combined with upto 4 players online adding a fun team experince.

												Ok.. so since this game became available for sale, I was thinking ""Yeah that game looks pretty good, kind of like metal slug... which I really like.... hmmmm to get it or not to get it...to get it or not to get it..""   So it comes on sale during the 2014 summer sale.  It was the last purchase I made during that sale, and wow am I glad I did!I absolutely LOVE this game, the gameplay totally reminds me of the old days playing megaman on the NES/SNES.  I'm totally loving this game, there are only a couple tiny drawbacks for me.  They are almost insignifigant but I guess being that nothing in this world is perfect, here we go with MK's.  The local Multiplayer screens make it kind of hard to see anything as it shrinks things to 1/4 of the regular size... not a huge deal to me personally, the only time it bugs me is if I'm playing the game with my wife on our living room TV.  It's still totally fun to play, I guess the solution could be -GET A BIGGER TV!!  Lol.. not a big deal so whatever.  The other thing... HAVE MORE PLAYABLE CHARACTERS!  Yeah, the two they have are great, I love them, but I'd have loved to see more selectable characters... All in all, its an absolutely WONDERFUL game.  The pros (in my opinion) FAR outweigh the cons and had I known it would have been so much fun I would have bought it for full price a while back, but I'm not complaining that I got such a great game at a discount!!PLEASE make more games like this one!  I'll be all over MK2 if it promises the same great experience as this one did! "

												I went into this game expecting contra/metal slug. It wasn't...I played for a good hour and while the game is really nice looking I found it lacking where it counts: Fun gameplay.Games like Contra or MS are instantly fun the second you play the first level. But this was just a very unsatisfying experience for me.It wasn't fast. It wasn't very action packed. I had to reload all the time. All enemies were in annoying places. A lot of backtracking. It just felt so clunky all the way through...Even talking with NPCs felt slightly awkward.And this may sound silly, but I really disliked the control setup and evnen had a hard time changeing them. Again, the setup felt so awkward. I was also very surprised to see a game of this type use such an abundance of control buttons. I expected two or three besides the arrow keys.If this game didn't have it's great graphics and music there'd be absolutely no reason left to play this as the game itself is poorly excecuted in my opinion.

The instant spawns of enemies whenever you move a bit further each time makes it unbelievably irritiating and sometimes unplayable. The problems with both of us getting into one map didn't make it any better, either. In the end, we didn't play it for more than 30 mins in total.			"

												4.5/5Couch-co-op on 1 computer is a big plus!!Metal Slug meets weapon customization and persistent gain.Overall pace is less chaotic than Metal Slug, allowing for a little more forethought and a lot more freedom of movement. IMO this is a nice pace and the game has more depth than simple arcade how-far-can-you-make-it.The weapon customization is balanced in a way that encourages trying different types and changing your playstyle, while still allowing you to choose what you like (2 shot hand cannon? homing AP machinegun?)Most levels are fun singleplayer, though few can be frustrating and would be a lot easier with more people (1-4 player)I'm using Better DS3 and 2 ps3 controllers to couch co-op with my roommate.

												After 3 hours I have run the same 2 maps for 12 missions, fought the same handful of enemies and built 3 variations of the same gun. The repetition and grindy nature of this slower, slightly awkward Metal Slug hybrid really doesn't work for me, and I say that as someone who was drawn in by the presentation and promise of a more involved side-scroller in the Contra vein. Make sure you read a few reviews across the spectrum if what you see on the store page appeals to you, since it certainly didn't turn out to be what I was expecting.			"

												Great gameplay, you learn the controls for keyboard fairly fast, excelent 8-bit art with lots of details around the map, lots of extra AIs just for effect, and you can customize you're guns, which I have never been able to do in any other 8-bit sidescroller I've played. You can mix and match parts to create the ultimate weapon.The hub, or base, consists of people you rescue and the more people you rescue, the more utilities and weapons you unlock. You have the ability to choose the missions you want to play and can even replay past missions. There are bosses and many interesting and fun mechanics to the game.Has a unique soundtrack that changes depending on the mood present. Plus, there is a multiplayer system that works great, especially with steam. Overall, very fun game that has a great storyline and makes you want to keep playing.Plus you get to shoot stuff up. 10/10			"

												Fantastic 2D platformer-shooter that really catches the spirit of the games it pays tribute to.Paul Robertson's sprite art is beautiful to behold and the soundtrack is aces, while the active reload, ducking and rolling keep you engaged in the action. Combining your gun from different parts is surprisingly deep (not to mention fun!) and offers a multitude of different playstyles to suit you. Only downsides are that building the gun parts is too grindy and the time limit on missions can be stressful.There's local and online co-op but the local game isn't so great because the screen is always split in 4, even with 2 players.Regardless, this is great, carefree fun!

												The Good:Very well done retro 2D shooterVery powerful gun customization systemLots of stuff to craftThe Bad:Poor tutorial, you really need to read the in-game manual on the main menu (which inexplicably is not accessible once you've loaded a charater).Major pacing issues, especially at the beginning. The first part of the game is the most difficult since you haven't unlocked the good stuff yet and haven't memorized the maps yet.Repetitive missions reuse the same maps over and over with slightly different objectives.Enemies can be quite cheap at times (pinning you against a wall, attacking through a wall) and the retro gameplay means you can only shoot in 4 directions even though some enemies come right in on your blind spots.Mission objectives are frequently unmarked and you have to scour the level to find what you're looking for (and hope you know where all the hidden areas are).Reloading is annoying and slow for a run and gun type game.The Ugly:Endless instantly respawning enemies (they respawn as soon as you leave the screen) add a lot of frustration and annoyance when traversing a level for the nth time trying to find an unmarked objective.This game is very close to being amazing, but suffers from a few fatal flaws. None of them would be particularly difficult to fix, but as it stands I can't recommend this game (especially at the asking price) unless you're willing to get past the initial difficulty wall and unlock the good guns.

												Crafting is one of the worst plagues upon modern gaming, and here is one of its worst itinerations.  The missions often take place in the same few maps, merely putting the start and finish lines in different areas.  The reload mechanic is completely out of place in a game like this.  Boss fights are the worst because said bosses will randomly leave the area and require you to track them down anew.  The music is a confused mess, unsure of whether it wants to go full chiptune or not.  The overall goal is also muddled; the game rewards you for speedrunning missions, and also for taking time to explore and fulfill extra objectives, leaving players wondering if they should just play all the missions twice.  The gun customization is really lacking; most ammo types are unavailable unless you specifically build you gun to accept them, and nearly every combination slows your character's movement to an unplayable crawl.It says a lot about the overall quality of the game that I can still recommend it, despite these awful downsides.  However, this is a very tentative recommendation; I bet there's plenty of people out there that would take those as enough red flags to stay away from Mercenary Kings.  Just download Cheat Engine and hack yourself a huge stockpile of crafting materials, and you'll enjoy the game so much more, I promise.			"

												Boiling it down to ""Metal Slug meets Borderlands"" is a pretty good way to sum it up, though not perfect: while equipment (namely, gun) choices can have an insane level of variety and custimation, there's no random generation involved like borderlands. Each gun part has specific stats, the parts needed to craft them consistently drop from certain foes or items boxes in a given mission. The only RNG involved is hoping a monster will drop the material you need from the 2-4 predefined drops in their loot pool.All in all, Mercenary Kings takes old school, tough side-scrolling shooters of the past (think metal slug, contra) and blends it with more modern RPG customization elements. Gear selection in a sidescroller isn't all that new, just look all the way back to river city ransom, but the incredible level of customization you can access to make cool guns definitely gives it a modern touch and adds a lot of depth. Add an enjoyable semi-retro 2D sprite art-style, a fun story/setting that doesn't take itself too seriously, and last but not least, local and online co-op,  and you have a well-rounded game with a lot of replay value.

												Mind blowing...Its like Metal Slug became an Adventure Rpg... you get to customize your weapons... which ends up being the core mechanics of the game... sometimes get dull since you need to get promoted to get more and more acess to more and more parts... but once you get used to it, you won't stop to play this little baby until you get all the parts you want to make the ULTIMATE WEAPON!!!

												Mercenary Kings (MK) is a perfect blend that is so rarely come across these days.  At a glance, it may remind you of Metal Slug - and, at a very surface level, it does bring you that feeling and experience, however, MK is far more than that.MK introduces several new and refreshing concepts to the classic run-and-gun platfomer.  As you defeat enemies, you pick up material drops.  These are used to craft weapon and armour upgrades, knives, and well as character ""perks"" if you will.  Though I'm not through the game, there are probably thousands of unique weapon configurations that can be created by mixing and matching different parts that you have created.  Armour upgrades are much more vanilla, a simple ""material for boost"" trade.  Armour upgrades are linear, and one-piece progression.Weapon crafting deserves a bit more talk.  The gun consists of several different parts, each of which may effect weight, range, power, clip-size, shot distance, reload speed, and special effect (armour piercing, caustic, electric, etc.).  Each part also has its own designed graphic which shows up as you play.  This allows some pretty zany and custom options for you to pick from.  You may also choose to build your gun as a ""set"" by picking each piece that matches the same name - there are some advantages to playing that way as well.As for missions - there are A LOT of them to get through.  Missions are based on a few categories.  You've got your side quests and your primary quests, but they're also broken down by ranking.  You'll need to complete the main quests of one group before the next batch of missions are unlocked.  I can't see any reason to skip the side-missions, though, as you will collect a lot of valuable resources and cash to advance through the game more smoothly.Though the price of the game may seem a bit steep, you can really tell that A LOT of work has gone into creating this title - there's more content than I can list in one sitting, and there are PLENTY of missions to keep you going.  If you can't afford the $20, I certainly suggest grabbing it while it's on sale.  There are only a few games that have piqued my interest and hooked me in as well as this one has.  Kudos to the devs.			"

												Very satisfying side scrolling shooter. Guncrafting is easy to do and generally awesome. The ability dynamic gives you that edge you need for harder mission. And they factored in everything from reload ability to wieght dynamic. The enemies are probably my favourite part of the game seeing as there are so many differant types of them each with there own strength and weakness dynamic as well as differant attack bases. I give this a thumb way up its super fun to play especially with your friends			"

The crafting system can be a bit grindy but at the same time you get 90% of what you'll need from mission rewards, so it isn't too bad.			"

												You'll have to do countless missions in the same map before being able to move to the next one, and the evolution of the character is extremely slow.

												Despite the delicious pixel-art graphics, this game is far from your typical retro game's ""feel""A healthy chunk of the game IS memorizing boss movement and reflexively dodging bullets a-la metal slug, but you'll be spending more of your time grinding old missions to up gather materials to up your dps (among countless other variables depending on the goal of each particular mission and your preferred playstyle) and customize your loadout.It can get INCREDIBLY frustrating at times, and it's one hell of a time sink, but if you're into the feeling you get after FINALLY progressing after long monotonous material grinds, and you're a completionist, this game is probably for you.

												Mercenary Kings is a pretty fun and cute little side scrolling platforming game. The animations for the sprite graphics is pretty damn good and sometimes very fluid. The overall appeal of the game is very nice and is pleasing to look at. Gunplay is solid and you aim up, down, left and right. Simple but it works. You can always gather parts to help build your own guns. Some guns can be cats or just a giant death face! You can hunt for meats and whatnot for you to cook to gain buffs. Honestly, if I have to compare it to anything it would be monster hunter. Music is nice but can get old so you might want to just listen to other stuff. So what are some cons? Well first off this game is..well..pretty boring. You'll accept missions to go to usually the same map over and over. Playing through the same level so much that you'll find each secret 20 times over. I will admit the level designs are damn good but if you play them repeatedly you just spoil yourself and get sick of it. I found the game to be faily easy, too easy in fact but maybe thats just me. Also, the REAL big hitter is the online. There is little to no one playing the game. Which is sad cause the game is best played with a group of people. If you have friends that are willing to buy and play then yeah, this game will be damn fun but as it stands solo and now...might want to skip over.			"

												Most of the people writing negative reviews are doing so because of their expectations, not much about the actual quality of the game.Mercenary Kings is a game that controls like Mega Man, looks like Metal Slug and is set up like Monster Hunter.If you hate revisiting locations or grinding in any sense then you're going to hate this game.If you're using a mouse and keyboard, you're going to hate this game.If you're expecting Contra, you're going to hate this game.However, if you play this with some friends, it's great. It's meant to be played in online multiplayer. The game also looks visually fantastic and the music isn't shabby. If you remember the Scott Pilgrim vs. the World game, it's the same art design. It seems like this game had a ton of glitches before but I haven't come across any besides one problem I had with the resolution the first time I played it.It's not perfect, but it is fun. Maybe not fun for a hundred hours, but it is fun. Get in on sale.			"

												The review that mentions about this game is not Metal Slug is the most accurate description of this game. However, if that doesn't stop you from thinking about buying this game, then there is a decent amount of fun to be had. While some parts are quite a grind, and once you get past the earlier levels the game really opens up and allows you to figure out your own playstyle. Some of the guns can be quite fun for if you want to have a toilet gun you can, or if you want to have a shotgun that shoot ice spikes you can. The draw back is that you might have to grind alittle a bit to unlock those guns.			"

If you love Metal Slug style gameplay but wanted a RPG elment to your weapons and character leveling up this is for you.I would say the mission can get reapative but the grind for loot and upgrades is one og the elemnts that can keep you coming back. That and once you do level up you can go back to old missions to try beat them in the fastest time possible anding another challenge to the mix.Combined with upto 4 players online adding a fun team experince.

The GoodAs advertised, this is a 2D shooter / scroller / run around the map a roller with plenty of gun customization.The music is pretty good and the pixel art graphics and animations done by Paul Robertson, among the best in that field, are absolute eye-candy to look at. If you've ever played or seen Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World The Game on consoles, you've seen some of this guy's work already. The basic gameplay works fine enough with you jumpin', runnin', knifin' and shootin' (not diagonally though) through an assortment of levels with a bunch of goodies hidden about. When you get into the groove and master the controls it can definitely trigger some nostalgia from cartridge/arcade cabinet days of yesteryear.The BadTo deck out those guns and upgrade your gear, you're going to have to do quite a bit of grinding for ingredients (random drop or otherwise). Expect to revisit a bunch of areas for this purpose and have to deal with monotonous mission objectives, time-limits and silly boss fights where you have to worry about tracking them down across the whole map to fight them some more until they die if you take too long. All while the timer ticks down in the background. No pressure to find your way to one of those boss arenas scattered about the maze-like maps while the boss periodically shuffles around (leading to some particularly cruel instances where you can finally make it to a boss-zone where it's at and it just walks away after three seconds) or anything. There may additionally be some problems with the game on certain monitors or comps but I didn't personally run into this myselfThe UglyEven with this game's short-comings, there IS fun to be had. As such, there is definitely an audience or two to reccomend this to. Just be prepared to have a bit more Monster Hunter in your Metal Slug sandwich than you perhaps initially bargained for. Replace the Mission Complete jingle with the one from Metal Slug via files for maximum irony while you're at it, too.			"

												Does blasting an army of bad guys to smithereens Metal Slug-style sound like your idea of a good time? How about doing it with your own custom-made weapon using whatever mishmash of parts you can think of? If any of that appeals to you, then this is absolutely worth a shot.Paul Robertson's handmade sprites and backdrops do a lot to give the experience that retro/fake-retro charm without coming across as just pixelated for the sake of it. The soundtrack's combination of metal and chiptune-like tones calls to mind things like Virt's compositions for Contra 4 and DuckTales Remastered.Once you get some momentum going, it's lots of fun crafting gun parts, bionic mods and even substitutes for your trusty knife, to put together your own personal loadout and see how it performs.There's a couple hitches though. To me at least, the system of equipment weighing you down seems out of place, and the Monster Hunter-type layout of missions giving you different objectives in the same areas means it can get kind of repetitive, especially if there's a gun part or something you REALLY want to get the materials for.Trifles aside, it's a fine example of mashing together run-and-gun violence and strategic weapon crafting.

												Is this a great game in the traditional sense? Debatable. There's definitely the skeleton of an amazing game, but it's hard to deny that the flesh is basically made out of bone. Like the whole thing is just a really really thick skeleton...What I'm trying to say is that the game is samey as ♥♥♥♥. Like pretty badly. The boss fights are nicely varied, but the missions in between are just... you'll know a map front to back at the end of it's related rank, that's for damn sure. The crafting system, while not terribly unique, really adds a sense of depth and personalization to the game, and lets you set goals for yourself, which is always a plus in my book. But the reason I recommend this is not any of that. I'm giving this a recommendation because it is just a much cooler version of Metal Slug, and I like Metal Slug. I might not want to play it all the time, but when I do this game is there for me with a mission I haven't completed the fastest time on or a new gun that I haven't beaten a boss with or just something, anything, to give me an excuse to play a very functional, responsive, fun 2-D scrolling shooter. And at the end of the day, that's worth the 20 (15 if you have friends) dollars.			"

												If youre looking for a run and gun, arcade style. chaotic game like Metal Slug when you want to buy this game, dont. This game is, in my opinion, more of a Mega Man style RPG. You can mix and match different gun parts, so your base can be a shotgun and your magazine can be a SMG to shoot rapid fire bullet sprays. I say its like mega man because the enemies in a level are strategically placed for you to come up with a plan to kill them. So you might actually have to take your time, being cautious, and not being a badass and running in guns blazing. The weapon combinations is what makes this game shine. Like I already said, you can buy different parts to mix with other guns types. So essentially, you can have a machine gun clip. rocket launcher base, sniper scope, SMG barrel, and assault rifle stock. While that might not be the best weapon, plenty of combinations and upgrades can be applied. Plus enemies drop ""loot"" which will be materials you need to craft and purchase different gun parts, as well as knives. Knives are pretty cool, they can attack through walls, and deflect bullets to defend yourself. The story is pretty damn good, unexpectedly.			"

												I don't think the game deserves so many negative reviews, even though I understand their overall issues, Mercenary Kings' pros easily outweigh it's cons.Mercenary Kings is a load of fun, highly polished with much more depth than it appears at first glance.The level design works through missions in 1-2 levels per rank (there's 10 ranks), with enough variation to keep you entertained, yet enough repetition so you can learn the levels and enjoy the benefits of improving with experience.The game rewards your patience with a highly satisfying control system that gets better as you do, and a very enjoyable mechanic where you unlock weapon parts to customise your arsenal. As you progress, rarer hidden parts become vital to unlocking the best weapons, which offers great replayability.It's fair to say taht the game does get a bit samey at times, and some of the levels can feel like a chore to replay, but overall I found this effect rather minimal to my enjoyment.I should also add that I bought this game on sale, and would feel more comfortable recommending it around the $10 price range, rather than the $20. Also, I think you will enjoy the game a lot more if you have friends to play it with. While the single player is great, I think the game shines at sharing your mix of weapons and working together to explore the map and bring down the bosses.			"

												If you like old school games like Metal Slug you will like this.  While not as fast as those games were this one has a great style and sense of humor and an interesting crafting system to make guns and knives and other things that help you along the game.  Only complaint is some missions for me are a bit too hard and it makes it an endless repeat to paly the same thing over and over again but there is no penalty for that so it's not a horrible thing.  In short a great old school side scrolling shooter with some an interesting crafting system.			"

												This game is incredibly fun. Think Monster Hunter + Metal Slug. You kill enemies which drop resources that you use to build parts for guns, build melee weapons, or make mods which give various effects. Granted, most missions are gathering missions, but there is a small variety. Sometimes you will need to kill a boss, or even capture it with Shock Bombs when it is low on health.You only shoot in the cardinal directions, which I am fine with. It would be too easy if you could aim diagonally. The jumping takes a bit to get used to. Just as a reference, think Batman on the NES. The jump works almost the exact same. A slight delay before jumping, hold it down to jump higher, and once you're in the air you can alter the trajectory slightly.Most missions have bonus objectives, and every mission has Secret objectives which are only revealed once you have found/killed whatever the secret objective is related to. Bonus and secret objectives offer bonus money and resources.This game is very grind-heavy, since you have to hope for resource drops, but it's much more forgiving than a lot of other games. Some missions offer a few of a specific resource, or the mission actually requires you find that resource. A simple look through the resource guide in the community hub can help you find that elusive resource. I'd recommend this game to any fan of Metal Slug-style games, or even just side-scrolling shooters. Hell, I'd recommend it to anyone, really. As always, if you're not sure, watch some gameplay videos of it.			"

												Platforming old-school style! This is classic style gaming at it's finest. It brings back memories of game arcades and early home consoles.The mechanics are a bit primataive (no diagonal shooting) but the game seems well ballanced around that.The story is also classic. You fight an evil organization bent on...world domination? Terrorists? Bad guys for sure at any rate. You start play as one of two previous mission/story survivors brought back to life by a specially formulated serum, which is probably why the island you are on was invaded in the first place. Everyone wants it.Gather the items your enemies drop when defeated and use them to create new weapon parts and other implements of destruction and warfare. Missions pay well the more successful you are, some even have bonus objectives. You can buy supplies (rations, first aid kits etc.)  to take with you into the field or chance finding what you need as you go.Games were never this complex in the old days since back then, it was all about the high score. Modern game design, such as the custom weapons, keep the game fresh in modern times.			"

												The game is great.Cool story, i like how every character has a unique type of talk, someone it's funnier, someone more serious, but they're all aiming for the right cause. And Choppy is hilarious.Some missions of the game are very difficoult, and for some other missions, a little strategy and preparation is required.Despite the first impression that this game can give, it's a very long game, and that's a quality for me.Main objective, extra objective 1, extra objective 2, and secret objective. Come on. It's cool.Nice thing that everything is craftable. A large variety of gun parts (and knives) that make you character 100% customizable. You can even customize your camp tent (but i recommend you doing this only when you have found the perfect gun for you, and your armor is maxed).Another good thing it's the possibility to change key for everthing. For those who use a keyboard it's critical, trust me. (Tip: Don't put the accept button, on Enter, or you will skip the story everytime).The only bad things i found are:- the character jumps, they're really awful and sometimes makes you rage.- play on the same map for quite a bit can be annoying - some bosses are way more harder than the final boss- when you die, it's not quite accurate where do you respawn, i still don't get how to change your respawn during a mission.- I hate the fact that some enemies make more damage only touching you, than with actual attacks.Totally worth game imho. 8/10			"

												A simple metal slug clone this is not. While the gamplay is similar, the depth here appears huge. With a multitude of weapon parts to buy using resources you scavenge while gunning down a horde of different enemy types.You'd think it would be hard to get bored of such a game, however while there are (in the end) a large number of levels, each stage forces you to play through the latest two over and over, rescuing hostages this time and destroying the generator that time... but the objective is a moot point, the journey from start to finish is the same from level to level.It's a shame since at times the pacing is great, set pieces work well and bosses are challenging... but eventually it all boils down to shoot, jump, reload, repeat. And 20hrs of that is asking too much.[5]			"

												As much as I love Tribute Games' amazing pixel-art and audio, it's hard to recommend this game because of how repetitive it gets.As per your standard ""loot treadmill"" loop, you will be exploring the same areas repeatedly while collecting crafting-goop that you use to craft better equipment. There's nothing inherently wrong with this formula, but I don't feel it worked for me in Mercenary Kings, because I got tired of the same 2-4 areas really quickly, and all the quests felt like filler. I also got really tired of picking-up crafting-material from everything, and didn't derive much joy from experimenting with various weapon/equipment combinations.The first 2 hours of the game were really enjoyable for me, mostly because of the gorgeous aesthetics and good sound-design, but eventually monotony just took over and I had to stop.

												Combat is cumbersome and contrived. Controlling your character is a chore due to speed, the poor hit direction of your attacks, and the delay of movement you suffer after landing a freaking jump. The gameplay is far from ""frantic""—deliberating your every move before jumping in to combat b/c of your own movement limitations is just inexcusable. Perpetually spawning enemies can be bland: they either spawn right in front of a doorway, or in the exact same spot they were killed a minute before. Search and rescue/destroy missions take forever due the circular level design in some areas.Ironically, MK really shines with it's non-Platformer elements. I love the idea of crafting weapon upgrades from found materials and dealing elemental damage. The reloading system is surprisingly fun: time your reloads, and dispatch your foes with high powered rounds of ammunition. Of course, the multiplayer is a plus, albeit a standard one.Part of me thinks I've just been spoiled by the gameplay of Metal Slug, but there are so many things that MK can do so much better. As it is, I cannot recommend Mercenary Kings, even with the $5 discount. Here's to hoping for a more polished edition after development is complete.			"

It's tons of fun if you are into that type of game, oterhwise you should probably buy this game anyway because is dirty cheap. Try something new.			"

												If youre looking for a run and gun, arcade style. chaotic game like Metal Slug when you want to buy this game, dont. This game is, in my opinion, more of a Mega Man style RPG. You can mix and match different gun parts, so your base can be a shotgun and your magazine can be a SMG to shoot rapid fire bullet sprays. I say its like mega man because the enemies in a level are strategically placed for you to come up with a plan to kill them. So you might actually have to take your time, being cautious, and not being a badass and running in guns blazing. The weapon combinations is what makes this game shine. Like I already said, you can buy different parts to mix with other guns types. So essentially, you can have a machine gun clip. rocket launcher base, sniper scope, SMG barrel, and assault rifle stock. While that might not be the best weapon, plenty of combinations and upgrades can be applied. Plus enemies drop ""loot"" which will be materials you need to craft and purchase different gun parts, as well as knives. Knives are pretty cool, they can attack through walls, and deflect bullets to defend yourself. The story is pretty damn good, unexpectedly.			"

												A sidescrolling shooter with retro grafics and custom weapons.GameplayThere is a bunch of bigger maps. Your missions are normaly set in a part of the map. Most of the time you have to kill something or search something. Different missions require different strategies and equipement. You may call it a little bit repetitive, but it works. The real thing in this game is the weapon customization/crafting: You can build different gun parts and combine them as you like. Scoped assault rifle? Armourpiercing Miningun? Homing SMG? Sniper-SMG? Shotgun-Pistol? There are no limits (almost).Grafics & SoundThe grafics are charming and functual. It's retro style but in a really good way. No pseudo-retro pixel war, nope. Its clean pixel art. The sound matches this perfectly: reminds me of the old console times.DifficultyOk i have to stress that: the start is quite challanging and a little bit frustrating. But soon you will be able to upgrade your gun. From this moment it gets easier. Mid-Game is playable and fun but in the end, well it gets quite hard again... but its perfectly playable. I played the complete game on solo: its possible but you have to think a little bit and train your fingers!Pros:-Custom weapons (play it your style)-Different play styles are possible-Lots uf parts to unlock-Diffent maps (Horizontal street parts, vertical parts in buildings, jump&run like parts)-Challanging (I take it as a pro, but you might take it otherwise)Cons:-First trys may be a little bit hard-Missions can by quite repetitive (kill X soliders, gather X minerals...)In a nutshell: On of the few sidescrolling shooters i really enjoy.

The game could have been great, but little things pile up and inhibits me from actually enjoying th gameFrom little I have played, the game will require♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of grinding. The weapon you start out is complete utter garbage and it is really unsatisfying. I tried to modify it with little resource I have, but I think I made the gun worse some how. Vast majority of the enmies take 5~10 hits which contradicted with what I expected from arcady style game. While that is perfectly fine, enemies respawn for no reason. There is very little incentive for me to kill enemies. Why bother? They are going to respawn anyway. Also, why do I have to pick up items by pressing down? Was it necessary to force players input to pick up items on the ground?? Lastly, I am disappointed by the animation quality during game play. While I am not a huge stickler in graphics, but come on! The designers should be better than to have characters 'freeze' while bullets fire out from their guns. Bad animation combined with utter lack of damage the guns are so unsatisfying to shoot with. Overall, if you want to purchase a game similar to Metal Slug, this game is NOT it. You might enjoy this game if you can survive the grind the game forces you to go through and understand the overly complicated gun customization.			"

												I went into this game expecting contra/metal slug. It wasn't...I played for a good hour and while the game is really nice looking I found it lacking where it counts: Fun gameplay.Games like Contra or MS are instantly fun the second you play the first level. But this was just a very unsatisfying experience for me.It wasn't fast. It wasn't very action packed. I had to reload all the time. All enemies were in annoying places. A lot of backtracking. It just felt so clunky all the way through...Even talking with NPCs felt slightly awkward.And this may sound silly, but I really disliked the control setup and evnen had a hard time changeing them. Again, the setup felt so awkward. I was also very surprised to see a game of this type use such an abundance of control buttons. I expected two or three besides the arrow keys.If this game didn't have it's great graphics and music there'd be absolutely no reason left to play this as the game itself is poorly excecuted in my opinion.

												Is this a great game in the traditional sense? Debatable. There's definitely the skeleton of an amazing game, but it's hard to deny that the flesh is basically made out of bone. Like the whole thing is just a really really thick skeleton...What I'm trying to say is that the game is samey as ♥♥♥♥. Like pretty badly. The boss fights are nicely varied, but the missions in between are just... you'll know a map front to back at the end of it's related rank, that's for damn sure. The crafting system, while not terribly unique, really adds a sense of depth and personalization to the game, and lets you set goals for yourself, which is always a plus in my book. But the reason I recommend this is not any of that. I'm giving this a recommendation because it is just a much cooler version of Metal Slug, and I like Metal Slug. I might not want to play it all the time, but when I do this game is there for me with a mission I haven't completed the fastest time on or a new gun that I haven't beaten a boss with or just something, anything, to give me an excuse to play a very functional, responsive, fun 2-D scrolling shooter. And at the end of the day, that's worth the 20 (15 if you have friends) dollars.			"

												This game breathes life back into the metal slug side scrolling shooters that in my opinion we could all use more of.  This game not only brings it back, but adds an rpg element as well as the most in depth gun crafting system I've seen in awhile.  The game is not only pretty in its animations, the backgrounds and level design really give you a sense of going back to the metal slug days with its sprites.  Theirs an intense list of gun parts, knives, and missions to choose from, and 100 percent completionists are going to be overwhelmed with the amount of content in this game.  However:  The game feels almost too long for what it is, and that feeling will come when you notice alot of the enemies, levels, and mission types are reused.  In my opinion the game would be sweeter if the reskinned enemies, and missions were reduced to preserve the flavor.  That and the timelimit to each level.  I could see how that would necessary for speed completionists and the like, but with the world so massive and the map telling little of the location of your objective sometimes, it can be frustrating and you may find yourself losing 20+plus minutes only to fail at your mission due to the timer.  This as well as the outright useless of the grenade and severly limited item carrying capacity, leaves me a peeved at certain times. (especially when half of the items are needed to advance or complete the mission)All an all it is still a great game, and worth every penny for the sheer quanity of game you get!  its nice to see this genre back up and running again, and kickstarted no less!

												First, let me say that this game can be hard if you're playing solo, but, with friends, you can have tons of fun, or you can lose them because you can't figure out where something or someone is. I've mainly played solo, but with tons of customizable guns, prepare to kill everything.			"

												It's fun if you like repetitive platformers where you have to learn the enemy patterns to defeat them. Missions are timed, death is frequent and failure is just around the corner. Reloading your weapon is an annoying minigame, you can only shoot up/left/right, down only if you jump up first, making some enemies far more dangerous because they can shoot/move on the diagonal. You have to grind to get items to unlock and EVERYTHING has to be unlocked.I found it frustrating and a waste of time. But someone will like it. It's a good game for the genre, I suppose, but it's not for me.			"

												It's repetitive and somewhat sluggish, but very charming. If you're like me and you're always looking for a game to match the Monster Hunter formula of fighting enemies, taking their parts and using said parts to craft better weapons with which to more easily fight enemies, then you'll enjoy this game, because it has that exact formula. The equipment crafting here is just as deep and addicting as in Capcom's epic fantasy franchise. It's just thrown into a Metal Slug-shaped package.I have yet to play with friends but I have to imagine it's ♥♥♥♥ing fun.Overall, if you love Monster Hunter, give Mercenary Kings a shot. I don't think you'll regret it.			"

While not as fast as those games were this one has a great style and sense of humor and an interesting crafting system to make guns and knives and other things that help you along the game.  Only complaint is some missions for me are a bit too hard and it makes it an endless repeat to paly the same thing over and over again but there is no penalty for that so it's not a horrible thing.  In short a great old school side scrolling shooter with some an interesting crafting system.			"

												Fun action platformer for both singleplayer and co-op.Positives:- Most of the overall gameplay and design- Graphics- Local and online co-op- Feel of achievement- Soundtrack- Setting/""story""- Crafting system (for the most part)- The game has a good amount of different enemies and customization availableNegatives:- Somewhat annoying spawn system. Sometimes you can get hit by a enemy coming from behind the screen when you are avoiding bullets that way...among other things.- To get everything, you might have to grind a lot - this can make the game repetitive- Achievements that probably require you to repeat MANY missions (unless you were going for them from the start)- Some achievements do not register correctly.- It can be hard to get some materials for crafting (usually the boss ones = more repetition) and if you make ornaments or banners, they don't really show off much. you are basically making 20+ different ornaments and 20+ different banners just to place 2 of them in AND on your tent (1+1).8/10 - has a bit too much repetition for 100% completion, spawn system can be unfair (you often get blocked by spawning npcs just because you moved a little bit to the other direction before jumping somewhere, taking damage)			"

												I want to like this game. I found the first level quite fun, it reminded me a lot of Metal Slug, and i was told that the gun part system is really quite cool. But here's the main issue: it just doesn't work for many people, including myself.After the first level, i found the screen flashing black, and elements of my hud turning completely black as well, as if my graphics driver was crashing, but it wasn't? And now, everytime i launch the game, i find a new graphical error. Once, the title screen was suddenly a black and white spritesheet. Another time, it was flickering in a way that made it look like an Old CRT TV before going black. ETC. And if you check the forums, many others are having a similar problem. Some people say that running it without the steam overlay and in windowed fixes it, but it honestly didn't for me, or for many others. According to the devs they ""can't replicate it on their side"" meaning it was probably ONLY tested on their hardware, and this bug is really purely luck based as to if you'll have to deal with it or not. And, because of this bug, the game is basically unplayable. If the devs figure it out, then i'd probably recommend it, but in it's current state of flip flopping depending on your hardware, i can't.			"

												Mercenary Kings is a blast to play, as long as you have a group of friends that will follow you into the hectic battles that is Mecenary Kings. Gameplay is very similar to Metal Slug so it gives you that kind of nostalgia from when you played back in the arcades. Weapons are great and have so much variety. The weapon building system works marvelously and offers a wide range of funny and versatile weaponry. The fact that you have to pick up materials throughout the levels gives more purpose to explore and gain more currency. Characters in the game are colorful and are each are very useful when using thier skills to strengthen your character and help progress through the levels with ease. At this point in time, everything seems to work; havent experienced any bugs of any kind yet. The only critism that I could throw in would be to make inviting friends to join your game slighty easier. More along the lines of a joinable lobby, instead having to in game; talk to an NPC and then inviting your friends. All in all I had so much fun playing with my buddies and it was well worth the cost, even if I got it discounted when purchasing it from Humble Bundle. IGN 10/10 XD.			"

It's meant to be played in online multiplayer. The game also looks visually fantastic and the music isn't shabby. If you remember the Scott Pilgrim vs. the World game, it's the same art design. It seems like this game had a ton of glitches before but I haven't come across any besides one problem I had with the resolution the first time I played it.It's not perfect, but it is fun.

												The game is great.Cool story, i like how every character has a unique type of talk, someone it's funnier, someone more serious, but they're all aiming for the right cause. And Choppy is hilarious.Some missions of the game are very difficoult, and for some other missions, a little strategy and preparation is required.Despite the first impression that this game can give, it's a very long game, and that's a quality for me.Main objective, extra objective 1, extra objective 2, and secret objective. Come on. It's cool.Nice thing that everything is craftable. A large variety of gun parts (and knives) that make you character 100% customizable. You can even customize your camp tent (but i recommend you doing this only when you have found the perfect gun for you, and your armor is maxed).Another good thing it's the possibility to change key for everthing. For those who use a keyboard it's critical, trust me. (Tip: Don't put the accept button, on Enter, or you will skip the story everytime).The only bad things i found are:- the character jumps, they're really awful and sometimes makes you rage.- play on the same map for quite a bit can be annoying - some bosses are way more harder than the final boss- when you die, it's not quite accurate where do you respawn, i still don't get how to change your respawn during a mission.- I hate the fact that some enemies make more damage only touching you, than with actual attacks.Totally worth game imho. 8/10			"

												One of the best Shoot'em up I've ever played (probably the best). Scenario Well, really, there's a bad guy who wants to do bad things, and you have to beat his a**.Mercenary Kings takes place in a wild lonely wild island where a super-vilain has decided to build his super-vilain's base.It offers (from the top of my head) approximately 7 differents sceneries, from the wild jungle to the full-of-traps temple, or even a high-tech complex. Graphics You like or dislike this kind of graphics, but I actually love it. ""Pixel-art""-like graphics are, in my opinon, a standard for this kind of games, and it suits very well with the features and gameplay it offers (even animated boobs, no jokes). Gamplay Easy to learn, pretty easy to master (at least master on specific type of weapon / ammo). I personnaly used an xBox 360 controller from the very beginning, so I cannot relly talk about the Keyboard / Mouse controls.Controls are intuitive, and even if it's not at the beginning, you really have the time to master it.Mercenary Kings is quest-based, with a ""Hunting ground"" (aka time / quest-free zone) where you can hunt animals and such to get missings compenents for your gear.It offers a crafting system for your guns. You have to build from components a parts of weapons, then you can assemble whatever part of any gun you like together, it will make a working gun (probably not as working as you expected).Some weapons have a certain ""synergy"", making you able to use special ammo (6 differents types) like shrapnels or rockets, and sometimes two of them at the same time (piercing rockets, omfg).You can also build knifes, which I thought to be unless, does really matters from middle to end-game.There's equipable ""mods"", which makes you carry more, run faster, shoot elemental bullets, or even makes you insensitive to certain elements.I don't really want to talk about the rest of the features, since it would probable spoil a bit. Multiplayer I didn't test multiplayer yet, I will update this review as soon as I tested it. General impressions Like I said, probably the best Shoot'em up I've ever played. I did finish the last mission, but I would really enjoy play this more. There's a really great amount of quest, stuff to craft, secrets to discover, and all kind of things.I didn't find anything that really upset me here.I'm kinda sad I couldn't test multiplayer yet, but as I see it, it would be as epic as the rest of this game.Note: 10/10. (Really.)N.B.: As a non-native english speaker, I apologize for any mistakes / bad words or such in this review.			"

												This game could be fun but it is determined not to let me find out, as it has crashed three times during my recorded playtime so far of under two hours. I can cope with broken games but replaying the levels just isn't enjoyable. In fact, from what I have been able to tell so far, there are only a handful of levels anyway, with enemies in the same positions who respawn if your screen moves a millimetre away from their spot. It might get better but seeing as I have played each mission twice now, I'm not sure I'm too interested in finding out.			"

												A dastardly cross of  gameplay from Metal Slug and Contra, with more RPG typical features like persistent equipment, crafting, and character upgrades. Interesting gun mechanics, and pretty slick 16-bit (ish) aesthetics make it a delight to play. The story is pretty minimal, but the writing is very funny, and continual references to other games make for great ""AH! I GET IT! THAT'S FROM _____!"" moments. Also: local and online co-op. It has both. The game doesn't change at all between solo and co-op play however, so everything becomes much easier with others.BUT: somewhat repetitive. There are over 100 individual objective based missions, but they take place on a much smaller number of actual maps, and going around the same maps many times can get boring. Add in the farming that inevitably occurs when you're trying to get parts for a specific gun part or implant or knife, and it can get a little tedious.Overall great game, especially for fans of old school run and gun sidescrolling shooters.

So you already know it's got awesome sprite works and animations.Now take into account it's heavily inspired by Metal Slug, and then add in a bunch of exploratative and RPG style elements, weapon customisability (literally building guns by sticking random parts together), various crafting systems for new weapons) and missions which go beyond just 'go from A to B and kill everything in between oh and don't die'.Now imagine you can get that game on Steam and it's amazing.Well it's all true and it is amazing and why aren't you buying it now.

												i missed any sort of hype leading up to the release of this game, but two days ago my friends told me to get it. and so i picked it up and played it for about 13 hours straight.friend: how was your easter?me: i spent it playing merc kingsme: didnt even leave the housefriend: well that's an accomplishment i guessfriend: you should post that on steam as a game reviewalthough a little buggy, this is a fantastic game. theres just enough variety in the mission assignments to keep it interesting, and the maps are wonderfully big. but really the biggest draw is the art. the pixel art style is often used to market games towards older types of gameplay, but here the art is just a fantastic medium for a game. robertson has done a lot of pixel art berfore as art, and even for the scott pilgrim game. here we see a great show of the same quality work he is known for. if you dont mind spoilers, you can view some gifs here http://probertson.tumblr.com/post/82062175084/mercenary-kings-animationstl,dr; its a fun game, especially with friends, to waste some time with. and youll never get tired of watching the sprite animations			"

												Normally I don't rate games unless they really REALLY stand out as amazing, and this one does. I can't say enough good things about this game! It's my favorite side-scroller game EVER! I looove the art style. The amount of weapons you can craft in the game are quite numerous! And the amount of levels in the game just provide for seemingly endless fun <3 I really hope the makers of this game either add more content, or make a sequel because I just can't get enough!			"

												Really fun game! I found myself actually wanting to play it!Apparently it's a lot like Monster Hunter? I don't know. I've never played Monster Hunter. The look and theme is very Metal Slug, but it doesn't play like Metal Slug at all. This does not make it bad, it just makes it a different genre.Positives:1. Wonderful pixel art in all its pixelated glory. Seriously I'm not even kidding. The artwork is absolutely beautiful and completely functional. You can tell every different enemy or friendly apart instantly.2. Tons of customization! You can customize your gun, knives, inventory, etc. to a great degree, allowing lots of potential.3. Perfect learning curve. The game gives you a little taste of customization when you start out that gradually gets deeper and more indepth so the player doesn't feel overwhelmed at first.4. Not a short game. There are lots of stages that give you variety.5. The story is tight and focused. You're a soldier in an army trying to beat some terrorist because he's a jerk. There are a lot of amusing NPCs who are your back-up team. It's stylized a little like Metal Gear Solid (there are 'codec'-like conversations), but it's not crazy-complicated. You can fully ignore it if you want.Negatives:1. It's a resource-gathering game. The core game mechanic is killing an enemy then picking up whatever junk is left behind, then doing this a thousand more times. Can't ignore it or you'll never get the better guns. Ho-hum.Nitpicks:1. For each mission, you have a primary objective, a secondary objective, then a secret objective that the game doesn't tell you about. When you complete the primary objective, the mission ends and forcefully brings you back to the base, even if you want to spend time on the other objectives. It'd be nice if you could, say, complete the primary objective and then choose when you want to end the mission (or just wait for the timer).Overall a very solid game. Recommended.			"

												Like Scott Pilgrim, this game has a pretty steep learning curve. It starts out pretty tough as you have no special skills, weapons or mods. But perservere; what may seem like a frustrating beginning (if you do find it tough) pays off in a huge way as you forge your own knives, build bizzare guns and blast your way through loads off brilliantly designed levels.I play on a mac, and get the odd crash. I also wish the online was more user friendly. But get this game, it's worth every penny.			"

												This game is basically Contra + Monster Hunter.  If that sounds interesting, give it a chance.  It's definitely a game I had to get used to and wasn't what I expected at first.  After you learn the game's mission structure and figure out how to customize your gear (which is fun), it gets pretty addictive.  It does seem weird how enemies respawn at first, but then you realize it's by design.  There's also some other minor annoyances, like not being able to change sound volumes in a mission, or having the reload system explained, or even being able to just ""restart mission""?  If these things are available I just didn't find them.  Regardless, I like how Tribute tried to make a unique title, and I feel they succeeded.			"

												I want to like this game. I found the first level quite fun, it reminded me a lot of Metal Slug, and i was told that the gun part system is really quite cool. But here's the main issue: it just doesn't work for many people, including myself.After the first level, i found the screen flashing black, and elements of my hud turning completely black as well, as if my graphics driver was crashing, but it wasn't? And now, everytime i launch the game, i find a new graphical error. Once, the title screen was suddenly a black and white spritesheet. Another time, it was flickering in a way that made it look like an Old CRT TV before going black. ETC. And if you check the forums, many others are having a similar problem. Some people say that running it without the steam overlay and in windowed fixes it, but it honestly didn't for me, or for many others. According to the devs they ""can't replicate it on their side"" meaning it was probably ONLY tested on their hardware, and this bug is really purely luck based as to if you'll have to deal with it or not. And, because of this bug, the game is basically unplayable. If the devs figure it out, then i'd probably recommend it, but in it's current state of flip flopping depending on your hardware, i can't.			"

												A reboot of those old-school action packed platformers. But with RPG elements, like crafting your own prefered equipment. Sounds good right? Well this game is not very good. It is boring.The problem is threefold:- you now need to ""grind"" materials for upgrades. And then you need to build a bunch of random stuff to unlock proficiencies. I got bored with this system and the available options about 10 missions in. Surely late game stuff might be nice and all, it is an unattractive system early on. Especially because you have no idea where you should be farming in the first place.- the maps are the same, over and over again. Same enemies, but that is not all, they are applied in a very repetetive way as well. Sniper on a ledge where you need to get close, rifleman jumping down on you, spearmen attacking from above, drill in a hole, metal drone when you zipline down. Repeat 20 times every stage. There, spoiled the first 3 maps, on which you do at least 3-5 missions each. Boring and annoying.- the ""quests"" you get to do are boring. Gather 10 of this. (random drops or in boxes, so walk around the entire map. Again) Go to this NPC. And even the Boss, which could have been interesting, is annoying and boring. He moves from the scene at random. So you have to go through the level you got to know by heart by now, AGAIN to find he moves away after just one attack, so you have to track him down AGAIN.Oh and it gets worse: Then you get to do that boss AGAIN. Same map, same fight, but now you have to finish with a shock grenade. Which is the first time you get to use these, they are hard to use, you get only three, so then if you fail to get it right 3 times, you can just as well go and restart the map. After two runs so facing and beating this boss 3 times I had enough.No more waiting in an infirmary for 50 seconds (!?!) to heal up, no more cleaning up / skipping the same enemies 20 times over and finding that you have 50/9 for one craftin component and 1/2 out of some random rare drop you never can seem to find.3/10, would not be bored by again.

												Cute and fun game that's an awesome experience in co-op. Takes a lot of influence from old classics (Contra, Mega Man, Metal Slug), but also includes features inspired by newer titles. There's lots of background and secrets, and the crafting system is pretty extensive (though I agree with the disappointment of some other reviewers of the locked gun-type paths).One critical thing I have to note though, to be able to enjoy this game, you're definitely required to have compatible gamepads!

												I highly recommend this game to anyone who was, or is, a fan of metal slug. This game uses similar mechanics, but also does away with intsa-death, for you and your enemies.It also adds further depth with customization options, such as knife-type, gun-types, ammo-types, and bionic mods (akin to passive boosts).Although the campaign does run a acceptable length of time, some people may find the levels repetitive - you are required to do several missions (about 7) per area, and you will revisit the same areas. There are 108 enemies, so enemies repeat. The music is great though, I certainly didn't mind listening to the same track often. Overall, I'd say that even though the game has some repetitive elements, I found it very enjoyable, completed the game, and did not regret a single hour of my time. If you're a fan of 2D platform-shooters, this is definitely for you!			"

												A game at first look through the trailer that it is similar to metal slug.It has metal slug art style and game play but there is more to the mix.Mixed with gameplay elements from monster hunter to bring more variety to it's missions and guns.However, it does get repetitive and boring in the missions as it has only 4-5 varieties.(Up to where I have played to)Overall, it is great fun and the humour isn't that bad either. :3A good game to get hold off if you are a fan of the metal slug games.

												Mercenary Kings (MK) is a perfect blend that is so rarely come across these days.  At a glance, it may remind you of Metal Slug - and, at a very surface level, it does bring you that feeling and experience, however, MK is far more than that.MK introduces several new and refreshing concepts to the classic run-and-gun platfomer.  As you defeat enemies, you pick up material drops.  These are used to craft weapon and armour upgrades, knives, and well as character ""perks"" if you will.  Though I'm not through the game, there are probably thousands of unique weapon configurations that can be created by mixing and matching different parts that you have created.  Armour upgrades are much more vanilla, a simple ""material for boost"" trade.  Armour upgrades are linear, and one-piece progression.Weapon crafting deserves a bit more talk.  The gun consists of several different parts, each of which may effect weight, range, power, clip-size, shot distance, reload speed, and special effect (armour piercing, caustic, electric, etc.).  Each part also has its own designed graphic which shows up as you play.  This allows some pretty zany and custom options for you to pick from.  You may also choose to build your gun as a ""set"" by picking each piece that matches the same name - there are some advantages to playing that way as well.As for missions - there are A LOT of them to get through.  Missions are based on a few categories.  You've got your side quests and your primary quests, but they're also broken down by ranking.  You'll need to complete the main quests of one group before the next batch of missions are unlocked.  I can't see any reason to skip the side-missions, though, as you will collect a lot of valuable resources and cash to advance through the game more smoothly.Though the price of the game may seem a bit steep, you can really tell that A LOT of work has gone into creating this title - there's more content than I can list in one sitting, and there are PLENTY of missions to keep you going.  If you can't afford the $20, I certainly suggest grabbing it while it's on sale.  There are only a few games that have piqued my interest and hooked me in as well as this one has.  Kudos to the devs.			"

												Metal Slug meets Megaman meets Metroid-ish.Graphic-wise this game is a feast. Great animation and character design. Music is quite good too, with chiptunesque rock giving the whole product a nostalgia feel.But, and this a huge but, the game is just too slow. Although the controls are quite responsive, the whole game seems fairly sluggish. The weight feature adds a nice touch but even the lightest configuration is way too slow. It's not only the controls, the whole game feels like a grindfest. You are expected to traverse the same levels again and again in order to earn money, acquire crafting materials and just doing dull repetitive missions easily found in any MMORPG.The combat system is very similar to Metal Slug but without its pace. Enemies take ages to kill unless you snipe or use the shotgun mods. Also, they have contact damage and respawn offscreen, which kind of kills the run n' gun mechanic.All in all, promising concept, poorly executed.5/10			"

												Oh boy I was happy when I saw that Humble Bundle, but sadly the game dissappointed me.I will make a comparision with Yoshi´ Island and Yoshi Story, because it reflects the best way, why this game doesn´t make any fun for me.In Yoshis Island all the collecting is optional, the main goal is to reach the end. The collecting was fun and challenging, because it rewards you with a bonus level, but as I said, completely optional. People loved the game.In Yoshi Story the collecting is mandatory to finish a level and it is just boring running around, searching for something, even if you reached the end of the level. People hated that game.Mercenary Kings kinda is a mish-mash of these two in form of missions. The ""Save X hostages"" or ""Kill X enemies"" missions are damn boring. As soon as you overlooked one enemy it just running around while the time runs out. Ah and even worse, if you die, what you often will, your reward will be decreased, so your ambition to finish the mission is even lower. What kind of design is this? In Metal Slug the save the hostage thing was luckily also a optional thing.As much as I like the mission idea for a platformer, collecting or finding  a dozen of something is one of the worst mechanics if you have to do it to finish a level. In all good games I know, collecting is always optional (and yeah in the Metroid Prime games collecting artifacts or batteries sucked pretty hard, never understood these decisions.) Maybe I´m too harsh on that, but it was the reason why i turned off the game, twice.And the combat is pretty boring. Look at Metal Slug, Megaman or Towerfall Ascension how good combat is designed. It´s all about the timing, and here it isn´t pretty there.Final Verdict: Awesome graphics and characters wasted in a mediocre designed game with pretty good ideas here and there.			"

												Metal Slug with Crafting.Mercenary Kings is side scrolling shoot um up done in the style of retro arcade classics like Metal Slug.  The Hook however is in this game is your can select and replay different missions, have a health bar, and collect items that you can use back at base to upgrade your character and weapons.  The crafting works well.  There are a crap ton of varations for your gun and the game does a decent job of pacing bigger and better upgrades.  The Game looks great.  The sprites are colorful and there animation is great.Controls are tight and responsive, shooting is satisfing and they even used a reload mechanic similar to gears of war.The only downside are the missions.  Alot of them feel same'y.  Get x amount of this item or search and destroy a boss. or kill x amount of x enemy.  It gets a bit old.  One of the reasons that games like Metal Gear hold up is that they were always throwing new and crazy stuff at you.  In Mercenary Kings things ramp up too slowly.  Also i'm not a fan of having timed missions.Overall this is a fun enough time waster that, if you want, you can sink hours of time into.			"

												Well having played this for 30 minutes I can already tell it isn't for me so I'm just going to leave it there. A couple of small things but sadly things that are some of my main turn off's in games; Respawning enemies and grinding. Seems there is a real focus on crafting new weapons and that means replaying levels and missions to grind for supplies dropped by dead enemies. That isn't my thing, as well as enemies respawning as soon as you move away from where you just killed them. Not for me, and wanted to highlight these two mechanics to any others who may feel the same way as me, that said I do love the art style which is great and it plays lovely, I just wish it was straight run and gun game or even a metrod-vania type game, however I wish for a thing rarely makes it so :).It isn't a bad game, but just not for me for the brief reasons I've given above and therefore *I* can't recommend it.

												Mercenary Kings is a pretty fun and cute little side scrolling platforming game. The animations for the sprite graphics is pretty damn good and sometimes very fluid. The overall appeal of the game is very nice and is pleasing to look at. Gunplay is solid and you aim up, down, left and right. Simple but it works. You can always gather parts to help build your own guns. Some guns can be cats or just a giant death face! You can hunt for meats and whatnot for you to cook to gain buffs. Honestly, if I have to compare it to anything it would be monster hunter. Music is nice but can get old so you might want to just listen to other stuff. So what are some cons? Well first off this game is..well..pretty boring. You'll accept missions to go to usually the same map over and over. Playing through the same level so much that you'll find each secret 20 times over. I will admit the level designs are damn good but if you play them repeatedly you just spoil yourself and get sick of it. I found the game to be faily easy, too easy in fact but maybe thats just me. Also, the REAL big hitter is the online. There is little to no one playing the game. Which is sad cause the game is best played with a group of people. If you have friends that are willing to buy and play then yeah, this game will be damn fun but as it stands solo and now...might want to skip over.			"

												Mercenary Kings is a 2D shooter with lots of gun customization and plenty of levels.  missions are broke into ranks and every time you complete the boss mission you rank up giving you access to new missions, gun parts and abilities.  There are many ranks and this game has a lot of replay value for the completionists out there.  If you are a fan of 2D shooters similar to contra or Metal Slug this is the game for you.			"

												If you enjoy sidescrolling shooting action this game is for you!The graphics and gameplay are similar to the Metal Slugs games.However you can create several weapons with different attributes (fast reloading, more bullets in magazines, bullet elemental damage etc.). The game itself is structered into several areas where you need to take on certain missions which can be quite similar (pick xx materials, kill all enemies, destroy xx, capture xx enemy etc.). Although some might say these missions can be repetitive, I personally did not mind at all.			"

												Here's how the game works, you load your character, spawn in the hub world, choose a mission, build your weapon, buy rations and grenades, test your weapon, go back to modifying your weapon, test your weapon again, become partially satisfied, check out the mods, become disappointed that you can't afford any of the good mods, test your weapon again, modify your weapon some more, leave the area via the chopper to perform the operation, roam the same map that you explored before on over ten previous missions, and then quit the mission because the reload speed on your weapon is terrible. That, and you ran out of rations.And the whole thing repeats (figuratively).I agree that it is repetitive, but that's what most of these Monster Hunter-style games are like.Personally, I enjoy these kind of games where I drop myself into an open world, roam the map to find my objective, collect materials, build my own weapons, and then repeat the same process.If you like games such as Metal Slug or Contra and are expecting this game to be similar, don't buy Mercenary Kings.If you like games such as Monster Hunter or God Eater with 2D side-scrolling shooter aspects, then you might actually like Mercenary Kings.I also recommend a controller.

												A simple metal slug clone this is not. While the gamplay is similar, the depth here appears huge. With a multitude of weapon parts to buy using resources you scavenge while gunning down a horde of different enemy types.You'd think it would be hard to get bored of such a game, however while there are (in the end) a large number of levels, each stage forces you to play through the latest two over and over, rescuing hostages this time and destroying the generator that time... but the objective is a moot point, the journey from start to finish is the same from level to level.It's a shame since at times the pacing is great, set pieces work well and bosses are challenging... but eventually it all boils down to shoot, jump, reload, repeat. And 20hrs of that is asking too much.[5]			"

												Mercenary Kings is a blast to play, as long as you have a group of friends that will follow you into the hectic battles that is Mecenary Kings. Gameplay is very similar to Metal Slug so it gives you that kind of nostalgia from when you played back in the arcades. Weapons are great and have so much variety. The weapon building system works marvelously and offers a wide range of funny and versatile weaponry. The fact that you have to pick up materials throughout the levels gives more purpose to explore and gain more currency. Characters in the game are colorful and are each are very useful when using thier skills to strengthen your character and help progress through the levels with ease. At this point in time, everything seems to work; havent experienced any bugs of any kind yet. The only critism that I could throw in would be to make inviting friends to join your game slighty easier. More along the lines of a joinable lobby, instead having to in game; talk to an NPC and then inviting your friends. All in all I had so much fun playing with my buddies and it was well worth the cost, even if I got it discounted when purchasing it from Humble Bundle. IGN 10/10 XD.			"

												The Good:Very well done retro 2D shooterVery powerful gun customization systemLots of stuff to craftThe Bad:Poor tutorial, you really need to read the in-game manual on the main menu (which inexplicably is not accessible once you've loaded a charater).Major pacing issues, especially at the beginning. The first part of the game is the most difficult since you haven't unlocked the good stuff yet and haven't memorized the maps yet.Repetitive missions reuse the same maps over and over with slightly different objectives.Enemies can be quite cheap at times (pinning you against a wall, attacking through a wall) and the retro gameplay means you can only shoot in 4 directions even though some enemies come right in on your blind spots.Mission objectives are frequently unmarked and you have to scour the level to find what you're looking for (and hope you know where all the hidden areas are).Reloading is annoying and slow for a run and gun type game.The Ugly:Endless instantly respawning enemies (they respawn as soon as you leave the screen) add a lot of frustration and annoyance when traversing a level for the nth time trying to find an unmarked objective.This game is very close to being amazing, but suffers from a few fatal flaws. None of them would be particularly difficult to fix, but as it stands I can't recommend this game (especially at the asking price) unless you're willing to get past the initial difficulty wall and unlock the good guns.

												Top quality guncrafting gameplay! Honestly that's the biggest reason to get it.The platforming is good, boss design is on point, art is obviously amazing, soundtrack is bangin'. The plot is pretty standard, but the dialogue / characters are both quite well executed.The multiplayer is quite enjoyable, and helps offset the tedium of resource gathering (a core part of the game, at least if you want more gun parts). There's enough system diversity (proficiencies, mods, ammo types, weapon aspects) that you can make some delightfully awesome guns.Verdict: give it a shot! ;)			"

												This game is the cutting edge of ""meh"". Played 5 minutes of it with a friend on console, decided to get for PC. Controls are awful for PC and quite frankly it's only good in couch coop, and even then it is indeed limited.I have a lot of gripes with this game, so I'll try to stay constructive where possible, but generally this game is guilty of every ""passable"" class sin in the book.-Enemies reskinned painfully often.-Static-y AI, bonkers damage. Limited lives that makes you need to go back to camp, load, select your mission, talk to your pilot, and reload the level. Dear god. This is frustrating beyond belief.-Great weapon customization system, but you can totally build weapons WAY too specialized and since you get only 1 gun, special weapons have no real use long term.-Boss reskins. Because why the hell not apparently. This is by far one of the worst sins in the book IMO.-Grindy as hell farming resources and the like. Some missions send you out hunting hostages or resources, and god damn is it boring to all hell. Forget a second playthrough outright. I put 47 hours into the game getting all the things the first go, but attempting a 2nd playthrough is murdering me to death.-Both playable characters (there's only 2) are painfully uninteresting. First playthrough I played the chick because at least she wasn't ""rambo clone guy"", but even she wasn't a particularly interesting character.-Bosses run away from you after a certain time, and their fights are based off learning attacks almost exclusively. This is a painful combination, but having to jog around the level, find the boss at any of 3 combat points, and re-engage him hoping he doesn't run away in front of your face (because that can happen, too) is absolutely there.-Reused levels and levels generally lacking much in the way of true definition, with a few outlying exceptions.-Virtually non-existant plot, dialogue, and soundtrack from what I can gather. But expect to get talked at about uninteresting crap for hours anyways.Look. I liked this game enough to play it through my first go, but coming back, every sin in this game is magnified exponentially. This game is long, uninteresting, and littered with so many time wasting, sluggish core mechanics I legitimately wonder what the hell they devs were thinking.Crap. I was trying to be constructive. See? It's that hard. Oh well. Detailed negative criticism beats enraged or understaffed negative criticism any day.Save your money. Don't buy this game. It's fun for a few hours, but then all the charm wears off. I legitimately regret buying this game outright.			"

												wanted to like this game, but majority of the issues with it are due to the developers being unresponsive/outright misadvertising their game. mercenary kings is touted as a multiplayer game, but you're not unlocking the ability to even choose multiplayer options until 8-10 hours into the game. there are also achievement sync issues, which devs have not responded to me when i brought it to their attention. not to mention one of the achievements is literally ""you gave over x amount of money to our kickstarter!"" (there is an in-game way to get said achievement, but that's missing the point). most importantly, i could forgive the game for being repetivie and grindy since it reuses a lot of the same areas/maps for multiple missions, but the game's overall goal is just kind of a time waster. you get stuff to unlock cosmetic stuff, gun parts (large majority of which you're not using), knives (while useful, again, you're only using one out of the several there are), and various minor upgrades. nothing in the crafting system feels like you're actually /crafting/ anything, just engaging in a glorified merchant system. and while it seems petty to harp on these things, this is largely all the gameplay amounts to.at the end of the day i'd have given this a slightly positive review since the game can be fun (if repetitive), and the art/music shines above the gameplay. but, with the devs being so misleading and unengaging, i can't say it's worth picking up.

												Great game, fantastic graphics, superb music, great gameplay.Best played with friends, but beware:  Local co-op is a joke, and the the way that split-screen / menu management works out looks and behaves terrible.  Mutiplayer co-op is a far better experience.  Overall a fun and enjoyable game, but it has some flaws:- It can get very grindy and repetitve around mid-to-late game.  It picks up quick enough for the end-game content, but that mid-game stretch is exhausting. - The levels are repetitive.  The level design is largely superb, but get used to playing them over and over again for different missions.- The crafting system is a great addition but also increases the grindiness tenfold as certain rare materials have depressingly-low drop rates.  A small gameplay change could fix that, I think--giving the player the ability to combine mundane materials together to get quality materials comes to mind--but in lieu of that, get used to checking the wiki early and often.Despite the grindiness, the game ends on a great note, and I highly recommend it.  Here's hoping for a sequel!			"

My only complaint is that the bosses have too much damn heath, and keep running away, buuut that's Monster Hunter.			"

												A game that looks like Metal Slug... but don't be fooled.With the best of Paul Robertson's Pixel Artstyle, Mercenary Kings is way more comparable with Mega Man Classics than Metal Slug...Slow-paced combat with very unsatisfying and re-used Bosses... Mercenary Kings drowns in it's own Nostalgia by purposely using only the bad gameplay gimmicks that made 2D games great.Add all that to boring Grinding, Cool-Looking Weapons... that end up just being static models with DMG percentages that aren't worth all of the Grinding.Boss Battles get the more clunky and tiresome approach of Monster Hunter ( this♥♥♥♥♥♥still has fans?! ) where you just study the moveset, wait for the brief windows when you can damage them... and go back to waiting... SNORE!...Mercenary Kings is everything that Metal Slug is not... just get a Metal Slug Bundle and evade this like the Plague.			"

												It could be good, but it is not.Crafting your own guns is a nice idea and the game offers enough gear to experiment. However, it puts in a barrier of horrible grind for materials and god forgive you craft the wrong stuff and end up with a crappy gun, then you have to use that until you get new materials again.Which would be ok, if the gameplay itself was good enough to not make the grind a horrible experience.But the controls are just the worst ive ever played a game with. Unresponsive, clunky, slow and just bad made.The leveldesign is atrocious, often demanding you to jump so exactly that it becomes bothersome.Oh yeah, and if that wasnt enough, you get a timelimit on your mission AND if you are unlucky you can finish the mission anyway, because you didnt pack in some C4 and cant blow up the door with the objective behind it.Nice hm?Playing missions is ok at first, but really i dont know why i would play them. The best part of this game is crafting your own gung, but playing with that gun is boring at best, and outraging at worst.If the controls and missions were in any way like Metal Slug, this could be the best game ive ever played.But thats not the case.And the bad enemies or bosses, so uninspired, boring and respawning whenever their location gets out of screen, doesnt help the game and only is one more nail in the coffin.I jumped back in from time to time, and see whether i like the game or not.I think i got my money somehow worth considering my playingtime.But i also would deny that since i didnt enjoy playing it really and only go about half way through the game before quitting.Just not worth the time and money.
