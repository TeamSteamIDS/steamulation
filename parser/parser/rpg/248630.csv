Early Access Review
								I'm a sucker for PVP melee combat games that involve both mind games and skill to win. I bought this game on a whim because I had nothing else much to play after I watched the trailer. it seemed very similar to Dark Souls and I was especially intrigued in the spells + sword fighting gameplay. First thought was, ""damn, why is this game so bright?"" but the game is beautiful. Some things aren't texturized that well and the game is full of glitches, bugs and inconsistencies but that is what an early access is about. Things will be fixed and as of yesterday, a patch has already been released acknowledging many inconsistencies and imbalances. Using the mouse to aim the direction of sword swings isn't unheard of, but I think the game does it well, and with the addition of bows, throwing axes, mines and magical spells, it adds alot of depth to the game. Discovering what types of spells go with which swords or abilities is fun and experimental and there are many different combinations to tinker with.All in all, I think this game has so much potential right now. If FlyLeaps studios could make the sword play a little more responsive, (sometimes, hits do not register), add a duel-mode similar to that of chivalry, and some more content (including more spells, swords, maps etc.) this game will be big hit that will most likely appeal to a competitive community.

								This game was nearly unplayable for me.  No matter the server one player always had higher ping, and this enabled them to dominate all as there was no way to defend against attacks since the ping delayed you too much for it to even register a block.It's a awesome concept, but to have a intricate battle system you also need the netcode or servers to back it up.

								Another early access game with plenty of potential behind it, especially since it is developed by solely a two man team at the moment. It boasts 360 directional attacks and parrying with swords. While this may be a dreamland for swordplay, one must not forget the dark fantasy background it has by including magic. It's a game that's still currently rough around the edges, however still manages to be enjoyable.This game may not be for everyone due to the amount of work it still needs. As this game is in Early Access, the developers do want you to report problems and make suggestions on their Kingdoms Rise Community Hub. So if you can make constructive feedback with some research, why not pitch in to help out?			"

Early Access Review
								First off I would like to say that I've been playing this game since the beginning and have literally not stopped playing. If what you're looking for is a multiplayer melee experience similar to that of war of the roses or mount & blade, but set in a fantasy world where you control magic at your fingertips, then look no further. This game really delivers, for an alpha.The updates in this game take awhile since there are only two devs working on the game and they do aim for monthly updates, doesn't always happen but they do let us know what is going on. As I have said the game is still in alpha and will have some bugs here and there. Playing with a low ping is highly recommended. Anything over 130 (in game not in the server menu) is not very playable.Right off the bat you are able to customize your knight in some impressive fantastical armor and clothing, but there are also choices for some more 'realistic' gear. Devs are adding new things all the time and are always showing off their progress on the Kingdoms Rise facebook page.As of right now there isn't a tutorial in-game, but one can be seen in the guides section made by the devs. You don't need to look at the tutorial, but believe me when I say, at the very least look at the parry and parry lock section of the manual. It will save you a lot of grief in game and once you master those skills, gameplay becomes even more addicting. You can get away with spamming away attack with other new players, but once you meet someone who knows how to parry, you will most likely lose. Luckily, those experienced few in the community are always willing to help out new players and usually it isn't too hard to ask these guys for some help.There are many different swords in the game, each with their special effects and stats. They aren't perfectly balanced, but your use in magic and skill with the sword is enough to offset any of the swords' abilities currently available. Magic in this game isn't over powered and is meant to be used to complement your swordsmanship as well as mold the playstyle you want. You can only equip 2 spells, however, you are able to have doubles of any spell as well as have a large selection to choose from. There are many types of spells from attack, to defense, to healing and mobility. Mix and match to create the playstyle you want.You will have a hard time at first controlling the sword with your mouse due to the nature of the screen moving with you as you strike, but like I said, look up the tutorials and get some practise performing the moves. They do require some timing and precision, so if an easy mode game is what you're looking for, then you are in the wrong place. However, if you're looking for a competetive game where the skill cap is high and it is very much possible for a skilled player to take on an entire team, without the use of cheap tricks/exploits, this game is for you.**AUGUST UPDATE**AI has been added to the game and makes for quite the training partners as well as a challenging surviving mode that will have you crying for mama within the first 5 waves. Really fun if you just want to mess around by yourself, or can't currently find a game. Just remember not to use the disonnect button while you're in the survival server as it will crash the game			"

								An example of Early Access gone to trash, which had great potential. (Among many others)Stay away from this.Edit: Apparently, I have spotted the dev responding to some comments recently about this game's status. I understand that you are a very small team of two and such, and the slow progress can be understandable. But you need to understand yourself that you have to keep at least some announcements, or some kind of dev blog about this game, rather than succumb us into dead silence for almost a year now. That's not how 'business' works around EA titles, and you can clearly see you've earned a pretty harsh reputation from your community. Just my two cents out there. Don't leave us in the dark, because there are other EA titles that have done this. I have no idea if this game will even progress at all, since now you speak of a 'port'. Do know that not everyone is happy by the way you've handled things, however. We want this game to succeed just as much as you do, so act like you want to.			"

								A work in progress... but IT has so much potential!!! Its a lot of fun with just a two-four people, and its a lot of fun with a large group. (That's a big bonus) The controls take a little while to get used to: BUT take forever to master completely. Learning when to block and when to attack. Not only that: BUT HOW TO BLOCK and where to attack can be tricky. MY BIGGEST complaint: is how SLOW you run. IT makes you feel heavily armored. However... it really slows the pace of the game down. Increasing the speed a little bit will make this game bad ♥♥♥. Getting that first double, then triple kill makes this game addictive because while your character can't move super fast. That doesn't mean: the action is slow when you enter the melee fringe. THE ♥♥♥♥ HITS THE FAN REALLY FAST!			"

Early Access Review
								Note: This review recaps my old review/experiences and then goes into more recent attempts at playing.One year ago, I was longing to experience Dark Souls, but couldn't due to hardware limitations. I began a quest of looking for a suitable hold-me-over and found Kingdoms Rise. Kingdoms Rise reminded of the combat experience I longed for- up close and personal melee combat with some ranged and magic attacks mixed in. After purchasing the game, I excitedly hopped in and was met with bugs and lack of features that killed the user experience (short recap: menus that didn't work, broken key bindings/controller support, no tutorials). As a new user, I was quickly turned off. As I tried playing, I became flustered with the lack of guidance and no tutorials to help me out. I did eventually find the video tutorials that the developer posted, but found it hard to implement these lessons against players with 20+ hours compared to my newbie self. As I tried to persist, I was put off by the bad GUI and lack of a tutorial. Players on community sites and Steam kept repeating that after about 10 hours of playing the kill cam, you would start to get better and that the bugs were not an issue. Ignoring the bugs issue, I was very put off by this. Call me weak or lazy, but I would rather not waste time (like my money) on a kill-cam simulator. In similar games, I was able to learn and start improving long before the 10 hour mark. Sadly, this was not the case with Kingdoms Rise. As I now review other reviews on Steam, I can see that I wasn't the only one that burned out shortly after starting the game. Between bugs and difficulty learning the new system, players gave up.------------------------------------------Nearly one year later, and a recently built new computer, the Black Friday/early Winter sale reminded me of this game. So, I redownloaded it and gave it another try. It is nice to finally see big bugs ironed out (menus function properly, controllers work, keybindings stick) and some areas of the game (practice range, menus, in game interface) improved. Sadly, the developers took too long with these changes and lost nearly the entire playerbase. On the server browser, I was presented with ~15 servers to choose from. Of all these servers and game modes, only one server had one person. Thinking it may be a bot/AFKer to draw people in, I decided to let the game find a match for me, hoping to find that one server that people were still playing on. I was given an empty server to fight NPCs on (alone) - which got old, fast. Wondering if it was just my luck with the match system, I hopped on a popular site with karma points to see what discussions were going on. What I saw was not pleasant. The latest post was 6 months ago, and the next post after that was 10 months ago. Many of the comments on Steam and this site call this game ""A quick cash grab by the developer"". It's sad to see a potentially great concept die out. Personally, I believe it is to blame for being released (even as an early access) too early and not enough speed from the developer. ------------------------------------------Assumedly eager to make some money - which is very understandable - I feel like the developer rushed the publishing of this game. From my perspective, this effectively killed the game when the developer couldn't keep up. While it should be a topic of its own, I feel this is greatly to blame on Valve's allowance of Early Access games. Between the dead player base and the improvements, I'm torn between recommending this game or giving it a thums down. But, because of the dead player base (the key aspect that makes this game playable), I'm going to keep my thumbs down.As the game (hopefully) gets more exposure during the sales, I'll keep giving it more chances to see if the community sparks a bit and see just how much the game has ironed out. As I stated in my previous review, I'd love to give this game a thumbs up. It's a great concept. But right now, I simply can't.			"

								Kingdoms Rise, in its early development presents players with the opportunity to beat the living S*** out of their friends or foes from around the world. Introducing a perfect blend between magic usage and melee combat, it could arguably be considered the magical equivelant of the Chivalry series. The weapon conbat is fluent and precise, with parrying and blocking working efficiently and allowing for some truly awesome duels.Kingdoms Rise, though an awesome game has several flaws which hinder its sucess in the playability area. The foremost of which being a lack of players. Some games become simply outstanding when played on a full server, alas, Kingdoms Rise seldom presents the possibility for this. The game in its pre-release accomplished more by ways of player versus player melee combat than many other games have accomplished in their whole lifetime.Whether you play Kingdoms Rise for its awesome character customization, to blow your friends to pieces with fireballs, to teleport behind enemies and impale them on a blade of flames, Kingdoms Rise is for you.The only recommendation I offer to those playing it is to go in with an open mind. The game has its bugs, as one would expect from an early release game. Though any braincell-possessing human being can see the potential in this title. Regardless of what the game is like now, it leaves me and other players with a ready mind for the full release. When this game fully releases, it will be a game to remember.`Durzo Blint			"

								(June 7, 2015: I wrote this review quite a while ago. Progress has continued to be slow, very slow. As I said in the review, it's still fairly enjoyable at this point, but honestly I feel like the most recent update was a step forward and two back. I've pretty much entirely stopped playing, but you might still find some fun in this game.)The game seems to be getting a lot of hate. If you ask me, people aren't giving it a chance. The mechanics are solid, fighting is very addicting once you get the hang of it. There is a low player count, but as a USA server player I don't have too much trouble finding a game. Other regions may be more difficult.Development is slow, to be sure. But honestly, the game costs 15 bucks and I've been hooked on it for months.

								Boy this is ♥♥♥♥.No, seriously. This has absolutely ridiculous levels of horrible. Everything that can possibly be wrong with this game is. Comical levels of clipping, the name of program is ""MADE WITH UDK"" - as in ""MADE WITH UDK has stopped working. I cannot believe I greenlit this. Actually, I can. Honestly this type of a game where you can kind of do the RPG spell-sword deal outside of Magicka is a good idea, and the way this was presented in Greenlight was pretty good. But let's get real, it's been about two years that this has been in early access and the features on it are absolutely minimal. You still fall out of the world, you still have a attack-defend combat cycle that you get locked in and can't break out without a third party's intervention. There's no time to do anything else besides hold left click for five seconds, hold right click for five seconds because the charge times take so long. There's basically only a,w,s,d and jump for movement controls, no evasion, nothing fancy, just walk left and right. It's just broken in the worst places and stiff and static in the very very few places that it is functional.It's not the worst game I've ever played, but that doesn't mean it's not a colossal waste of money.

Just another indy money grab if you ask me, not sure how these projects get put on to the store page but if it's a dead game then suspend sales at the very least to protect people with background information.

								Visuals that reminds me a tad of Dark Souls, a fighting system that reminds me of War of the Roses, a very skill based game and a nice variety of spells.So if you're looking for quick PvP melee-axe-throwing-backstabbing-spellcasting-arrow-shooting-trap-setting game. This is the game to get. Still in early access stage it has left me wanting more and more. Blocking works wonderfully and the locking system is very rewarding when performed correctly. I have no big remarks to the fact that the game is early access and just developed by two dudes. Sure, it’s a bit unpolished in some areas, but nothing really game breaking. With more things coming in the future and smoothened out product, it will be one of the best melee action games out there. All in all, if you like action with big swords then this is a must get.Edit 2014-08-12:A couple of updates later and I'm still loving it. Sure the game suffers a bit from a two dev-team with long time between patches, but I still have loads of fun.			"

No. This game requires your full concentration of your 360 surroundings. It takes skill and planning on your next move to take out your enemy player.Completley customizable, from your characters armor, to which weapons and spells you use.Amazing dueling system, as well as an outraging free for all frenzy!Ypou can not get this game and expect to be best in the lobby right off the bat. Give it time, watch your opponant and counter his moves. Learn the games playing style and adjust to it, and the skill sets you have chosen.The players that you see running show in the game are usually nice guys, dont be affraid to ask them for pointers and advice.Over all, this game is so much fun to play, one of my all time favorites, and i recommend it to anyone who is looking for an exciting, skillful fun and challenging game.9/10			"

								I see allot of comments saying:,,Dont buy this game,slow servers,it wont get updated,etc.''But it is getting updated slowly.Just today a new update came out that really made this game more awesome.Also,it depends on which server you play,because they have allot of servers for different regions.For people who dont know anything about this game:Its an Multiplayer PvP and Survival (since todays update)Game where you can create your loadout out of weapons and spells which each player has since the beginning(There are no new unlockable weapons) and a Character menu where you can change the look of you char,but it doesnt gives you better abilities.Each Weapon,Spell or Special Item can be chosen by player,who sets his own loadout and fights in multiple gamemodes against other teams,players,bots,etc.Its also only medieval weapons and honestly,I love playing this game.The grafics are amazingly beutiful,Characters can look really good,The combat system is great,but there are some grafial bugs like:,,Capes and armor just beeing inside a wall/ground/body,Or at the end of a map where there are only textures where you do fall out of the map and die.I Really do recommend this game and its allot of fun with friends.(Sorry if my englishh isnt to great...)

								Don't bother. This game is, while admittedly in Alpha state, very very poor quality. The combat is reminiscent of chivalry if you were stuck in third person and moved at a snail's pace. The graphics are on/off fuzzy. One moment I felt drunk, the next everything was super clear. Spells seem very underwhelming in terms of offensive stuff, while the teleport spell seems very overpowered. Lag seems to be an issue with this game as well. It is your typical indie fare. The redeeming quality of this game is the customization of the characters, which was the extent of my fun minute of the game out of the half hour I tried it, if that speaks to anything of the game's quality. Would not suggest this game to my friends unless they want to try yet another third-person battle arena style game that runs like a steaming heap of...well...you know?			"

								Kingdoms Collide couldn't have asked for a better sequel. Combat is somewhat like Chivalry, only everyone's on equal ground and there are 8 swing/parry directions, as long as a clever parry locking system to raise the skill cap extremely high. There's also a ton of character and loadout customization, like magic! You can have 2 spells ranging anywhere from nukes, teleport, crowd control, magic immunity, healing, etc. and use any combination you like, as well a special slot that is used for a bow, mines, traps, throwing axes, what have you.There's a ton of game modes, ranging from huge FFA fights, organized duels, last-man-standing (Counter-Strike style), as well as a survival and practice mode.The learning curve is sharp, but it's getting better. They're adding a lot of features into the game to make it easier to understand what's going on, but even then a good swordsman can take you out pretty quickly. I had to pull a player aside, pull out training swords and get smacked for a while as he taught me before I understood what was going on. The game is extremely satisfying, and has a bright future.Even in it's early state, the devs have the genius and success of Kingdoms Collide behind them, and Kingdoms Rise is looking fantastic.If you read this review, and you're thinking about getting this game, send me a message on Steam. If you plan on getting this game, add me as a friend/send me a message and let's duel! I'm still learning, and I can help teach you as well! The game is a lot of fun, and I want to help show that to you first hand.			"

								-Little progress in 3 years.-Single dev decides to start porting to Unreal 4-Working on two others titles, Territory and Blade Rite, the latter of which is a successor to this (unfinished) game.-Pay-to-Win DLC recently added to Steam.I understand life and circumstances can get in the way of funding and developing a game, but the way in which this game is currently being supported shows desperation (which I can empathize with) and a lack of business ethics (which I cannot empathize with). If the dev(s) decides to make good on this game by giving owners Blade Rite for free AND/OR make this game what its supposed to be and ditch the P2W DLC, I will change my review accordingly. In it's current state, I cannot recommend supporting this game, nor the practices it represents.			"

								“Kingdoms Rise” is a great melee game to pickup and go with. No leveling or unlocking, everything is immediately available, and lots of fun. I even picked up a 2nd copy for the occasional friend to play.With in-depth & intuitive mechanics for the genre, blocking isn't frustrating or over powered like in ""War of the Vikings"". Instead the combat system makes a lot of sense, and not just because I read the manual – though it did help explain combos, counter-attacks & how to parry.Character customization is also very impressive – whether you want to be a heavily plated knight, a nimble ninja, or something in between, you pick every piece of armor you wear (or choose not to wear). Combined with your choice of weapons & spells, players of all archetypes step onto the battlefield with a variety of builds – often resembling characters from different videogames (such as Link & Ninja Gaiden).While ""War of the Vikings"" offers higher production quality, and a realistic experience in the genre - ""Kingdoms Rise"" offers more fun with its deep & balanced combat mechanics, character customization, and vivid colourful graphics.I’m really looking forward to what this title offers in full release! Keep up the great work Flyleap Studios!			"

								This game is really fun! Sure it's early access, and you notice it on some bugs that appear now and then. But most of the time it's just awesome! Some people complain about that the fighting is just about mashing the left mouse button, but that is far from the truth. Sure mashing is how you start out(probably), but when you learn how to block that's when the real fun starts. Locked in a swordfight where the smallest of mistakes can cost you your life. The spells add another layer to the fighting such as ice bolt which freezes the target for a short duration which leaves them defenceless against your sword swing, unless they dodge or neglect it with magic immunity or planeshift. In conclusion, a great game with a deep fighting system. Not to mention the awesome character costumization.			"

								I do love this game, and want to give it a  thumbs up simply from the time spent with a group of friends wailing on each other.However, the devs have made some design decisions that have put a hamper on things for me especially, and feel like the game is going in a direction that I dont feel will keep my interest in the game.When we initially started playing, all magic, items, and swords were available from the start, and it was a blast experimenting with them at first, and then switching on the fly during a match as we got more experienced, just to keep each other on our toes.With recent changes, it's moved to a level up unlock system. It's not awful, but it's not good, and just makes it feel like most of the gameplay we had already been playing was now time-gated in a way.Looking at the current test branch, there is now a system where upgrades are now an in-match unlock, which I do not find fun. Some people might, but this frustrates me far more than feels like it gives me something to work towards, and always seems to fall into that trap of strong getting stronger, and weak falling farther and farther behind.When this game was just deathmatch, with everything available and on the table to use, it was the most fun. The way I see things going, I feel like it's going to just turn into yet another prestiege-unlock fest or worse, and this is something that really counts against the game in my eyes.Hopefully, things will turn out for the better, and I do somewhat understand the reasons for the dev taking so long to update, but for now, I'm going to have to give this game a thumbs down, unless I see some promise that the problems I with the game are unfounded, or improved.In short; I love the combat, I really do (magic barrier a bit too strong against everything though), but I dont like where I see things going.

								(This review is late. I bought the game in 14 I believe)Early access foooor... how many years? I would've rather spent $15 watching paint dry. It would've been less frustrating and more rewarding at the end. Could've gotten past the terrible experience of the game if the developers hadn't told me to screw off when I requested a refund due to incompatibility regardless of reaching high above the system requirements on a high-end gaming laptop. And when I say 'screw off', I'm almost putting it nicely and giving them too much credit.			"

Early Access Review
								Do not be fooled by the trailer, the game moves almost half as slow as the trailer suggests. You cannot run without putting away your sword at which point you have to draw it again in order to fight or defend yourself.Normal movement speed without running is painfully slow though the teleport spell alleviates this a small bit.The sound in the game is overbearing as every character shouts out surly insults in a psuedo medieval male voice that gets old within the first match.While it is refreshing that swords do realistic damage, causing people to die in 1 or 2 hits, it causes fights to boil down to people dying and respawning to run back to a central point and backstab the people already fighting repeatedly. This also gets old within the first match or two as there is no minimap or even a real way to hear people coming up behind you. Graphically, the game feels a bit dated already, and due to the washed out color palette it can be difficult to even see other characters within parts of the battlefield.While the game is still in early access status, there are still noticeable elements such as keybinding bugs and extremely awkward sword swinging controls which can hamper combat even further.In short, the concept of the game is a very good one, but so far implementation leaves quite a bit to be desired. If you enjoy games such as Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden, you may be disappointed as the pace of combat is almost slower than in oblivion or skyrim.			"

								This game is really fun! Sure it's early access, and you notice it on some bugs that appear now and then. But most of the time it's just awesome! Some people complain about that the fighting is just about mashing the left mouse button, but that is far from the truth. Sure mashing is how you start out(probably), but when you learn how to block that's when the real fun starts. Locked in a swordfight where the smallest of mistakes can cost you your life. The spells add another layer to the fighting such as ice bolt which freezes the target for a short duration which leaves them defenceless against your sword swing, unless they dodge or neglect it with magic immunity or planeshift. In conclusion, a great game with a deep fighting system. Not to mention the awesome character costumization.			"

								7/10Purely on potential. It seemed like they have slapped a bunch of different aspects of several RPGs together and made this game. Graphics are cool and gameplay is somewhat actually addicting. A lot of gilitches but that is to be expected in an early access game such as this. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone who has a problem with unfinished games because this is most definitely unfinished, but if you're looking to kill a few hours in a hack and slash multiplayer game, then this is for you.

That being said, the gameplay of this game shines. Its a magical swordfight, and with enough people on one server, it gets insane in the best way.

								  Kingdoms Rise, a fantastically fun beta game where you a customize a knight, hop in a match, and ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up in a pvp fashion: free-for-all, conquest, or team-deathmatch! I've been eye-balling this game for the past few days and decided to get it and I'm not disappointed because this game delivers! The fun factor alone is good enough to buy this game, but then it also has beautiful landscapes, easy to play (for the most part; parrying is something I'm still working on), and nice character customization (even though it's not even done, it's still good for what it is). Of course there's bugs, glitches, very few collision issues, etc. with the game since it's still in development, but thankfully it does NOT take away from the fun at all really. All-in-all, this game has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of potential due to what they have and the engine they're using to develop it (UDK is awesome from personal experience). I'm anxious to see what else they do with this game!  I read a few reviews that mentioned it reminded them of Dark Souls, and as a fan of that game also, I can see where they're coming from. By all means though, from watching vids and playing it, they didn't rip anything from the game or the ideas; it's no clone. It carries a certain aesthetic that ""it's a dark place that you want to be in because it's beautiful"" and the sword-play mechanics are pretty good.These are a few things I hope to see over time as the game develops:-Full graphics optimization (on a semi-decent rig, I still have to play in super low res).-Balancing out spells. Some spells make others irrelevant due to how OP they are atm.-More weapons, sidearms, and spells to flesh out more variety and strategies.-Make some clothing aspects react to the team color so it's easier to differentiate who's on who's team (I've killed countless allies by accident because they didn't look to be a teammate lol [sorry bros]).I know these would take even more time, but it would be cool too:-A developed story.-Single Player Adventure Mode... or something along those lines, maybe even with Co-Op._My Rig Specs_CPU: AMD Phenom 2 x4 945; 3 GHz rated @ 6.75 GHzRAM: 8 gbVideo Card: GeForce GT 610; 1gb VRAMOS: Win 7 Home Premium; 64-bitDirectX: 11Internet: Fiberoptic Connection			"

Early Access Review
								I would just like to say a few things about my experiences with Kingdom's Rise. It's greatest flaw is that it is an incomplete game; which is perfectly fine seeing as it is in early access. Make sure you take this into account when analyzing the game yourself. Another thing that might initially be a turn-off is the lack of an active player-base meaning those trying to play the game solo won't get to do much playing, which is a shame because the gameplay is quite enjoyable despite all its buggy unfinished-ness.I have yet to play the game extensively, and I bought a four-pack for me and some friends so we've had someone to play with. What we have experienced is a genuinely fun melee-combat game, which is something we have been searching for for quite some time. The combat is visceral; every hit and parry feels great and the spells are a great way to add some flair to what would otherwise be just a sword-fighting game. There's plenty of variety of tactics that you can utilize to take down your opponents in creative ways by mixing sword-type with spell choice, and if you get tired of one build, just try another. Get a few people together and you'll have a lot of (admittedly unpolished) fun.If I were to compare this game to any others that I have played I would have to place it somewhere between Mount and Blade and Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. It has swordplay reminiscent of M&B and the magic/force powers of Jedi Academy, but the swordplay is more active than M&B and without all the confusing randomness (that I felt) in the lightsaber battles of JA.I hope you find this useful and would absolutely reccommend purchasing the game. Buying the game increases the player base and gives support to a game that has a lot of potential. Even though it is rough and incomplete, with support and patience I think this game could turn into something truly unique.Anyway, that's my impression. Take it as you will and with discretion; thank you for your time.			"

								Although the game is pretty empty right now (hard to find other players), this game has a lot of potential and is really fun to play.Sword fights are interresting and requier skills, and magics bring different fighting styles, from the stealthy invisible ninja that tries to stab you from behind to the tanky knight with a shockwave spell.A few bugs need correction, but the game is defenitly playable and I hope it will get even better.The big problem right now is that all servers are empty and it's quiet difficult to find other players to fight against, but you can still have fun in survival mode against the bots.Most of us are just waiting for the game to be finished.To the developers: Please keep the work going, your game is fun and I'd really like to see it finished with a big community.

								THIS GAME IS NOT ABANDONED!!!!!!So, gameplay is fluid and amazing, loved the interactions from what I had played.  I haven't played the game in recent months, or years, but I messaged the dev the other day after remembering this hidden gem.    He's getting ready to release a massive update as well as a console port (game is moving to Unreal Engine 4).I have high expectations for the update.Something he mentioned:  Players will be able to host servers (not sure if it's coming with this one, but it will happen.Now you can all stop complaining about there being no active servers for the game.  And since the game isn't abandoned, your other arguments about why you have a negative review are invalid.The developer is LITERALLY ONE PERSON.  Not a studio, not a team, just one guy.  And you wonder why it takes him 6-18 months to release large updates.			"

								It ♥♥♥♥ing sucks to not recommend this game cause it is so damn good, but for being in early access and not having any updates come out for at least 2 years I simply can not recommend this game. I've played nearly 10 hours of this game and I would still play more of it if there were more people on the servers. The only single player is a basic wave base game mode which is kind of boring unless you give yourself a challenge like ""Don't use any magic"" or something like that. Other than that the game is perfect where it is. If they pushed out one more update just fixing the bugs and doing some optimization I think more people would buy the game and I could recommend it. Hell, if I saw 5 people on at a time on the same server I would be playing and I could actually recommend it.			"

								This is an amazing idea, and a beautiful execution.  It is a fun PvP game with a suprisingly deep combat system that is both easy to figure out (if you watch some tutorials) and has a very high skill cap.  Great character customization, and cool looking weapons combine to make it that you can make just about whatever style of knight you want. The only drawbacks that come to mind are that the community is fairly small, updates have been coming very slowly, and there are only two game modes (currently).  You have classic deathmatch, which is suprisingly fun given the combat system's being at its best, in my opinion, when it is a 1v1 fight.  Then you have kind of a fast paced king of the hill mode, I say fast paced because the capture timer is zero; as soon as one team has the advantage near a capture point it is theirs.  This makes the king of the hill mode feel strategic and a little frantic on ocassion.  The commnunity is not non-existant, I've always been able to find a game, but the server lists do look a little empty.  Bottom line is that if you're wondering whether or not to buy this game, you should.  The biggest issue is the size of the community and that can only be fixed by more people picking it up; and it is shaping up to be an incredibly fun PvP game the likes of which hasn't been done before.

								Bought this because it looked like Dark Souls, which turned out to be kinda true. The combat is a lot simpler, but there's nothing wrong with it necessarily. It's just ..simple. Pros:Spells provided lend to a huge variety in playstyles, keeping matches fresh and challenging. Devs plan to add even more of those, too, so keep an eye out. If you're into Dark Souls, and/or would like to kill people (or be killed) with giant swords--buy this. It's worth the money.Cons:Also must be noted that player population tends to run very low, so be patient with matches. It is a game in development, too, so, again, patience. You'll find this game is riddled with bugs and connection issues, but nothing is gamebreaking. I enjoy this game a lot; once you get the hang of it, it's pretty fun. As it stands, though, it isn't for everyone.			"

Early Access Review
								Kingdoms Rise is a game with a great deal of potential and the FlyLeapStudios is clearly working hard at that as stated by themselves and through their first patch which has alleviated a great deal of issues that were plaguing the game. The game is clearly Early Access so you have to understand the game will eventually be something worth your time and money but it needs a bit more polish. This review is written based on playing with a rather strong computer so just bear that in mind, your experience may vary.                                                                                       The Good             The good in this game is that the groundwork is clearly there for a great highly tactical chaotic sword and magic game. The art work is of a high quality and the animations are certainly well done and seamless. The gameplay is fluid for the most part and the game is functional. The combat can be quite fun as you swing, dodge, roll and use magic with relative ease to defeat your enemies. The magic spells are varied and can mix up your gameplay quite a bit. Do you want to be a stealthy guy who can assassinate someone? Do you want to be a guy who can take a lot of hits and get into the heat of battle? You have many options when deciding on the type of warrior you wish to be. The various swords in the game also have unique stats that help make your warrior be more true to your desires. Swords have stats such as increased damaged, increased back attack damage, etc and it all works quite well. Especially with the new patch that balances magic and swords out more. It is easy to be swept up into the frantic combat and I never found myself bored of it.           The character creator has a decent selection of varying armor pieces for your character to wear and make him (and soon to be her) look unique to a certain extent. In the battlefield you may lose some of your identity but you can stand out depending on how creative you get. Also the team plans on adding more game modes into the game to spice up the rather lacking selection at the moment.                                                                                          The Bad             This is an Early Access game so these problems I address could very well and probably will be gone within a month or two so take this with a grain of salt. Don’t dismiss the game because of what I say here, it is a game in progress and will evolve. The game has few modes to keep you interested right now. It’s your standard generic fps fair of Deathmatch and King of the Hill. The replay value isn’t much at the moment unless you really enjoy those.              Spawn camping has been somewhat of an issue in my time with the game in so far as team modes are concerned. In free for alls I was never once spawn killed. However in team matches if one side was overpowering another it would get to the point the other team would camp the spawn and keep you locked inside of it. Without a moving spawn point this can be an issue and while you can fight your way out eventually, the spawn system shouldn’t work like that. It has been proven in countless games that fixed spawn points typically lead to spawn killing.              Something about the combat doesn’t feel very meaty. It feels like I’m not really fighting so much as I am swinging a sword vaguely at the direction of pixels which pulled me out of the experience a bit. Also magic really needs some better animations, it is very easy to be blindsided by it with no warning. As I said in the last part the gameplay is still good but it needs more fine tuning to achieve all that it can.                                                                                      The Conclusion            The game itself again is Early Access and the gripes I mentioned I know will be stamped out a couple months time. The game does have a lot of positives going for it. The combat is smooth and the mechanics are definitely there for an excellent experience. The game is fun as it currently stands but the replay value is little at the moment. When more modes get added in and other gameplay mechanics I feel the game will have a far more powerful draw on peoples wallets. For now however the game needs more fine tuning and you can find better games with more replay value for your money. Keep an eye on patch notes and wait for some big updates before jumping in.			"

								Kingdims Rise is a unique 3rd person combat game with s large focus on customiation, with coiuld be deeper but kep in mind that this is still in devolpment. The key to sucess is find yourt personal fight style through the currently semi-limited customization options. The fight controls are easy to understand and every responsive but, imporved controller support would be an added benifit, Overall if you're a fan o chiviarly: mideval combat you'll definitely find alot to love about this game. Lastly, take your time and learn the controls and, you'll find that every kind you combat is well represented. I look forwar to the fuly release.			"

It is a great game with amazing graphics made by only one man. I love this game and already played ten hours of it. And best of all the game is only 15 dollers! This game is a lot like Chiverly Medivel Warfare but with magic and sick looking swords. Though this game has many bugs and the bow is over powered it is still a great game and I recomend it.

Pick this up, get a feel for it and look forward to the development of this potentially incredible title.Update 10/22 - New update, cool features but longing for stats.Four years later, dead, and an update doesn't make a game not dead.

								After my first couple hours with Kingdoms Rise, I would have clicked thumbs-down. After giving it a fair chance, and admitting that my initial negative opinion of the game was due to inexperience and false expectation, I've had a lot of fun with it.A player is not going to be immediately good at the game; it will take time for it to feel comfortable. But the directional swing/parry system that's implemented, as well as the spells, work well and are satisfying. I also think the pace of the game, the speed at which your character moves and the time-to-kill, fit well.The most importat issue that a potential player should be aware of is the current lack of other players. It is not impossible to find servers populated enough to have a good game, but it is more difficult than ideally it should be.			"

								This game is awful.It looks very nice. The actual artwork is well done. Spell effects are suitably flashy. Animations are stiff and clunky and the melee combat is atrocious.Blows are unresponsive and imprecise. Parrying is the same. It seems like it was intended to be modelled after the Mount and Blade/War of the Roses style of melee combat, but it fails utterly. If you're at all competitive minded, don't waste your time.			"

								Looking for a fun fantasy arena based fighting game? Then look much further as this is not that game. As soon as I entered the game I could tell something was just....off. A shoddy menu screen with a rather dreadful layout. I continued on to the character creation screen (same menu btw). Creating your character should be in a nice well lit area with a contrasting background for easier customization right? Wrong! Kingdom's Rise rejects these ideas and instead introduces a very intruding and ever present orange light to blot out any detail on your character. So the color scales they give you that dont work anyway, wouldnt show any color on your character to begin with!  Due to it being ""Early Access"" I decided to give it a bit of leniency and continue on to the gameplay. Boy was I in for a treat...and not a good treat. The artwork resembles what looks like a child splattered watercolor paint onto a game engine and the combat was no better. Terrible hit detection, sluggish movement, and (for lack of a better word) absolutely dreadful animations. Save your money, skip this game, and hope for a better future in this genre!			"

								Horrible optimization and the matchmaking is almost outright broken. I understand this is an Early Access game, but if you look at other titles like DayZ or Rust, they make their games playable and release semi-frequent updates to let their customers know what is happening. I originally puchased the game because of the customization aspects and ""diverse"" loadouts. All there is is a little menu before you begin a match that allows you to pick 1 Sword and 2 Spells. The swords are named ""Tank Sword"" or ""Speed Sword"". I mean hey, if you're going to have people purchase what seems to be a pre-alpha, add some lore for god's sake. Make it interesting. Do something like Magicka's element combining system or War of the Roses wide selection of weaponry besides ""Life-steal Sword"" and ""Fireball"". Lastly, I may be talking out of my ♥♥♥, and I have little to no idea how game developement works, but update your customers. Appeal to them. Have some guy from your staff do an AMA on Reddit or something. People on Reddit eat those AMA(Ask Me Anything)'s up. Garner some following. I really believe in this game, and I feel that it could become an insanely fun game with optimization and weapon/spell diversity, but right now? Not worth the ludicrous $15 price tag.			"

								Gonna try to keep this simple.Pretty much dead servers with rarely 3-4 people actually playing. Mechanic wise it's really interesting and combat is enjoyable till you run into the wall of nonsense this game has behind it.Fun till you discover that combat is based on getting close to each other and spinning around hoping to strike. (You can get good at it and all but in the end, it's spinning in circles).Roll is clumsy and worthless since if you're close to an enemy and you roll, for instance backwards, he can simply WALK up to your post-roll position and land a strike just like that.Some spells are OP, some UP, some situational and some just worthless or broken.I don't even know why this game has bows in it. You can get few kills with a bow initially, don't get me wrong, but then people realize that the counter to this magnificent weapon is movement and that's it. It becomes a mild annoyance.Imo anything but 1v1 (maybe 2v2 too but I only played it twice or something) is not playable (it just doesn't feel interesting, like at all, you just go in and hope to land a last hit), but then again, you'll rarely get to do anything but 1v1 'cos of the already mentioned dead servers.Playing with a controller is quite alright till someone who's semi-decent on a keyboard gets on the server and destroys you.Got it for free, tried it since I was hoping for some DS-like combat, was fun for few hours but that's pretty much it. No way this is worth 14€ in its current state.			"

								I personally don't even think this game is close to being playable. I know it's an early access game, but there are way too many problems to even have it on the Steam network. I haven't seen any work or fixes for the game so far since I've owned it. I can tell that down the line (quite a few months to a year) it may be playable and fun, but it's no where worth $15 until then.			"

								AMAZING. Been playing this game for quite some time now, and after every update it gets better and better.This is not one of your hack and slash and if i button mash ill get points type of game. No. This game requires your full concentration of your 360 surroundings. It takes skill and planning on your next move to take out your enemy player.Completley customizable, from your characters armor, to which weapons and spells you use.Amazing dueling system, as well as an outraging free for all frenzy!Ypou can not get this game and expect to be best in the lobby right off the bat. Give it time, watch your opponant and counter his moves. Learn the games playing style and adjust to it, and the skill sets you have chosen.The players that you see running show in the game are usually nice guys, dont be affraid to ask them for pointers and advice.Over all, this game is so much fun to play, one of my all time favorites, and i recommend it to anyone who is looking for an exciting, skillful fun and challenging game.9/10			"

								hmm.. first of the game was good, and if it died, well its the gamers fault. Why? Not enough support, No really, like nobody cared or gave it a chance. Whiich is why i believe that sometime you just cant let gamers get beta access, because they'll play it say that it sucks or that its not good enough for modern gaming, even thought its an early access beta ( which means that it STILL in development), and just keep developing the game in silence with out gaming the gaming communityany feedback. Because gamers just judge, and 75% of them don even know nor understand programing, nor how it dificult it is,  and more when a game came from SCRATCH. so good job community at kill a woderfully made game with a great future.In end i believe that if the game is dead they should reuse the mesh and textures and the holl concept and desing  and the code and further developeit, and use it in another project, because even though the game code was a mess its still had and has potential.So please Flyleap Studios Pty. Ltd. dont give up and keep going, ther is potential in your work, beacuse i really envisioned the gaming style of KR as a good a idea for an RPG.			"

								For a game that is in early access it is a pretty beast game,You are looking at some pretty awesome sword play mechanics, interesting customisation choices, entertain spells 'n' secondary weapons and to top it all off UE3 still makes for some lovely visuals.My only nitpick is that you don't want to play this game if you have a choppy connection or share your connection with house mates as the combat is not forgiving and nothing will save you from a close shave when your mates decide that its time to play some world of warcraft.

								I completely love what this game could potentionally be and that's what inspires me to keep on playing. Many would disagree with me that this game is an instant buy, however i beg to differ. This game  not only has a unique feel to it but an inspiring one at that. The mechanics are recognisable, and you can see the path it is going down, but then suddendly your whisked off your feet and pushed into the unknown where magic, gore and brutality awaits. The customisation of the character (will be) perfect once the HUB is stable and to the brim with different armour.The spells are standard but balanced and the maps are beautifully original. I would recommend that you purchase this game as it is destined for great things.			"

								A true Gem in the rough.First and foremost, realize this is alpha, you're paying for early access, there are bugs.That being said even now the game is a ton of fun to play. Getting into a small match and enjoying duels between two players is fun enough on its own. But then you get massive matches where everything is pure chaos yet still manages to suck you right in.The controls are not intuitive - but a quick glance at the tutorials will set you right on your way. The combat is rediculously fun and easy to perform once you've grasped the basics. But oh god is it difficult to master.I've only been playing a couple of weeks and I remember my first few matches being something like 2 kills and 20 deaths, but I've been able to see myself grow in skill and I just now got out of a FFA match where I had 40 kills and 8 deaths - more than double the second place player.As if the melee combat wasn't great enough they go and throw in spells - and not a single one of them is lacking - every single spell is useful in a variety of ways and really opens up gameplay. Whether you enjoy sneaking around like a ninja, teleporting around like some multi-dimensional stalker, or blasting your enemy to pieces with a well placed fireball - there's a spell for you.Probably the most fun though is finding new tactics and new ways to counter your opponents. You'll notice pretty quickly a few loadouts that are common amongst players and I take great pleasure in being able to adapt my combat style to most effectively fight them.This game has huge potential and I can't wait to see where it goes.Feel free to friend me or shoot me a message if you want any pointers. Ill see you in game... impaled on the end of my sword that is. ;-)			"

								This game is a very unique and cool.  At the moment it is still early access so there are still bugs.  That being said, this game is very cool.  I really like the fact that you can customize your knight/character with so much depth.  It is multiplayer only which is cool.  I think singleplayer missions would be nice but it is still a very epic game.  The combat is different from most games, requiring skill rather than just point and click.  If you have a team on here it can be really cool as well.  Definitely a game with a huge amount of potential.			"

								So far i am really enjoying this game, in depth character customization, nice weapon variety hoping more is added later on, and beautiful fantasy battlefields to destroy your opponents on. The combat is alot of fun and somewhat unique with its teleporting and healing, fireballs ect. This game does have its share of glitches and bugs but thats expected from a game thats in Alpha/Beta stage. I see alot of potential in this title reading the plans the developers have in store for this game and playing it for myself. But as we all know everyone has their opinions on good or bad games so try it out for yourself, buying into the game during the development stages will help make this game become the masterpiece it is destined to become.

								Hi everyone this game has made me want to write a review it is my first review and as I have only played for 2 hours this will be to the best of my abilities (as the time is now 3:33am and I have been up for around 26 hours now) and please I accept criticism.Network IssuesI have had no troubles connecting to servers. I have not tried quick joining, I have selected the servers I have wanted to join. Character Customization So far in this game the Character Customization is pretty nice as far as armor and colors can go. You can change the armor on your left and right shoulders and arms independently, to mix and match some pretty menacing looking outfits. There isn’t much to choose from as of yet about 7-10 choices for each part you can customize, those parts being Head, Left shoulder, Right shoulder, Left arm, Right arm, Chest piece, Scarf (Shinobi style is my favorite), Groin, Belt, Legs, and Boots. You can even have different voices. So far as of playing I have yet to see the same two people be exactly the same (unless they were trying for it). The parts that you cannot change about your person yet are if I remember correctly Gender and Hairstyle.WeaponsThe combat in this game reminds me of Chivalry more than War of the roses, in the fact that you do not have to block in left right up down format, you just have to hold the right mouse button at the time the opponents swing would hit you and you will parry them completely. There are 5 swords to choose from so far, Stealth Sword (grants x5 backstab/flank damage) My personal favorite!!, Fire Sword (added ongoing fire damage/ may pierce block) Tank Sword( grants extra blocking time/reduces incoming damage a hair) Bowman’s Sword (extra ranged damage) and Mobility Sword (Gives you sprint speed without having to but away your sword/faster dodge rolls) Second personal favorite. Your choices for secondary weapons are as follows, An Explosive Throwing Axe (one time use 75-100 damage depending on how close the target is to it after it lands charges and explodes) Personal Favorite, A sturdy Bow (depending on the range and where you hit your target 25-100 damage multiple arrows 10 or more), a Mine ( 75-100 damage EXTREME KNOCKBACK, I have been sent flying off of capture points and into the void because of these nasty buggers), and a Trap ( a Gigantic bear trap that does either 25-50 damage and locks you in place for a few seconds, if the hunter is vigilant you are dead as soon as you trigger it)SpellsThe spells are as follows, Fireball (it’s a damage over time spell), Freeze ( Its pretty much a Trap you can use over again), Flame Drop (Execute your Target and everyone around him with this, But be warned cool down time is pretty major and you will hurt/kill friendlies), Teleport ( It’s a Teleport Spell)Choice 1 from me, Heal ( It heals you fully over time) Choice 2 from me, Phase Shift( turns you into a glowing ball that is immune to damage as long as you can hold it, really good for dodging heavy hitting swings from the fire and tank swords), Stealth ( turns you completely invisible, Be careful though your team members will not be able to tell if you are a friendly while invisible). Magic Invulnerability (Immune to all magic damage) For spells you get two choices, Teleport is a must if you want to have any kind of advantage in movement against a mobility sword!! Heal is just awesome, pop it in the middle of a fight and if you can block your opponents attacks you will be at full health in a matter of seconds.CombatHere are a few tips, if you plan on being ranged support with the bow, use the Bowman’s sword with a mine at your feet so you don’t get stealth killed. Spell choices for ranged in my opinion the best two spells are Teleport (to get to higher ground and have a height advantage against everyone on the field) and Freeze (just in case someone starts charging at you with a partner)For you stealthy people, who just love to dash in and out with maximum damage, use the Stealth sword with teleport (required) and freeze/stealth/heal.Anyone who wants to try taking on multiple melee combatants at once I suggest the Tank (hp damage reduction) or Fire sword (Pure raw damage). HEAL IS A MUST, and take fire drop just to run into a group cast it and get a good 4 or 5 kills.Learning CurveIn the beginning, you will die. It will happen. Just learn from your mistakes and have fun.Additional notesThe only three glitches I keep encountering are as follows, the in game scoreboard is glitchy at times with different resolution sizes, my name shows up as the only one typing in chat, and the other is that sometimes when I make a kill it says Player alive killed Dead Player.Much respect to the two man crew that has brought this game to life. A few things I would like to see in the future if at all possible, an Assassinate button for when you are chasing down a target that is Sprinting (sword is on their back) away from you and you have either the Stealth sword OR the Mobility sword, or just an Assassinate button in general. A capture the flag type game mode would be awesome for this game, as would dueling servers. I would like the Spell Freeze to lock people in place so they cannot turn to face me if I hit them in the back with the freeze spell. I would like the Bow and throwing axe to have better crosshairs on the screen rather than having the translucent circle that is the size of my water bottle. The last thing I have an issue with is the teleport spell I would like it to negate fall damage if timed properly, as in someone is running under a tower entrance I want to be able to jump from said tower and a few seconds before hit teleport and land safely on the ground and give chase to them, instead of just going splat on the ground. Those are my wishes :D GREAT JOB SO FAR KEEP IT UP GUYS :DFrom the Humble,Loki The Damned			"

								The game is abandoned and unfinished devs don't even boser answering questions anymore.I thought it would be something like Jedi Outcast Academy II, yet JOA II  has much better combat system and many other fun fichers (even so the game is hella old)At this moment the game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dead  (they could at least turn on bot practise and lvling up vs bots, but nah- why bother) I do not recommend buying it			"

								It is a great game that needs tons of develepment. It crashes randomly due to stupid software issues and now its not finding any servers. While all my friends play happily I cant seem to join or find any servers. This really sucks and since the community so small there is not any help online either. It is another game that devs create and shove it up your ♥♥♥♥ without any support or help.			"

								This game is a very unique and cool.  At the moment it is still early access so there are still bugs.  That being said, this game is very cool.  I really like the fact that you can customize your knight/character with so much depth.  It is multiplayer only which is cool.  I think singleplayer missions would be nice but it is still a very epic game.  The combat is different from most games, requiring skill rather than just point and click.  If you have a team on here it can be really cool as well.  Definitely a game with a huge amount of potential.			"

								First of all, buy this game and give these developers your money. Here's why (for those of you who know how to read). Giving them your money will help this team improve. This game is the best and worst game I have ever played. It plays sort of like Dark Souls series, with combat, they could drastically improve the combat system for more fluid movements and better mobility. The idea of this game is what every hardcore RPG player will want in a game, an online, combat oriented, PVP masterpiece. But that's just the idea. The game has many flaws that will only be fixed by overcoming financial barriers. For those Dark Souls series lovers, remember Dark Souls started as Demon Soul's (which nobody I know personally played before falling in love with Dark Souls other than myself). I strongly suggest this crowd to support this game, and to see where a series like this could go. Pros:-Awesome Character Loadout Screens-The Idea of a PVP combat Oriented Hardcore RPG-The Gameplay is fun even if it's not as good as it could be.-PVP System-It's not even finished yetCons:-It's Not Finished-Slow Updates-Very Slow, Un-Fluid (for lack of a better term) Movements.- Graphics could be smoother in most instances.

								Burned. Where should I start? The game says beta but they need to do themselves a favor and call this early alpha. It's embarrassing to call this beta. I've played pre-alphas that have had better UI, menus, options than this. The Steam footage makes it look better than the graphics produce in real gameplay. Not that the game is ugly.. the graphics are ok. But when looking closely around the maps I see horrible low-poly grass popping out of the ground in all kinds of odd places. The whole interface lacks function and any sort of decent graphic design. There is no explanation to the weapons and spells. Nobody really knows what does what. The tutorials are only on the dev website. The sound controls do not work. The key bindings always have to be reconfigured. Only movement and special are mapped to controller so if you want to map the game with Xpadder you're screwed. Either make the gamepad fully functional or leave it off completely until it is so we can remap the keys. The list goes on. I knew I was reaching when I got this game, but ultimately I was burned. And truth be told, there is a decent game buried inside this dysfunction somewhere. The combat is actually kind of fun. But there is a long way to go until this turd blossoms. I doubt it ever will. If there is quality control on Steam how did they let this game release with a UI like that. Give this one at least another year. If it hasn't come around by then.. it likely never will.			"

								A lot of people keep saying it's dead because the developers ditched it, but it's not true... It's dead because they they released it at a very early and buggy stage AND they did so when the Christmas holiday came around so they had some time off with families and couldn't address the issues in quite a while, however they have not ditched the game and are updating us on the discussion forums on steam and their facebook what they're currently working on and they've already fixed and made a lot of changes since it's release.I would recommend buying the game during steam sales as it is work in progress, however I can assure you the game isn't ""ditched"" and they've shown great promise with screenshots and update logs involving major fixes to bugs, gameplay, and interface. Not only are they fixing things, they're also adding more spells, and recently posted a screenshot of new weapons, not just swords/bows.So stay tuned! The game will certainly recieve new life once the quirks are out and would certainly serve as a great pvp experience.			"

								When i saw this game for the first time I fell in love instantly. It was a like all that kind of games of multiplayer shooters but instead of using guns, using swords. That was something compleatly new for me, and I have never liked shotters because I prefer swords (hell yeah), so I had directly infront of me the perfect game. That would have been a really good time if the game was finished when i bought it. But I dint mind, i just played and looked for things that could be improved, and im glad to say that most of the things that i thought have been used. Anyway, not everything is good, the description exagerates every aspect of the game, it is full of bugs, as the game is a beta there is not too much people playing it at once or maybe no one is playing (that produces that all the people that is playing is playing the same game and maybe the servers has too much lag for you), the ""noobs"" and the ""pros"" play the same match, etc, etc, etc. But as I said this is beta enviroment, it has a lot of things to improved and I encourage them to keep going like this. It is incredible the way they have work this. Date: 4/11/2014			"

								First things first: if you are wondering should you buy this game or not, don't buy it (right now).But if you like sword fighting multiplayer games, keep an eye on this game.All this is because of one reason. The game is basically abandoned by players most of the time. But at the same point, developers are making updates on a regular basis. Plus the game itself has a really nice gameplay. Easy to understand but also with some depth (well, at least for an early access game). You have spells, you have several swords, each with its own bonuses, you even have some ranged weapons, plus acrobatics. Also the graphics and animations are really nice. Yes, there are quite a few bugs, but it's early access, right?But all this niceness doesn't matter when you don't have players in the game.So, as I already said, keep an eye on this game.And if at some point the Kingdom will Rise, buy this game.

								Don't bother spending money on this game that may never get finished. Oh the devs may say its complete but it will never live up to what it is supposed to be, the combat (which is the entire game) is clunky and slow. The trailers are very decieving and the actual in-game action is nothing like what you see. Huge amounts of bugs and the devs take months to push updates, they are more concerned with playing DOTA2 than fixing this mess. Fix the bugs and polish this and it may have a chance, but right now it seems like the devs are just going through the motions and pushing for a quick release to claim that they have a full game here.

								I thoroughly enjoy this game which has a fantastic pvp design aesthetic and useful and fun abilities.  There is a learning curve with melee attacking and blocking but I enjoy that it isn't a dumbed down button mash like most games these days.  The gameplay behind this indie title is very gratifying once you get the hang of it.  It just needs more polish and customization of character/weapons.  Definitely a gem in the rough.  I really hope this game goes somewhere.			"

								The game is still in it's alpha stage, but from what I've seen so far it has the potential to be great. It has a Dark Souls feel to it when it comes to the combat: slower paced movement, powerful satisfying strikes. The magic involved is also well done. Easy hotkeys to use, and despite the somewhat limited spell/sword choices, you're able to come up with the build that is perfect for you. You can play stealthy, aggresively, as a tank, or a ranger, your choice! The armor is wicked customizeable and has no movement penalities, you can make your character look like anything you want. I can't wait to see the game continue to develop, it's worth a buy.			"

Early Access Review
								When I got this, I was actually hoping for Jedi Knight 2-esque sword-centric gameplay mechanics. I was actually quite surprised in that the swordplay is coming from a completely different approach. My first couple matches were more akin to an old-school Unreal Tournament match than actual dueling or sword-play. It almost seems to me that perhaps if the characters' speed was somewhat less, and jumping wasn't so exaggerated (you also even see a lot of--again--old-school ""bunny hopping""), then the players would have to be more methodical and deliberate in how they wield the swords. Also, especially after my first match, it struck me that while learning the wielding mechanics must surely give you an advantage, it seems that in most circumstances simply just button-mashing and swinging the sword in random directions does the job just fine. Point in fact, that's mostly what I witnessed, generally speaking. Of course, one could argue that the above is simply a matter of taste (and also consider my previous leanings toward JK2) and that many people enjoy the fast-paced combat. Thus, now that my main grievances have been mentioned, I feel that it must be said that for a dev-team of only two people the game as it stands is quite an impressive achievement. The graphics are actually quite pretty (although the bloom/HDR effect might be too glaring in some places), and while the maps are small, they're designed well enough to serve as makeshift funnels for the players in such a way that you--again like in UT--can't go but a few seconds without needing to charge in or defend yourself. Here again though, I do feel the need to point out that I found the 360 degree sword system description quite misleading, since that doesn't actually seem to be the case in practice. That would almost imply mouse-controlled sword movement. I personally found it, with all the button-mashing and jumping around, quite difficult to actually defend myself with my own weapon. It's more effective (and non-lethal for your character) to simply roll away and swing random blows at your opponent. So for future players and purchasers, I do believe that should be clarified more on the product page. But I digress, I should mention that there is partially complete character customization that defintely shows a lot of potential to be very attractive especially if the devs follow through with their planned content updates. I honestly believe that this game can turn into a true gem if some combat and gameplay balancing issues are addressed to actually make it worthwhile on how to learn how to use the sword (which seemed to me to be a major selling point/factor?) skillfully and if the devs follow through within a relatively timely manner on content. Even if it's just small, consistent patches. And for those who might be wondering, yes I did watch the training videos. Some of them several times. But I do have to also say that there seems to be a precedent for some Indie and/or Early Access games to die out, especially in MP, when the aforementioned updates do not occur or are very delayed. I really don't want to see this game kick the bucket before its prime, and it has loads of potential. And also, despite all my groaning, there are enough tense or exciting/fun moments to make the game worth picking up and playing occasionally for some gamers. So I'd say it's worth a buy for some, bearing what I've written in mind of course. To the devs: it's all just constructive criticism, keep up the good work. You've got a very solid foundation for an excellent indie title. It's few and far between that you get to see an indie title with such high graphical fidelity or unique gameplay. Maybe introduce a gameplay mode that enhances and encourages dueling and duelists? Hey, it worked for JK2! :D*Edit:As I'm looking at some of the other positive reviews, I noticed that quite a few people mentioned the game Chivalry in comparison to this game. Incidentally, I had actually written that into my first part of my review above, but took it out because I thought it was long enough already. Well now I'm going to make it longer, so if anyone is reading this, bear with me. And if not, well it never hurts to brush up my writing skills I guess lol. But I also own Chivalry also, essentially hoping for some meaningful, in-depth combat again. While some people might look at how many hours I've played of this game or that game, I don't really need to sink countless hours of my life into something to be able to speak with experience. I think most people that are reading these reviews are gamers and have been gamers and know what I'm talking about. Essentially I came away pretty disappointed. Sure, there is a comparatively sophisticated (speaking of Chivalry [hang in there, I'm going somewhere with this]) directionally-based combat system, and the classes do add some measure of tactical depth, but basically button-mashing can all too easily triumph over the attempted practiced, methodical approach. In effect, what I'm pointing out for KR is that although the sword system is touted as a major selling point of this game, and even showcased in the trailer, the gameplay mechanics nor the realities of the game as it is does not encourage, let alone reward, the player for learning how to wield the sword effectively. I didn't really get from the trailer or the product page that it was seeking to achieve the same flavor and, well, chaos that occurs in Chivalry. Last thing I wanted to mention is that from a practical/realistic/historical point of view, that kind of...flailing could only be useful in a very specific, and limited manner. When soldiers marched against each other, effective militaries of the day would obviously be in some kind of formation (rank and file, phalanx, testudo, etc.) and would therefore be pressed together on both sides. Once the opposing forces eventually charged each other's lines the men in the front would only have that claustrophobia increased. Again, historically speaking, the effect of that being the men in the very front couldn't move, use their weapon, or manuever. The men in the ranks behind them (mostly) couldn't hit the enemy at all. Thus, the prevailing tactic of the day was for the front ranks to plant their shields and intentionally be pushed by their companions behind them. Naturally that doesn't make for a fun game. But once the combatants began to have some ""elbow room"" so to speak, perhaps that flailing could possibly have been effective for that very narrow stretch of time. But once the combatants had spread out further, for various reasons, it's obvious and only logical that the men would bring whatever methods, training, and skill to bear if only because it was essentially a matter of survival. Chivalry (just like my comparison above) is very much alike to KR and UT in that despite the relative ""thinness"" or rather absence of any organization/structure/formation, method, practice, and skill do not guarantee a correspondingly effective kill ratio. In fact, I would go as far as to say that as the game is, speaking in a broad/general analyses, that it is more effective to utilize rolling, bunny hopping, and trying to circle around your opponent while simply striking with your weapon. As in, ignoring the blocking, parrying, and intentional sword swings entirely. Of course, for the sake of completeness I should mention that in Chivalry, the characters don't move quite as quickly which makes logical sense. However, what doesn't make sense is thse big, broad-shouldered, armor-laden, giant-sword-wielding--soldiers? Mercenaries? Erm...princes? Can bunny hop to a height as would occur only if fighting on, perhaps, the moon, roll in full armor, like a gymnast, and swing huge weapons like candy canes. Therefore, after all this long-winded analysis, I find that, unlike my first part of this review, I cannot recommend buying this game as it stands, if at all.			"

THE FINAL GAME IS A DIFFERENT MATTER I understand there are also going to be huge bugs in a Beta but the overall mechanics feel unbelievably rigid, slow, and not like a legitimate sword fighter. If you are not into PvP, obviously don't get this game. If you are scared of bugs, don't get this game (yet). I acknowledge that there is a very small team, but at least call it ALPHA NOT BETA			"

								The game is still in it's alpha stage, but from what I've seen so far it has the potential to be great. It has a Dark Souls feel to it when it comes to the combat: slower paced movement, powerful satisfying strikes. The magic involved is also well done. Easy hotkeys to use, and despite the somewhat limited spell/sword choices, you're able to come up with the build that is perfect for you. You can play stealthy, aggresively, as a tank, or a ranger, your choice! The armor is wicked customizeable and has no movement penalities, you can make your character look like anything you want. I can't wait to see the game continue to develop, it's worth a buy.			"

								Don't recommend it, well not yet. Okay, it says early game access, but even for that it has many bugs, and crashes randomly. Poor optimisation and a lot of missing features. But when it will be complete with no bugs, it will be awesome.			"

Early Access Review
								Kingdom's Rise is still in Early Acess, but it has huge potential. Though I haven't done too much with this game recently, it has a great concept, and huge customizability options for a MMO. When playing, it is easy to tell that it is still under development, as the game is a bit buggy, and some things aren't balanced. This game could possibly rival Chivalry or other games of the same concept. I would reccomend this game to anyone who is looking for casual play every once in a while, but isn't looking for massive servers with 20-30 players. At most I think I've had 15 other people in a server, so the community is still small, but don't let that persuade you not to support Kingdom's Rise. If you don't want to get it now (with all the bugs and small community), then consider getting later on sale or after it passes through the Early Acess system. Great job to Flyleap Studios for making a phenominal game with huge potential. Keep the work up!			"

								I realy enjoy this game and its evolving. Its a good melee combat game with powerups.But I can not reccommend it. Becouse it has too much bugs, Some hits don't actualy happen, you can bug out of the maps, Video settings can ♥♥♥♥ up, Sometimes can't connect to servers. Graphical glitches esspecialy on physics based objects like capes.But still can be entertaing. How ever I think dev's should focus on fixing the game rather than adding new stuff to it. Also graphics are a beauty. (Well used Unreal Engine.)			"

								In the really early Alpha, I would say it's a game with great ideas. For players with experience from almost all Multiplayer Sword-Fighting games like me (M&B:Warband, Chivalry, War of the Roses, PVKII, and a lot more) it's a great purchase due it's unique playstyle.For everyone else, due it's Alpha it may be confusing at first try, but it has really good ""Easy to Learn, Difficult to Master rate"", so I recommend this game, but if you don't like clumsy Pre-Releases, I would suggest to wait untill it gets more stable.And one more thing...the graphics in this game are like Steven Spielberg's ""Spotlight Fetishism"". What I mean by that; there are lights EVERYWHERE. Some people like this, some don't, I personally love this kind of lighting.			"

								Just played the game and I have to say that this game is pretty interesting to say the least. I like it so far, but the fact that the team I just played with loved team killing so much since it was a thing, really detracted from the game. But saying that the game is bad from only that is too much. The game has a lot of interesting abilites and amazing looking weapons and armor. The customization is going to be plentiful from what I can tell. Gameplay is solid enough where you wont want to throw everything in your room that is within arms reach. The moves look strong, every blow you give looks powerful but the animations look a bit robotic and too smooth for the human body, especially when running. But those are little quips when looking at the big picture.The world looks beautiful; the lighting and the scenery. This game looks great for something that is early access and you can tell that they put a lot of time and effort into making it look that way too, without skimping out on the actual gameplay mechanics. So far I only managed to play in the forest, snow castle and uh... mini acropolis? or a hill with a light shining from the middle looking map. Look I forgot to look at the map names ok? (￣▽￣) They look great is what I am saying. This game is definitely worth the money it is asking for in my opinion, and the game can only get better later down the road.I noticed some things and if they could work on things like:Having our cooldowns on abilities reset after respawning.Being able to run and swing or at least lunge instead of sheathing your weapon and then taking the time to pull it out again.Have something that demotes team killing.This may be just me, but I feel that the controls aren't as responsive as my hands can move.Pressing escape while in game kind of jerks around and spazzes for me. It looked like it was switching from the main title menu to the In-game menu.The customization menu also had a few quirks:Having no zooming capabilities (that I know of, all I tried was the mouse wheel) to see my characters face.The slider for the Hues and Tones also turn the camera.The lighting is too bright for me to get a clear picture of the helmet. Not sure if that is just me.I didnt really see my character's hair color change. Neither did I see the eyes change for that matter.You have to wait a bit when selecting the voices unless you want your eardrums to be barraged by a chorus of yells. (It was pretty cool imaging an entire army charging when you do that though, just turn the volume down a bit)I'm really excited for the finished piece of this game and then all of the other finishing touches and polish that they are going to put on it eventually... Hopefully. If the game looks this good and is only in the Early stages and is only developed by two guys. Just saying, I'm impressed.			"

You can hit and parry in a 360° angle, move your mouse in any direction whilst hitting or parrying and that will be your hit or parry, but even better than that, two opposite sword strikes will also collide... beautiful absolutely beautiful!

								Before I start, I recommend this game only if it becomes f2p or if the community fixes and more people start to play.  Well....I have to say, I had alot of fun playing it when it first came out.  Sadly, like most people have already stated, the development has dwindled to say the least.  There is currently only one server (that I can see at least) and nobody is ever on it.  The one thing I wanted to add that is different than the other comments is that I remember reading something from the developers that said ""if it comes down to it we will make it f2p"".  Which honestly I wouldnt even care that I wasted $15 on it if it became free because it is a great game.  If anyone wants to play 1v1 or get some other people on then add me, I won't play all the time just because I play alot of other games but I'll definantly play sometime.			"

								This is the last time I spend money to get into a beta.  This game should easily be considered alpha.  It seems really cool but I can barely even play it due to unremitting lag issues and skewed visuals of menus.  Things don't load properly, textures are undefined.  I've played many an alpha, many a beta, many an indie, and many a AAA title, and this game should be marketed as alpha.I'm very unhappy that I spent my hard earned dollars on something so shoddy.  I will happily return to this game when the kinks are worked out.  I understand that Beta is Beta, but this isn't Beta, it's a mis-marketed payed alpha.As I said though, once the game has it's technical problems worked out, it should be fun, and I look forward to playing a finished, or even refined version of the game, however, if you're considering spending the 15 bucks for early access, I recommend waiting for release.

								Kingdoms Rise is very, VERY, VERY buggy, and if you don't want a clean game experience, do not buy this game until it moves further into development stages. Menus are transparent and as bright as the background, so maneuvering is difficult. Graphics are unchangeable even though they give you options. Your resolution resets every time you try to change an option. The swordplay is clunky and they give you no indication of what anything is. Aiming is difficult as you have no crosshairs.  I love the concept- this game will be great when it is finished, but for now, it's worthless. Hope this helps you decide on wether or not you want to spend your money!			"

								Ugh. I thought this was going to be different, but it's just a hack and slash arena combat game. Almost no tactical purpose, very little teamwork involved, and pretty poor on the graphics side of the house. I was NOT impressed and feel like I wasted $15. I highly DO NOT recommend this game.

								I acknowledge that the game is in ""early access"" but this game is no where even close to what I would call the beta stages.Not even counting combat, the menues are buggy and incomplete. When clicking one button, it would take me to another. I was confused when I clicked the cog which I assumed would be options took me to the server browser. Clicking it again later then brought me to the options menu. The tutorials aren't even in the game. Instead of an interactive tutorial to get you used to the engine, it simply tells you to follow a link to their website so now I'm watching instead of playing when I was excited to get my hands on a blade and start wrecking face even on a practice dummy, but no. I'm told to quit out of the game and not interact with it.There are several easily accessible areas that the players were clearly not meant to be, some of which do so decievingly. To test and see how well the jumping worked, I tried jumping along some rocks and shapes juttiung out from the waterfall. Very blockily and slowly but surely, I made it to the top to where there was nothing and I fell out of the map. That's understandable, perhaps I found something the devs had overlooked. There is another area in the same level with fallen stone pillars. Simply running up them brings you to the wall of the arena where there is nothing. The level just stops and that's it. You fall out and you're dead.The movement is anything but smooth, the graphics are decent but often clip and clash with each other, and all around the game is just a mess. I understand it's an early access game but it's so early it shouldn't have even been put out yet. As of posting this, it's in Beta 2.0. Does beta not mean they're just about complete, they just need people to test it out to iron out creases? I would call this an early alpha as it has a long way to go and as I'm leaving this game to sit on my digital shelf, it's got all day to get there. I'm guessing that a majority of people agree with me as well seeing as I was unable to even test combat as all of the servers were empty, much less one with a decent ping. By the time this game is far enough along to actually be a half decent release, I'll have already moved on to something else. The devs should have waited much longer before even attempting to sell the game. If it was further along in development before I got my hands on it, people may have enjoyed it for a while, enjoyed it and continued playing.			"

								Game feels really clunky and somewhat unresponsive. The UI was decent but was broken in multiple places after the May 2014 patch and started to frustrate me. Blade Symphony does what Kingdom Rise is trying to do but is a lot more fluid and has a lot more depth. The game also does not receive as many updates as an early access game should.(The last updates were around 5 months apart) I'll probably come back to it once the game is a bit more polished and see if anythings changed. Of course this game is still in early access, but i do wish to give some of my perspective on the current state of the game.			"

								When I first saw Kingdoms Rise on Steam Greenlight, I was excited for it. Who wouldn't be? The trailer and screenshots showcased a fast-paced multiplayer fantasy action game. So when I saw the game appear on sale as early access, I bought it straight away and got ready for some sword-fighting action. All I have gotten so far it disappointment and frustration. The controls are awkward and unresponsive, the classes all seem to be exactly the same, several of the specials are usless (for example, there is no way to aim the throwing axes/knives), and the game itself is laggy to the point of being unplayable. I'm aware that this game is still in early access, but it would be nice if I could actually have fun with it. It is supposed to be a game, after all.I wanted to like Kingdoms Rise, I really did, but it is simply an unenjoyable experience. If you really are keen to try out this game, I would recommend waiting until it's out of early access or just avoid buying it altogether. After all, why spend fifteen USD for something this broken?

								Yay! If you like(d) the PvP in DarkSouls you will love this! Well it's even the harder mode of DS. You have to block by doing the oppsite of your enemy, or roll away or teleport away...Everyone can join the battle with different weapons and spells which is pretty cool and ofc costumize their hero.The maps are pretty cool and seem to be balanced, but in the point capture mode it would be good if you dont loose the point within a second and get an overview where they are..Most of the ppl who dont recommend this game played less then 1 hour... It is simply impossible to know how it works and how to win fights in this time. I must admit I started it two times before I got used to the battle system. But now I finish first or second most of the games I play (after that one hour of playtime).Its a bit confusing infight (camera blur etc.) and the teleport could be more userfriently but hey, its currently an alpha and costs only 14€...I can truly remmend this :)			"

								I cannot recommend this game.It's a 3rd person fighting game like Chivalry, if you know what that is. It uses fighting in the sense that you have to choose a direction in which you want to attack, like overhead, underhand, left, or right. Well it's too damn slow to have a decent battle, so it's a never ending battle of ""Who will screw up first.""The character customisation is also screwed up still, and the ONLY thing they've added since I paid 15 bucks for this back when it released, was the female gender to play as.This game still has SO much work to be done on it, and i'm afraid they're too far in to fix it now.

								Pretty awful so far. The equipment system is atrociously lacklustre, with every item coated in clipping errors, a nonsensical colour swapper and an interface that doesn't work. The fighting system flat out doesn't work, with 99% of hits not registering and a zany lack of control that is a huge step backwards from games like Mount & Blade and War of the Roses. The magic seems to work, but I didn't push on to try all of the magical abilities, the rest of the game being so disgusting.I write this in early beta, so some of the problems are to be expected. I'm not tempted to play it again until much later in development. I'll change this review when I do, hopefully not just to remove the beta disclaimer.			"

								This game is actually fantastic and I'd recommend it, but not yet. But I do think you should ignore the negetive reviews because the reason there has not been any updates with the game is because the developer is porting the game to a new game engine so it can be played on pc and console. So I beleive in the next few months there should be constant updates being released being said there is already a beta for owners of the game to play the updated version. So, please do buy this game, just not yet.			"

								So i tested a bit this game and i must say its not worth that money. Its looked not bad in trailers, but its illusion.Something like this should be free.We have already two good games like Chivarly and War of the Vikings (in my opinion the WotV is just superrior )This game have nothing with witch can beat these games.Horrible models, textures. It was definitely not made ​​with love to deteils. Sticking out in all directions textures.Brrrr. Very Buggy.Also fight system in Wotv is better. This game have just  one feature  what the others do not have. Spell/magic.... Also if you come from EU good luck with finding a appropriate players. Servers are empty.So save you money and look for the others two alternatives.			"

								Just a warning, that as of 12/7/2013 This game is nearly unplayable. It has alot of potential, but is 95% annoying, 5% fun. I saw the video for it, thought it looks great, but the videos for the game are extremely misleading. -The controls are completely wonky, and unresponsive.- No way to cancel an attack, causing you to many times hit teammates on accident who move in front of you, and often times killing them. - Very screwy movement for the characters, hard to control, no fluidity what so ever. - EXTREMELY SMALL maps, and this is absolutely no exageration. The screenshots and videos of the levels are 3/4ths of that entire map or level. No joke. -Due to the EXTREMELY small sized maps, often leads to 1 team dominating the other, and spawn camping the other team the rest of the game, resulting in a very frustrating, and un enjoyable experience.-Nothing in the way of letting you know the differnce between weapons, etc. - Very bad UI, that is both confusing, and misleading. - Absolutely nothing letting you know whats going on, such as if enemies are taking a control point, etc, or if the other team is controlling it or not, again, with the stupid small maps, it's not the biggest issue, but again, causes alot of confusion in games. -Very confusing main menu. -Cosmetically the UI layout, in-game layout, and main menu is very un appealing and or confusing. Of course, again, a small thing, but it's just one very small of many things to pull it all together to turn someone off. Like I said, the game has ALOT of potential, because of what they are trying to bring to the table, but it has quite a very long time to ever get to that point for what the stage is at. Consider yourself buying a Pre Alpha version of a game. Where the levels are made, the base simple mechanics are there, but nothing else is remotely close to being finished.  "

								I had a lot of fun playing this game back when it was released. There were a lot of players and it was just something different. Felt kind of like a mount & Blade without campaign and horses, but with magic and more weapons you could choose from.The game is all about pvp and has no actual single player, except for the ""training mode"", which i think doesnt count.Back when it had a lot of players it was pretty fun. It was, at least for me, easy to pick up but pretty hard to master. There were combos in the game but you would never find out about them because the game doesnt show you them. You would need to watch them in the internet which i found was pretty stupid.The character creation was and still is pretty good. You had a lot of options to create your own custom character and change the name every now and then if you get bored of it.Sadly this doesnt help in making the game good.When the game came out it had a dedicated player base and i was able to always find a few rooms with lots of players in it (up to 12 players on one server if i remember right, but im not sure).The lack of updates for this game resulted in players getting bored and slowly decreasing the playerbase. Barely any update for increasing the gameplay of the game was released. Just felt like the developers didnt care at all.They had to choose between making an actual good game by investing the earned money in it or just misuse the early access on steam to cash grab the players like in DayZ.Worst of all is that they are making a sequel and will most likely never finish this game. I paid 15€ for it on release.They should be ashamed to create a sequel and never make a game again for being so untrustworthy.0/5			"

								Its slow paced combat that requires quick motions with the mouse and well excuted parries to win a fight.You can also customize your char looks, color, and voice.This is a game I'm glad I own a PC for, and I'd still want another person to join in on the fun.[EDIT] That was years ago.  And while my initial feelings still hold true.  The Dev's screwed this game up by implementing level skill-unlock features. Those take quite awhile to get with no playerbase to get it from.  Meaning all the abilities that you use to have from the start, they put behind an XP wall.  Bad move.  Not very smart at all if they actually thought that would help this game.Its a shame, Kingdom Rise was in a class of its own when it came to this game's kind of skill-based combat.I recommend you get For Honor, or wait for Absolver.

Environment is crisp and perfect, sounds are well made and interactive. I was so exicted I jumped straight into a game thinking it'll be just a smash and hack but was I wrong. I would HIGHLY recommend looking at the tutorial (which were not avalible in game at this time) but can be found on the website. Parrying and dodging took some getting used to and I found if my ping was abit high I was dying. Mayeb there should be a practice bot you can learn the basics off? I learn because I bought my mates the 4 pack and we just jumped on a server and learnt with each other, but I doubt everyone can do that. Also not sure what the different swords do? but get this game even if to just mess around with for a few hours, well worth the money. Great work to all involved in the game			"

								I bought this game when it just came on steam. I played a good amount but I left because there was noone playing it. The game had teams of four (Probably more but I don't know because there was noone playing it). If it was F2P with buyables, like TF2, this game would take off and prosper, people would scramble to get on servers to play it. It is by far one of the most fun games I have played, but because you run into the same 5 people all the time, it becomes unfun, especially if one of the people have 100+ hours on it and play it all the time. I honestly wish that this game was alive still because I would be playing/would have played it more. Just because the servers are dead doesnt mean that it always will be. there might be more than 3 people on at once, then hop on in and enjoy a fun small game.If this review is read by someone in the masses of steam/a developer, I really think that there should be a secondary game mode where its sort of like a MOBA, where you are the commander of your own little troop of weak NPC's that arent too weak and can take a hit. No towers, just protect the king, 1v1 2v2, 3v3, make it competitive. Also a 1v1 option, like an arena where people can enter and rank up would be cool too. And tornaments to support more people coming onto this game. Pull a CS:GO and create skins for new weapons that are rare, common and somewhat rare. It would attract the people who want to play the game for money. Drop the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons and as more people buy into the game, release the more expensive ones in a tornament format. 1v1 tornament, 2v2 tornament, and 3v3 tornament.

								This game was a lot of fun and the mechanics are really cool(wish blocking made more sense to me) sadly, atleast whenever I got on no one else was playing. Also there are almost no graphics options for people with lower quality computers such as myself.  If you made those options available I might be tempted to come back to it before getting a new computer but untill then I wish you the best of luck with increasing your player base.

								Seeing this game in library hurts, it had so much potential to be something great. Then a few questionable updates came, namely an XP unlock system. I'm fine with it in early access, to test feedback on it and see if the rate needs any tweaking, but the game has, for all intents and purposes, a dead playerbase, so you really can't progress to unlock better spells and swords.I bought into it early, before the XP progression, and I really really liked what it had to offer. The combat was decent enough for the state the game was in, if a bit confusing and frustrating at times, but that was part of the fun, learning how to do combos and then do them faster and faster. And then, everyone I was having fun with in the game started to disappear, now there's only about 5 people if you're lucky.			"

Early Access Review
								One of the most important foundations for a purely pvp-focused game to have is a solid set of gameplay mechanics. And Kingdoms Rise more than delivers on this front. It has a well-executed, smooth and deep melee combat system where every single factor comes into play when fighting your foe, from basic things like movement and mouse control - sidestepping attacks, aiming your own swing well and knowing your sword's reach, dodging and rolling - to the advanced features of the combat system, including directional parrying, counterattacking (""locking""), and juking parries with feints.The system truly allows for a master swordsman to outshine his opponents (up until the moment an adversary sneaks up on him unawares and cleaves him from behind, at least!), and the satisfaction of improving and seeing the results of your own improvement in-game is a huge part of what makes the game fun. And oh yes, don't forget the kills. Bloody, brutal and extremely satisfying. The game has an awesome, fluid set of animations even at such an early stage of development.Then there are the ranged weapons and spells. I have a few minor gripes about them (I personally hate how stealth is spammable, even mid combat, and I also feel that plane shift is too strong) but overall, it's remarkable how well balanced abilities and secondary weapons are for a game so early in development. For the most part they bring even more depth (and fun!) to the game, without overriding the main flavour of the game, which is pure melee combat. I feel that teleport and heal  bring the most to the table in this regard, especially heal as it prevents ""graveyard zerging"" of a player who's already been engaged in heavy melee combat, but emerged victorious (albeit not unscathed). Out of the box, this pre-alpha appears to be really buggy - lots of unimplemented things, settings not getting saved, missing menu items, and so on. Don't be put off - everything that *needs* to be working for you to jump straight into a game, is working. I'm actually happy that the menu looks like crap, the menu sounds are annoying and loud and everything looks like crap - because the real soul of the game is there. And gosh darnit, it's not even pre-alpha yet!			"

								FIRST IMPRESSIONS:An extremely fun game, even though it is still in development. The directional-based sword fighting feels both weighty and satisfying, and though it lacks a little in fluidity you soon forget this as your blade cuts through your enemies. Combat consists of directional-based attacks and parries depending on the movement of your mouse, but also allows for advanced combat tactics such as rolling, jump-attacks, locking, feinting (cancelling) and counter-strikes. It also has a decent array of spells that can change the course of battle; including invisibility, fireballs, bear-traps, teleportation and mines, with more to come in the future. Graphically, the game is quite impressive. It looks fabulous and the maps are not only varied, but each equally fun to play; there's no one map that gives me the reaction ""ugh, I hate this one."" It also has a large amount of content for character customization, including specific armour or clothing pieces for specific areas of the body allowing you to carve out your own, unique champion. Often, I've recognized players not by the name above their heads, but by what they look like. Bear in mind it is still in development, so you will have to forgive the occasional graphical bug (such as swords not appearing in the hands of a swinger) that while annoying, didn't particularly subtract from the overall enjoyment I had. Though I only played for a few hours, I had a blast of a time and would highly recommend this game to anyone interested in fantasy sword combat.This game has great potential that it has already begun to realize and I cannot wait to see how they expand upon it in the coming months. I'd love to see some sort of progression system, new weapons with varied statistics and the ability to create clans/guilds with fellow players and battle it out in epic guild wars. I also hope they add larger maps with the possibility of larger player counts; 20 on 20 battles would be extremely glorious!			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game when it just came on steam. I played a good amount but I left because there was noone playing it. The game had teams of four (Probably more but I don't know because there was noone playing it). If it was F2P with buyables, like TF2, this game would take off and prosper, people would scramble to get on servers to play it. It is by far one of the most fun games I have played, but because you run into the same 5 people all the time, it becomes unfun, especially if one of the people have 100+ hours on it and play it all the time. I honestly wish that this game was alive still because I would be playing/would have played it more. Just because the servers are dead doesnt mean that it always will be. there might be more than 3 people on at once, then hop on in and enjoy a fun small game.If this review is read by someone in the masses of steam/a developer, I really think that there should be a secondary game mode where its sort of like a MOBA, where you are the commander of your own little troop of weak NPC's that arent too weak and can take a hit. No towers, just protect the king, 1v1 2v2, 3v3, make it competitive. Also a 1v1 option, like an arena where people can enter and rank up would be cool too. And tornaments to support more people coming onto this game. Pull a CS:GO and create skins for new weapons that are rare, common and somewhat rare. It would attract the people who want to play the game for money. Drop the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons and as more people buy into the game, release the more expensive ones in a tornament format. 1v1 tornament, 2v2 tornament, and 3v3 tornament. Would make this game ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING. But inorder for this to happen, it would have to be paid for and the skins should not be able to be sold until the game gets more publicity.

								The trailer was the thing that made me grab this game. It looks amazing and vibrant. As soon as I got into game it looked excatly like the trailers and that is grand. Environment is crisp and perfect, sounds are well made and interactive. I was so exicted I jumped straight into a game thinking it'll be just a smash and hack but was I wrong. I would HIGHLY recommend looking at the tutorial (which were not avalible in game at this time) but can be found on the website. Parrying and dodging took some getting used to and I found if my ping was abit high I was dying. Mayeb there should be a practice bot you can learn the basics off? I learn because I bought my mates the 4 pack and we just jumped on a server and learnt with each other, but I doubt everyone can do that. Also not sure what the different swords do? but get this game even if to just mess around with for a few hours, well worth the money. Great work to all involved in the game			"

								WORST purchase of the holiday season build is labeled as beta 2.0 but i think its barly in alpha, this game is so terrible half of the controls dont even work and trying to change them just leaves theas undefiened and even if you do manage to change something hitting apply doesnt do anything because the next game you join its all back to defaults. the customization is ok...if you dont mind half of those not doing anything either, even for 33% off this game is not worth the buy giving it away for free is even charging too much if this game got my rating id give it -1/5.

								The trailer was the thing that made me grab this game. It looks amazing and vibrant. As soon as I got into game it looked excatly like the trailers and that is grand. Environment is crisp and perfect, sounds are well made and interactive. I was so exicted I jumped straight into a game thinking it'll be just a smash and hack but was I wrong. I would HIGHLY recommend looking at the tutorial (which were not avalible in game at this time) but can be found on the website. Parrying and dodging took some getting used to and I found if my ping was abit high I was dying. Mayeb there should be a practice bot you can learn the basics off? I learn because I bought my mates the 4 pack and we just jumped on a server and learnt with each other, but I doubt everyone can do that. Also not sure what the different swords do? but get this game even if to just mess around with for a few hours, well worth the money. Great work to all involved in the game			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game when it just came on steam. I played a good amount but I left because there was noone playing it. The game had teams of four (Probably more but I don't know because there was noone playing it). If it was F2P with buyables, like TF2, this game would take off and prosper, people would scramble to get on servers to play it. It is by far one of the most fun games I have played, but because you run into the same 5 people all the time, it becomes unfun, especially if one of the people have 100+ hours on it and play it all the time. I honestly wish that this game was alive still because I would be playing/would have played it more. Just because the servers are dead doesnt mean that it always will be. there might be more than 3 people on at once, then hop on in and enjoy a fun small game.If this review is read by someone in the masses of steam/a developer, I really think that there should be a secondary game mode where its sort of like a MOBA, where you are the commander of your own little troop of weak NPC's that arent too weak and can take a hit. No towers, just protect the king, 1v1 2v2, 3v3, make it competitive. Also a 1v1 option, like an arena where people can enter and rank up would be cool too. And tornaments to support more people coming onto this game. Pull a CS:GO and create skins for new weapons that are rare, common and somewhat rare. It would attract the people who want to play the game for money. Drop the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons and as more people buy into the game, release the more expensive ones in a tornament format. 1v1 tornament, 2v2 tornament, and 3v3 tornament. Would make this game ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING. But inorder for this to happen, it would have to be paid for and the skins should not be able to be sold until the game gets more publicity. I really want to see this game succeed, Good luck.			"

The game suddenly started being updated really slowly, all the players are gone because a single patch that ruined the whole game, it has been fixed, but the UI has not been updated and only a couple of swords and spells added. No new maps, no nothing other than simple bug fixing. Its a good game, just slow developing and should have never been early released as soon as it was.You can just wait for the final product, which will be great if they just do what they said they were going to.

Not only that but this game has bad graphics and horrendously slow gameplay.    You shouldn't balance combat by nerfing everything and making all the players slow and dumb.

								I love this game. It may be unfinished, but it's well polished. I like how the controls are similar to mount & blade and forces you to block in the same direction as the oncoming attack. It's tricky, though. I found it better to invert the mouse controls. The fluidity of combat is nice overall, I'd say. The graphics though, OH THE GRAPHICS are sweet for what frames I get for them. Compliments to the devs for loading it on the unreal 3 engine. Solid move. There needs to be a single player mode, though. I swear I have an urge to fight a huge boss or take on a really hard dungeon with flippy, bust'em-up & brutal ninja-knight combat. Oh dear god, what if there was a first person mode for the occulus rift? I would literally pinch myself until I get an aneurysm in my arm. And to those of you with a tight wallet and cash to spend... there are people out there that pay $15 a month to use swords and spells instead of paying that only once and having the warm fuzzy feeling of supporting an indie game company. I'm just sayin' to have an open mind is all.			"

								I bought this game not long after it was released on steam with expectations of this being a promising game, but after about 20 minutes of game play I became disappointed and bored rather quickly. Note, yes I know this is an early access game, but after only ONE update in over a year (that I have seen) it has stayed this way. I have tried this game two or three times since I purchased it, and beside a few minor tweeks being changed the game is still the same in my opinion. Also, it seems this game has very few people actually playing it and that makes it kinda hard to stay interested in. I believe if the developers actaully had continued to work towards fixing and updating the game, it could be very promising. But as of right now, it is NOT worth the price, it would be better as a Free To Play.			"

								FIRST IMPRESSIONS:An extremely fun game, even though it is still in development. The directional-based sword fighting feels both weighty and satisfying, and though it lacks a little in fluidity you soon forget this as your blade cuts through your enemies. Combat consists of directional-based attacks and parries depending on the movement of your mouse, but also allows for advanced combat tactics such as rolling, jump-attacks, locking, feinting (cancelling) and counter-strikes. It also has a decent array of spells that can change the course of battle; including invisibility, fireballs, bear-traps, teleportation and mines, with more to come in the future. Graphically, the game is quite impressive. It looks fabulous and the maps are not only varied, but each equally fun to play; there's no one map that gives me the reaction ""ugh, I hate this one."" It also has a large amount of content for character customization, including specific armour or clothing pieces for specific areas of the body allowing you to carve out your own, unique champion. Often, I've recognized players not by the name above their heads, but by what they look like. Bear in mind it is still in development, so you will have to forgive the occasional graphical bug (such as swords not appearing in the hands of a swinger) that while annoying, didn't particularly subtract from the overall enjoyment I had. Though I only played for a few hours, I had a blast of a time and would highly recommend this game to anyone interested in fantasy sword combat.This game has great potential that it has already begun to realize and I cannot wait to see how they expand upon it in the coming months. I'd love to see some sort of progression system, new weapons with varied statistics and the ability to create clans/guilds with fellow players and battle it out in epic guild wars. I also hope they add larger maps with the possibility of larger player counts; 20 on 20 battles would be extremely glorious!			"

That being said, the scenery is beautiful, and the skills+swordplay coordination is interesting to learn. I believe that the game has a lot of potential once it has had time to be developed. One thing I think would be nice is slightly faster attack speed. Other than that, keep an eye out for this game once it is further along.			"

								   I want to like it, I really do, but I've got a few gripes with it: the swordfighting is oddly rythmned for a game based on it, any spell other than a few of them are vastly underpowered, thus giving everyone similiar abilities which makes it rather boring to watch; the bow is useless with no reticule, the arrow falls like soggy bread, the customization of characters is good and rather visually appealing, but no customizable swords kills that for me. The combat isn't terrible but it's not great, nothing really separates it from other games to be honest. The concept is good, if they polish it a bit more then it'd be great.

I was hooked from the start, and look forward to see what this game continues to bring to the table.  If this is your first game with this type of combat, I suggest checking out the tutorials that they have made to help new players; they are very well done.

								First impressions you want?""What the hell is this.""Then you try to customise your character and then you're like ""It doesn't even work properly.""You choose your first combination of swords, special actions and magic and then you're like ""Oh this is so underpowered.""Then you have your first fight. ""Omg the fighting system is so un-deep.""But the time passes, you start to enjoy the action, when everything flies around you and you are on adrenaline rush.The first match is over.What's then?The real pure fun.

								Excellent game! Definitely incomplete, definitely awesome nevertheless! It illustrates legitimate medieval combat while implementing a unique and, if I do say so myself, a double-backflippin awesome magic system. My personal weapon of choice is the stealth sword (one of the five swords) and two fireballs. Though weapon choices are limited, the character customization is INSANELY COOL! My only gripe is the cloaks. Though I still wear them, they act really strangely. The sidearms are all pretty cool. I go with the explosive throwing axe, myself. I also like how there is no crosshairs, making the whole thing much more realistic and hardcore. If you want a challengingly fun fantasy combat game, this is the way to go.I can't wait for more updates!			"

								NEEDS A FRAME LIMITER!IMO it's irresponsible and inconsiderate software development. I don't care what stage you're in, frame limiting is so basic that you not implementing is pretty ridiculous. It tells me that you don't care if my video card fries while running your currently unoptimized product.Honestly Steam should have requirements like this to even get distribution... It's just too basic a feature that saves on hardware lifespan so much. It's pretty insane that it's not a standard by now.Fun game otherwise, tutorial might be nice.			"

								Even for an early access, this game is amazing. I have not had more fun in a melee fighting game before - it's even on par with Dark Souls and Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. The combat has amazing intrisicies to it, as well as being simple enough to understand at a glance at the tutorial. The magic and special weapons only add to the experience, although getting fireballed several times in quick succession can get annoying :3. I heartily recommend this game for an awesomely fun time - totally worth the price tag!			"

								I love this game. It may be unfinished, but it's well polished. I like how the controls are similar to mount & blade and forces you to block in the same direction as the oncoming attack. It's tricky, though. I found it better to invert the mouse controls. The fluidity of combat is nice overall, I'd say. The graphics though, OH THE GRAPHICS are sweet for what frames I get for them. Compliments to the devs for loading it on the unreal 3 engine. Solid move. There needs to be a single player mode, though. I swear I have an urge to fight a huge boss or take on a really hard dungeon with flippy, bust'em-up & brutal ninja-knight combat. Oh dear god, what if there was a first person mode for the occulus rift? I would literally pinch myself until I get an aneurysm in my arm. And to those of you with a tight wallet and cash to spend... there are people out there that pay $15 a month to use swords and spells instead of paying that only once and having the warm fuzzy feeling of supporting an indie game company. I'm just sayin' to have an open mind is all.			"

								Well, when i first saw this game on steam i seemed like the best idea i have read. Multiplayer/coop PVP based medieval/fantasy sword game with magic? How can something like this go wrong ... Well i didnt think it could but it did.I was very excited when i bought it, downloaded right away and jumped right into battle ... well, it took me about 30 minutes to even get into a game because either the servers were full or they wouldnt let you connect. I know that the game is still in early access and every time i buy something like this i get annoyed by things that propably will be fixed before the actual release if there is one, but , the rate of updates here is very slow, i mean slow as a turtle. With each update there is more shiny spells, more buffs, more debuffs, new shiny sword, class or whatever but the very core of the gameplay is still not fixed. Half the time when i parry perfectly i still get hit but when i attack someone from behind pretty much decapitating him the game doesnt even recognize that something like that happened and the guy walks away swings his sword about 10 meters away from me and guts me perfectly, these things after more than a year still happen.It is such a shame, because the game has incredible (and i realy mean this) potential. - The Good:Pleasing graphics, smooth and elegantSkill and combat animations.The Idea.- The Bad:Glitchy Combat ( which is 95% of the actual game)Menu feels more like an overlay, doesnt realy have the fantasy feel, generic.Lots of Bugs.Slow updatesI do realy hope that the updates will come more frequently, actualy fixing majority of the bugs so we can atleast enjoy it whilst we wait for content updates / release.Good luck.

Early Access Review
								Talking about Kingdoms Rise is difficult because it's a title dear to me and I wish more people played it, but it's been in early access for years and with the accompanying quirks. This is an amazingly fun game that can really be summed up as third person Chivalry with magic. But it's much more than any of those things.Normal melee uses a charge/release system. When you release, you swing in the exact 360 degree direction that you moved the camera while charging. You also block in the same manner, holding a direction, up to a couple seconds at a time. There is no magic block button in this game. You have a dodge roll, but there are no invincibility frames. You have a backstep, useful for counterattacking, as well as a disarming strike that render's the opponent's weapon unusable for a couple seconds by hitting your roll button during an attack charge.There's an assortment of weapon choices in the game from the tank sword, which reduces incoming damage by 30%, to the Sneak Sword that basically functions like a TF2 spy knife to the Mobility Sword that increases your movement speed and enables you to double jump. There's a sword and shield option if blocking in a given direction proves too much for you and the Warhammer has a large amount of knockback useful for sending players flying off ledges.You're allowed to carry a bonus item into battle as well, and these vary in form and function. You could enter battle with a longbow strapped to your back, a bear trap to place on the ground, or an amulet you can consume for a health boost. Maybe you want to use throwing knives instead of the bow, or an axe that explodes like a grenade and can stick into a player if you hit them with it.You can take two spells into combat (or the same spell twice), though if you're good at using the menu you can swap these out on the fly, assuming you're willing to wait their full cooldown duration before use. Spells include a long-range teleport, turning invisible, force pull and push, multiple slows, a buff that grants temporary immunity to non-melee hits, some nukes like fireballs and lightning bolts, the ability to turn intangible for a couple seconds, a healing spell, and more.Spells (and their cooldowns) are where all the game's strategy comes from. Do you want to rely on your sword to kill opponents? Take spells like teleport and pull to get up-close and personal. Afraid to get in close? Try using Fireball, Lightning Bolt or Ice Shot to deal with enemies at a 'safe' distance. Having touble against that kind of player and want to juke out their cooldowns? Go for Phase Shift, Teleport or Magic Immune to dodge their damage while you approach. Are you losing in the melee? Consider using Force Push and Invisibility to sneak up on any player standing too close to a pit for a kill and a good laugh. The most recent spell, Ice Spike, summons a large crystal which pops up players on top of it and once summoned, can be used as cover or to platform on top of.The only real problem with this game is that no one plays it. Nine times out of ten, the servers are all going to be empty. There is a survival mode and a practice map with bots that can show off the game and give you the opportunity to test your loadout, but it's not the true Kingdoms Rise experience. I would buy this only if you have a friend to play with or if you want to be one of those guys and add random people like me onto your steam list hoping for some matchmaking.I write this fresh out of an hour and a half streaming session in which I played Kingdoms Rise for none of the world to see, because people watch the game as much as they play it. If you want to see the game in action, the different maps and spells available, and you don't mind a bit of vulgarity because the friend I'm playing with and I are disgusting when put in the same room, I suggest you at least take a peek. If you'd rather watch footage that's safe for work, just turn the sound off. It's probably for the best anyways, though the gradually increasing music volume as the timer reaches zero is a nice touch by the dev. Click Here (NSFW)tl;dr: Buy this game, then buy it again. Then buy a four-pack. Buy one for all your steam friends. If you can get one of them to play with you, regardless of who they are, you're gonna have a good time. If you buy enough copies, maybe the dev will be able to afford a marketing budget finally and we might get opponents on a more regular basis.			"

								Seeing this game in library hurts, it had so much potential to be something great. Then a few questionable updates came, namely an XP unlock system. I'm fine with it in early access, to test feedback on it and see if the rate needs any tweaking, but the game has, for all intents and purposes, a dead playerbase, so you really can't progress to unlock better spells and swords.I bought into it early, before the XP progression, and I really really liked what it had to offer. The combat was decent enough for the state the game was in, if a bit confusing and frustrating at times, but that was part of the fun, learning how to do combos and then do them faster and faster. And then, everyone I was having fun with in the game started to disappear, now there's only about 5 people if you're lucky.			"

								It was fun when people played it, but its the classic early access game where it will never be finished.			"
