												Playing two worlds is a lot like dating a girl with issues, you either drop her as soon as you see whats wrong with her, or you learn to love her little quirks that make her unique and ignore the rough edges.			"

												How can a game be terrible and awesome at the same time? I don't know, but that is the case here. Bugs, glitches, terrible voice acting and vanilla writing mask a large, enjoyable open world, a confusing but rewarding alchemy system, a ton of loot, and enjoyable exploration. I love this game, and when it's on sale it is an incredible value. If you like B movies and Oblivion, this is their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child.			"

												One of my badges gave me a coupon for this game. Now I didn't think much of it was like 90% off so I looked and total was about a buck. And for a dollar I figured ... Cant go wrong right?  Now all I can say is Wow after over 50 hours in and hardly touching the main story.  I'm still enjoying it. One of the best dollars I have spent.			"

												Okay, so I have to start my review by admitting I really enjoyed my time playing Two Worlds.  As others have said, the game is fairly glitchy, but as a long-time gamer, glitches don't ruin things for me as long as they are consistent.  In fact, learning to take advantage of those glitches used to be a big part of gaming, and I enjoyed the challenge in Two Worlds.The game is pretty standard fare with a male hero seeking to save the hapless female (yawn), and the hack-and-slash gameplay is good.  Go kill some stuff, collect stuff, and do some quests that consist of killing stuff and collecting stuff.  It's nothing special, but I enjoyed it all the same.The voice acting is so bad that I actually played with the game muted.  That was a new experience.I was having fun, exploring the land and doing side quests, and then I discovered something horrible.  Truly horrible.  This is the gamer's equivalent of Lovecraftian Old Ones rising from their slumber to slaughter the denizens of an innocent town...After about 90 hours of gameplay (mostly ignoring the main quest), I discovered that certain tasks in side quests MUST NOT be completed before certain other tasks in the main quest.  Or you break your entire experience.  And the game can't progress.  And there is NO way to fix it....Boo.			"

												Pros:      1. Great Open world to explore and discover stuff      2. One of those games that the more you play, the better your guy gets, no cap      3. Gameplay is fun      4. Quests aren't repetitiveCons:      1. Acting is TERRIBLE      2. Graphics are not the best, its a pretty old game after all      3. Quests are annoying at times, like i said, acting is really bad      4. Can get quite annoyingReason for recommendation:      While the acting is terrible and the quests can be annoying, I personally enjoyed it just cause you can go out and just level up endlessly and the gear has a fun upgrading system, you can get more of the same item and combine them to make it better, but it will still be the same item. So, say you take out a tower, and like every other guy had the same weapon. You can then take all the weapons and combine them together and get a weapon that may just be better than what you're using. Worst comes to worst you can always sell it and not worry about having to carry around 15+ weapons to get your gold. I have always enjoyed a game that has endless upgrading. This one is enjoyable too if you can get past the terrible acting and just do your own thing.			"

												I really like this game but it is super rough around the edges. Mouth sync is non existent, graphics are dated, quite a few glitches, and small mechanic issues. I won't lie and say you won't notice them, because you will. However, this is now the third time I have completed this game, and I still give it a good rating. I have more fun every time I run through it.I love this series so much, and it sucks that they have stopped adding to it. This game has a great charm to it. Everyone speaks in old English and it just sounds nice. The second one is all around better, but no other game has had that charm that this game has.This game honestly has a lot going for it. The experience system is nice and even. The skill building is cool. The mobs are varied. The armor upgrade system is awesome. The area looks good and is quite diverse. If you get past the problems, there is a real gem here.I am fully recommending this game. Love it!			"

Posted: November 10, 2015
												Well, after playing quite a lot and still playing I decided to recommend this game, at least to rpg funs. I am saying this because with a ton of games available today and so many on sale offers, one may easily abandon a game and go for another.Why I like this game? It is addictive. It keeps you playing for its advantages regardless its flaws. I have a lot of games, games I go back playing like skyrim, games I do not stop until I complete them like shadow of Mordor and games I never start playing yet. Too many games, too few time. Still, two worlds is a game that I start and did not abandon nor I will anytime soon. This game has something strangely addictive. For example I abandon dark souls about mid game while been an excellent game but I am now mid-game at two worlds and I hardy spent this little time to write this, right now I prefer to enter the game and continue.To describe this game very briefly, it is like diablo on levelling and items, like oblivion on world environment feeling and like divinity 2 on movement and combat. It also has some unique gameplay elements on its own.What you need to know primarily is that tutorial is brief and very basic. This game needs your close attention to understand it. The first time I play I think there were major flaws and bad designs but with a second and third closer careful looks I understand that I was wrong. Once you understand how things work it is where you really get addicted. I am sure that most negative reviews comes from hasty gamers. I do not blame them, a modern game needs to have a proper tutorial, a complex game a large tutorial, this game most likely relies on the manual.Let’s get on details(the bad stuff at the end):The character: You only play a male human character, no females and no races. That’s it. Also your starting character is fixed, fixed attributes and fixed starting skills. You cannot start with point pool and boost what you like. However the starting skills are the basic ones and at level 1 of 10. You can level up and increase any you like. All starting skills are all you need to do all essential things and secondary actions. For example you have lock pick 1 and you can lock pick and also increase it for a better chance. You do not have alchemy skill but you can still use alchemy. Finally, playing the game and visit villages and towns will allow you to meet trainers that will teach you the level 1 of all skills eventually, so there is no skill point cost at all for level 1 skill. If for example you want to advance alchemy or water magic you do not start with, all you need is to find the appropriate trainers to get the 1st skill point by paying some money. While levelling you get 5 attribute points and one or two skill points, usually one. You may also get one skill point before you level up but I have not yet figure out when, the game has many good secrets. You can also permanently increase attributes using alchemy even without skill 1, if you find the proper ingredients. In other words the game is rewarding for the good and smart player offering more than the standard gain experience and fixed level up procedure. Two level 10 characters for example may be different, one may be even 40% stronger from extra attributes and skills alone.The gear and items: Items are much like diablo, leveled items and many auxiliary items, consumables and especially ingredients. The only disadvantage here if it is one is that there are too many items. Not just leveled, too many items. Perhaps the greatest variety on gear I have ever seen. Ready consumables are just what is needed. Ingredients are plenty and not only herbs but also parts from animals and various minerals. There are also gems as consumables to add different types of damage to weapons, traps to set, spell cards and spell boosters and few standard items like the teleport stone and quest items.One unique gameplay element here is that you can enhance any gear item, weapon or armor with another piece of item of the same type. Items have a special attribute called ‘class’ which is usually one. If you have a short sword for example and find another one you can drag and drop it one another and you will now have a class 2 short sword which of course is a little better, doing more damage in that case. This is a very good thing and very useful, as it allows you to use trivial equipment to avoid buying everything from the store at every couple of levels or so, or live and die by drop chance alone. For example I used a Grom Shield that happened to be a very common item groms carry and drop so I end up finding about 30 or so, effectively had a class 30 simple grom shield with a parry number high enough to keep me up to level 10 or so. Then there were better shields to buy and enemies no longer often carry that shield, so it was time to change. Spell cards also stack. Add a second and third and so on card of the same spell and the spell becomes stronger, requiring more mana however. Finally gems can be placed on a weapon for extra damage and you can put as many as you like as long as they are of the same type, e.g. rubies that add fire damage.Money and trading: Surprisingly money are always needed here, and the game offers a fair amount of money. The trading is active to this game. You always earn cash and you always have reasons to spent, and not on consumables exclusively. I’d rather say you may spent for making your hero more powerful. Enemies either drop inventory with a fair amount of gold and random items or a single standard automatic pickup, like the wolf drops a wolf heart which is an ingredient.  Anything may drop but specific items have better sources to be harvested and animals and beast always drop standard ingredient item instead of inventory. All except single pickups are level depended, chests, enemy inventories and shops. You are bored looking for ingredients that increase your stats permanently? No problem, pay some attention to mage shops and after a certain level you definitely come across to buy.Enemies: Good variety of enemies, large size enemies are really deadly and not level depended, leveled enemies are logical like bandits; they got stronger but not as much as you.Classes: The 3 archetypes work well, fighter, mage and archer/thief that is. Hybrids also work well. There is depth on each single archetype, fighting style and weapons for fighters, magic schools for mages and lots of choices to master for an archer/thief.The story is interesting, the world is very good at least. The soundtrack is almost perfect.Now the bad stuff: The back-jump. Honestly I hated that. In my opinion it ruins melee. I do not even assigned it to a button. The game is much better without. Again, my opinion.The dialogues. Not sure what English dialect that is but it is strange until you get used to it. Also some times are almost childish, some other times are very mature. Your hero speaks quite well though.The NPC characters. Quite average.The spells. They are lots and great and come in form of cards that stack and extra spell booster cards (more damage, less mana etch). However you may have 3 spells with booster cards (that also stack), the others need some special way to be placed on your custom hot bar, first on the spell amulet and then on the hot bar. No big deal but somewhat annoying. "

I can recommend this game. But to be honest...just barely! + Huge World to discover and it is open world from the start+ Very fast loading screens+ It definitely has a certain charm and overall I liked the game- There are so many areas you can just ignore because theres nothing to do there. In my personal experience I found the southern part of the map so unpleasant that I just rode my horse past all enemies to get to a certain place as fast as possible.+ Environments look nice, full of trees, vegetation, wild animals and other enemies. The water looked extremely good for a game that old.+ A lot of different enemy types!- The environments also look very round and generic, there are almost no rocks or cliffs in this game+ The cities and villages are filled with many many NPCs- All the NPCs look similar and it is hard to recognice those who actually advance the plot.- Most of them just say the same thing and are just there to fill the city...useless!+ Teleporters are scattered all over the map to make travelling faster. Without much loading time.- Most of the times the teleporters are also quite far away from where you want to go. I recommend planting a mobile teleporter next to some merchants in one of the cities so you can save some time because you will want to sell your stuff frequently.+ Merchants have no limited amount of gold, so you can sell them all the stuff you want.- Your Inventory has a limit. At some point your strength doesn't increase the carry weight any more.+ Some of the cities are huge and very impressive- They are also too big and you have to run through them to get to an important NPC or merchant- Also they lack verticality as there are no towers or walls to be climbed, the hero can also not climb any ladders, they are just for decoration+ Horses for longer journeys are very useful. They are much faster and you can find them in many places.- The controls for horses are very stiff. You will get stuck in trees, rocks and they wont go up or down any steep landslides. Horses do not teleport with you and the function to whistle for your horse is useless when being further than 10 meters away from it.+ The combat animations look great+ There are a lot of different ways to attack: Magic, Bows, Clubs, Staffs, Swords, Daggers, Axes... . Some two-handed and you can dual-wield.+ You can enchant your weapons with (an unlimited amount of?) gems of the same type making them more and more powerful. I have literally used all of my fire-gems on one weapon and it was extremely strong and I could add even more fire gems after that.+ It is very satisfying to kill an enemy with a two handed club because they will sometimes fly all over the place.- It also feels very stiff to fight. You will constantly miss enemies. There is no way of actively blocking an attack (at least I didnt find it).- I am sure I am not the only one to be very annoyed by the enemies with bow and arrow. It usually goes like this: Attack a group of enemies, the ones with swords will die first because they are in close combat. The archers are in the background shooting at you. You run at them to kill them. Before you can swing at them they already turned around and ran further away. You run at them to kill them. Before you can swi......x3 I've chased archers across the map like this so many times.-The framerate seems to go down during battles+ A huge amount of different armours and robes, rings and amulets. They can also be stacked when you find identical items. It is very motivating to be on the lookout for better equipment.- The high level armours wont allow you to swim, use your bow or dual wield. Why not?- There is a river flowing across the world. I wondered: I have an armour which doesn#t allow me to swim. So I ran towards the water and....the hero just walked to the other side of the river...under water! (which is also MUCH faster than swimming!)+ A large selection of skills to level up. And a lot of different spells.- Swimming skill is useless. Don't waste any points on it. There was no situation at all where I was required to swim anywhere.- Sneaking skill is useless too, as is pickpocket skill. You wont have any money problems in this game.- If you want to use the best armour in the game, don't level up your arching skills, because those armours can't be used with bow and arrow.- Horse riding skill is useless. The few times I did use horses I just used them to travel faster and get off them as soon as possible :)- There is a skill to de-horse enemies....I have not seen an enemy riding a horse.+ You can also stack your magic spells to make them more powerful.- Projectiles are very slow and will often miss their target when it isn't either standing still or moving towards you.+ Cool looking creatures can be summoned. They can distract enemies.- Summoned creatures are very slow and have no perception of depth. They will miss their swing 9 times out of 10.+ The music and sound effects are enjoyable.- The english sync is horrible! Try to play it in another language. I played it in german and it sounds a lot better.+The whole world is full of side quests!+ Levelling up is fun+ NPCs have a lot of dialogue and it's all voiced.+ A lot of small stories help to get involved in the world- Sometimes I skipped the dialogue because I didnt care.- Personally I didn't find the story interesting			"

												Two Worlds is an open world third person medieval fantasy role playing game that borders on a single player MMORPG. Its not just single player, there is a multi player function via network. Even if you want to just play single player, you need to setup a user name and password. I'd say that the game was designed for multi player. Its not just fighting one enemy, but packs of them and they were far too overpowered until I was 4 hours into the game. That's one of a number of bad first impressions I was given.I was forced to run away and let two packs of enemies kill one another and then I'd loot the corpses. It became part of the game for me. If you're not into combat, you can run by any enemy no matter how large or overpowering they are. Even if a dozen enemies are following you, they'll get bored eventually. You'll always be faster even if there's no run button. You can chose your level of difficulty at the start, but never in the game. I made the mistake of going medium.The game has a lot of dialog. In fact some banter between my character and a quest giver bordered on a novella's length. I'd watch the sun rise in the background only to have night fall during the conversation it was so long. The voice acting is stiff, slow and spoken in the old tongue. I can't call it bad voice acting, the voices are memorable, its just the speed, delivery and the ""mayhap,"" ""whenst"" and archaic words that are no longer used. It was almost a point of comedy until I got used to it. With that being said, I'd rather listen to the dialog than read it. You can hit the space bar to skip each line.Another bad first impression was the fact that a lot of the time you're told to do something. Sometimes its marked on your map, other times its stuff like ""find these two deserters and kill them."" Well where did they go? If I knew that, I wouldn't need you. Even things that are marked on your map can have locked doors preventing you from entering or lock picking. Well where's the key? Oh you won't find that until you stumble upon some quest giver half way across the land. Then he'll give you the key after completing three quests with no sort of hint that he has the key.A lot of quests, you're given a choice to accept them and it boils down to well do I want to have something to do in the game or not? Yes of course I'll take the quest. In a game with such a giant land, it became a struggle to even find quests. The first town was brimming with quests. Each town does have a few quests, but sometimes they're relegated to one person giving all the quests. Other times you're in giant cities that you really need to go digging to find quests. The game makes it easy though to find who has a quest when you walk by them an icon appears that indicates if they're a typical background character, a quest giver, a merchant or a trainer.Gold felt worthless in the game. I never really bought anything. Everything that I had was from killing one of the hundreds of bandits or thousands of orcs. There was an occassional find at a merchant, but after a while I just stopped browsing their wares and just sold everything to them. A beautiful part about the game is they'll buy everything, they don't have limited funds and they're not picky. Its pretty streamlined. Even your inventory can carry a lot of stuff, and not that many things have a weight to them. I just wish there was a search function. You won't be over encumbered. You just can't pick up something when your inventory is full. It keeps the game moving. Another beautiful thing is you can merge the same weapons or armors to become stronger! It clears space and its interesting, even if it wouldn't happen in real life.Two Worlds is big on exploration. one of the biggest joys that I felt was exploring new areas either on foot or on horseback. There are lush forests, bright deserts with rolling dunes, bamboo forests inhabited by horrific arachnids, eerie graveyards and foggy wastelands with twisted trees. The only problem is that 99.9% of it is outdoors. There are still dungeons, but they're few and far between. Not only that, but they feel very sterile and empty. Too perfect and unnatural. Towns have interiors, but its relegated to single rooms and those too are rare. An entire village might have one room for you to enter.The land is so vast and large, with dozens of settlements. Everything from humble villages to grand cities you'll get lost in. There are two military camps, dozens of bandit camps, grom camps, mines, a dwarven quarry and gang hideouts. Oh but that's just the north half of the land. The south half is just as big, but instead of humans, every settlement, village and castle is full of orcs. The deserts have their own unique settlements, inhabitants and humanoid monster villages. Its just all so diverse. There's always something new and fresh. Necromancer towers, new enemies, new locales. It kept the game fresh and kept me exploring.Since the game is so massive, there are teleporters after you complete one of the first few quests. You'll need to find a teleporter to unlock it. Otherwise there are horses to travel faster, but a real problem is that you can't bring a horse into a teleporter. That might make a centaur. I'm very thankful to have the teleporters.The orc war is really the backdrop to the game. Its a pressing issue for the people of Two Worlds, but for you, your main goal is to rescue a woman who has been kidnapped. No no not a princess. Your sister. In fact she's one of the few women in the game. I'd say 99% of the game's population is male. More than half of the female populous dies by the end of the game if you fulfill the quests.Every dead enemy stays dead. Nothing will respawn. You can go through the entire game and become the only living thing. To shorten some silly long quests, I merely killed two entire villages full of people. They wouldn't let me into their settlement, so I killed the man with the key and everyone attacked me. Even though the game told me that the guards were notified, no one did anything. I was never arrested, nor fined. I could walk through an entire military camp and no one cared.Another way that it feels like a MMORPG is when you die, you simply respawn. You'll find several healing ankhs and mana replenishes. If you get low, just stand on them. There is no punishment for death. The only real punishment is wasting time traveling back to where you were. I managed to exploit dozens of big, tough enemies by dying, respawning, striking them twice then dying with one hit. Keep chipping away!Combat itself is easy and resorts to mouse clicking madness to attack. You've got a quick use toolbar that lets you use keys 0 - 9 to use things like spells and items. Even a quick mana or health recharge. Your three active spells are also in the toolbar. The right mouse button also uses whatever skill you've highlighted in the toolbar. Spells and arrows have lock on aim, which is nice, but you can turn it off if you'd like to miss 99% of the time. There are spell modifiers in the spell menu, things that reduce the cost of mana to doubling their effectiveness. Each spell is basically a card. The more of the same card you have equipped, the more damage it does. Spells felt very ineffective compared to physical melee.Leveling up gives you five attribute points to sink into health, attack, intelligence and dexterity. The dexterity felt useful, because it raises your attack and defense percentages, but it goes down over time making it feel wasted. You'll also get skill points to sink into several skills, most of which I never used. Skill points even seemed granted at odd times, making me think you get a point for every X amount of minutes played.While I got entertainment out of it for the exploration, I'm not sure that I can really recommend it to anyone else. I was surprised that I endured the first 4 hours. By the last 4 hours I was getting bored again. Its been $1 and free before...			"

												Lets get the bad stuff out of the way first. BUGS. HOLY MOTHER OF GOD, THEY'RE EVERYWHERE. It's like an infestation of glitches of every kind: graphical (I'll talk about that later.), gameplay, combat and some are even game-breaking. Walk up stairs,  open a chest, and never walk down the stairs again due to the magical power of floating over noble gasses gained in the 11 seconds you spent raiding the poor farmer's pantry. Luckily, the game keeps a good list of autosaves to avoid these issues.Second biggest problem: the visuals are horrendous. I was walking through what I thought was a field of grass and happiness, when suddenly...bamboo. A whole forest of it, and I was walking through the center of the mighty wilds without even noticing. It took the game 10 minutes to process the enviroment fully. I could understand this if you were playing Mass Effect 3 on a Commodore 64, but with these extremely out-dated and pixely graphics, it should take less than 5 seconds on an average non-gaming computer.Oh, and don't bother talking to that drunk guy in Four Stones Village. His voice acting is even worse than the cook in the army camp named Bodlo, wh speaks in 3rd person and has the voice of a pig that was injected with both steriods and female hormones.With the bad parts aside, lets talk about why this game is actually worth the $10.00 asking price. Let's be posh and give you a list of blunt statements:- ALMOST 600 ARMOUR SETS, each with individual pieces: helmet, gauntlets, legs, torso, and boots.- 200 different weapons- Decent character customization (Though more hair options would be nice, other than just the 12 flavours of short available in 9 shades of brown.)- Very easy to pick up and play.- Puns of Damage. And lots of them. Some of them are even tolerable!- Large open world, with tons of shiny loot, though I wish more of it could be placed in your house...which you can't have.Over all, the hardcore gamer will find nothing of interest here. Fans of western RPG's will find an interesting mix of complete control over your character's destiny, and terrible, game breaking bugs such as randomly dying when you pick a lock to... A TENT? I can bloody see inside of it for the love of damn.			"

												Really having a lot of fun with this 6 year old open world RPG (for the second time through), thanks to some great updates.Patches have made the game a lot more stable, bug free, and even better looking. Sure its not perfect, but neither is Skyrim if you really think about it (backwards flying dragons FTW). What TW does have is great visuals, deep player controlled character delopment, a lot of crafting/combining items into more powerful items,  tons of loot and a pretty good story thats fully voiced with a lot of optional side quests.Become any hero you want to be with no classes or weird♥♥♥♥♥leveling requirements.Theres 5 schools of magic with 25 spells (each) that all can be powered up and boosted, bows (with different ranges and different draw speeds) and 7 different melee type weapons (Axes 1h/2h, Pikes, Maces 1h/2h, Swords 1h/2h).As you level up  you'll get Paramater Points to spend on 4 attributes, Strength, Vitality, Willpower and Dexterity, but you'll also get a lot of points from finding rare items and making stat increasing potions. You start with everything at 5, but it might not be long until your skills are in the 100's, the sky is the limit (might actually be 1000, not sure).Also by gaining a level (or completing certain goals) you'll gain skill points to put into one of the games 38 skills. Like Beskering or Multiple Arrows, or sneaking and stabbing someone in the back.Walk around the huge map or fast travel via a teleportation system that you can set and move 3 points of, or  try horse riding with mounted combat.It's very much a complete game thats fun, and challenging, and something that YOU get to build your character in. Again, yes, it is rough around the edges... but the overall experience is definatly worth it. "

												I would highly reccommend this game to anyone looking for RPG Adventure games similar to the Elder Scrolls Saga. Decent graphics considering it is from 2007. I greatly enjoy the open world format, although, sometimes inventory space is an issue, especially when hoarding materials for when you reach level 10 Alchemy (Skill initially learned from a trainer without enhancements you have ot be level 24 to max skill). So far I am 37 hours in and I think it has a Good Story line. The teleport side quest is exceedingly helpful in making sure you don't have to leave any loots behind. Slight lag when it autosaves but otherwise runs smoothly.  Biggest disappointment thus far has been the inability to pickpocket from the NPC's. Word of Advice to those interrested in this game, use caution and consult google before diving head on into using alchemy, permanent indregient aren't very easy to come by and the brewing system is not intuitive on how to best maximise thier use.

												Don't compare this game to Oblivion. Try Gothic 1, then compare games again... or try Arx Fatalis and come back.Two Worlds is a grand effort from a small team to try to make a game they'd want to play. A labor of love, so to speak. It's for that reason why I love the Gothic series (especially the third one).In Two Worlds, you don't get the feel and controls of a triple A game franchise. You get handcrafted, homecooked, delicious, awkward experimentation from gamers who love games.Remember Peter Jackson's first few movies? Would it surprise you to know that the guy who gave us all the Lord of the Rings movies started out just making random, insane films, like ""Dead Alive"" and ""Meet the Feebles""? Innovation requires risk.Two Worlds does things a bit differently and that's what's worth taking notice of. Sure, horse controls are awkward, and your main character says ""Mayhap"" and ""Perchance"" enough times in the first hour to make you want to invent time travel and murder ancient languages... but keep playing.Keep playing and discover an absolutely massive world with very, very little loading time, and a Morrowind-esque combat system. I dislike the Oblivion comparison because that game was truly real-time and Two Worlds is more die-rolls and random chance based on skill percentages like Morrowind, Dungeons and Dragons, Shadowrun, and... well... 80% of CRPG's that have come out in the last 35 years.In summation:Voice acting: Bad to the point of comedic.Combat: Die rolls... not Oblivion.World: HOLY COW this thing is huge.Gameplay: Enough variation to keep me coming back.Horses: Not as good as Mount & Blade, but better than Ride to Hell Retribution.Replayability: Mayhap I should complete it once before I judge this.Two World's Epic Edition is of such quality that I can only compare it to Seth Rogen's ""The Interview"": A lot of people said a lot of things about it, but when I finally saw it for myself, I realized that people don't really know anything and I should just judge things for myself. It's not perfect, but I like it anyway.			"

												By far one of the most memorable and underrated RPGs ive ever played. This game recieved mostly all negative reviews on release and was hated by most critics. I didn't know any of this before I saw in an EB Games and picked it up for a cheap price on disk. Two Worlds is definitely a flawed game. The writing is♥♥♥♥♥♥ with everyone speaking in the old style english language that sounds ridiculous and out of place. On top of the writing is the atrocious voice acting (which is funny). The starting game cutscene even features writing where a character repeats a Monty Pyton quote word for word which is farcical. The devs also decided to use laughable names for certain things in the game, for example calling some sort of plague ""The Taint"". Two Worlds was also riddled with bugs on release (patched with expansions in Epic Edition) which didn't help at all in the way of reviews. Looking past those issues though, Two Worlds is an enjoyable experience. Reviews on Youtube do great in making this game look like a laughfest of asinine writing and technical flaws, but besides those issues, the game at its core is an ambitious underachiever which still succeeds in providing to the player for the most part. The main menu music was the first thing that stood out when I started the game, which complimented the pretty wonderful soundtrack. Two Worlds takes place in Antaloor, a mysterious and expansive setting that always kept me expecting more. I never felt like I was playing a walking simulator (even though the world is huge), nor did I feel like I was being attacked left and right. The game did nicely in striking a balance between a good amount of action and passive adventuring.  Two Worlds also includes a multiplayer component, with PvP and Co-op. I never really played it though because the population was mostly Eastern European, so English was pretty rare. The combination of the two leaves a lot for the player to do. Questing, exploring, looting, messing around, and kicking♥♥♥♥♥is always an option. The cities are big and populated, and felt very lively. I personally was in love with the variety of awesome armor and weapons, which is what I liked the most.You can also choose how you want to play, throughout the entirety of the game. There are no preset classes or anything, so you can play however you want to. You can play melee the whole game, or be a hybrid archer mage warrior. How you choose to fight is only limited by what you have in your inventory and your skill levels. The combat system is also one of the few ive experienced that actually works. The targeting system is automated which can be troublesome but rarely is it actually. You can't always button mash to win though, since you can easily die, but its satisfying and rewarding. The combat is nothing innovative nowadays, but it works and its fun. I always looked forward to what kind of loot I would find. I would be ecstatic when I would find a new piece of armor that made my character look lawesome. The graphics for it's time were decent at best. Far distance rendered poorly and the textures and effects were pretty basic but taking into account how expansive the world is, with all the different types of environments, it was justified. The armors and weapons did have pretty intricate details though. Even if you had to game maxed out and ran at 60fps plus, it still looked choppy thanks to the animations. Hours can easily be lost in this game when you realize all that there is to do in the game world. If you really choose to, you can hate this game. Two Worlds has quirky dialogs, a poor storyline, weird people, terrible voice acting, questionable sound choices (attacking someone with a sword plays punching sounds?) and ugly animations. To me, these issues were relatively unimportant, which is why I enjoyed the game as much as I did. Two Worlds always had something that allowed me to forgive it for its issues.So much in this game can be done in the way of customization and how you want to play. I still consider myself pretty lucky to have given this game a chance and I still remember experiences from 5+ years ago. To add, I can safely say I enjoyed this game just as much as any Elder Scrolls game, which seem to be the standard which any RPG is based on nowadays. Two Worlds lacks polish and is nowhere near perfect, but underneath all of the minor issues, is a gem. A gem of a game that is immensely underrated and misunderstood. Despite all you may read, this game is an immersive and rich experience that can leave you glued to your screen for hours. It's up to you to realize that not every game needs to be technically perfect, its how you appreciate it and your ability to see through the rough edges.			"

												Oh, where to begin? I could write a review equivalent in length to War and Peace if I wished to list fully everything that I wanted to say about this game, so I'll give two versions - one brief and one a bit more in-depth, take your pick. Here is the short version: Two Worlds EE is Skyrim with Oblivion graphics, there is as much to like about this game as there is to annoy, you need at least 3-4hrs in to start really enjoying it and remember, it's the first game from a small development team. That's the short version. For those who want a bit more info, read on. I went into this game, on the back of mixed reviews, not expecting a lot from it and was very pleasantly surprised by how much this game has going for it - yes, the graphics are a little outdated today, but it IS still a very pretty game overall  on max settings. Some of the scenery is beautifully breathtaking, but unfortunately pop-in and a fairly short draw distance does ruin it a little. And this is the story through the whole game. For every single thing I loved about this game, there was a downside - usually directly related to the thing I loved (such as the graphics example above). I loved the way the weapon/armour levelling system worked - downside, you never knew which items to keep (as there are literally hundreds  of both) and which to sell. I loved the diverse array of different environments on offer - downside, I spent 5-10mins exploring a new area and then half an hour putting stuff away to keep/save to sell in bulk, as you can build up your strength (helps with carrying), but once your inventory screen is full, you cannot carry anymore regardless of how much spare weight you can manage. I loved the large map, with virtually every environment you could think of in it - downside, there were parts where you wouldn't really have noticed if they weren't there (like empty stretches  of forest/grass/sand etc.) and mountain ranges devoid of everything and only 1 way up. I could go on and on, but you get the point.The best features of this game, in my humble opinion, are: Huge range of weapons/armour/enemies; lots of diverse environments (even the dungeons don't seem 'samey' after you've been in 4); Skyrim-like short main questline with lots of 'mini' npc quests; every time I started to feel invincible I encountered a new enemy (they level up with you) who either gave me a damn good fight or made me run off with my tail between my legs (to come back later with better weapons); the ability to play the game as a medieval Rambo, a wizard, an archer (sniper) type or indeed ANY combination of the three at any one time! The best thing loved was the fact that even at 100hrs in, with 90% of the (large) map covered and almost finished all the quests, I was not only not bored and looking at what to play next, but was STILL finding new places and enemies! And it's the ONLY game I've played where walking through snow actually sounds like walking through snow!!! There is more, I could also list a lot more downsides, but basically just (re-) read the short version above and if that appeals to you then this game is definately worth giving it some play time. I'm looking forward to playing Two Worlds II soon.			"

												A decent role-playing game for those who enjoy exploration and looting.For some reason Two Worlds seemed to be mostly ignored by the gaming media. Perhaps because it did not have a very good marketing, hence it did not make a decent following before its release date. It was definitely not something it deserved. Two Worlds is an open-world RPG in a spirit of such games as Gothic and The Elder Scrolls. While it has many drawbacks, it certainly is a very enjoyable game at least for those players whom enjoy exploration and open-world games.The game has a very disappointing storyline that is boring and forgettable. It only serves as a background for a player to do stuff. NPCs are quite shallow and without characters too. In addition, dialogues are horrible, not only writing is unsatisfying, but also dubbing is horrid. Although it sometimes is quite entertaining, it’s so bad that it’s good as one might say. Nonetheless, it’s definitely not a reason to play this game.Two Worlds has some strong points though, and ultimately whether you will like the game or not depends how much you like exploration. If you love it as much as I do, then you will have a blast playing this game as it’s one of the better implemented exploration in RPGs. Not only locations are varied, but also there is no annoying level scaling of enemies or loot so prevalent in many modern RPGs and so annoyingly killing any challenge, joy and excitement out of discovering new lands. In Two Worlds you might encounter an enemy that is way above your level, however, if you are pertinacious enough, then you might kill them with use of some tricks anyway, but it might be a tough fight. Moreover, challenge is well worth it as loot that you might gain might make you more powerful. The game offers a huge gameworld and seems to be the first third person RPG that offers a decent horse riding and combat (Yes, you can fight while you are on a horse, unlike in Oblivion). Needless to say, that exploration is very satisfying, and so are combat encounters, although the combat itself is a bit too simple. However, in late game the player becomes too powerful and challenge perishes, unfortunately.To summarize, Two Worlds is an enjoyable exploration RPG, however, with some weaknesses. I recommend it to everyone who like open world role-playing games for wandering around and experiencing new discoveries. Do not expect a good story or interesting NPCs though, as these aspects are lousy and will fail to meet your expectations whatever they are.			"

												I know this game is far from perfect, but I really enjoyed playing through it (in 2012). I didn't like it much when I started playing, but after I got the hang of it I started to really like it. I sure never thought I'd get over 100 hrs out of it (not too bad for $5 I paid for it a few years ago). Two Worlds is an open world RPG with big open areas. It's like the Gothic/Risen games in the sense that when you kill an enemy it's dead for good, and that the world is sprinkled with some really tough enemies you'll have to level up, gear up and come back later to defeat it. The combat is mostly mindless button mashing, but it does a good enough job with it. One cool thing about this game is that you can combine weapons and armor that are the same, so eventually that weapon you first had turns out to be really good after some time. The story is alright with terrible-ish voice acting, but the game is setup good enough that I didn't pay a lot of attention to it. The graphics aren't great, but are good (for the year it came out) although the framerate was kind of choppy. This game was relaxing for the most part. It was good for zoning out and killing tons of enemies. I will admit that the last 10 hours I ran through quickly just so I could beat it and be done with it. My rating 7/10.			"

												I remember trying Two Worlds when it first came out years ago, and it was pretty horrible.  But I recently picked it up on sale and gave it a shot.  They really drop you in with absolutely no background, but you learn about the world very organically through conversations and quests.  These conversations are made through some of the most hilariously bad voiceovers I've heard, coupled with corny faux-fantasy writing.  But the style has kind of grown on me, and I am really enjoying the gameplay.  There's lots of loot, adventure, and exploration.  The character development is quite varied and interesting as well, with lots of playstyle options available.If you can get past the initial low-quality shock, there's a really fun RPG in here.  Be sure to install the Nvidia legacy Physx pack to be able to run it, it is not included in the install:  http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.12.1031-legacy-driver.html "

												Two Worlds is a game that has the right intentions and was headed in the right direction – it just had a few stumbling blocks en route. If you can get past some of those obstacles, you will find a very solid and entertaining RPG that will eat up a lot of hours.Two Worlds is worth a play, but only if you've exhausted the competition. And invested in ear plugs for when the characters start talking.To its credit, Two Worlds dares to be less conventional than Oblivion, but it's not nearly as polished in any regard. The unbalanced difficulty makes for a frustrating first few hours, and there's little incentive to return to the game after completing the main story line.It's a solid effort that may not bring a lot of ingenuity to the fantasy RPG genre, but still provides many hours of entertainment.Two Worlds succeeds at what it sets out to provide – a poor man’s Oblivion and a simple, unrestrictive introduction to role playing games. Overall 7/10.			"

												I liked Two Worlds. Mechanically, I'd even say there's not a single thing that Two Worlds does badly. But I can't recommend it.""Raining again?""- Your nameless heroAs with all massive open-world aRPGs, your various playstyles play so differently while being the bulk of the gameplay that no two people can be said to be playing the game. So here's the game I played: major emphasis on two-handed weapons and heavy plate armour, used traps to disable large foes and projectile spells to stun archers to get in close. Looted every enemy to get them to despawn to avoid any memory leaks (somehow not an issue in this game but I wasn't taking any chances), explored all the landmarks and most road-based locations but didn't fully 100% the map. Played on Hard, which made the combat much more hectic and enjoyable.The core melee gameplay of crowd control, using the i-framed backstep and fishing for criticals, while using the tertiary skills like traps and spells, was legitimately fun. It more than carried the game, and even when taking on enemies and hordes who will happily stunlock or one-shot you on Hard, you're never really in over your head so long as you're quick on your feet and quicker on the hotbar. Skill resetting/regression isn't just there but encouraged (although not free), more than urging you to try out new builds and playstyles and recover from bad ones.Art-design wise, nobody really has a neck and the pauldrons are about 3 times the size over the legal limit, but apart from some truly ugly mid-tier armour it's fairly nice to look at. Soundtrack, likewise, is generic but not bad.""Ugh, it's raining.""- Your hero, who shall not be named.Where Two Worlds really shines, though, is in the superficial systems and aspects. Best presented through some examples:You have fast-travel, but it can only be unlocked through a questline and you can only fast-travel to places you've been before. The convenience is there, but earned, and is probably the best fast-travel in an RPG outside of Morrowind's infamous but lore-godly commutes.You can ""stack"" weapons and armour of exactly the same type to slightly upgrade its ""class"", granting you higher stats. This means that even lategame, when you've finally gotten a matching set of armour, there's more than enough incentive to continue spending money on matching items to upgrade the stats. Inherent boosts like strength or HP upgrades are carried over too, resulting in some endgame outfits that will happily double your stats. ""Stacking"" applies to spells too - from the spells themselves to spell boosters. This works in exactly the same way and is just as incentivized, although getting endgame viable spell combos is an uphill battle.The map design is godly. Although not quite as much terrain variety as one might like, the precise use of verticality sees you frequently seeing certain or even every other major city and landmark in the game, something that never gets old and really grounds the entire world. Quest design, though conventional, is never lazy or boring and the voice-acting - especially with your miscast villian of a main character with his Christopher Walken-tier ham - is incredible to listen to.These are just examples, and the list of examples goes on (without touching on the indepth alchemy or the enemy spawn system). It is with sincere regret that I look back at the dozens of hours spent playing this game, with its many high points, just to be brought right down low by a single low one.""It's rainiiiiiiiing.""- Hero Schmero Gero LeroIt runs badly.This is a core performance issue. Regardless of whether internal or external tools tell you it's running smoothly at 60+ FPS, there's a subtle ""stuttering"" that continuously happens wherever you walk (and is greatly exacerbated by horse travel). I've looked up gameplay of other users playing the game, tried every fix that's come to mind, this is core and universal and kneecaps any thought of recommending the game.Certainly not helped by the animations running at low framerates independent of the game, all this combines to make Two Worlds nauseating to play for any length of time. The whole game. And it is beyond sad that a game that does so much right, does so much that's interesting, is brought to its knees by this single, fatal, Achille's heel of a flaw.To further damn the game, I got some frequent crash to desktops that the saving system made easy to deal with, and the ending FMVs failed to trigger at all, just booting me back to the desktop after I beat that joke of a final boss.I looked them up on Youtube afterwards, they were pretty bad but you do get to see how the models in the FMVs look substantially worse than the ones in the game proper, which is always fun.""Hmm. Looks like it's raining.""- McHeroes the ZeroesSo that's Two Worlds. A tragic hero of a game. To be mourned but not necessarily played. If you have the grit and immunity to every form of motion-sickness, eye-strain and aversion to giant pauldrons there is, there's a gem of an aRPG here that might've ranked with some of my favourites in a different world. If you don't, and don't have the dogged determination to see a sickening gem to the very end to write a cool review about it, then sorry to say, but you should just move on.And certainly don't play it while hungover, that's just a mistake.If anyone has a fix for that stuttering please comment with it and I'll gladly just delete this review. Or at least majorly edit it to be a big ol' thumbs up. I sincerely, sincerely want to recommend this game. But as is, I just can't.Temp Edit:Someone posted that forcing v-sync will amend the stuttering. Will confirm myself, had problems first time through.			"

												Regarded as one of the worst games ever created by many, I found this game to be highly enjoyable. The combat system has its faults, but the ability to become a mage-warrior had an appeal to me, and it was fun to play through the map in that role. Pros:Diverse landscapes including; snow, desert, meadows, mountains, hellish regions, beaches, forests.Extremely intricate skill system. Enormous map to explore, with many dungeons each of which different from the last. Hundreds of different armor sets and weapon choices make customizing your character easy to suit your needs. Hundreds of quests ranging from the classic fetch quest, to more detailed ones where your choices will play a role down the line.Great combat system for warriors, mages, and archers alike.Great variety of enemies to fight; humans, orcs, dragons, wyverns, raptors, wolves, and many more created just for the game that can be found in the bamboo forests, deserts, and beaches to name a few. Cons:Terrible voice acting. Same battles over and over.At a certain level combat just becomes too easy, especially with the ""Restore Health"" spell that fully heals you at the cost of barely any Mana.Overall, while I probably wouldn't purchase this game for its retail price, I would buy it if it was under $5. I have about 30 hours at the time of this review, and while I've been done with the main story line for a while I feel I definitely got my money out of it.			"

												First impressions were not good; the game doesn't look all the great (faces are terrible), sounds worse (nice soundtrack though), plays poorly at times (especially on horseback), and doesn't have much of a tutorial beyond ""use WASD to move, click to attack, okay, off you go!"".Despite all that though, I just can't stop playing. The world is vast, varied and full of different things to slay and quests to do, and the best part is that you learn everything organically rather than having all the lore shoved down your throat. Combat is a little underwhelming, but there are lots of spells, abilities and tons and tons of equipment to help add flavour.The only gripe I have with the game is that despite this being a ROLE PLAYING game, you don't really get the chance to play any role in the side quests beyond ""mercenary only motived by gold"" which is disappointing because it diminishes the replay value of the game and makes you feel like you don't really have an impact on the world besides checking off a list.Overall, its great game if you can look pass some of its rough edges and well worth your time and money. If you find yourself hating the game in the first half an hour like I did, just give it some more time; you don't want to miss out on this experience.			"

Good game, couple of flawsThis is a well made game. It's a bit linear as you have to do certain story parts to open up new areas. It does have replayability however, as you will pick one path and then try another path the second, third time. It's great to be a caster and attack a horde of orcs or a dragon with 8 conjured minions. I have primarily played a mage in this game up to a pretty high level. I did archer for quite some time as well, but it gets repetitive and is actually tougher than the mage. Thief is useless. The game doesn't force you into one of these archetypes, you are free to mix / match skills, but a hybrid in this game is weaker than a pure character. The game is good enough that I bother to write a review so that others will try this game.Flaws: 1) Magic card system is weak. During combat, a caster is opening the magic window every few seconds to swap spell cards or enhancement cards. That said, the magic in this game is well thought out and looks great. I love my summoning demon bud!2) Item collection becomes tedious and at higher levels you just give up on it. Early in the game you almost obsess over it. Later, you ignore all but the most intriguing items.3) AI is weak. Mostly get bushwacked and charged. But, combat is interesting and looks great.4) Sneaking is useless.			"

												This is probably the most underrated game ever. If you compare it to Oblivion, then yeah.. it's not even close, but it's a very good game anyway. Pros: - Tons of item, especially Armor and Weapons. You can call yourself a hero if you manage to collect 10+ full sets through the game; - Stacking items of same class;  - Very organized inventory; - Beautiful graphics and places;  - Cool spells; - Traps and bombs. Cons:  - Shallow storyline. And that hot girl is your SISTER... WTF!?;  - Dumb conversations (but still funny);  - Not the most attractive combat sistem;  - You become overpower fairly soon, but still there are monsters which will kill you with one hit. Overall it's a good game and you will like it if you are not expecting something like Oblivion. It's more like Gothic 3, but better optimized and more beautiful. If it's on discount it's a must-have game.There is a sequel too and it's one hell of a game. Actually one of my 10/10 games.			"

												In some ways, this game is better than Oblivion, the main competitor in the open-world fantasy genre, but there are quite a few issues and a real lack of polish that prevents the game from reaching its full potential.The main gripe is combat. At later levels, the game becomes severely punishing. Now I don't mind difficulty, but this game likes  to suddenly throw overpowered monsters at you without warning. High level monster scale rediculously well. They will have a few times your health and do a couple times your damage. If you want to be able to take on high level challenges, you either have to grind out a lot of levels, which is done by killing monsters MMO style or through quests, or invest in the severely flawed magic system.One can understand why the monster are so strong when one takes a look at what spells are available to the player. While finding the exact spell you want is nearly impossible, getting hands on any higher level spells makes your power level spike like crazy. I was able to get my hands on a reflect aura in the earth magic school. By abusing the magic system, I was able to get my reflect spell to reflect 70% of all damage. You heard that right, 70%. It seems the game will assume your use of of magic. By throwing out rediculous monsters, it forces you to be a sort of mage-warrior no matter what.The leveling system in this game is actually more interesting than that of Oblivion's. There are a myriad of skills that can be learned, and the aforementioned magic system provides a bunch of really cool spells. Unfortunately, in terms of melee combat the game seems to favor two-handed weapons. The advantage of dual-wielding or using a sword and shield is the ability to parry attacks (done automatically). But one quickly realizes that isn't not worth it. It's far better to abuse the two-handed weapon's long range and simply physically avoid the ennemy blows, rather than nibling away at the enemy with the extremely short ranged one-handed weapons and relying on the dice to block strikes. It doesn't help that two-handed weapons all seem to deal double the damage of one handed weapons. In a role-playing game, the player should never be forced to do something. All roles should be equally valid. Whether that be a mighty barbarian or a graceful duelist. But the game funnels you down a single path. With some more polish and a better balanced combat and magic system, I might have really enjoyed this game. But these gaping issues ruined it for me.			"

												two worlds has become one of my favorite games ever, and noone is more surprised than me. first of all, I didn't start playing fantasy rpgs until a few years ago, they always looked too generic and boring, plus I really hated everything, and I mean everything, about the two worlds demo. but thankfully I gave it another shot and had a ton of fun playing it.it's not a perfect game by any means, but also very far from the trainwreck a lot of reviews make it out to be. the graphics still hold up, the viewing distance is really amazing, you can see stuff in the distance from really far away (yet grass seems to grow under your feet, which is one of the very few complaints I have). the music's great too and the voice acting falls into the so-bad-it's-hilarious category. it was grating at first but became entertaining soon, the over the top usage of 'olde english', the protagonist's sarcastic remarks and taunts like 'say hello to death!' or 'they look like my in-laws'.some of the mechanics are pretty interesting too: you can use a bunch of active skills during combat (after you learned them from trainers) and there's a jump back button, which is essential against bigger but slower enemies. there are horses, but I found them only useful as inventory extentions, just park them next to a teleport and you're good. riding on the road is actually fine, but as soon as you go off-road, it's hell. you can probably get the hang of it eventually, but with a generous amount of static teleports and your personal teleport stones you don't really need a mount to get around. sprinting would've been nice though, even if you run faster with your weapons put away.speaking of weapons and gear, you can combine multiple copies of the same items to make them more powerful, which is great, and also makes inventory management easier. there's a crazy amount of loot in the game though, with a lot of variety in everything, so multiple trips to merchants will be necessary to grab and sell everything. I wouldn't have minded a third inventory screen, actually.there's also magic and bows (no need to worry about arrows) and I'd say combat is good enough, you can mix things up, though it can get a bit hectic because aggroing an enemy usually mobilizes their friends as well. but most importantly (for me anyway), the game doesn't have respawning enemies (there's a ghost mechanic though that's explained in the game, but it's only troublesome in the beginning) nor level scaling, which can make for one-hit deaths early on if you run into something far above your level.the alchemy system is pretty good too, you can make temporary and permanent potions and gems from almost everything, plants, monster drops, minerals, and they really make a difference. if you're into exploring and hoarding, you can become so powerful that almost everything will die in a few hits. this might be a problem for some, but you don't have to make potions, obviously, and you don't have to kill every wolf you run into for even more xp. that's what I did though: I can't remember the last game where I wanted to explore absolutely everything and where exploration was so relaxing even with literally thousands of enemies around. I'm not one for farming and grinding, but I killed them all (more than 10.000) while I was at it. I wouldn't say the game world is especially unique, though later on you'll run into some weird creatures and unsettling environments.there are a lot of quests, some of them are pretty basic, some are more involved, and sometimes you have to make a decision, you can't complete everything (though it's possible to have max reputation with all the factions at the same time until you anger them). the main story is nothing to write home about, your sister's missing, go find her, oh, and save the world in the meantime, will you? the game shines in the sidequest department though. there are a few funny ones, some are touching, and they can have unforeseen consequences. you think you're done and did the right thing, but when you go back to the village or npc later, you'll find you actually made things worse. I loved these.I could go on for days about the game but I'm sure these reviews have a character limit, so I'll stop before I get too much into it. long story short, if you're looking for an open-world fantasy rpg you probably haven't played, check this one out. if you want to do everything, it'll keep you busy for more than 100 hours (or you can just concentrate on questing and be done a lot faster).

Two WorldsI bought this game for € 1,50 with a coupon and I didn't expected too much. But damn this game is cool! People compare this game to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, but that's not really fair. I think if you love Skyrim you would like this game too! It has its flaws and bugs but the gameplay, magic system and quests are amazing. If you love to explorer a big beautiful open world, this game is for you. Final verdict: 8/10 "

												Fair RPG, good and confusing. Multiplayer mode is dead for now, so lets forget that, no living souls inside the servers.The single player main story campaign is ridiculously short - perhaps 1 hour or so overall. But there are factions with quests, that can expand gametime greatly. Combat itself is good, but the enemy balance is awful, kill or be killed by one hit. Best parts of the game are the character dialogues, and the freedom the game offers. The map is an enormous one, pretty barren though, with beautiful landscapes, with lonely atmosphere.Highly recommended to buy during big discounts.			"

												The best fantasy RPG of the year 2007.I love this game.Well i can surely say that this game is a really underrated gem.Is funny, huge and addicting.Yes,maybe is not an AAA production but is worth playing for sure.Combat system is pretty funny indeed, and the spell creation mechanics are something i've never seen in a third person RPG.There are various playstyles possibilities: stealth assassin,mage,archer or a brute tank vanquisher.Weapons and gears are in a good amount and the simple crafting system is well made too,with the possibility to recolour your armours.You can ride horses. Man wtf you have to try this.Enemies are various and in huge amounts but sometimes are a little dumb.The story is pretty long, not worth an Oscar prize but still enjoyable and there are tons of secondary (and funny) quests to do.

												Ok, so I'm not gonna lie, this game has tons of flaws. The artwork is terrible, the animations are bad, the voice acting is cheesy and some of the skills are literally useless (I'm looking at you UNHORSE - there are no enemies on horseback). IF you can look over all this, you soon discover that this gives the game a certain charm. And if you get caught up in that charm, you are in for a treat. In spite of all it's flaws this is a GREAT GAME! The characer development is flexible and fun (when you know which skills are actually useful) The  alchemy and crafting system keeps the game interesting. The world is HUGE, and it seems theres always something new to discover. If you like open world exploration then this game is unsurpassed. So in short, if you care nothing for polish, don't mind cringing at bad voice acting, and only care about having fun then - if can take this game for worts and all - this is your game.			"

												Two Worlds is a tough game. The voice acting, horse-riding and combat at times, is all very♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sometimes they have their moments but most of the time they struggke to reach average. But if you can somehow get past the inital crap then you find a gem.Two Worlds is surprisingly deep, with a intriguing, large  and beautiful world.The armor and weapons that you find start off looking rather dumb but soon you start finding very epic looking swords and axes, awesome spiked plate armor, damn i really liked one set of armor that i kept it for far longer then i should of, making the game harder then it should of been.The crafting system in Two Worlds is very simple, just drag and drop, but i felt it went very well with the style of game and allowd even weaker waepons to stay strong with a little extra effort.Alchemy is done well in the game as well, with you being able to craft many different potions of different effects out of many different ingrediants.And the world, i really enjoyed just exploring the massive world and slaughtering the all bandits and helpless animals i came across.I reccomend Two Worlds but know that many people will not be able to get over its flaws.If realty pump only had a little extra funding or more time or whatever, they could of made a truely epic game.

												This is quite possibly my all time favorite game.  I've now bought it for myself 3 different times (Once on xbox, once in disk form for the PC, and once on steam), and even gifted several copies on Reddit.  It is astoundingly deep, and has some neat stacking mechanics that I thoroughly enjoyed.  However, since I don't want someone reading this review, getting the game and going in blind, I don't want to sugarcoat it.  The first 30 minutes are miserable.  Maybe even the first couple hours.  It has possibly the worst first impression of any game I've ever played.  The animations aren't particularly smooth, giving it a pretty cheap feeling, the graphics aren't great, even for 2009 (though the scale is huge), the voice acting is atrocious, and there are parts of the game that they get incredibly wrong that seem like simple mechanics (Horse Riding and Archery) - and yet, if you give it a few hours, I think it's brilliance shines through, and would hook anyone that likes the genre.There are tons of different environments - You've got your standard medieval knights, forests, swamps, caves and dungeons.  There's a Samurai land with giant starship troopers like bugs.  Creepy cults and necromancy.  Desert nomad lands, and dune like worms.  Cities are massive, and you can go in almost every house, with worthwhile loot in most of them.  You can create permanent stat gain potions to a ridiculous degree allowing anyone that wants to become a demigod to do so.  Finding extra copies of the same spell don't just become useless inventory items, each new copy you find stacks on previous ones making them stronger, in fact you can do the same with items in the game.  You could go around killing the easiest enemies in the game, stacking hundreds of their clubs, and have a decent weapon for a while just from that.  Speaking of items, the sheer amount of them is crazy.  Where there might be 20 unique weapons in Skyrim there are hundreds in this game, and hundreds of armor items as well.  You can look like a samurai warrior, a monk, an evil wizard or a menacing black knight.   I have never found a game like this (even the sequel in my opinion, while fun, pales in comparison), it is really incredible, you just have to struggle through a bit of muck before it will shine, but I can guarantee if you wade through it, it's a game you wont forget.

												Please, play the game for an hour or two before you decide you dont like it! At first because it feels different sometimes you need that short adjustment period, and you will be so glad you did! I Highly recomend this game, possibly my favorite game of all time.I guarentee you have never played a game the has 1/2 the ammount of armor and weapons that this game does, you have about 30 different morning star maces alone... The armor ranges from realistic leather and plate, to fantasticle dragon hunter style armour.The world is so immersive, the shadows of tree leaves blowing in the wind glistening your beautiful plate armour, the birds and the clouds. THE RAIN STORMS  are amazing, the weather system in this game is hands down better than anything out there, you will truly feel as if you are stuck in the pouring rain with lightning striking the trees around you, as they blow and whilt violently in the wind. Truly the way the grass and plants move in the breeze beats any game ever made.The world is beautiful, massive forest landscapes with mountains everywhere, snow to the East, desert to the south east, bamboo forests, lava fields BEAUTIFUL coastlines with fishing villages.The magic is awsome, you can cast while you have a weapon in hand, or use a staff as a propper mage, very creative and When you look at the magic effects and all the lighting upclose you will see the unbelivable detail and beauty, seriously a decade ahead of its time.So many great enemies, from bandits (you get what they have on them, no chance drops) to wolves, Scapulari, Hell warriors and masters, Octagrons, Groms, Orcs, necromancers. So many big baddies like Tulok, Daemons, Cyclops, Stone, Steel Wood, Flesh Golems to name a few.Go onto me steam ?page? and view some of the screen shots, this game is so beautiful, the voice acting is very immersive, and the story is very interesting.

												One could say that for every two things  Two Worlds  did right, there's one thing it did wrong.  In my opinion, it still deserves a positive rating (especially since you can now get it for free on DLH.net), but let's talk about some of the aspects.The in-game world is beautiful; full of interesting locations to visit and a variety of things to do. There is also a simple (""simple"" doesn't equal ""bad"", mind you!) skill tree, so you can choose your play style: an elemental wizard, a Necromancer, a warrior, an archer or even sort of a stealthy ""bandit""... or a mix of them all, just like it should be in every decent RPG.Sadly, there are basically no ""flavor"" dialogue options to go along with your character. You can accept or refuse a quest, you can even choose whom you want to side with on multiple occasions, but you can only do it one way. The developers were reasonable enough to give the Hero a neutral attitude, but the ""role-playing"" part suffers from this. Even if it wouldn't affect the actuall outcome in any way, it'd be good if they gave us more dialogue choices.The questing is fun at first, but as you are nearing the end of the storyline, it becomes a bit dull. There are still many places to explore, but you sort of don't care anymore. The side quests aren't bad, they're just missing that little something, the twist that would keep you interested. As a part of your questing, you can gain or lose reputation with multiple factions. The only real benefit of having the max reputation with the factions, though, is to be able to do their quests and advance in the story (their merchants also give you more money for the things you sell them, but earning money is incredibly easy in the game anyway).Then there's the combat system. You grab a weapon of your choice, distribute some talent points (which you get for doing various stuff thorough the game) and start slaying whomever and whatever needs to be slain. As you eventually grow stronger, you'll start noticing that fighting is terribly repetitive. There are monsters that require absolutely no effort whatsoever to slay, and there are monsters that are still fairly easy to defeat, but can kill you in one or two hits, so you have to kite them. And then there are archers who are insanely annoying to fight if you don't have any range weapon. Luckily, there aren't many of those.The character models,  animations and the voice acting get criticised by almost everyone, but I had no big issues with those.On occasions, the NPCs do sound a bit funny, but it happens even in modern games. It's not as horrendous as people claim it to be.What I did have a big problem with, however, was the lack of any sort of ending. After you have dealt with the bad guy in either of the two possible ways, the game just returns you to the main menu. Just like that. No epilogue, no final cutscene, no further info on the in-game events, not even a glimpse of the Big Bad's (dis)graceful demise... nothing. Huge disappointment!All in all, it feels as if the developers implemented a whole lot of great ideas, but none of them got enough attention to fulfil its potential.  Two Worlds  is still a pretty fine game, really worth your time  if you enjoy RPGs. It's just not as great as it could have been.  "

												After having this game back in the heady days of the Xbox 360 I spotted it on sale and thought I would give it another whirl.I'll start with the bad points:- Combat becomes quickly repetitive- Insane difficulty curve in new areas, but strangely coupled with a resurrection mechanic which removes challenge from the game- Graphics are poor, even for the time period it was produced, gameplay is actually better than the cutscenes!- You will often see several of the same character model in an area- Voice acting is terrible, filled with medieval words such as ""Mayhap, perchance, T'would"" etc, with about 10 different voice actors (""Oblivionitis"")- Main plot is a non-starter for me, I had completely forgotten what it even was after a few hours- Multiplayer is completely broken, don't even bother- Many buildings are just *there* as artwork on the landscapes- Horse combat is lauded up in this game, but riding a horse is about as easy as flying a helicopter when its attempting to lift a merry-go-round with an elephant on one side Phew.Okay, onto the good stuff:- The game world is HUGE- Many towns/settlements in the game, and they actually feel populated with lots of NPCs milling around- There are hundreds of side quests to complete, not just simple fetch or kill quests but lots of different types, including assassinations in which you can double cross the original quest giver- Multiple clans/houses to gain respect with (or gain a bad reputation with)- Probably thousands of armour/clothing combinations- The weapon/armour upgrade system makes alot of sense and is easy to use- Magic system is simple to use yet deep, with power up cards and multiple schools of magic available- The soundtrack isnt half bad either- THE VOICE ACTING IS SO BAD ITS HYSTERICALLY FUNNYI personally really liked TW, as it provides at its heart a good RPG experience and it is trying hard. It does however have a lot of issues, so if you can get it on sale - go for it.			"

I like the portals, really useful.

												This is a ""B-Movie"" game to me.  It's ""so bad, it's good.""  The voice acting IS terrible, but I actually like it.  It's like a group of people trying to do their version of an old English accent.  And let's be honest, this game is basically trying to be Elder Scrolls, at least Oblivion.The controls are a little tough to figure out at first, but back when I first played it and finally figured everything out, I had a tough time putting it down (XBox360).  Don't expect too much.  It's a fun open-world romp into the B-Version of Oblivion with delightfully terrible voice acting and fun combat.  Don't buy it at full price, and have fun!			"

												Probably the most underrated RPG ever made.When Two Worlds was released with claims that it was bigger and better than Oblivion, this didn't help when it was revealed to be a glitchy mess. By the time the game was fixed and made playable, it was too late. Two Worlds had been slated and ignored, the sad thing is that the game was an amazing rpg which had simply fell victim to a terrible launch.seriuously get this game!! the voice acting is ye Olde English, the graphics are dated by now, but as a game and rpg it's bloody fantastic! Two Worlds seems to have a cult following made up of those who either patiently played the game until after it was fixed or bought it years after release, it deserves more recognition :) "

												This game really is a Diamond in the rough or perhaps it's a rough surrounded by Diamonds, at any rate this game is great fun and a giant step away from your typical RPG experience. It wreaks of originality and has a style of it's own and isn't afraid to flaunt it.  This game caught a lot of flak due to how it strives for originality in it's own obscure way. People complained about the voice acting, but really, I feel these people just struggled to digest an approach totally foreign and new to the genre and this conflicted with their usual expectations of what an RPG should be, but Two worlds broke the mold and I can appreciate that. The style, characters and atmosphere in Antaloor gives you an immediate feeling of a strange yet authentic medieval culture. People talk strangely to one another, but the more time you spend in Antaloor, the less strange it becomes and begins to feel genuine and relatable. Sure there are some awkward dialogues and the VA can be a little hit-and-miss, but overall it's laden with intrinsic value and thoroughly enjoyable.  Even the combat is strange, strangely enjoyable though. Combat feels impactful and organic, albeit a little clunky. There's a good balance of combat techniques you can use, with a good mix of Archery, Melee and magic. Archery mechanics are done quite well and you'll often find yourself trying to snipe tough enemies or pull them towards you in a more orchestrated attack.  But one of the more interesting aspects of Two worlds, at least to me, is how gear actually stacks! Essentially, instead of finding one rare or unique armor or weapon, you are able to find multiples of the same type and combine it into your original piece making it's stats ever more powerful Muahahahahah! So once you've found something nice, it quickly becomes an obsession to track down more items of the same type- but don't be fooled! It must be the exact same ""breed"" of item. You will find many different versions of items but to ""stack"" they need to be of the same family, i think this is reflected by a number as well as the aesthetic of the item.  Lastly, this game is a loot-♥♥♥♥♥'s wet dream. You'll be constantly on the hunt for more items to help you grow in power, but as discussed above. not in the traditional way and you'll also be on the hunt for a Steed capable of hauling your massive collection of weapons and armors around and spend countless hours deciding which stuff to keep and which to sell. Speaking of selling, this game is also a Merchants wet dream and I surprised myself at how much time I spent traveling to strange new towns with a glimmer of hope in my eye that the traders there would have yet another piece I could stack together. There's probably a lot more I could say about this game, but that could take all day and I want to play games! It also probably goes without saying that my Steam hours played does not represent my actual play time in this game. Two worlds is a bit rough around the edges, but there's more than enough goodness to compensate. Good for at least a few hundred hours, I recommend it!			"

												I once asked an online forum whether Two Worlds was any good.  Among the sea of negative responses was a single positive vote for the game.  I asked that one person why he or she liked the game and the response was, ""I don't know, I just love the open-worldiness of the game.""Open-worldiness is an apt description of Two World's major strength.  After a quick and painless tutorial you are given a couple quests and off you go.  The world is yours to explore.  If you like games like this, then you may like Two Worlds too.The major negative about this game is, in spite of the huge world, there just isn't a lot to explore.  Compared to a game like Elder Scrolls Oblivion with quests and dungeons around every corner, Two Worlds feels like Oblivion on a stringent budget.  You'll often run into the same creatures and bandits.  These creatures are challenging at first, but terribly easy to beat in later levels.  By the time you cross a certain place in the map to face more challenging creatures, you've already progressed to the point where those are easy to beat.Dungeons are few and not very memorable.  Worse yet, there doesn't seem to be a point to them.  The joy you get from getting to the end of a long dungeon and getting that memorable item you wanted is not present in this game.  They seem more like an afterthought.  A couple of corridors filled with the same enemies who mostly run straight at you swinging once  you are spotted.Combat in general is lackluster, your most used ability is jumping backwards to dodge swings.  Once you've learned this skill, melee combat becomes a breeze and your only difficulty comes from the occasional archers and mages.  I once took down a Cyclops, one of the largest and toughest enemies in the game, simply by jumping backwards and getting a hit or two in before he could swing again.  A single hit would have killed me but I was still able to defeat it.  If you come to Two Worlds looking for tough combat, you're not going to find it.I do enjoy the armor ""crafting"" and upgrading.  Simply find an identical piece of armor, drop it over your existing armor and you have a stronger piece or armor.  The same can be done with weapons.  Skill upgrades are plenty with skills ranging from five classes of magic (earth, air, fire, water, necromancy) to specialize in to multiple weapons, armor, and archery skills and buffs.  You are not forced into any one class so you may mix and match as you choose, a nice feature of the game.  Tip: Lockpicking is a must as nearly every valuable item is hidden away in a locked chest.Alchemy, on the other hand, is a complete mess and does not work they way it is instructed in the manual.  For all the plants and minerals you collect in your travels, each labeled with a specific buff or permanent upgrade, they don't provide much use unless you have maxed the alchemy skill.  Personally, I kept the items that gave permanent upgrades and never used the rest.  Tip:  You MUST include a health or mana potion when combining minerals or you will not get the upgrades you want.In short, this may be a game you'll enjoy if you like the freedom to explore and upgrade your skills to suit the fighting style you enjoy.  Just expect to get bored of the combat and the limited content before the story ends. - - -Edit:  A warning.  This game requires registration of a CD key Steam provides you in order to work.  Fortunately, the servers are still online and they provide you with a nice piece of gear for doing so.  Not bad for a seven year old game.  (Hear that EA?!?!)  Also, this game uses an old version of PhysX drivers that the latest drivers do not support.  Nvidia card users need to download and install the old drivers from this website in order to get the game to work: http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.12.1031-legacy-driver.html "

												I had the opportunity to play this game when it came out,  sadly  I had a hard time with it. It was difficult and I decided to stop playing it, however I always wished to finish it. Now I got it again for a ridiculous low  price, and even that the game has very weird and sometimes annoying controls (Yes I am talking to you, horse!!). I can say I am enjoying it now. I still have very little game time, but compared with the first time I played it,  now I really feel I am making progress! What I can say, is that if you have the patience to overlook the flaws of this game and withstand  the voice acting of the cleaning staff of Reality Pump :) , you will find a very entertaining experience in this role-playing game.

Do you like tearing undead monster, wild creatures, or bandits limb from limb using a big two handed sword or even elemental magic like a firey EXPLOSION!?! F@#% YEAH, who doesn't? Well this game has it, set the enemy ablaze with pyromancy or maybe just smash them with your fists. Ah, if only they had Torgue weapons... Anyways I got to go, I invited Tiny Tina over to play Two Worlds and she should be here soon.

												I've been playing Two Worlds for the better part of 40 hours and I am loving it!  It's not Skyrim, DragonAge, or The Witcher, but I'm finding it to be a deeply interesting and fun RPG to play.  It has a well developed world full of warring factions, magic, skills, and horse back riding.  I actually like the horse back riding better in Two Worlds than in Skyrim (IMHO).  The questing in my mind is what is the most fun in this game.  Two Worlds is loaded with cities, caves, dungeons, and quests to complete.  This is not an expensive game and I've seen it goes as low as 1.49.  This game has issues and some very quirky dialogue, but I still recommend it.  I could have finished the main quest 15 hours ago, but I'm having too much fun with the side quests.  I've seen a lot of bad reviews for this game and I can understand some of the complaints, but I find this game so much fun and the quirks and bugs just simply don't bother me.  ""Lovely weather"" said the hero as he stormed through the rain shower that just popped up.  Love It!			"

												I just finished the game and all in all, it was pretty good. The fighting mechanics are a bit clunky but still enjoyable. The storyline and quests are good and keep you interested. The worst part is probably getting used to the game mechanics and fighting style (due to the lack of any tutorial), but once you get it, the game is great from there on. I'd definitely recommend any RPG lover to try this game.			"

												This is an interesting game to say the least. At first it is bad, but somehow you can like it after a while. While many things are bad about it, I can't come to hate it. Maybe it's just my love for generic/crappy RPG's.The story itself is underwhelming, and actually will have you do more sidequests then actual main missions. But when it comes the the sidequests, they are surprisingly great. I swear you could take out the main story, work on the sidequests, and make the game about a mercenary making profit off the Orc war. Almost all my playtime was on sidequests, which get surprisingly in-depth, though not as much as I would have liked.As you level up, you will find that there isn't a great host of enemy types, and at some point you will have gotten the best gear there is. Though through those levels untill you reach the end, it really makes it interesting and fun.There are also certain events in-game that are great (Such as a certain event that happens when you do a certain something in a certain city).Overall when on sale you should buy it and give it a try. I got it for around 2$ or less.*Edit: The main story isn't nearly why you should buy the game compared to the sidequests. It has noticeably less work then all the other quests, and can be completed in 60 minutes about if you just explored and did most of the quests on your owm.Not to spoil anything, but the ending is very lacking.

												The game is a classic. Absolute trash, but a classic.If you're even looking into acquiring this game, then you already know what you're getting yourself into. It's glitchy. It's ugly. It's bogged down, and unrefined, and somehow perfect. It is NOT a good game -- not by any measure -- but it is a supremely unique, memorable experience.Everything is so poorly crafted that not a single moment is dull. You will never cease to be surprised by all the little bits of awfulness tucked throughout the world of ""Antaloor"". Everything from the clownish bear animations to the random-guy-off-the-street voice acting will keep you grinning from beginning to whenever you get bored and shut it off.			"

You have to choose factions which will eliminate some quests, so there is plenty of reason to play to completion more than once.			"

												Two worlds is unique game because you'll hate it and love it the same time but after first hour you would't dare to stop before finishing it. Two worlds has many problems from unstable frame rate and game not launching to horrible horse riding and even worse mounted combat. There are not nearly enough tutorials and you'll end up checking forums every now and then. Combat can be bit difficult at first but after you'll get used to it and learn to use ""Q"" button to dodge at the right time it will be almost too easy, almost. Alchemy is extremely well done and magic is better than some games, but offers 5 schools of magic whit each unique spells, but still each having similar basic spells so you don't have to learn everyone to get attack, defense and summoning spells but should if you're playing as a mage.What makes fighting difficult sometimes is that two worlds allows a lot of enemies at once, for instance in the orc capital you might have to face 50+ enemies at once, while they're fighting each other too. Story is not the best but the quests are unique and not repetitive as well as bountiful. Enemies offer wide range of fighting styles and some variation between same enemy types, for instance wolf will fight differently than zombie and bandit archer will fight differently than bandit mage. Overall I'll recommend Two Worlds as it will give you 30+ hours of gameplay, but only if you like open world games and are a fan of RPGs and can look over some unpolished bits in favor of overall experience.

												Horse Collecting Simulator 2016.The reason I love this game is not because of the randomized loot, the procedural magic system, or even the entirely way-too-large map full of hundreds of secrets to explore and discover. No, the reason I love this game is because of the horse collection aspect. I now run a horse barn full of about 8 horses. I have all the different types such as blackie, goldie, whitey, skelly, and scaley. When I found my first horse I was ""oh cool a hores"" then I drove the horse back home. Now a single day isn't complete without going in search of a horse to rescue from the tiny fists of an mini orc boss. Now I spend most of my in-game time tending to my horses, making sure they have enough feed, bringing them inside when it gets cold outside. What can I say, It's my life now. I love my horses.10/10			"

												A great game, very underrated. In many respects similar to an Elder Scrolls game with the same freedom of movement, collecting alchemy ingredients, running around doing quests, and the same sense towards the end of the game that you can destroy everything with ease.Enemies tend to be in either groups of average strength or single or pairs of overwhelming strong enemies. They have to be managed differently, and archery is actually very usefull especialy when facing large number of archers who can disarm you and do decent levels of damage.The first 30 minutes of the game is a grind but get past that and the game becomes very enjoyable.One of the really enjoyable things about the game is that the guards of towns are no stronger than they should be. So if you are able to take down a cyclops or slay a dragon you don't get the sillyness of guards being able to bash you up. In fact if you want you can rampage through the world slaying everyone and reserecting people afterwards. It's slightly over the top but it really adds to the enjoyment.			"

												Back in 2006, Elder Scrolls: Oblivion was the most popular open-world RPG, but a year later, Two Worlds was released, and the RPG fans wonder how much batter it would be.Well, 8 years have passed and Two Worlds remains forever in Oblivion’s shadow. Above all negative towers this Reality Pump release, the story-line gets the worst part. Not-so-epic, and somehow basic, we take the role of a traveller searching for his sister who is mysteriously kidnaped. After being approached by a strange man who leads us to the main quest, we start our journey only to realise the side-quests are actually more interesting. Despise all the shortness, the main-quest encourages the player to explorer the kingdom, complete site-quests, gain reputation among the several available factions, choose a side among the war against the orcs, and discover new areas.Much like Gothic series, this action RPG gives you the freedom to explore the world as you want, with an amazing combat system that puts you to the test by fighting bandits, goblins, wild animals, Cyclops, and many other creatures we are used to encounter in this genres. Getting yourself in the wrong side of the map might lead you to difficult enemies, but with great rewards worth the trouble.Two Worlds offers a simple and interesting system where the player can create new items by cooking all sort of organic and magic objects. Mixing up till 5, the result may be different each time you tweak with the items, but you get to keep all the recipes for future use. New potions with a lot of different results are the most common, this will certainly make the game a lot easier, since harvesting items can be done pretty much everywhere. You can’t craft new weapons, but you can upgrade them, and that’s good enough. There’s plenty to choose from the vast variety of armour-sets, swords, staffs, and many more powerful objects to kill all those evil Golems!The player also relies on magic, and for that the levelling up is great, choose among the 5 elements, and advance your combat skills and how well you manoeuvre your weapons.Although the gameplay is flawless and the graphics try to keep with it, the major problem falls upon the text-dialogue. NPC are just repetitive, in both appearance and dialogues, and that’s really a shame, because some actually tell you interesting things about the world of Two Worlds. It’s a big map, but very repetitive, even with snow, desert and deep forests, the game lacks on dungeons with only a handful of them to complete and loot. Small huts and villages with hidden secrets might be your salvation after a long walk throughout the world. With great emphasis on side-quests, your journey won’t be a waste of time, and in time you may learn to enjoy it.One of those games where you love it or hate it. Can’t go medium with this one, it’s made for RPG fans. Unless you are one, stay way.Could be batter, but could be a lot worst considering all things! 6/10.			"

Huge and open world, climatic changes ( rain ), diverse landscapes,  day and night cycle and more...At the beginnin I really enjoyed this game, but after 20~30 hours, this game started to be boring, because this game a little reminds an MMORPG game cuz we have a lot of side quests and a quite poor main plot ( I got a main quest at 7th lvl and i complieted it when i had sixty level... so ) Special defect in this game is horse riding cuz controling horse is absolutely repulsive. But Two World have a lot of pluses: good graphic and gameplay, a fantastic combat animation and different opponents. So ending, I really recommend TW everyone who keen on RPG, maybe this game isn't AAA class but definitely worth to play. Final verdict 7/10			"

												The first hour of playing this game leaves you with a poor sensation of what it is. When you have gone beyond that point, it's actually really enjoyable.The old-fashioned graphics, the dozens of exploits and odd characters gives the game a nice atmosphere.The crafting and magic aspect is great once you get into it.You can freely choose how the story will unfold and often you get the choice to continue helping certain NPC's or kill/betray them to help others instead.The item and loot system is decent, but the ability to stack armor and weapons to improve the gear and save space is really brilliant. The fights can be somewhat clunky at times with certain skills/weapon combinations, although it can easily be avoided.The horse-mechanics are annoying, but they have other uses besides transportation.Quest can sometimes be rather vague in describtion, but compared to how easy they usually are these days, it can be a nice change of pace for some.*Watch out for the random spider spawns in Cathalon, they are terrifying.

												If you like an old school RPG that lets you steal with impunity; upgrade your gear; collect and quest in an open world - then you could probably forgive the dated graphics and voice acting.I could not find much to dislike about this game. I experienced only a couple of bugs, easily overcome with setting the auto-save timer and regular saves. Even the voice acting grew on me after a time and I started to wonder if it was deliberately done to be humorous.It is very easy to overpower yourself very early on in the game using alchemy, which you may wish to avoid if you want to get many more hours out of it.

												This is like the video game version of a B-movie.  Is it a good game?  No.  Did I still have fun with it?  Yes.  It’s a classic case of “so bad it’s good”.This game gets almost everything wrong.  From the horribly written dialogue, to the terrible voice acting, and even the almost unplayable combat, this game is hard to love.  It can also be unclear what you have to do sometimes, but luckily there’s a good number of guides for this game online.  Really the only thing I thought this game did well was the magic system.  There’s plenty of spells and they’re all really diverse.  Between shooting projectiles, giving yourself buffs and the enemy debuffs, and summoning creatures to help you fight, magic is definitely the funniest combat system to play with.Considering I bought this game for about $1 USD, I would say that it was well worth the price.  If you can wait for a sale and pick this up, and forgive its flaws, you can absolutely have some fun with this game. "

												I'll probably complete this review when I'll complete it, but since I noticed it's on sale at 90% off (0.99€ here) and I just started playing it, I just wanted to give it my thumbs up with a quick review after about 23 hours of game time.I was very dubious if to waste my time on this since the mixed reviews, but I'm happy that I didn't listen.You're not always ready for some game that will take your life away for months or years to come, so if you still want to play a relatively modern and open-world RPG without the need to take weeks to learn how things work and how to craft stuff, this might just be the game for you.There's plenty of items in this game, and you can choose your own path into anything (warrior, mage and so on) upgrade after upgrade, to shape your character into what you want without having to decide that at the start of the game, but without becoming too complicated. Sure, the game don't tell you basically anything about how anything works, but you can always read the pdf manual that Steam gives you and find all the details there, but anyway, after just 1.5 hours I already was going through the menus without problems and without ever reading the manual.There's stuff you'll learn with practice or by trial and error, but if you don't want to read that pdf you can consider it like an adventure in the adventure :)One very useful thing that the game don't tell you (or I didn't notice) is that you can merge 2 identical items into a better one by just drag and dropping one onto the other one, while in your inventory. That way you can improve your current equipment for free, without the need to buy a better one.Now I just hope I won't hit that quest bug that another user experienced, that seem to happen because some side-quests can break the main quest if done before it, but I'm trying to not let the main quest behind too much and I hope that'll be enough.

												This game is an underrated gem, I recommend it highly to any fan of open-world RPGs. It's biggest hurdle is just its first impression. The character creation is a joke, the cut-scenes & voice-acting are hammy, the controls and menu navigation a bit unintuitive, initially.However, give this game an hour or two to grow on you, and you will find a vastly underrated, very free, open-world fantasy RPG that will give you hundreds of hours of enjoyment. The loot is vast and randomly generated (and items are stackable, which means looting never gets entirely old); the levelling is well-paced and addictive; the scope of abilities interesting to experiment with (archery, traps, magic, various combat techniques, etc.)  The alchemy/crystal system is very interesting as well, though you might want to download a strategy guide to get the most out of it.Combat and enemy AI are weak and relatively easy to exploit, but that didn't bother me much -- I just view the game as more of a Diablo-esque, loot-driven kind of experience, vs. a game built around challenging/nuanced combat. And although the story and voice-acting initially seem awful, the cheesiness of it becomes a part of the charm, and the protagonist is often actually very funny. He becomes strangely good company as you go roaming the world by yourself. Visually, the game holds up exceptionally well, if you have a good graphics card. I don't know if the graphics were revamped for the epic edition, but at times the game looks on a par with a high-end Skyrim, and the world can be quite beautiful. There is also a ton of detail in the armor, weapons, etc. I've also had no problems with bugs/crashes or anything like that, with the Epic Edition. Also a plus: the world is absolutely *huge*. I am certain it is much bigger than any recent Bethesda games by far, and the environments are quite varied once you get out a bit.In short, this is a game that got -- to my mind -- unfairly passed over when it was released. It does have its quirks and doesn't make a great first impression when you start up, but I can honestly say I've had as much fun with this game as any other open-world RPG you can name, and like it as well -- if not better -- than Skyrim. They're just different. At anything <$20 -- let alone the 2.99 or so you often see it for -- it is an absolute steal. Highly recommended.			"

												A solid RPG with many features. Very playable. Even re-playable. Especially like:- Seamless nature of the world. Very few load-screens. Even entering towns and homes is seamless. This is how it should be!- Variety of quests and goals, mostly optional.- Engaging skill choices.Quibbles. Not really ""dislike"" but ""somewhat annoying""- Times when the merchants are wandering around randomly. Finding the same merchant again is a pain.- Horses steer like they're brain-damaged. Sometimes will veeer off to one side and suddenly you can't steer anymore.- Horses again. You can't ride down a hill, but you can get off the horse and call it down the hill. WTF?- Some of the quests are incredibly obtuse, relying more on luck and happenstance than on deliberate planning.Major bugs:- The crashing. Especially after saving a few times, it'll just crash on my system. No response from either Steam or the ""official"" game support.- The dialog. Only looking at some videos did I realize there was supposed to be dialog! Totally not working on my system. I only get the text, but everyone is silent.Definitely worth the buy. Now if I could just convince Steam to let me have the Strategy Guide I paid for. It's DLC, but it refuses to install. I'm guessing it's a Steam issue, but they keep passing the buck to the publisher, who has no control over Steam.			"

												I remember when this game first came out, the box had a splash art announcing Two Worlds as the ""Oblivion Killer."" If by that the devs meant make the player never want to play a fantasy rpg again, then they succeeded. the cons far outweigh the pros for this too ambitious title.Pros:1: Neat lore elements that obviously had at least some creative thought put into them.2: Fully voiced.3: Some humorous side characters.4: Large explorable map.5: Fully illustrated strategy guide, should you make the extra purchase.Cons:1: Strange registration setup that requires exiting the game upon starting the game.2: Unimaginative and uniteresting storyline.3: All of the voices are terrible. Like really, really bad.4: Bland and annoying main character. Most of the supporting characters are this way as well.5: The map barely resembles the actual terrain, and a vast portion of the landscape is nearly impossible to traverse.6: Many areas of the game look unfinshed, with random invisible walls, inescapable holes in the ground, etc.7: Stupidly easy, if you are even the slightest bit versed in building characters or can do 3rd grade math. (Normally, I like easy games, but this was too much even for me.)8: The most repetative gameplay you will ever experience from a game that is not on mobile. Exploring, questing, fighting, all of it.9: One of the most atrocious set of game mechanics I have ever experienced. Fighting monsters was silmultaniously a bore and a chore.I could probably go on with the cons of this game, but I think I covered the main points. So if you are willing to push through hours of horrible gameplay for a semi-funny joke every now and then, by all means by this game. If not, do not. With 225 hours in this game, I am probably one of the leading authorities on Two Worlds now; and my recommendation is to never touch this game.			"

												So I picked this game up for $1, managed that with a voucher that had it at 90% off, its not a bad game, it has alot of bad reviews despite the gameplay itself. I think the biggest problem for this game itself is theres alot better RPG's on the market. If you can see past, old english language text and not many voice actors, and a bad battle system you will enjoy Two Worlds. I gave it a 6 outta 10, personally you would be better off playing Skyrim really!			"

												One of my best memory in rpg gaming has to be Morrowind and how I ""broke"" the game to become an almighty flying God who could destroy an entire city with a single spell.Two worlds won't let you do that but it's the kind of game that is so imbalanced that you can become an invincible killing-machine.I like that they won't limit you, RPGs which try to balance their world with abstract rules have it wrong, Two Worlds and Morrowind made it great!Yes the story is boring, the characters are stale and the voice acting ridiculous but you can break it and that is worth gold!

												It's actually a very good game unlike what people says about it.It does lacks in content, it doesn't have the biggest map ever, it doesn't have a lot of creatures, animals, spells and items.But it is a good game, the gameplay is all right, nothing great, nothing bad, it is really, really easy though, you can dodge every attacks so easily but it's good anyway, when it comes to blocking, it's the same as in Morrowind.If you love either The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion or even Gothic, you'll probably like this game, it's not as great, but it's good, the World is pretty similar, without the Hellish stuff that Oblivion has though.Note that Gothic is way more challenging than this game, this one is actually pretty easy but it's a fun game anyway.It's also cheaper, so there's that.Hopefully that we'll see Two Worlds III, which will be at least 4x bigger than the world map in Two Worlds II, with many new creatures and items, and a way better gameplay.Honestly, I don't think this game deserves 65, but at the same time, it's coming from Metacritic, a bunch of good at nothing who knows nothing so their opinion doesn't really matters, the same could be said about IGN and many more, anyway, it's better to make an opinion of something by yourself than by someone else.In my opinion it deserves 7.5/10, It's far away to be perfect, but it's a really great game considering its low price.

												This turned out to be a surprisingly modern and well designed game and I though I haven't yet played it for as long as some others, I've had a lot of fun exploring and discovering what this game has to offer. In today's MMORPG landscape, particularly post-WoW, most of these types of games tend to be very similar and it's easy to forget that there are MMORPGs like Two Worlds II, The Secret World etc, which, while not as flashy and refined as the mainstream games, offer their own flavour and ultimately a fuller experience.Two Worlds II has a far more lively world than other games I've played and excels at building an interactive world, particularly after the slow early introduction story, and despite a less than perfect spell system and less shiny graphics, it's a fun game to experience that makes you feel a part of the world, something that's often amiss from modern titles.

												This game is like Gothic 3 - 3rd person fantasy RPG with action combat, but controls are much arcade. This is crossower between gothic 3 and hack and slash game, steals elements from many games, but is highly rewarding. If you find item of the same type you can make one piece with better parameters. Spell system is interesting - you have cards with spells and booster cards and can have only 3 spells active at once but they are realy powerfull. One thing I did not like is some main quest item taken before story leads you to it leads to skip of final animation, but I enjoyed gameplay and that is what games are about. I will play this game in future for sure again			"

												Two Worlds doesn't have the amount of exploration and interesting content as the Elder Scrolls: Oblivion does, but it certainly has its own unique charm. Two Worlds captures that old RPG feel that seems lost in the games of our current generation, it felt very akin to playing the original Ever Quest. From the start of multiplayer mode, you'll be getting your♥♥♥♥♥♥handed to you on a silver platter over and over and over again, and the enemies will promptly give you more beatings. There's challenge to be had here, but it doesn't add much to the genre overall. I've heard that through the later levels you have a lot more freedom to customize your character, but I didn't see much through the miniscule time that I played. It was just basic kill X target or gather X item, not much innovation. The lower level multiplayer enviroments don't look very interesting, and I imagine it would be a bore to trudge through without a friend by your side. Within the multiplayer component, the quest rewards were very underwhelming. In the map that I played, all I gained from completing them was gold, gold, and more gold. Where are the unique items, you might ask? They're sold by NPCs, or sometimes found on corpses, or within treasure chests. If you bore easily, this isn't the game for you. I wouldn't recommend playing multiplayer without a friend, my friend and I only saw five other people playing at the same time. I can't speak for the singleplayer content as I haven't played it, but I imagine it's more or less the same. The story and voice acting are also terrible, so I wouldn't purchase the game if you're looking for that. You should also know that there are some nasty bugs that come along with this game, after several hours of playing multiplayer, I abruptly crashed and lost all of my progress. So be wary of the multiplayer aspect of the game, you could unexpectedly lose all of your progress, and there is no fix for this that I know of. tl;dr Two Worlds brings back the old school feel, but it doesn't measure up to other games released in its time period. If you're looking for a great RPG experience, I'd recommend Oblivion or Dragon Age: Origins. 4/10. It's an average and bland game, but that's part of its charm.  "

												Ok, I just bought the game on steam for $1 as the epic edition (on sake at 80%) apparently after having been patched to hell and back and...you know what? It's not horrible. I get that that it's long past the redemption area now but it's actually quite playable and compared to the 360 version, there is no frame-rate issue...and I'm playing this on an Ideapad with integrated graphics. Yes combat is a bit loose and awkward but it is doable and the story and dialogue aren't that bad. Exploration is huge and vast. Respawning is a nice change of pace from some RPGs I've played. Is it Oblivion or better than? No. Is it now a competent RPG on its own? Yes, actually. I paid a buck and...I got a lot more than my money's worth.﻿			"

												I have played this game years ago. It was one of, if not THE first solid RPG experience I've had. I loved it from the first day, and to this day, I still love it. The world is immersive, and MASSIVE, you can never say you've explored it all. I remember challenging myself to explore EVERY SINGLE dungeon in the world, and I yet didn't finish that. Unfortunately, I lost the game CD, but now that I bought it again on Steam, it's time to play! Yes, the story, the dialogue may be cheesy, you might encounter funny bugs, although I know they've fixed most of them, but there are so many things that you can see and do that you can easily cast aside all the negative and just enjoy it. Now excuse me, I have quests to do, dungeons to explore and monsters to slay! I totally recommend this game to anyone willing to have fun!			"

												TLDR: Two Worlds is The Room of RPGs. It's somehow both bad and fun at the same time.Lets get this out of the way: this is a trashy Eastern European RPG. The generic plot is written in bad ye olde englishe and spoken by the worst non-native speakers this side of House of the Dead. It will actively try to disuade you from paying attention to the plot, and yet IT WON'T SHUT UP. Hoods breath, does this game have diarrhea of the mouth. And yet, it's really enjoyable for the cheap RPG it is. Once you realize that all weapons attack at the same speed and dodging instantly makes you immune to damage, you can cheese the game like a boss. Oh, and when you die, you just respawn at the nearest health shrine, no xp loss or anything. Still not as great as other European RPGs like Gothic or Risen, but it's not the hellspawn that it has the reputation for. Then again, I really enjoy terrible movies, so I guess I just have trashy taste.			"

I've liked this game since it came out and it is a ton of fun with friends. A buy for those of you looking for something to do with friends, just make sure you can get past the lag issues. Also don't count on this game going on sale because it most likely won't.			"

												Some people seem to genuinely enjoy this game.  That caught me off-guard.In 2007, I'd heard all the hype about this being the next great RPG.  Just coming off Oblivion (which I'd played obsessively), I was so excited for Two Worlds!Well, I played it about 30 minutes, was horrendously disappointed, laughed at it a bit, and gave up.  It's very pretty.  That's about all I have to say about it.Recently, seeing all the positive (??) reviews for the game, I grabbed it for $2.  Well, I wish I had my money back.  I gave it another try.  If there is redeeming value in this game, I can't find it.  The combat is awful, it's buggy, the dialog is laughable...Two Worlds II, on the other hand, is actually underrated.  It's a lot of fun.  That's another reason I gave this game a second shot.  The sequel is so much fun, despite not exactly being brilliant, so maybe I missed something in the original?Well, again, if I'm missing something, I can't find it.  I have a pretty high tolerance for crappy RPGs, but I can't tolerate this one.			"

												Two Worlds is one of those games that is so bad that it ends up being a little good. Although it is impossible to take seriously, the game can actually be quite absorbing once you get into the swing of it. The game has aged quite poorly, and even getting it to run properly can be a nightmare. One you get it to run properly, you may be faced with constant crashes, although I have not had these issues. That being said, the game actually runs somewhat well on the PC, which is a nice contrast to the 360 port, where the game runs under 30 FPS at almost all times. On both PC and 360, the game often lags hard when you kill someone or when you level up as you kill someone. This sometimes makes a very damaging blow quite satisifying, but most of the time it's just annoying.Moving on from the technical side of this game, we need to take a quick stop to look at the story and voice acting. The story is quite generic. Some evil dudes kidnap your sister and you need to get her back. The voice acting, on the other hand, is anything but generic. This game has the worst voice acting I have ever heard in a major title. Even the protagonist's voice acting is terrible, with laughably bad writing to boot. The voice acting and story go hand-in-hand to make a hilariously bad story experience that you can't help but laugh at when playing the game.Before we take a look at gameplay, I want to touch on graphics. The graphics, specifically the face rendering, are simply bad for the time that this game was produced. By contrast, many of the environments look quite nice. It feels like the artists really put some effort into this part of the game. Graphics almost never make or break a game, but I wanted to touch on it.Now for the gameplay and replayability. The gameplay in the game is quite repetitive, but something about it is addictive. You often adopt the same strategies to kill many enemies, but actually figuring out what those strategies are can be quite fun. For example, I found that a mixture of critical strike, defensive combat, and traps allowed me to easily tackle any enemy. However, experimenting with other paths can be quite fun as well, which is where the game's replayability comes in. Although I found that the critical strike build was simply the best build, I did have fun experimenting with an amplification nuke mage for a bit. Sadly, the mana costs were too prohibitive, but experimentation like this is what helps keep the game fresh.Although some have complained about the game's difficulty curve rising too quickly, it is likely that those same people missed many of the essential side quests that allow you to level your character and tackle larger enemies.  For example, if you skip the first major city (Tharbakin), you will fall behind drastically in levels. Just like in other RPGs, if you tackle the main quest first, you will pay dearly. The general rule for gameplay difficulty in this game is as follows: the further south you go, the harder the game gets, and when you cross the river, the game gets significantly harder.The gameplay is where the game redeems itself and comes into its own. Somehow, this gimmicky gameplay where you find the best way to abuse the game's skill and combat system is quite addicting, and you often find yourself playing for hours at a time to see just how badly you can abuse the game. Through my strategy of mixing critical chance, critical strike, and defensive combat, I was able to build a character that would crit on virtually every attack for 250% damage, quickly disposing of my foes. For any bigger characters, I would abuse the game's traps and bad enemy pathing and walk the enemies into the traps before I unleashed on them with critical strikes. Attempting to abuse the game in different ways allows for many hours of replayabilty.Before wrapping up the review, I want to quickly address the Xbox 360 port of this game. When I first played this game, I played it on an Xbox 360, and that experience shaped my opinion of the game quite negatively. The game lags quite extensively, and the combat system is significantly worse because the controls are just horendous. Lastly, for some inexplicable reason, critical strikes are broken on console. You cannot crit people. This means that killing even modest enemies requires you to have many traps and bombs and patiently kill them. This drawback is very large and detracts heavily from the gameplay experience on console. I would recommend at least looking at the PC port if you played the 360 version and did not enjoy it.This game, despite its big flaws, actually ends up being a mediocre but very addictive fantasy RPG. I would never even pretend that it could compete with games like Oblivion, but something about it is quite addictive and can leave you playing it for hours on end as you try to find the best way to cheese the game and abuse the combat systems. I would never dream of paying $60 for this game, but I would recommend it at $5 or below. It is worth it just for the hilariously bad story and voice acting at $5, and if you enjoy it, you will actually get quite a bit of value out of it as you can easily end up sinking 50+ hours into this game.

												Regardless of it's flaw's and imperfections IDC it's the only working rpg-like mmo on the market that allows for you and another to explore a open world. It's crashing issues and bag lag can all be fixed :). I will rate this game 8/10 considering turning it from unplayable to playable single player and multiplayer is a patch and allowing for >2gb address spaces in the exe file and Compatibility - Windows xp service pack 2. Anims are bad voice is bad dialogues are bad really!!. So the ♥♥♥♥ what. Give the game a break it's old. Do yourself a favor and buy it apply the fixes and you wont regret your purchase id still pay 10 bucks for this game if i had to buy it again. And besides i need a community to play the game with :).			"

												Do you like the thrill of the chase?  Searching forests for rare animals, such as The Dodo, and then, when you finally find your prey; Notching an arrow and killing it with a feat of skillful dexterity, Or perhaps stealthily sneaking up to kill it with a single thrust of a dagger; in order to get a . . . solitary feather?  Ok, what about skipping along a beach in full armour, ocassionally whistling for a horse?  You could do that instead if you like.Fight a bear, an orc, an ogre, a cyclops, sometimes all at the same time. (To be honest I've never fought a bear, an orc, an ogre and a cyclops at the same time. Though I have fought a lot of orcs, several ogres, a few stone golems, at the same time; I'm pretty sure there was a cyclops there too) Dragons, they're about too.T'is a good game. Worth a go if you're into large world RPGs.			"

												Ah, the original Two Worlds. Often considered a flop and a bad game, I can safely say this is one of my favourite games and it will always have a place in my top 100 video games of all time. Why?I don't think it's worth my time or anyone else's time to start arguing about the quality of the game itself. As many others have pointed out, this game does have its flaws. Plenty of things could have been done better and it does indeed fall short in many aspects. However, the whole package is simply amazing for multiple reasons.I've always had a soft spot for a simple and barren world in a video game. It's not barren in the same sense as Fallout 3's world: actually quite the opposite. In Fallout 3, the world is simply ""dead"" but it has a lot of things going on. In this game, the world is actually quite beautiful but it lacks, well, the meat. There's not much in it.For some reason Two Worlds feels like it's actually a much better game than most people think it is. I have my problems with the voice acting and a lot of other things but the experience is something you can't get out of any other game. Maybe it's because the game reminds me of an MMO of days past but something in this game just draws me back in again and again. I've beaten it before Steam as well.			"

Drink every time you finish a quest, but it breaks so the marker never goes away or can't be completed.  Drink every 10th time you kill some type of WolfDrink every time the Hero spots an enemy animal creature and refers to it as ""bandits!"" Every time you complete a faction quest and have no idea which faction it was stand up and spin 5 times.  Take 2 drinks each time the main story is advanced.			"

												I reviewed this a while back with as a joke but today i came onto steam only to it as the newest released game, I have no idea why this is considered new but what the hell it gives me the chance to review this horrible mess again.Two Worlds is a western rpg that plays, sounds and looks like crap. It is perhaps the worst game i have ever completed and i have no intention to ever play it again. The story is about a man who has lost his sister, shes kidnapped or something and it is your quest to glitch your way through twenty plus hours of running past things. I created a melee fighter as i couldn't be arsed figuring out the magic system and as a melee guy i blessed with the good button of Q, a back-step. You see to fight in this game you hit then you jab Q. If you fail to jab Q you are probably dead as pretty much everything from a wolf to a demon-lord guy will one hit you. Now this may have been my own fault as around half way through i got extremely bored and stopped doing the side quests; they where boring.There are a few moments in the game that really shine like the bit where you glitch your horse onto a teleporter and jab enter so you can take it with you in this massive boring landscape (Seriously the first horse teleport i manged to do was extremely satisfying). Or the bit where you take the final boss(apparently someone who everyone is afraid of) half way across the map in the hopes that you can find a bear to kill him cause you cant be arsed to spend another thirty minutes trying to get another quarter of his health down .Overall, its a boring massive world with terrible dialogue and voice acting. The horrible combat system that is frustrating yet simple and the confusing and drawn out storyline make Two Worlds an experience that should only be touched when free and not really then.			"

												The First time i played this game was on 360 and i loved it but for some odd reason the disk stopped working or it would just work sometimes, so i loved the game and got it on steam when it was on sale a few years ago, and i didnt play it. After a year i played it again and i hated it i couldnt understand why i loved it, the voice acting doesnt sync sometimes and its terrible just terrible the combat it a little odd and hard to get used to but its fun and somewhat east to dodge attacks due to being predictable, horse ridding is glitchy(dont ride horse next to mountan walls might glitch in and wont get out), but i found myself loving it again with your guy occasionly shouting insults at enemys, laughing while he delt damage or killed something, stacking weapons and armors improving the value and stats every time.In all honesty its a terrible game but it was really fun and still is. The only problem i have is that after a period of time if i havnt played it, it becomes unplayable and i have to uninstall and reinstall just to get it to work again.			"

												Two Worlds is an exciting and story-rich RPG. You play as a mercenary who will do anything to save his sister, Kira. There are many enemies you must face: blood-thirsty orcs, golems, ogers, dragons, necromancers, you name it. I'm just going to say it straight-forward. This game is hard. When you first start out, you are extremely weak; you struggle to slay a couple bandits without using a health potion or spell. As you progress things only become harder. You may be able to slay 12 bandits with your mighty greatsword with no problem at all. But how will you fare against an oger? Or 5 necromancers? It is satisfying, being able to kill something you once struggled to even hit. But know that there will always be an enemy that will utterly destroy you. When you die, you respawn at the last shrine you visited (there are A LOT of shrines around the world). You don't have to go back to your last save or anything like that. Which can be both good and bad. The game play is great, the graphics are good enough to keep your immersion, and the voice acting is mediocre at best. There are flaws, but there is a lot of fun gameplay here. Unfortunately, after you complete the game, there's virtually no replay value. I haven't picked it up since I beat it. So, if you're looking for a game you can beat multiple times consecutively, then this isn't the game for you. I had fun playing it, and I do recommend it if you're looking for a good open world RPG. 8/10			"

The two main cons I would state are: Tons of bugs, but none actually important, and, just like most open world RPGs, if you do the side quests, the main quest becomes really, really easy because you are too overpowered. Also, the semi-boss is kinda harder than the final boss. (many monsters are actually harder than the final boss (both endings))Anyway, good balancing IMO, decent stats and skills, and decent story.

A game filled with choices and moral dilemmas, makes this a unique experience that allows you to immerse yourself into the life of a pirate and work your way through the hierarchy. Deffinetly worth trying if you liked Gothic, Oblivion or Arx Fatalis.9/10 for all due to some minor tweaks/buggs that should have been corrected or improved upon.			"

I know, this one not for every each gamer and RPG lover. This is not Gothic, not The Elder Scrolls. Probably that's worse than they both by one, but here you can find a few interesting gameplay features:First one is a craft system. Each thing can be upgraded and be perfected, you can make your own best weapon with ordinary knife.Second it's hardcore beginning. Not for everyone again, but if you like to die over and over, first 5 hours will be your favorite. Third point is a old good taste of game. This design, graphics, atmosphere... Everything of this make you feel nice, and this is pretty well.It have a lot of real ugly things, but if you want to little bit return to those times, when games feels a little bit interesting and newer, that's your choise. In this boring times, where everything look same, this old one look really awesome.			"

												Okay, before looking at the time I have spent sofar on this game for PC, please realize I have it for 360 as well, and beat it with about 200 hours or so and all the achievements. This game is amazing, hands down. While the graphics and voice acting is not the best to todays standards, it is still pretty good. The story line is like a 7/10 for me, but the side quests are very good. NOTHING respawns in this game, so it is possible to kill everything in the game and be stuck with nothing to do. I do love the part of the map where the volcanos are and all that, as it was done very nice. The mobs are fantastic and unique as well, such as the Lava Dragon. It might start out hard in certain areas, but once you get to about level 45 or so, you can pretty much 1 hit everything except the boss and mobs in the hell area. 10/10 game for me. I do not like the second game much though...			"

I have found there is humor in some of the city, and peoples names.  The creatures and monsters are adaptive, so as you reach higher levels, the they are harder to fight.  The game has alot of cool weapons and skills are fairly balanced.  However, the magic spells are limited and but the effect are great.  I enjoy playing the game.			"

Sure, it's not the ""Oblivion killer"" that it was advertised to be, and it's not the best-looking game ever, but holy damn is it fun. What you have here is an open-world action-RPG [closer to Gothic, barely, than The Elder Scrolls] with a cheesy (almost as much so as Fable 1) storyline, a hell of a lot of loot, and a very customizable class system. The voice acting is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but that's okay because it fits the cheesy-fun mood of the game (again, like Fable 1). Overall, the journey, if you can get used to the uneven difficulty, is well worth it. Just... Turn down the voice acting slider, and pretend the game has no voice acting.			"

												One of the classics from our childhood. Put in context this game offered a lot of land to travel, side quests, freedom of movement and consequences for the deccisions you take. The main cons are the scarce explanations about how everything works and the DRM system, which was bad even for those years.After this game they came great titles in the genere like Oblivion, Skyrim, The Witcher II, etc. So this one is nowadays suits best for nostalgic gamers and collectors.Of course, if you get it at a reasonable price and you want to be patient and put some time into the game it's probably a title that will surprise you despite the first impression.

												I played Two Worlds a lot in 2010 on the disc version of this, amassing around 150 hours in it. The acting is rubbish to be quite honest, and the story isn't that exciting(when you finish it, the game simply ends - I didn't actually feel inspired to finish it until I was nearly done with the sidequests). The main reason I had such a long playtime for it was because of the weapon upgrade system which had me running around randomly searching for weapons to combine with what I already owned(and usually find something better), the sidequests which sometimes had an interesting bit of backstory to them and the NPCs(in cities especially) who were remarkably fun to kill or scare with different types of spells(Guards will instakill you at first though).Two Worlds is also still fairly nice looking for the age it is - don't expect groundbreaking graphics, but the green environments especially still look quite nice.

												Good to pass some time away, but overall not recommended.   Visuals are passable considering its age, combat is again passable with the ability to ""dodge"" (a feature missing from TW2) - Two Worlds is hugely unbalanced in every department, magic is massively underwhelming requiring massive spell upgrades before it becomes 'useful' Alchemy is extremely overpowered with the ability to create potions giving you thousands of permanent hit points, magic or stats.  Mounts are buggy, with horses having pathing issues constantly.   Item fusion is also overpowered giving the player the ability to fuse together the same items and have the stats cross-over, allowing for some extremely overpowered godly items.  Another major issue is frame rate and stuttering which happens constantly, and gets fairly annoying. The game contains plenty of side quests but since the 'quest' tracker is confusing, most of the time you can't really figure out where your supposed to go, or to talk too.   The main story quests are extremely convoluted with plenty of pointless running around just to open simple doors so you can continue your quests.  Balance in every department is poor and its very noticable - once you complete the main quest line, the ending is exceptionally bad....I'm talking 'Mass Effect 3 bad'Overall, I cannot recommend Two Worlds but for people looking for a quick open world rpg to pass some time, and if you can find this game for 'cheap' or free, then its worth maybe checking out if your a fan of the genre.

												Underneath this somewhat unpolished game, marred by huge expectations (pre-release hype expected this game to be the next Oblvion open-world game), and a horrible buggy release, lies an enjoyable, often unique open-world RPG game, a game that I can recommend to open-minded gamers.It's amazing I can say that because on release, when I first got the Xbox 360 version, it looked like I had made a mistake. Tons of framerate issues, game-breaking bugs, and moreover a very unimpressive intro and beginner newbie area. The game eventually got patched, and I enjoyed it enough to later buy the PC version, and for my friends and I, Two Worlds 1 has become a guilty pleasure. I actually bought this twice on the PC, directly from publisher and later via Steam, so my hours don't reflect all of my accumulated playing time.I have to stress, though, that you have to weather the horrible beginning of the game. The game cinematic intro is uninspiring, then it drops you into a forest area, eventually giving you a barebones tutorial that doesn't show you the cool features of the game. On top of that, you have to make your way to your first town which sports some of the worst voice acting I've heard heard in a game. Fortunately, the voice acting improves a bit as you get further into the game, however the dialogue is still pretty bad, but you get used to it.On your way to the town, you may get mauled by wolves, which travel in packs, which until you learn the agro system of the game, you may die repeatedly.  So often, gamers will just quit at this point, several hours into the game, which is a shame, and I believe why most people didn't give this game a fair shake.  Lots to learn -- how to use the magic system, how to collect ingredients, how to handle night time creatures in the game (you won't be able to kill them initially so run away from them), etc.I really liked the weapon-combining system which I wish more games would implement.  You can combine similar weapons to upgrade your main weapon, so alleviates inventory issues, just keep combing that generic sword over and over. It also solves the moan-and-groan of finding junk loot, because in this game, you can make an uber weapon out of crappy weapons. Of course, eventually you'll want to combine higher-level weapons, but it's a great way to lessen inventory issues.I also loved the co-op feature, able to the play the entire game again with a friend. Not sure if you can still do this, though, because I don't remember if it needed access to original Two Worlds servers.Character models may look a bit dated, but the world still looks pretty good, and it has a lot of variety. Lots of side-quest and secrets to explore and enough variety to replay the game with different classes, which is also a strength, Classes aren't set in stone, but you can develop your character however way you want. Some people have issues with the mounting system, getting aggravated with the horse mount, but I found the PC version is far improved over the 360 version.Two Worlds 2, the sequel,  is by far, a more polished game, but TW1 sports a larger world, and doesn't have the weapon combining feature. If you can do some reading of the game mechanics, and not give up right away, you may find yourself enjoying this game.			"

												Two Worlds is a game I had originally heard of, but never played until about a year ago. I didn't keep up with the hype and the marketing for this game, and it was because of a YouTuber called ProJared and his review of this game that I bought it, mainly to see if it was as bad as he said it was. And - surprise, surprise - he was right.Two Worlds, according to ProJared's Review (be prepared to see ProJared's name come up a LOT in this ""review""), was going to put another game - The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion - to shame. Needless to say, it didn't even come close to matching Oblivion in anything. And I'm going to prove it.The game starts off with the Main Character and his twin sister, Kira, riding through the rain. Kira is injured, and falls off the horse. Here is where one of the many problems of Two Worlds starts to show. First off, the voice acting. It's God-awful. Every single voice actor - well, with an exception or two - is bad. Every line of speech is forced, no emotion is in the dialogue and even worse, the text in the game looks like it was written by someone trying to emulate Shakespeare.The story for this game is simple. As the Main Character goes to look for a shelter that he and Kira can stay in for the night to keep out of the rain, Kira gets kidnapped. About six months later, in the first village you're in (I don't remember what it was called, just more proof of how bad this game is) you recieve a letter telling you that your sister is alive. After reading the letter, the village elder gives you your first quest, the traditional cliché quest at the beginning of most RPGs out there: clear a cave of monsters. You do that, you come out of the cave which is really a temple, and when you're through with that task, some guy from the first village tells you that some ""hard warriors"" have come looking for you. After that, you find the man who kidnapped your sister - Gandohar - and he tells you to go and meet his master Reist in the Goat's Cave. You meet Reist, and he tells you to go and talk to Gandohar. Refresh my memory, why did I need to go in there again? Anyways, speaking with Gandohar reveals that he ""claims"" that he wants to help Kira, and to do that, he needs you to go and collect four treasures representing the four elements: Fire, Wind, Water, and Earth. There's also a fifth piece that binds them together just like that ring from Lord of the Rings. And apparently, only the Main Character and Kira can touch the key and nobody else can, similar to the Vampire Killer whip from the Castlevania franchise. That's really all I can say about the story, because I pretty much quit playing after that.Gameplay: The gameplay is somewhat similar to Oblivion, but they somehow managed to screw that up. When you're fighting anything in this game, and I mean anything, it all basically amounts to a button masher swinging wildly at everything around you, and I mean everything. There's no surefire way to be sure that you're hitting something other than the blood that shoots out of enemies, and the punch sound that accompanies trying to hit something with a steel blade that clearly is there to cause bruises rather than draw blood, but whatever.The graphics here are a mixed bag. The character models and everything look awful, to the point where they would barely pass as PS2 graphics, and they're animated so poorly. The lip-synching is also terrible, which makes Godzilla movies look masterful. However, and this is what I mean by the graphics being a mixed bag, is that not everything looks terrible, the enviroments are kind of nice. I can admit that.The music sounds like your typical midieval sword & sorcery-style RPG, with light tunes when exploring, heavy tunes when in danger, things like that.All in all, I have to say that it's a damn shame this game didn't quite live up to the hype, because it shows great potential that could have easily put The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion to shame, but they let their ambitions and a clichéd story along with awful gameplay get in the way of it all. Also, the voice acting was really disappointing as well. Still, hopefully they learned their lesson with this game and made Two Worlds II MUCH better, but I'll be going into it expecting the worst.

												This game is extremely clumsy, a bit buggy, but it definitely has charm. The dialog is obnoxiously stiff, but it has character. The combat and physics are kinda wonky, but it means you never know quite what's going to happen. The environment is decent, for a game of this age, but the main plot is pretty boring.

												It's a very good game but just doesn't quite make it to great or legendary due to a series of small items that take away from the overall experience.   Overall I still give it a thumbs up.  There are many ways to play your character - I did ""two handed weapon Tank"".   Due to the negatives (specifically being overpowered due to alchemy I just can't see myself doing a second play thru and that's why I rate it good and not great.  You'll play 80-100 hours and if you like these types of games, you'll enjoy it but won't be wowed by it and likely won't want to play it thru a second time.  Other games of its ilk (Titan Quest comes to mind as something close I've played thru multiple times with variety of builds).  This one - I don't think it'd make a difference.   When you have 50000 HP with 1500 HP heal spell and monsters do 100 points of damage and it takes one/two hit to kill them, the juice just goes out the window for combat related aspects of the game.  What I liked -        Large open world to explore.  While some areas are harder to navigate before you get strong, for the most part you can go anywhere at any time.          Alchemy skill was extremely fun (albeit it does make you overpowered)       merging items to craft a better item of same type - really liked this.         U.I good, easy to pick up       Side quests were enjoyable.       The atmosphere was very good.         Unlike others, I found the storyline reasonable and I didn't mind the graphics.        Due to alchemy and the lavishness of resources that add to your stats ""permanently"", you become very overpowered very quickly.   At about level 20 or so I had a ""Spear of Destiny"" which is a one-hit kill for most monsters and was a three hit kill for Dragons, all Golems, and all Boss Monsters (final battle was a one-hit).  I also had 50000 hit points and 20000 in physical resistence and 8000 in resistence to Elements (most monsters do hundreds of points of damage).  At no juncture did I feel threatened in any battle.  This one main aspect to me keeps this game from being great.     "

												Personal terms: worth purchase (i got on sale with 80% of discount)Impartial traditional terms: 5/10Personal sentimental judgment (Just for the record): 7/10I like this game, a lot. To me is a great game, really got me absorbed, and I probably will play a hundred more hours. This game need to be remembered with some honors. But you can't take my personal judgment as guarantee you gone like. To me is a great game, as i said.There is a lot issues in this game, but a lot of good thing too.Good characteristics:*Real Open World *Nonlinear campaign progress.*Smooth loot and inventory system.*Interesting lore*Extremely big variety of enemies*Hundreds types of armor and weapons*Very deep and easy magic systemBad characteristics:*Horrible voice acting*You won't feel connected to the game*The way the quest are display on your map can be confused.*Combat can be boring.*Lack of lapidation.*Open areas can be empty, because the enemies don't respawn.*There is no books or anything like to read in the game, what would make the story and mythology more complete and interesting to understand.*No crafting system.I didn't understand why but the autosave system has a facility to put you into a death loop, and the game only keep a history of three autosaves, what is a flaw in a Open World game. Once two of my three autosave got into a death loop and I almost lose all my campaign progress. But fortunately you can manually create an unlimited number of manual saves.Personally this game really is a hidden preciosity, for some RPG fan only, and I can't recommend to everybody. If you're not a great RPG fan will be some kinda difficult to you like this particular game. If you are a casual is almost certain you'll not gonna like it. Is a good RPG, with some interesting lore, but has also to many problems. Two Words also doesn't have a good replayability, everyone who beat the game is almost certain that he wil never play this game again. Is extremely inferior compared to others RPG Open World in the time was release, but in my personal experience this franchise became a remarkable experience in one of my favorite types of games. What I can say is: 5/10. Is just a normal game, have just enough to be average, nothing realy attractive, is just a game that dont sucks (considering the PC version only, stay away from the console version). Being a ""normal game"", as I said, you can't feel connected with the lore, the world and the characters (this last because of the extremely horrible voice acting), and this is a important thing for a RPG. You're hardcore RPG fan like me? If yes give a try, you will like this game, although much more the franchise as a whole package.			"

												I've only really started playing this game today, and I have to say, for it being quite an old game it is still fun to play, and worth a try if you are looking for a rpg to play. I really like the alchemy system, you have 4 slots I believe if i can remember, and you get ingredients from plants or wildlife that give you buffs. The skill system makes sense and I honestly have no problem with it, it has a sense of progression. For instance you have to be a certain level before you can put more points into a skill. This way you don't find yourself leveling one skill the entire time. I also like the fact that there is reputation with the factions in the game. It runs on a scale of 1-10, 1 being not important and 10 being very important. The more quests you do for a faction the more rep you gain. The questing is fun and the voice acting isn't really all that bad, It's better than reading quests (Morrowind). At the beginning it is sort of rough, but once you can get some gear from crushing some Grom skulls you'll be fine :)			"

												TL;DR: This game is demonstrably bad, yet has a charm that lets it hold it's own against other rpg's of those days.I will start this review with a warning: I'm biased in favor of this game. It was the first open world RPG I ever owned and so when I saw this game on steam the nostalgia hit like a thrown brick.This is a game that you have to laugh at to play. If you are a fan of open world RPGs like me and are willing to keep a sense of humor, this is an excellent game despite the constant speed bumps.The gameplay elements that work in this game's favor are the skills, crafting, and combat. The raw number of different skills allow the player to create a Robin Hood-esque ranger, a steel-clad one man-army warrior, or a mighty mage who owns an entire town (a bug I will explain later on).  The crafting system is simple, find two of the same items and you can combine them to make a single more powerful item.  The alchemy of Two Worlds is also the best type of potion-crafting I've ever experienced for a single reason: permanent effect potions and trap-making.  The combat is as varied as the classless skills, making any path viable. Using a wide variety of re-useable traps (from poisoned spikes to hammers and fire-coated blades) allows players who prefer ranged magic or bows to kill much more powerful creatures without the worry of being forced into melee. Magic and potions can keep a warrior alive in even the thickest melee.While I do love this game, the experience fails in just as many ways as it succeeds. The game's skill system, combat, and crafting could all use some work.I sound like I'm contradicting myself, but it is the truth. The way the player unlocks skills is by finding a trainer and purchasing the skill, which then allows the player to use and allocate points towards that skill. This is not a huge problem except for the alchemy skill. The alchemy skill is useable from the start of the game but the player must find the alchemy trainer (located far to the south and hidden among end-game monsters) in order to increase the skill, which is vital in wringing out every last stat point from permanent-effect potion ingredients. With the most useful early-game skill unlocked in the late/end-game, the other major skill dissapointments are the useless and annoying skills. You can learn a skill to unhorse a mounted enemy, but no one except the player can ride a horse. The swimming skill is useful for crossing rivers, which the player only really needs to do once or twice meaning the skill is a waste and swim-speed makes every river crossing a five-minute ordeal.The combat, while the options are varried, can easily become stale.  Once you find a style that works, you will abuse it. For example: what should be an epic battle of ranger vs dragon becomes a chore as you trick the dumb-as-rock AI into alternating between stacks of traps as you fill it with arrows. The crafting system requires two of the same item to create a single more powerful version. However, if the two items are too different in their enchantments, you can't combine them. The only way to tell if an item is too different from your gear is to have them both in your inventory, making purchasing equipment a gamble at the best of times. The game has a few qualities that are neither inherently good or bad, as long as you keep a sense of humor. Perfect examples being the dialogue and the bugs.The dialogue is comedic. It would be difficult for anyone to write funnier dialogue becuase between the merciless abuse of old-english and the uninspired voice acting, every single conversation will have you either cringing or laughing. The best bug I've ever experienced was in this game. *SPOILER ALERT*  During the course of the main questline, a city is overrun by orcs. By killing all the orcs and using the resurrect spell on everyone (including the orcs), the player can create a city where guards do not attack them and the humans and orcs co-exist peacefully (the orcs even sweep the streets) *SPOILER OVER*While there are countless speed-bumps to enjoying this game (including the terrible activation), it is an experience worth having.

												Is the dialog goofy, perhance?  Aye, perchance!That aside, this is a pretty decent Elder Scrolls style CRPG.  Big world to explore, lots of monsters to kill, quests to find, and factions to join or oppose.  The opening section seems to be one of the toughest, in terms of game balance, but once you're through that (and you realise that combining two items of the same type makes one stronger item) you'll be hacking your way through hordes of enemies in no time.

												Open World RPG. The takes about 15 hours for the main quest; probably 5-10hrsr more on all the side quests. There are multiple ways to complete quests and you can kill anyone at any time. It is Skyrim of 10 years ago. The voice acting and the word usage is the only downfall. The storyline is a little wierd too. However, it is fun questing and the packs of monsters are unforgiving. It can be a challenge. I took a lot of 1 hit kill deaths.			"

												Get this game if you aren't afraid of warriors, hard ones. You're the kind of hero who prefers to narrate everything you do, all the while sounding like the last guy who told your drunk♥♥♥♥♥to get in the trunk. The kind of hero with the air of a repeat sex offender who eats nails for breakfast, but possesses a warm gooey center and extremely mixed feelings about their scantily clad sister who looks nothing like them 99.9% of the time. If you feel like chasing the big bad hard warrior known as Gandohar and is sensible but stylish  master named Reist across the damn continent to save your sister prepare yourself for a twist that would probably make M. Night Shablabdingdong proud. Note that it will cause everyone else to indifferently stare at the screen while fiddling with their genitalia. Oh yeah you kill a lot of things and get progressively shinier armor to protect you from (or attract) Gandohars firm hands, its all fun and games till the bad guy starts caressing you like  you're his pillow. Also this game is a fantastic substitute for Blender Simulator 2013, I'd like to see those sim punks make an even better identical sword by throwing 20 of them in a blender together!Seriously though Two Worlds has...Symbol Key--------------------++= very good+= good- = bad--------------------- Hilarious voice acting (yes its bad but in a good way) + - Exploration! ++- Some Forgettable quests -- Plenty of quests +- Plentiful factions but no real consequences for reputation other than more or less quests =The combat is somewhat difficult but unlike other games you can't permanently die, you'll just get ressurected at a nearbly Maliel Shrine and continue your journey back to that damn Cyclops that used your helmet as a bongo. No item loss, no nothing, just rinse and repeat till you win (quicksaving in other RPG's is kind of the same thing though). Did I mention the map is huge and full of diverse and fairly interesting environments complete with some fairly standard but servicable guilds/factions to be a part of? Whether you're slaying Jackals and Dragons in the desert, killing Polar Bears and Orcs up in the glacier, being chased through the ruins of the deadlands surrounding a destroyed city with appropriate amounts of demons, undead, and more. Maybe you'll just slaughter entire cities and towns for fun once you become powerful enough? Just don't beat the main quest right away as once its over so is the game, its a lot more fun to explore the exotic landscapes of Antaloor and though they may lack much lore to give them added signifigance, its always the journey that beats the destination. Good thing the journey is so damn fun.Yes the voice acting is THAT bad and you will love it! Its part of the games charm.7.7/10			"

												My experience with Two Worlds is that it is COMPLETE, unplayable feces. I don't know what it is about my computer, but this game refuses to play on it under any circumstances. I believe I got it to work once, right after I got it, and when I got the game, the controls were absolutely atrocious and unintuitive on the xbox 360 gamepad.Now though, I can't even get this game to run without crashing to desktop with a 'Two Worlds is not responding' message, and I know what the common issues with this game are, I've tried all of the 1 fix I've ever seen for this game crashing, which is installing the proper nvidia Physx legacy driver. I've done that exact thing, installing and uninstalling the drivers multiple times, verifying game caches, uninstalling and reinstalling the game, running a command line parameter that allows me to finally launch the game in a tiny window only for it to crash while loading. This game doesn't know how to function. The programmers must have been complete idiots when they made this.The only positive thing to come away from this game with is that at least the developers learned from this and made Two Worlds II a much more competent, smoother, and overall better experience. If you wanna check out Two Worlds, don't bother, get the sequel.----------Edit:Alright. I finally got this thing to work, and here was the problem, files in OTHER GAMES I OWNED were keeping this game from running. I have no clue how ANYONE can fail at programming a game so hard that having another file in another location on your computer for another game keeps this other, ENTIRELY DIFFERENT GAME from FUNCTIONING. The solution, to people who had the same problem as me is, check your games for lgvid.ax files and delete them. These files are most common in Looking Glass's Dark Engine games (System Shock 2, Thief Gold, and Thief 2: The Metal Age are the most likely culprits). While I could also use that as an opportunity to lay the blame on those games, the fact of the matter is, I have over 200 games in my library and not ONE besides this game ceased to function just because of a file it shouldn't even be referencing that exists in my other games.That said, if you can fix it and get it working, Two Worlds is worth trying. Getting past the technical issues, I have been playing the game quite regularly in the past week or so, putting in over 20 hours already, and most of that was just me exploring, killing monsters and bandits and groms and animals, then looting, equipping, improving, and selling their stuff without doing any quests. So I'd say it makes for a fairly enjoyable sandbox Action-RPG that I would recommend, but again, ONLY if you have no issues getting it to run. The technical issues should be a big red flag if you plan on getting this game at anything other than a considerable discount.			"

I am reviewing right now while it's 90% off and sitting $0.99.  That is a great price.  The default price is a bit high since the graphics are outdated by now and the game itself has some issues but I found them easy to overlook and have a great time with the game.			"

The voice acting was horrible and the end seemed... a bit cut off? Either way, I really enjoyed the open world and the graphics were really quite good for its time.			"

												A hidden gem. This game isnt for everyone plain and simple. Its aged to be certain, but I believe its aged relatively well compared to other games of its time, the combat isnt anywhere as clunky as say morrowind and it doesnt crash to desktop like Gothic if you run it on Windows 7. If you like RPG's and arn't a graphic snob then this game is for you. everyone else can move along.Lots of weapons, lots of armour, lots of spells, lots of badass, its actually fun to loot in this game.

												I really would recommend this game, I have invested about 25 hours in total into this game and I picked this up at 69p on a weekly sale. I'll list the pros and cons; Pros  It has a large world to explore and there is fast travel for those who wish to use it. There are a lot of quests and sidequests. A system of combining identical equipment you find to improve it, this makes it hard to choose what to use i.e. should i use this really good sword or keep my old one and keep improving since it's more common? There are a lot of different weapons and equipment to find/loot. Things like archery and chemistry are actually things you need to improve and learn rather than just knowing straight away. Each city has noticeable differences in culture which I really liked. Cities are quite large, compared to Skyrim where the cities are more like towns this actually does have large cities, it comes at a price of sacrificing the size of indoors however.  I am not saying it's better than Skyrim  Cons  It has some of the worst voice acting I've ever seen in a game, get used to hearing mayhaps, aye, and perchance just thrown into conversation with a slow talking drone. When an enemy is dead, they're dead, any random bandit encounters won't happen again once you kill them. Nothing respawns. It is very challenging to start, it starts you off with very poor equipment and launches you straight into what seems like at the time level 1000 enemies, you can still beat them it just requires a lot of determination. The main story is very boring so if you like story based games, probably want to avoid this. It seems a bit expensive given the experience playing it, don't get me wrong I loved playing it but that is mainly due to me buying it at 69p. Money pretty much has no value, countless times I would buy a 5000 gold sword and be broke and jump straight back up to 5000 within a few minutes just from selling loot and finding gold, this is good in some ways but not very challenging.There are many more things to say about this game but I cannot think of more at the minute. If i was to offer a comparison as to what Two Worlds is like then I would say it's something like what Oblivion would have been like if Bethesda would've had a fraction of it's budget. "

From my experience of playing the game, two worlds is well worth the money. The game is a 1st/3rd person game. Cities and villages are nicely made. Items can be found everywhere in the world. Coolest thing in this game is that you can stack weapons on the same weapons to upgrade em to become a better weapon. This type of upgrading can be used non stop. If you enjoyed gothic and Elder scrolls oblivion, than you will enjoy this game!Pros:Tons of items, Armor and WeaponsStacking itemsorganized inventoryopen worldCool spells;Traps and bombsQuests aren't repetitiveNon stop upgradingCons: Shallow storylineDumb conversations terrible combat systemmonsters kill you with one hit "

												I thought I'd give this game a try even though plenty seem to find it terrible and unfortunately I have to agree.This game is very outdated with ugly graphics and atrocious voice acting. Nothing managed to grab me and want to keep playing, story seems boring and cliche.I normally try to play a game for at least 10 hours before writing a review, but the voice acting immediately put me off, sounds very robotic with no emotion behind the words, sounds like someone is bored and just reading the lines half heartedly straight off the bat.The default controls are horrible as well, space for action and e for jump.At least you can change it. Though I could not map shift to anything at all and trying to map the tilde key just resulted in opening a dialogue function.Character creation is extremely limited, you can only play as a male and change his hair and features a tiny bit.I do not need to play much at all to decide that I really hate playing this game. It's terrible in every way. Talking to NPC's is like a form of torture, listening to dialogue that sounds like someone is very bored makes me want to mute the sound. A waste of time to play such a bad game when there are heaps better games I can spend my time playing. I only have playtime more than an hour as I was trying to get all the card drops.But if you feel the need to give it a try maybe get it on a sale. But to me this game is not worth playing even if it was free. I'd rate it 4/10 as it is not a joy for me  to play at all.			"

												I would recommend this game only to those people, whose attitude to RPG became a kind of ""fondness"". And i am one of them. This game became just a ""+1"" to my game list, though i like role-play games very much, but i'm not sorry for buying it. As usual, i will start from ""minuses"":- The sound. Who was synchronizing it? I suppose it was a computer with plain intonation. No emotions at all.- The plot. Just see - from the very beginning the main hero behaves a bit indifferent to his companion (leaves her alone) and that leads to her loss. 50/50 apprehension.- The hero's skill of sward flutter. It looked a bit strange, as if his knees and elbows were aching.- A lot of personal information is to be filled in into the form. Am i going to be a deputy or am i to cast a vote? :DAnd pluses:+ An open world. Always liked that, and this game isn't an exclusion.+ A skill-tree. Making level-ups brings you not only stats, but also an ability to choose your specialization. That's just a part of RPG.+ Graphics. Though it's not acute, but it also doesn't disturb your eyes. Never the less, it could have been MUCH better.I don't know, whether you are to buy this game or not. So it's up to you. I can't say something towards its ""defence"", as towards its ""prosecution"".			"

												Recommendation: Play the game with the sound turned off, or at least the voice acting. If you can manage, maybe even turn off subtitles, too.This game has a lot going for it, but it's the small things that kill it, and there are so many of them. The voice acting and writing are horrible. The horse riding is a janky pile of garbage. I think the horse only has 5 frames of animation, and it has a (somewhat deficient) mind of its own, often deciding to veer in the opposite direction you indicated. The graphics are pretty bad. I'm all for taking into account the age of the game, but there are plenty of games this old that don't look this bad. It's surprising, because some of the assets look pretty good, while others look terrible. It's like they just lumped together a bunch of assets they had sitting around. The quests are also confusing and not very descriptive. I had to look up several of them in online guides.There are plenty more, but I stopped playing mostly because of those. It was just, plain silly. Pity, because I actually enjoyed a lot about this game. I still need to try TW2 to see if it's any better.			"

												For its price point the game is decent but honestly it's pretty terrible overall. Enemies come in packs of 3-6 which is difficult/tedious to defeat early on, so your best strategy is to stand by a revive shrine and fight with rapidly regenerating health. Later on you're broken because alchemy is overpowered in that it lets you make permanent stat potions from easily obtainable materials. That and you can stack gems on a weapon and make its damage obscene.The real problem is the lack of quest markers. You know how you've probably played a game and thought ""wow it's really lame this marker leads me right to the objective"" Well, if you want to see why developers do that, try this game!!!!!! While there are quest markers most of them are to the person giving the quest and you get to wander around most of the time lost. Most of the directions are vague like ""near"" or ""east of"" and then not really either.There's also really draconic DRM too which apparently only allows three installs. The game's playable I guess... I mean it held my attention longer than Morrowind in this day and age, but really it's quite poor quality unfortunately.			"

												Probably the best game on Steam. No, I'm serious.This game is simply amazing. It's one of the best I've ever have played. To start off the story is astounding. Never have I played a game with such a massively in depth and rememberable tale such as this. You start off in the immensely fascinating world of Thalmont. The hero is on a quest to discover the mysteries of an ancient orcish curse left behind by the late Azrael who is the son of the executioner of Hell and a mortal woman. The hero is traveling with his sister, Kira, who holds the key to the knowledge about resurrecting Azrael. Gandohar, a powerful wizard that seeks to harness the power of Azrael for himself learns of this and then sets out to kidnap Kira. Throughout the game the hero is trying to find where the scoundrel Gandohar has taken his sister. Along the way he is forced to work with Gandohar as well as Reist Tungard, a shadow of a man who turns out to be a demon sent from hell. The hero battles his way through countless obsticles to try to save his sister. At the very end he is forced to make a choice that will inpact the destiny of the entire world. As for the game itself it's an amazing action RPG that rivals games like Skyrim and Dark Souls. The combat is extremely well balanced and always put you on the edge of your seat. The voice acting is phenomenal and makes you feel as though you are really in a dark medieval fantasy world. Almost every character has a unique voice actor and a interesting character model to go along with it. You can also customize your character much like the elder scrolls games. I find the customization to be better than the default elder scrolls process. You can increase every little detail from the height of the character to the arm legth and even small things such as the eye size. I personally made my character look like Steve Stifler from the American Pie movies. Overall I'd give this game a 11/10. It is truly one of the best games of this century. If you haven't played it then BUY IT NOW. It's only $0.99 which is a steal for such an amazing game.			"

												6/10 I will start with my dislikes to likes.I have to start off by saying, if you get this, you got a 99% chance it will crash on start up.. To fix, get the legacy drivers or whatever its called in the forums.Will work then.I had issues where sometimes the voices would stutter, and I didn't even get to see a entire cutscene because it wigged out and suddenly skipped the entire thing. :/The voice acting for most the characters is god awful and have no feeling in them. Where someone should be upset, they sound as upset as when your leg falls asleep.________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________As for the good stuff, I played a lot of skyrim, and some morrowind, and gotta say, the fighting animation is pretty cool. It isn't just swing your weapon around like a madman. So I did enjoy that.Also liked the skill tree. Was simple and clear.Despite the terrible voice acting, the story wasn't bad. I enjoyed it, even if it wasn't the most clear sometimes of where to go.Like this. (Go south to Goat Cave.) When the correct direction is SouthEast, and is a small dot that says Active Underground as its name.Now liking the story only got me so far, not spoiling anything but the ending was not worth the last few battles.. Not even close.. Not to mention unlike TES games, once you beat main story, thats it. You can't continue the adventure with the insane sword you got from the boss.. noooo, cutscene, end. Can reload a old file before the bossfight, or start a new character.Combat was fun, was a basic evade button (Q) to jump back. With enemies that need different thing. Like undead monsters are really only good to hurt with magic or enchanted weapons. Normal weapons will take very long to kill.I also like, which they do not explain, how you strengthen your weapon and armor. EX. Say you kill some bandits, and they all drop the same sword, you pick them up, drag them to your sword to add more strength to it. Helpful with basic, but the more rare and powerful make take longer to increase.All in all, great gameplay, good story, decent challenge, bad ending.Some bugs but I only seen a few. Replaying now as a archer.			"

												BE WARNED! This game has an in game registery and you cant play anything but a demo version until you do that. Unlike most steam games you have to enter the cd key as well. Im still waiting on the email to get it Freaking registered. I bought this on steam sale for about 5 dollars and am seriously concerned it might not be worth it.			"

												I finished the Epic Edition on DVD, then rebought it on Steam. I'm not a huge fan, but when a game is as universally panned as this one, I guess I need to make a point and reaffirm that some people will enjoy it.Yes, it's a low-budget game, yes it has bugs (what open world RPG doesn't?), but it also has one of my best memories as a gamer: I discovered by myself that I could accumulate weapon merges, and ended up a kill machine that could one-shot everything in its path -- all within the constraints of the game, rather than through the use of cheating.Abusing a game's mechanics is usually reserved to good, hardcore gamers. It's nice for once that a game could be abused by a more casual gamer.(Also, an Eastern 'area' in a serious med-fan setting? It's so messed up it's hilarious. You just can't hate that game.)			"

												Two  Worlds is a third person medieval RPG with outdated, ugly graphics. The voice acting is atrocious and the music forgetable. Your character can only be male, with very little customization. Its unbalanced and glitchy, with the horses having pathing issues constantly. The quest tracker is confusing, with no clear path to take or who to talk to, to progress in the story. That said, the story seemed boring, pointless and cliche'. The clunky controls are horrible, not the regular space for jump its 'e' and space is for action O.o. with the exception of the mouse in the easy, unrewarding battles. Spells in the game feel weak and unaffective. Its obviously geared more towards being an MMORPG. It has Reality Pump DRM and you have to input a key and activate before you can play the game. They want your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. It seemed extremely over the top intrusive considering its on Steam and I'm not going to play the multiplayer part. I would recommend playing Skyrim instead.			"

												I wanted so badly to like this game. and I do. Though just slightly. It can be an enjoyable game. But there are many many many flaws. The biggest ones, are that the voice acting is abysmal. by far the worst ive ever heard in a game. The missions = go here talk to this person, then go here and talk to him, then go here and talk to her, and kill the same enemies every 20 feet or so. and its hard to figure out what youre supposed to do too. And the combat is bad. Not the worst mind you, but very bad. it consists of mashing the LMCB over and over and over while he spins the sword in front of you. It only flat out sucks when you try to kill an archer cause they run from you and chasing them is annoying as ♥♥♥♥. I wont list anything positive about this game. ill simply say this: There are better simillar games out there. some for the same price. Get dragon age, the witcher, dark souls, dragons dogma, or even fable over this game. unless you get it on sale for like $1.25 like i did. Unlike every other steam reviewer, i wont say that this game sucks. its simply inferior and falls into the shadow of much better open world RPGs. Rest assured that it isnt the worst open world RPG. that honor goes to risen 3. Cant decide between giving this game a 5/10 or a 5.5/10, But what i can decide on is that even though i got *some* enjoyment, i doubt many other gamers would, so i cant recommend this game to the general gaming public. Pick this up if its on sale for less than $2 or if youre just an RPG junkie like me.			"

												Awesome roleplaying game great graphics and epic story. The beginning is very hard you have to take your time and build up be patient, dont dive into combat or you die. learn the jump back system for defense. The horse riding is better than any rpg ive played for realism, you can shoot your bow while riding horses. The combat system is very fun once you get comfortable with the way your character moves. THere is an ingenious way to stack equipment so nothing gets wasted and items lvl as they are stacked into eachother. There are hours and hours of content and side stories. The magic system is fantastic. This was due to buggyness rated as one of the worst RPGs but infact i find its one of the best RPGS now with the patching. I prefer this game over oblivion 10 to 1. The characters are more robust. Some people complain about the voice acting but its appropriate for the setting the old english. Also its nice to hear your character talk instead of read what he says as a mute as in most games.  There is plenty of element of exploration. This is a recommended must buy for anyone who likes skyrim,oblivion, gothic or any open world RPG 3rd person games. Also this game has some of the best looking armor sets ive ever seen in a game and the most veriety of weapons and items in any game to date.			"

												Listen everyone. I had this game on xbox 360 and even though it is much more stable than the PC equivalent it is every bit as fun. Here is everything you need to knowMany first time players may experience crashing when starting the game, this is a common error and there are tons of people who have solved this problem within the discussion section. Game crashes were frequent in multiplayer when I started playing but I ironed them out over time and soon enough the game was fully playable. If this does not put you off then stick with meThe game mechanics and controls are not taught at any point in this game, there are times when you will either remap or try to learn the controls. When you just don't understand how the game works just keep trying and stick with it because it gets better.This game is like Dark souls, you will die, a lot. If you expect to be a double sword wielding, big♥♥♥♥♥♥bad♥♥♥♥♥then you should play another title because this game will not forgive you. You will come across enemy's who are a million times better than you and they will destroy you every time until you get to at least level 40-50.The enemies themselves look like walking cartoon characters, their animations choppy and faces incredibly goofy (especially the spider, the spider is my favorite). More times than not they are incredibly overpowered or come in large packs, it is at this point you realise the ""Q"" button is your best friend. You will kill that enemy eventually, it will just take a bit of time.Now onto the best bit, the voice acting. This is the single best part of the game, I challenge you not to laugh at a Germany company putting together an English script using words such as ""Tis"" and ""Twould"". The actors try their best to get around this but it is still the funniest thing, you will cringe often but damn these people are so quotable, especially your main character.In all the years I've played games I have never come across such a sloppy AAA title but my god is it fun. It is one of those so bad it's really good games. The combat is flawed but there are so many different weapon and Armour sets it's hard not to get a bit of a thrill when taking a hit that would previously have been fatal (all because of your new full plate hauberk) or the fact you killed the wolf with 4 hits instead of 5 with your shiny new Eye of Aziiral sword. The amount of customising in this game is astounding. There are hundreds of different armours, weapons and spells to choose from as well as hundreds of different monsters to kill. There is something so satisfying about killing a giant trachidis after dying 20 times and looting it's body for those sweet vitality boosting eggs, small victories lead to huge amounts of fun. It's a frustrating game, it's a hard game, but once you power through the hard parts the game gets so much better. I have one huge problem with this game however. Horse Riding. I didn't realise horses came on rollercoaster tracks because that's what it feels like. You tell your horse to turn left and he will go right as to avoid that tiny pebble in the road as apposed to jumping or walking over it like any other horse would do. You know it's bad when your horse driving completely sober is worse than your car driving 10 drinks in.In summery this game is bad, some might even call it terrible, but my god is it fun. I have never been more excited to play this game online with friends than any other game out there. It's buggy, it's glitchy, but killing that Cyclops after the 15th attempt and using the money from his corpse to buy a new sword is nothing short of satisfying.I love this game and I really urge everyone else to give it a try. Play about 7-8 hours before you make a decision because that gives you time to level up and get a better understanding of the game "

												I generally dont like writing bullet-point reviews , but I haven't really played all that much to write anything else. That being said , there are some things I want to mention.Starting with the cons , since they are more (not necessarily outweigh but are more) than the prosActivation is broken , and might even require you to use an unlegitemate keygen to activate the gameVoice acting is pretty bad.Character and NPC animations are choppy. I have no idea if the character movement is animated with 30 fps in mind , but it looks weird on anything above that.Story can be really cheesy at times.Pros:The game world is well crafted. Soundtrack is nice.Story , although filled with cliches, can be interesting enough to keep you playing.Im giving it a negative just because of the technical issues. The bad voice acting I can get over , but the hassle to get the game actually running and the immersion-breaking character movement are really annoying.			"

												Is a good game, addictive hack n slash with endless open world exploration. This game also works on 3D conversion software such as TriDef-Ignition quite nicely and is a lot of fun, feels more immersive. Again, The rated hours on this is inaccurate, I bought the original game on dvd until it refused to register after having to reinstall a few too many times. I've played this game ALOT and I still enjoy it, I missed it and got a great bargain here on steam			"

												If you want to experience mid-00's RPG go try Oblivion instead of Two Worlds. If you absolutely loved Oblivion and want more of the same sorts and have some time over to waste (like I do) - THEN play this one.Bad parts: Outdated graphics, bad sound, horrible voice acting, not so imaginative quests and environments.Good parts: Dragon slaying, mounted monster bashing5/10			"

												This game never gets old! I love playing it and the quests are difficult but it kinda makes you think as you're running around fighting monsters how to solve problems and its a skill that can be used in the real world. Not everything in this game is just handed to you like most games now and its a good and bad thing. Overall this is a really good game expecially for this sale price. I definitely recommend this to a friend and i believe it even has online play. The horseback riding is kinda odd but when you really think about it, its more realistic than most other current games, horses won't just ride off a cliff in this and they wouldn't really in real life either. Its realistic in many ways, but nothings perfect.			"

												This game was pretty nice and I don't understand such bad reviews it received. Yes, story was ok, not great, but somewhat rushed. In this game I actually liked graphics, I liked weapon and armor upgrade mechanics, even so they made little sense. Game gave you lots of choices as to where to explore and how to become more powerful. Some areas of the game felt a bit unfinished. Overall, it was a decent game.			"

												RPG classic, surely there are some bugs and ""not so pretty graphic"", but the depth of the game and ideas that developers used in it - well, it definitely worth it. I played many RPGs and I can say that Two Worlds - is quite unique in this matter. I like the combat system (yes, it has some flaws, but still), I like inventory management and magic system. The characters and story is interesting as well. In short - buy it, it is ""must have"" for all those RPG fans out there.			"

												This game... Either you love it, or you hate it. In many ways it is one of the worst games i have ever played, However, despite it's numerous flaws, terrible voice acting, and cumbersome menu layout, it is still one of my favorite oepn world rpg games. As to why I enjoy it, I can't really say. It could be some kind of stockholm syndrome since it was the only game i had access too for a few months when I first played it on the xbox 360, or it could be that underneath the bugs it has a number of good gameplay qualities. (it has fairly good replay value, A few neat game mechanics, a lot of quests, etc) I'd reccomend it if you liked any of the games in the elder scrolls series, but be warned it is a bit of an aquired taste, so maybe you should wait for the next steam sale to buy it just in case it's not your cup of tea.

												This game is one of the best RPG games I have played. The Map is huge and access is free around the map. There is no loss of scenery and no annoying gaps where you get stuck. I am not an expert gamer so I like a game to be reasonably easy without being killed constantly. I stopped playing Dungeon Siege III for that reason. The character development is similar to Gothic III. Creation of upgrade potions require experimentation but, once discovered, gives a new dimension to the game. I played this for many hours over Christmas and found the tasks and roleplay to be challenging and very enjoyable. There is no excess gore in fighting and the horse riding control is the best I've come across allowing for good combat on horseback with upgrade skills. Magic is easy to use and spells are upgradeable as you increase in levels and controls are easy considering the many options available. If you liked the Gothic series and Risen, I can recommend this game.			"

												I legitimately tried giving this game a chance. I heard there was a lot of initial backlash, but I also heard from multiple sources, be it reviews or from this community hub for the game, that it had some charm and it was otherwise a very solid RPG Experience. So going in to it with a tinge of anticipation and an open mind, I attempted to play Two Worlds hoping that I'd find exactly what people said it was: A solid RPG Experience with bad voice acting. Sadly, all I found was a tedious, boring sandbox-ish RPG with such a dry assortment of spells, traits, and characters wtih abysmal voice acting.Archery feels lackluster, spells, until very VERY late in to the game, feel irrelevant, and melee combat is reduced to a simple four hit combo where in some situations, you get the occasional crushing blow/critical hit that does a tremendous amount of damage. At first, I thought the combat was simple, but worked quite well for the game. As time went on, gaining levels and using my skill points accordingly, the game boiled down to abusing the invincibility frames in the back step whilst swinging very selectively for critical hits. Combat eventually felt bland, lackluster, dry, all these words and then some more that I'm not at liberty to say.I really, REALLY tried to give this game a chance, playing it all the way from start to finish with a game-file that says my total play time was approximately 11 hours. In those 11 hours, only the first two, maybe three felt like the game delivered what fans promised it did. Afterwards, the game otherwise falls short of whatever it was meant to provide, and I felt more frustrated than anything else by the end.All in all folks, the game kinda sucks. I mean, there's really not much else for me to say.			"

												its a ok game not that great or anything and there is basicly no balance and you will die a lot over and over and sometimes the enemies will chase you to the spawn point and kill you over and over untill you kill them or you run away would i recomand this game not for 10 dollars maybe like a dollar			"

												One of the few games I have ever played that manage to make mage characters both vulnerable and also crazy powerful.  (Basically only games based on older D&D rules (such as Baldurs gate) have done similar, at least in my experience.)Also your character is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fantastic at times and is voiced by the most fitting voice imaginable.The gear upgrading system is such a pain as to effectively unusable, but for a full mage/mage-warrior/mage-theif equip upgrading is unnessecary.  Also from what little gameplay I have had as a pure warrior/pure theif kind of char, they seem remarkably weak, but that could just be me being♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Just no.Got it a really good discount hoping that it would help kill a few hours exploring a new world? And was I in for a disappointment? It's just bad. I could barely go through an hour before I found out how to get out of the game, enter my Steam library and choose the delete option.Strangest of all is that now, I can place a single thing that turned me off from this game. There is just this overwhelming distaste hanging around it that is the result of so many things and issues. To name a few - the combat system, the dialogs, the atmosphere of the world, the menus, the in-game HUD, the combat! Well you get the idea.If you are placed with the choice between spending a couple of pounds for this ""thing"" and buying a cheeseburger - go for the burger, at least it will leave a better, albeit brief, impression.

												This game has an acivation sistem, one which ask you very personal data such as personal address, phone number, birth date, year of your college degree, surname of your grandmother etc... That should be enought to turn you away.In the first minutes it may seem clucky and bland but if you manage to play 1h you will discover that it's not that bad after all. It has weak story but the fighting and looting sistem are interesting. It reminds me of Gothic for many aspects.I bought it on sale for less than 1 euro and i'm not regretting it, for that price i'm having quite fun.7/10 if you find it on sale			"

												They way game is backed for linux, must be reviewed. Its and outdated wine (first verison) with custom winetricks and some scripts to work flawlesy. Game runs slagish, but ok. Im not sure its okay, to use outdated versions of wine, since they ported this game a two (max three) years ago. Last version is 1.9.15 with huge improvement must be suited well.The game generally is ok, dont jugde it by goty 2016 standarts. Main story is okay, at least its all sounds like a fairytail. People who wrote a script sure are old school rpg fans.So, problems in balance. There is no way mages are better then melee fighters. Im tried a lot of builds, and using pure magic damage are weak, so really weak. Its like a joke, even games main art says go play *uckin knight :D. P.S. Try game with friends, its fun.			"

NOTE: 8 of  10 people can no longer run it at all without a physic x patch and 3 of 10 still can't even with it. compatibility mode patches do nothing, run as admin does nothing, this game is a very dead nothing...I would not give free copies of this to my enemies, it is that bad...Most frustrating download/install/crash/broken patch/waste of time of 2015...

												The voice acting in this game could use some minor tweaking. I wonder if the devs have ever gave an explanation why it was so rough. It is the most... let's say peculiar voice acting I have ever encountered in a game.Some impressive stuff:The weather. Especially the fog, also the fact that  your character reacts to the weather changing. Loads are super short, the map is open and you can just go inside peoples houses and♥♥♥♥♥♥without entering a loading screen like in SkyrimThe game remembers locations of slain mobs and remembers where you stored your crap in a box.The performance, great fps count all across the board.Some constructive criticism:-The game is good but next time try adding someting cool like:SoldiersMachinegunsRocket LaunchersSniper RifleTanksThanks!

												First, there's the DRM and registration nonsense to slog through, then once you've registered, the game presents with wretched graphics, clunky interface, two-dimensional combat mechanics, and some of the worst voice acting ever perpetrated upon a helpless player. ""But it's an old game, you shouldn't expect glorious graphics and great acting,"" some might say-  This game was made in the same year as Dragon Age: Origin and Fallout 3. It has no excuse. It's not worth the time it took to DL, let alone the purchase price, even on sale. Your 10 bucks has thousands of better ways to be spent.			"

												There's a lot of dialogue which really slows down gameplay, and the controls are absolutely awful. It seems you cannot control the direction you're facing as well as walking and attacking. Could definitely be improved.			"

												Game has problems running with video cards.  Got this one with two world bundle,  it kind works on older, pc's with older video, cards, but not with new video card types, and if u got a AMD Radeon HD 6570 game will not work at all. just a not. when buying older type window, games like this one. check your video card and its settings,  card might play all the new stuff, but when comes to older game. got look  at the settings and the codeing, that your card has.  as for recommending this game, i would say NO, since,  never got it to work.

												I can't play this game, it will not boot. I've tried on 3 different machines, all drivers up to date, and each are running different OS's. Just some brief googling shows that this is not an uncommon issue but I've had no luck with any fixes.Regardless, it would seem I'm not actually missing out on much. The overall consensus of Two Worlds is not exactly exceptional. However, it is still a disappointment because I'm a sucker for old RPGs.			"

Thank goodness i got this on a Steam sale for 5 bucks otherwise i might actually be inclined to ask for money back.  But that would be more hassle then the 5 dollars is worth.  So if you're reading this.  save yourself, turn away and get something else.  Yea it might be cheap but you get what you pay for.			"

												I picked this game up in an RPG bundle on Bundle Stars for 5 bucks (As I'm writing this, that bundle is still  available.) I actually bought the bundle for Two Worlds II, but I figured if I played that one first, I would never go back and play this one, so I decided to play TW first. 	Perhaps it is because of this that through the whole game I had a feeling of wanting to just get it over with. At the beginning of the game I was getting killed by everything, and I just wanted to get it over with, then I got a little stronger and acquired some better gear, but I really just wanted to get it over with. Then I finally did get it over with, and I looked back on the 20 hours I spent on the game and thought “well, I’m glad that’s over.” I did miss out on the finer parts of the story due to skipping a LOT of dialogue because the voice acting is laughable and the on screen text is an odd “period appropriate” font which is hard to read.(This obviously was before the world realized that fantasy RPGs don’t need to have period-appropriate gothic fonts and HUDs with ornamental metal decorations around the mini-map and bars, and where the menus look like scrolls/notebooks)But what the main storyline boils down to is basically a series of fetch quests, to acquire the different parts of an artifact which will help something something the tomb of an orc god something something the main characters sister something something bring the god back something something. It's not very interesting, but it's not horridly boring. 	As I said, the main story is just some fetch quests. For me this just meant running past a bunch of enemies, grabbing the artifact piece, and running like hell to the nearest exit. Do this a few times, bring them all together, fight the bosses, game over. 	BUT there are also a slew of side missions to enjoy and different factions to be a part of. I chose to help out the necromancers and the merchants guild, but there are other groups. The combat is alright with me, but it’s nothing special. For me it was equal parts slashing away with a weapon and pausing to switch spells. Not as stiff as, say, an Elder Scrolls game, with Two Worlds featuring automatic aiming and quick access bar which I never actually learned to customize except for the spells. Though the system was certainly not as entertaining as, say, the first Witcher. As for the enemies on which you will be employing your combat, I thought there was a good diversity!  Though the RPG staple, “giant rat”, did not seem to appear (or I just didn’t notice) there are some quite cool enemies to do battle with. You have your standard wolves, skeletons, orcs, and bears, but also ghouls, zombies, dead knights and a  slew of others, all of which fight in different ways. There are creatures unique to different terrain, which is cool, and there are massively overpowered beings such as golems and hell lords (yes, HELL LORDS) walking around like they own the place. Overall, I was happy with the diversity of enemies. However, the minor boss battle at the end was an hour of me spamming the mouse button, and I hate that, though that may have something to do with me rushing though the game and getting to the boss before being properly leveled. I’m not going to talk about the magic or leveling system because I didn’t put a lot of time into it, seeing as I was breezing through the game. But, of course, average mechanics can be made up for with a good story and atmosphere right? Well let’s talk about both of those. Story: It’s fine. It was underwhelming for me because, as is the case with these RPGs, the fate of the world was at stake, but I didn’t really care what happened to the characters in this world, because none of them were interesting or endearing. There’s something close to characterization in the relationship between the hero (you) and his sister, but it’s not really that engaging. Atmosphere: The world looks quite good. When you pop into first person view and look around, there are a lot of pretty landscapes to behold. All types of environments are represented here (Glaciers, fields, deserts, bamboo forests, lava-pits, big cities, small villages), and they all look pretty great, but they are sometimes inexplicable. A desert will abruptly turn into a field, and other things of the like. But though these landscapes are pretty, they are also quite empty. There are many expanses of wilderness which don’t have any interesting features, NPC’s or enemies. Overall, the atmosphere is of a world which is interesting, but it does not make me want to BE there, which is what I look for in an RPG world.	 Anyway, though my review is negative, I wouldn’t say that this is a horrible game. If you can get it in a bundle, as I did, it’s probably worth a play through, but only if you’re into the genre.			"

												I bought this game when it went on sale for $2 and I gotta say it was worth it. I was a bit worried after hearing all the negitive reviews but soon realized that most of the negitivity was coming from the xbox version. The PC version has better frames and better controls over the xbox. Pros: Great combat system, Tons of magic and abilities, Good monster variety, So many armor and weapon sets, Huge world filled with bandits and monsters roaming around, A lot of quests.Cons: Bad voice acting, Some frame drops here and there, Mediocre story, Some character animations look a bit weird.Overall its a great game. 8/10			"

												Simple list for you guys if your looking to buy the game, So here it goes:-PC controls are better then Console, as i played both,-Plot is O-kay, -Combat system is VERY good, more of a personal refrence, Early game is hard, however as you go further into the game, you get better items, etc. So wait for the game to pick up a bit.-Content isent repetitve nor junk, It is actually quiet fun. The world is very open and you should explore every cervice and crack of it.-CREATURES DO NOT RESPAWN, I actually dont mind this, However, many do, So take this into account for your Purchase, I personally dont need them because i spend my skill-points and stats very wisely, and i Search for good items, Thus i dont need to farm creatures, just do quests and clear a region. Also, to mention, Randomly at night, ghosts will appear where slayed enemies or NPC's are, you need magic to hurt them. (They do grant XP!)-ENDING IS BAD, and you cannot continue after it, If you want to however, Save before you do the boss fight, common sense.-Game rating is 8/10 for me, For others though, i would say 7/10So what are you doing?! BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												This is a great game. I played it 14 years ago as a teenager, and it formed my dreams for the years to come.I played it again now, thinking that I had emphasized the visions from this game only in my head, just to realize that they were really as amazing as I always thought! A must have for all RPG fans. On par with Oblivion, with a better detailed world and combat.If you are an RPG fan and didn't absolutely love this game, I'll personally refund your money with interest!			"

												If you do not like this game..,,you suck. What a hidden gem, I got it on sale and played it a bit like I do most of the games I buy and then go back to them later and play a bit more. But this game is quite addictive, and I really dont see anything wrong with the graphics. Nice enviroments, somewhat ugly animals but I can live with that. The human characters are a bit goofy but there are so many good things about this game that any not up to snuff eye candy is easily overlooked. Very large map and a good bit of content makes this a sleep killer.			"

												You know... It saddens me to have to say this, but I really didn't like this game very much, and I love open-world games like this.Here's a tip for the programmers: If you want a game that is to go toe to toe with the Elder Scrolls franchise, it would be wise to actually make a game with gender selection in your character creation and have combat that actually... I don't know.... is good.The first problem I have that I will list is a small nitpick, but still a problem in my eyes. The character creation. I understand the hero of the story is canonically male, but so is the Champion of Cyrodiil from Oblivion, but Oblivion still lets you play a character that is female. I don't know if this was just a design choice or if Two Worlds was just TopWare/Reality Pump's first RPG, but.... Why can I only have a male character? That completely limits your role-playing. Why do the siblings HAVE to be brother and sister? Why can't it be two sisters? If you want to make a game that is about playing the way you want like a Bethesda RPG, then allowing the player to have a male OR female character would be a good start.Second is the combat. Particularly the archery part of combat. WHY CAN I NOT STRAFE WHEN USING A BOW? It makes archery almost completely useless and pointless. Hell, I've died multiple times on easy enemies because I tried to strafe like in any Elder Scrolls game to establish distance, but instead ran away, cancelling my bow attack. Melee combat unless you get a good enough weapon is pointless. The only thing that isn't barely functional in this game when it comes to combat is magic. When I buit the hero as a mage, the dude was nearly untouchable.Third, the atrocious animation, dialogue exchanges and the awful voice acting. ""The.Orcs.Having.Religion? ...Bah...!"" Why does it sound like the voice actors were having an off-day and why use King James English so awkwardly? There is a fine art to using the language of medieval speech. The lip-synching is very much off, making the first Godzilla look like Star Wars in terms of mouth movement to the sound of the actor's voice. It also is like the game can't decide if the protagonist is fully voiced or a silent protagonist. When you choose a dialogue option for speech, he doesn't say anything. Yet any other time, he's chatting. Hell, he even gives some bad one-liners when in combat. ""Pathetic."" Or when you come back after dying. ""I live again."" (Or... sorry, that should be,) ""I.Live.Again.""Fourth, for an open-world RPG meant to put Oblivion to shame, the world is actually rather small comparatively.Five, the fact that the game just.... expects you to know all this stuff and who this Aziraal or Aazhizha or whoever, without the slightest hint of an explanation, leaving me like, ""Okay, and I should care about any of this.... why....?"" A bit of depth into the lore of the game's universe would have been nice. Or the game also could have told you that the woman you're off to save was your sister earlier than when you get the note telling you that your sister is alive and well.Six, the story barely makes any sense and feels like a knock-off of the Final Fantasy franchise.On the plus side, the game looks.... pretty good and the armor designs at times are pretty cool. The soundtrack is decent from time to time.My point being.... If you're a fan of games like the Elder Scrolls, there are better games out there than Two Worlds. and the sad part is, the game's not absolutely horrible, it's just..... Mediocre.			"

												I didn't even get past the main menu. Firstly, the game would CTD on startup until I got an old PhysX driver from the Nvidia website.Then the in-game cursor was stuck in place, but I could (extremely inconsistently) move an invisible one around. I tried looking for solutions on forums, but none of them worked. The one which would likely have helped (disabling hardware cursor in the options menu, it helped in the sequel) was unusable, because even after about 3 minutes of trying, I wasn't able to click the interface tab with the erratic invisible cursor.Open world RPGs are notorious for being buggy, but I don't recall ever playing one where even the main menu was completely broken.Combined with a registration DRM, which pretty much asks you to fill out a resume, I have decided this game wasn't worth the hassle. Fortunately, I got it in a bundle, otherwise I would have been really mad. Buy this game at your own risk.			"

												Utter Unplayable Garbage.Which is too bad, because it really does have potential. All the RPG elements are there, and the game tries to give you freedom in your choices, which is also great. There's a ton of armor sets, and the map is frigin' huge. That's all well and good, except it was all programmed by monkeys with keyboards. The combat...oh my lord the combat is horrendous. Seriously, if you're gonna make a dodge mechanic, can I please control the direction in which I dodge? Remember MOrrowind combat? Yeah even this is 10 times worse than that. The visuals are gross, pixel-y, and look like a bad photoshop filter. Horse combat!? Im my MMO, oh please tell me they at least got that right...Nope. The horse combat is ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The horse doesn't control well, and just makes you feel like an idiot charging into a group of enemies. I am gonna play Two Worlds 2 and hopefully find some redemption for this production team. If they were smart, they fired the old team and got a new one. I am really glad I only paid 4.00 USD for the whole package.			"

												Found this game on a Bundle website for $5. Thought to myself, ""What a deal! I've always wanted to play this game it sounds so cool!"", i was sorely mistaken after playing. The size of the download size had me worried, Not even 5 Gb. I woke up this morning stoked to play my new game. Open the game up, and what do you know, a ridiculous activation set up that you HAVE to do. it has the option to do it later, but tells you that you can only play the demo because you won't put in your personal information (I.E. Full name, address, gender,etc.) and is required. I still had my hopes high for the game, thinking that maybe it would be worth the activation hassel. Once again i was wrong. With no sort of tutorial, you are thrown into a place where you don't know the controls and don't even have some sort of direction to go. There is no marker or header telling you what do do. I finally figured out the controls enough to kill a couple guys with terribly choppy comabt and fluency.  Finally I find that the way out was where you started from...wait, what? Yep. Terrible design, no tutorial, no sense of direction, and choppy as balls combat. Maybe the open world will be waiting for me outside this tomb! got outside and was pleased with the evironment for a solid 3, maybe 4 seconds. Then i saw a bear. Well i think it was a bear, it kinda looked like a bear from a nintendo 64 game. Thinking, ""Awh♥♥♥♥♥♥ gunna go kill a bear since it's in the starting area!"", as it comes running at me with it's 4 frame motion run, it ones hits me. In the starting area. Back to the tomb. Played for an hour, unbelievabley disappointed with this game. I think the PS2 game ""A Bard's Tale"" was much better than this game. It definetly had better combat fluency, that's for sure.			"

												Great game. Had it on windows XP and it works great. Got it on steam now for my new PC, but it refuses to work on windows 8.1 pro. Honestly, I'm having a hard time recommending this game on Steam, since the problem seems to be the Reality Pump DRM system, which locks up the game BEFORE i have a chance to enter the game's serial. If this single problem can be solved, either by Valve or by Reality Pump, so their DRM actually WORKS instead of locking up the game, then i'll be more than happy to revise this recommendation.Please, do not be mistaken, the game is great, just this problem is stopping me from enjoying the game on my new PC.

												Originally got this game to play with a friend. Was able to start up the game with no problems. Registration to start the game was not such a big deal as many people have made it out to be. I can not mention anything of the singleplayer as I have not tried any of that. However with multiplayer out of the three available servers that are up, only one of them is working and its a EU server. From there the population of the server is near dead being at the most I have seen around being ten or less people. From there trying to connect with my friend to begin a game together became the problems. Both of us can start up and host a game but neither of us could ever join the other. We have tried every recommended step such as ports, dropping firewalls, bypassing routers, etc. Sadly I discovered that many others have had the same results with no solution.If your looking to enjoy this game with a friend, sadly its a complete risk if it is going to work or not for you. I do not recommend this game on its multiplayer fuctions.			"

												Can't say anything about the game much. First you will run in to a problem, that it will not boot at all, just give you error message, that process just ended its work. Hours later you will find the solution how to fix it on forums. Once you have finished with first quest - there is something even more interesting awaiting for you - Activation. Yes, You cant activate this game. I tried all different settings for internet (I'm not behind proxy, but just in case) - nothing happens. Tried to call the number - can't reach them. Its probably a good game, if you have time to search for solutions how to make it work.  0/10			"

												Ive been looking for a game to play with a couple friends so when I saw this had multiplayer yea I had no problem paying 5 bucks for it, especially after reading the reviews. I kinda just wasted 5 bucks. There really isnt a multiplayer if you look into it. But the game also kinda blows as well. All these reviews keep saying its on the level of Oblivion but for real Id rather play morrowind than this. Obliviona dn most other rpgs tear this game aprt. The combat is awful, the enemies are incredibly hard, the animations really throw me off, the camera sucks, the dialog kills me to hear, and so on. The game does have an awesome amount of weapons and armor though. But the game just feels dead when I play it. The world feels sooo empty for an rpg. It kinda seems like someone was working on a rpg and they had an good idea but were like"" #@!% it I dont feel like touching up al the crappy stuff"" I really wanna like this game and I feel like it has so much potential but I just cant. But for real dont believe all these reviews talking about it being like oblivion and gothic. Theres a reason you've heard all about The Elder Scrolls and you have no idea what Two worlds is besides the fact you saw it was 5 bucks on steam.			"

I've made a terrible mistake.While it is true that I never actually PLAYED the game, the amount of trouble this POS game gave me to get it to actually work was supremely frustrating.  But then the real kick in the jewels is that everything about the game is atrocious.  The graphics, the voice acting, the pacing, the introductory narrative that would have been written better by a prepubescent child completely improvising what's supposed to be the beginning of a riveting adventure story.  The world and the conflict feels cliche and boring.  There was no real character customization beyond an insultingly negligible character skin selection.I wouldn't recommend this game at all to anyone under any circumstances ever.  Unless you hate having fun.  In which case play up.			"

												Not the greatest game, but a damn fine buy at $1.49.I bought this & like many before me, immediately experienced crashing. after checking the forum I quickly found a link to a legacy driver that fixed the issue. I had issues getting my gamepad to work with the game, but conquered that battle. And even after getting the gamepad to work, the game (especially the combat) handles like a monster truck with no power steering. Now don't get me wrong even after all the issues above & the occasional crash (after 20+ I experienced: 1 during gameplay & 1 lock up during exiting the game) this game is pretty friggen good.Combat is a bit clunky. I wish it was as polished as Amalur's, but I wasn't expecting a whole hell of a lot coming into this one. The best I can say for combat is it's passable.Storyline is above average. Not too cliche.Graphics are not horrible for a 2009 release.Audio is pretty damn good. I found my self impressed with the wildlife sounds Top Ware bothered to add.Two Worlds WILL fight with you. Knowing that, would I recommend it at full price? Probably not, there are better games out there more deserving of the $9.99. I would say grab this fast, if it's on sale & you enjoy 3rd person, open world RPGs..... Oh & if you have the patience.			"

												The game itself feels like an old version of Skyrim. However there are so many small things in that game that totally ruin the game experience.For me it felt like the game didn't scale - like it was expecting you to throw  it away after an hour of gameplay.I was a level 65 mage in the end. I had the best possible staff at around lvl 15... Btw. you have 2x10 skill slots, but only 3 of them can contain spells. Most skills are pretty much useless. The AI could be tricked very easily. There were almost no items for high level characters - and the few which where there had the same stats as low level equipment.I could go on about this, but I read that the second part is much better - so I am off to that one :P			"

												First of all, I must say I paid 1 dollar for this game and was aware of what it was (played it some years ago), so I'm not really mad at it and I consider I'm objective.The game isn't all that bad (it is bad, don't get me wrong). I start playing it in a Let's Play and it's fun to play, like a very bad movie is fun to watch.The biggest issue with it is that it's almost unplayable. I had to install nvidia legacy drivers and reboot my computer to launch it the first time. Made 3 episodes of my let's play... Today I want to launch it again, but it doesn't want to :/Also, when it's working, the game crashes a lot. For example I have to load my game while in window 800x600 mode (otherwise it crashes) and only when I'm in game I can go fullscreen with a higher resolution... The game made that easy since everytime I launch it, it's in window 800x600 mode again !Also there's a very intrusive DRM that ask you where you live and stuff like that to activate the game. Apparently you can only install it on 3 different computers before having to ask the game staff to give you more activations. Unacceptable.Concerning the game itself :- The gameplay is kinda fun with some minor issues that stacked together ruins the game : you have to stand still to shoot arrows, melee combat is a random mess- Horses are cluncky as ♥♥♥♥: it's like driving a big australian truck (you can almost hear the BIP... BIP... BIP when you move backward). You can use bows while riding but let's just say you don't want to do that :D- It's not really fluid, voice acting is a disaster (on a furnitures commercial level), the story isn't good, etc etc...Except if you plan to mock the game (and are okay to spend money for a game that will probably not run unless you spend 20-50 minutes on it), don't buy this piece of crap.The game could be good if it was more polished and actually playable (the actual game would be very limit as an early-access title). What a waste :/			"

And, I had heard the odds of cancer forming within my poor little body if I obeyed her wishes. I did not want to get cancer. During the times I refused to go outside because of these two factors, I looked far and wide for quality gameplay. Low and behold, Steam was found. I downloaded Steam. An eager chap I was, wishing to play all the fun and popular games. I avoided cancer at all costs. I did not smoke, I did not partake in any nefarious activities, and most importantly, I did not go outside. It appears my efforts were wasted anyways, as this game gave me cancer.			"

												I know this is an old game, but did the story need to suck such a big time? Well, it does. It's stupid, lame, and childish. This game is not worth 5 minutes of time, believe you me. Bad graphics, bad acting, bad combat system, terrible story that makes no sense, players will not feel they're inside the story, nothing in this game makes any sense. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.			"

												Looking at some of the positive reviews, I didn't give this that long of a chance.  Rough around the edges, yes very much.  I disliked the combat, voice acting was terrible.  I can deal with dated graphics, but it needs good gameplay.  I find the game clunky and not a joy to play.  I don't want to be bothered playing this game any longer than the hour or so I did.  Uninstalled, $2 wasted, could've been worse.  Purchase at your own risk.			"

												Quite possibly one of the worst games I've attempted playing. First off the bat you need a patch/legacy driver fix after that when you manage to get in game it's.....pretty bad. The voice acting sucks, the world around you attempts to kill you before you even get any gear at all and yes I know the graphics are old but they are really bad.......			"

												Alright, I'll start with saying this. I had fun with this game. So why do I not recommend it?  Because it is not for most people. I'm kind of weird, because I love a lot of games many people don't love, so I like this, but not many people will.Here's why...> There are a lot of bugs and glitches, and it is very unpolished. Plus, it is not optimized for newer hardware, and at 1080p, has a bunch of render issues, and is overall a drag to work.> Many quests seem very underwhelming and, while it offers a lot of loot and ""rewards,"" it doesn't seem that satisfying.> This game is a beautiful open world tarnished by crappy writing, poor optimization, and broken gameplay.> Gameplay is confusing and sometimes is broken.> Voice acting is terrible. Don't even bother with it.Overall, it is very dissatisfying. Like I said, I still had fun, and I got this for $1 in an India Gala Bundle with a bunch of other, better games, so I don't have any buyer's regret, but I do not recommend paying full price for this. At least, most people will find themselves dissatisfied.			"

												Why did I even play this game? 1) I hated the wonky controls-Usually in these kinds of games using the keyboard and mouse as a control scheme, the spacebar is jump, but not this one, it is the actioin button. 2) No direction-Seriously, no direction at all. The game starts in this temple place and you have no clue what is going on. Well, granted, I did skip the beginning cutscene, but still, it doesnt really explain much.3) Almost no character creation-Like, what's the point of this games character development? You can only change the hair style and color and facisl features of your character, but thats it, might as well be a predesigned character anyways.Lastly, I could only stomach 30 minutes of this game. There is no map button, there is no easy way to block, the bar at the bottom of the screen doewssnt really work all that well.Bonus-NO TUTORIAL!!!!!!! Do NOT buy or play this game!!			"

												This is shockingly bad it's like the developer hired kindergartners to make the game. The makers of the two worlds series have a very very long way to go before they are in the tripple A zone. The voice acting is akin to something you would see in B movies from the 60's with drunk actors who have severe learning difficulties, The combat looks like something a blind modder came up with.The games only plus side has to be the graphics, To look at it's sort of pretty but thats where it ends, If you value your money then do not buy this garbage, There are so many other games out there than are light years ahead of this.

Ignore the game time, that's me idling to get some card drops.Since everyone's review is ""...it's like Skyrim..."" and ""...glitchy game..."", I'd say the same. Just by looking at the screenshots, it's more like a modded and polished Oblivion. And since the overall review is mixed or below bad, I'd also say the same.

												Finished it at Sunday (Hard difficulty), have some things to say.Cons:1) Turn the voice down ASAP. Horrible, despicable, disgusting VA.2) The script is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bad... I have no idea who tried to make it ""medieval"" with all these phrases like ""pray tell me"", ""pithee"" etc., I just stopped trying to read through these terrible, horrible, damnable lines and just skipped everything. Never lost a thing. 3) Plot is boring, subplots are boring and unrememberable. 4) Horse riding tends to be awkward. Like, AWKWARD round riding.5) Tons of useless NPC, boring names, overall ""i try to be medieval and fail at it"" feeling.6) Almost every encounter can be dealt with jumping around HP/MP shrines.7) Weird animations. Peasants axing the ground? Scything the trees? Pros:1) Really vast gameplay options. Magic? Pretty nifty. Summoning spells helped me a lot. Chaos Rage + Ressurection made lategame into somewhat long, but funny fights with your little armies killing their little armies. You can kill a guy, loot him and ressurect him into the fight (dont take his weapons though). Did not went for combat or archery, cuz i wont be going to play this again. Magic is really funny, honestly.2) Somewhat intriguing world. It is fun to explore it, thought the southern part and the desert are meh. 3) Funny upgrading system. Xzibit must have taken part in it with all this ""I put a sword on the sword to hit them with the sword while i hit them with the sword"".4) Nice alchemy with your own concotions. Overall:If you are all into gameplay - try it.If you are looking the ""R"" letter in this RPG - dont ever look at it.  "

												This game is a disaster.  There are so many things about it that were executed poorly that I have trouble believing it's a finished product.  That said, there are a number of great seeds here, and if they fixed almost everything about the game, it could actually be enjoyable.The voice acting is heroicly awful, it is visually appalling (even for its age), and the dialogue and story appear to have been written by my 8-year-old nephew.  The combat is stiff and impossibly diffucult, and they make traveling on foot pointless within the first hour of the game.  The only reason you should buy this game is so  you can understand that no matter how hard you try, at least you will not have been responsible for releasing this game.It baffles me that it got a sequel, and baffles me more that the sequel might actually be good...

												the voice actors should... be.... firedYou can potentially if you play long enough level up your sword to do a million damage.Poor gameplay in comparison to the elder scrolls series...however the fact the map is big, you cant just instaspawn on places you have not discovered, you have a ""lord of the rings"" type tower in the end of the map! the concept that you enemies dont level up is good meaning in order to get place to place you need to actually do objectives.... even though the objectives are boring.6/10i predict you will give this game a 3/10			"

												Ehhhh. I can't recommend this one. Sure games that have the mobs leveling up with you, still at least try to make things fun and enjoyable, while making you feel like you are getting stronger. This game doesn't do that. The stronger you get, the stronger the enemies get, and its a never ending balance that cannot be broken. It becomes boring rather fast, as leveling in this Epic edition, is Epicly slow. Expect every fight to be a hard one.			"

												Sadly, I cannot say this game was good. It has a lot of good going for it, and at one time during development it may have even been a great game, but it simply has too many bugs, is too glitchy, and has really weird commentary by the characters like saying ""What do we have here?"" every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time you pick a plant. It gets annoying as fast as the small enemy target areas which seem impossible to hit sometimes so it's a lot of button mashing. I bought it on the sale for $1.50 and that was all that made it worth it. Great graphics for its age, and it has some good ideas, but stay as far away from it as possible. Once you're in, you'll be mad at it for life. Oh, did I mention the half hour it takes for the initial start-up of the game, plus giving all your personal information to the developers so they can ""keep you up to date with the latest content""? Yea, major no no.			"

												I cannot recommend this game. I want to, very badly, but I cannot. Yes, even for $2.50, not worth it. The Last Remnant is cheaper and a better challenge, no lie. Anyway, this is why this classic should be laid to rest.Before I could even play the game I ha to download a special driver update because my Windows 7 cannot outwardly play this game. This is despite it being RECOMMENDED as a OS by STEAM. Fail. After the first fifteen minutes was scouring the internet for information I fnally got into the game. Two Worlds was made in 2007, so I forgave the awkward character creation system and lackluster options in hair styles and colors. Even the ""great for its time"" graphic rendering. For me, however, the big let down came when we got to gameplay.Anyone else take notice that it uses Diablo I font type? Like to the ""T"", I wonder if they paid for that font? Anyway, the voice acting began to remind me of a bad early 90's dubbed anime. The actors kept missing inflections of words and botching their lines 'emotionally' and it was just the opening scene! I get to my first objective, kill a few baddies and gain xp and again bad things happen. Three of them come at me, I fire a fireball at the first one then go to swap targets to attack the encroaching second baddie. Wait, how do you change targets? I almost die trying to figure this out and use the awkward ""Q: jump forward, E: jump backward"" dynamic to slay and burn my enemies to proper pulps and ashes.  Afterwards I take a quick moment to alt-tab to Google to find my answer. The answer? You cannot swap targets. Wait, what? Excuse me? A game that requires me to focus attacks and fight multiple monsters not only hasn't figured out how to ""jump and direct"" at the same time but doesn't have a simple TARGETING feature?I'm sure this game was great in 2007, the original Final Fantasy was groundbreaking. Now a days, however, there's so much more that could be and should have been done to this game. The dynamic of spell making and reputation systems are great, but it's really hard to get to that part of this game when it fumbles over every other step. I have Two Worlds II GOTY on my PS3 and a lot of these issues WERE handled. This is why, 2007 was a great year for TW, but not 2014 and not even for $2.50.			"

												A relatively old game, finished it for the second time now, and enjoeyed it more than the first time.What I like+ good graphics for the main character ( the armor & weapons look awasome )+ pretty good graphics for the environment+ action oriented rpg, you don't get to just walk around, you find stronger monsters everywhere + motivational AI: you find monsters that kill you in one shot at first! So you grow stronger, until, in the end you feel like a god ( you fight the same monster, 5 - 10 in number )+ no puzzles ( i don't like them )+ simple but fun combat and spells+ stacking armors/weapons of the same type ( if you find armors/weapons of same kind you can just combine it for something stronger )What I didn't like+ if you use a horse, quick save because you could get stuck in some textures ( rarely but happens )+ awkward control with the horse+ some animations could have been better+ real doge ( you have a back dodge ), but a dodge controlled with arrrow keys makes the fight more dynamic+ end game too easy. I was a god in the end, pre-boss took 5 max hits, and boss 2  hits. + game crashes ( very rarely but happens ). I suggest to use quick save.I recommend the game if:+ you are an action RPG lover ( dislike rpgs with quests where you get 3 flowers, etc )+ can make a compromise with some elements of graphics/animations+ don't like puzzles, because there are none in this gameOtherwise, go and get it, you'll have a lot of funCheers			"

												Very poor game. Hardware-wise it stutters on 9 out of 10 machines you play it on. In terms of gameplay. the world is very open, yet you still feel boxed-in. Horse riding is a total pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ they seem to have their own agenda and don't all-in-all, it doesn't work very well. They bump into invisible walls and take themselves up weird routes. Combat feels completely devoid of consideration, you just repeatedly LClick. You're stunlocked while attacking, so attack once more than you want to (which is way too easy to do) and you'll take hefty punishments from the thousands of mobs you pull just walking through the wilderness. It feels way more like an MMO that only you are playing rather than an RPG - there are far too many mob encounters, meaning it takes forever to get anywhere if you're not the kind to just pull a trail of creeps around with you. The voice acting is ridiculously bad, and the dialogue is cringeworthy. I've played some bad RPGs, but this one takes the cake. I hear the second one's better, though.			"

												Game crashes on start-up, so you have to go to another website and downlaod a driver. After that you have to manually enter your keycode, then they want you to register it (name, address, phone #, birth date, etc.... yeah right, I'm going to give them all that). And to top things off, it won't acivate. Games like this just ruin your day.After another 5 attempt to get it to activate, I come to find out that you can only play multiplayer on European servers, American ones are shut down. I may have seen at any one time up to a whole 3 other people playing it. It suffers from terrible lag.When playing multiplayer, you have to finish all the quests in one sitting, otherwise it restarts all over again.'Oh your connection timed out, too bad, time to start over from the beginning again.' But on the plus side you keep everything you got from the previous session.Co-op is pretty much non-existant, all you share is exp and gold. And all monsters are always in groups of 3.No penalty for dying and I died alot.And to think I bought this game just for the multiplayer portion of it.			"

												I feel that Two Worlds was a great game ahead of its time. A game of complete freedom and total versatality. I have to say if you are looking to purchase this game I recommend that you take a second chace to withdraw and dont. No matter what there is constant lag and very poor AI. If they remade this game with todays engines and resources this game would be one of the best but as it stands its a complete bust.			"

												I really hope this gets on the list of reviews, because it has to be said. I suppose this is the mistake i have made, but don't let this lead you estrange.I've never seen a game try so damn hard to be Elder Scolls and fail so badly at it. That being said, if you can't afford Skyrim, or any of the lesser Elder Scolls games, you'll have to do with this. Don't expect much though, it's very badly made and coming off of Skyrim just makes it worse.			"

												I could talk for hours about how terrible this game is (the awful enemy AI, the horrible horse riding mechanics, the overly large mostly dead world, the terrible combat, the atrocious writing which barely makes sense....I could go on), but instead I'm just going to describe one quest to you. It pretty much sums up what's wrong with this game in a nutshell and might be the single worst designed RPG quest I've ever encountered.So, some guy in a random village wants a curse of  fish monsters eliminated so he tells you to go speak to a Wizard---who sends you to a villager, who sends you to a lady, who sends you back to the villager, who sends you to the Wizard, who sends you to the villager, who sends you to the Lady, who sends you to the Wizard, who sends you back to the lady, who then kills herself for some reason, then you have to go back to the Wizard to finish. Yeah, so basically 20+ minutes of running back and forth listening to♥♥♥♥♥♥dialog. And there are more quests like this!			"

												Don't even know where to begin with this game... It was my childhood favourite game and i loved every single aspect of it, and i had the game from day 1 so to all the people saying there's glitches well you shoulda played back then!:DThis game doesn't need an amazing set of voice actors or incredible HD graphics because it does what all old school games do.. blows your mind with amazing combat and immersion.Not to mention it has so many elements to it:-You're walking down the road and stumble across a bandit camp.-They block your path and demand gold.- (low level character) tells them they should leave before they get hurt and they laugh before charging you-(High level character) doesn't even need to tell them to leave as they're already fleeing for their lives- after scaring or killing the bandits you pillage their camp and find a master locked chest- spends 5 lockpicks trying to open but to no avail- gets rewarded for reaching a lockpicking goal and receives 1 skill point- uses said skill point to level up lockpicking skill- Attempts lock with last lockpick and opens chest first time- about to loot chest and gets chased away by bounty hunters that have been set upon you by a regions guard- get's one shot because hunters are OP- respawns close by and runs for the hills where you find the bandits camped that you scared earlier- befriends the bandits and returns to that master locked chest- your bandit friends help you take out the bounty hunters smoothly- you are accepted by your new bandit friends and live out your days drinking ale and pillaging10/10 still a better RPG than skyrim			"

 #LittleLycanOnSteam   Hello Reader  , If You Are Reading This Review, Don't Keep Your Hopes High As It's Not A Review As Such But My Feelings About Any Games Including This One. I May Have Played Or Not Played This Game, Still I Will UpVote It As I Know How Much Efforts, Blood And Sweat Is Used To Make Any Sort Of Game, Irrespective To Big Or Small, Branded Or Small Devs. I Personally Do Not Have Time To Play All Games, So I Just Idle Them, No Offence, Just For The Cards But I Know That The Game Is Worth Shot Even If Not Worth Our Time As It Requires Tremendous Efforts To Make Even The Simplest Of All Games. God Bless All The Game Developers, You Guys Are Great Because You Guys Make Games And Games Are Life For Gamers And Stressbuster For The Working People. Thank You!- #LittleLycanOnky #January2017			"

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway. "

												If there's anything good about this game, it's the fact that you can complete it in 5 minutes. Thanks to lazy coding you can make some villagers kill Gandohar for you. This triggers the ending cutscene and saves you from several hours of mediocrity. Buy it only if you're a die hard RPG fan, a masochist, or if you enjoy laughing at the pure cheesiness of it all.

												Surprisingly enjoyable little fantasy jaunt! Don't let the low-ish meta-critic scores put you off - its rather good!!  A definite pick up in the sales :DAwesome fun and a worthy challenger to the Elder Scrolls games.  I would honestly say I had more fun playing this than Morrowind & Oblivion - plus I actually put the time and effort in to complete Two Worlds unlike the Bethesda offerings.  Really good fun overall!			"

												I love this game!! LOVE IT! This game is a bit old, sure, but it is so fun to wonder in its world. Exploring is never inhibited by anything else, you want to go see what that tower is for? Go for it. The quests are simple enough to follow and all add to the overall feel of the world.You get to customize your character's abilities as you see fit. For example, I'm a Necromancing Swordsman and I am GOD! In my world anyway. Play it!			"

												This is one game I regret not playing earlier. My first impressions were not good. The game seemed shallow and lacking polish for an RPG by current standards. I convinced myself to give it more of a chance, and proceeded to play beyond my initial dissatisfactions. However, if I were to depict my appreciation for this game on a graph vs. time, it'd look like an exponential curve in the positive ""y"" direction. In other words, I now realize how wrong my first impressions were. The combat looks and feels awkward at first because the character hasn't yet developed any combat skills. In the beginning, the world feels empty and uninspiring because of the sheer scope of it and the fact that the various methods of fast travel haven't yet been realized. The amount of content this game offers is quite possibly more substantial than any RPG I've ever played (even more than Oblivion and Gothic 3). I highly recommend this game. It already has me looking forward to Two Worlds II (the sequel).			"

												Own it on disc and played it for ages but didn't mind paying the £1.50 sale price rather than look for it in the cupboard to give it another go. The animations might be a bit ropey but the visuals aren't too bad. The combat could have been done better and feels a bit dated, using the bow is pretty poor, but if you can look beyond it's faults there is a huge game for the tiny price. Always liked the way you can combine matching items to boost them up (mouse over them in the inventory and if they match they turn green, then just drag 'n' drop). I would suggest using the 'jump-back' key to avoid enemy attacks and survive combat for longer though, especially at the start, and carry a mix of slashing, piercing and bashing weapons with different elemental upgrades. Horses have their own inventory, just stand next to them and get the panel up, use these to solve your storage problems by gathering a few around a teleport site. Doing this and having different ones for different item types makes it easier to collect armour sets etc and to keep matching items to combine them.   Huge world, loads of locations to discover, tons of loot, vast number of quests, hacking down creatures while on horseback, if you want an epic rpg experience and give it the chance it deserves you'll soon find yourself ignoring it's failings and find a good game, get it at sale price and you can't go wrong.

												It's a very underrated title, often looked down upon because it was somewhat similar to ""Oblivion"" back in the day. Personally I think of it like a separate series of game, and I like it. It's a big and solid game with lots and lots of content, and many hours of enjoyment. Doesn't look half bad either to be honest, even though it's slightly dated. There's also community patches to fix certain aspects of the game I believe, since the developer has most likely stopped patching the game all together. I like it, and if you like 3rd person action RPG's with a huge open world packed with stuff to do, you will too. 8/10			"

												Two Worlds Epic Edition (Two worlds 1) is a hidden gem. It is Well worth the sticker price of US $9.99 . Two Worlds Epic Edition plays allot like the Elder scrolls or the Torchlight games. In play style, Two worlds feels like a simplified mix of the two styles. The voice acting is quite good as is the writing and quests. Gold is plentiful, Alchemy is fairly easy, and ""crafting"" is fairly easy. Inventory management is fairly easy suffering only from a few glitches common to most games - there never enough room and this detracts from gameplay. TW1 however makes it easy to teleport around to shops and sell your goods and get back to game play. Two worlds 1 has its own small mod community over at www.insidetwoworlds.com/forumdisplay.php?f=3 IF you want to download one of the mods, I suggest using the Two world control panel - http://www.insidetwoworlds.com/showthread.php?t=26659 . TW also has a mod sdk and nice tools. TW1 really has not seen much mod authoring since about 2007-2008 and the forum while not deserted, lacks the excitement you find in Torchlight or the Elder scrolls games. Using mods is optional in TW1 - its really a nice game on its own.TW1 has a multiplayer mode I did not try.So if you like adventure games, pick it up, as part of the US$5 bundle and don’t feel badly if you pay full price since TW1 is well worth the US$9.99 sticker price!

You will never run out of things to do in Two Worlds because the world is so large. (Unless you get the Strategy Guide).

												(NOTE) This review is dependant on having friends for multiplayer- it might not change your past experiences but give you an insight into how to get good new ones. This game is... Bad.So bad that the single player is entirely not worth it and beyond saving- there's no point to playing it, and as many has said before the voice acting is awful and characters not at all memorable.But that has somehow not made this game a terrible purchase for me. You see, I bought three copies of it while on sale for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles once I saw the multiplayer tag, expecting a few hours of cheap laughter and something to bash on.I got exactly that and more. The combat is -just barely- engaging enough to drag you in, but broken enough to be completely conquered by several players together, at low levels. I've related all the dragging and running from monsters and the fact that melee combat is awful at lower levels to being rather realistic. It's like some strange dark comedy where you run from hordes of wolves, bears, undead, grom, and ghost bears to take to the towns people who of course mob upon it and destroy it in seconds. But while doing this, you'll of course start to grow and gain more and more experience, levelling up in a sort of Dark Souls manner. In fact, the combat of the game sort of reminds me of the souls games, like a simplified version without repostes or other mechanics- but a dodge and parry button can be used, and it can be used well enough that there's a skill cap to melee combat. And you can mold your character however you want past the beginning much like in Dark Souls as well- you want to be an ice mage wearing huge armor? Sure. Sneaky necromancer who stabs people with a spear? Absolutely. It might not hold your hand and it certainly won't be fair at times but that can be forgiven with the strangely mesmeric depth of character possibilities and gameplay on several open world maps, even if you can't change their appearance to begin with past a few sliders that make no sense. For the sake of difficulty, I'd recommend starting as a magic class and then change into whatever you like later on- equipment has no restrictions except for stats and many spells just need a few points into their respective fields of magic. And somehow the game keeps things refreshing even if you lose all progress on a map when you exit the multiplayer session (you can, of course, unlock many maps through progression of the multiplayer and pick up on those irregardless) by having the enemy spawns and loot be interchangeable. One time a encampment of orcs happened to have a sand dragon instead of its usual, far over levelled and idiotic to fight. But we killed it and took its mediocre loot with a sense of accomplishment. Dying means nothing in this game as spawn points are everywhere and they heal you- but it still has managed to be fun? The setting is easily laughable and the characters forgettable but this is a game I can find myself recommending to play with multiplayer and a few friends. It's just enough of a clone to many well known games that you can find yourself having fun while breaking and bending it to your whim. As an example, animals are afraid of many fields of fire magic and you can also easily stun lock enemies with the water magic's AOE capabilities forever, even if when they take damage they unfreeze. Me and my friend has somehow made this challenging in unexpected ways and still had fun seeking adversity. Don't take yourself seriously while playing this game- imagine it like some poorly made table top game that your little sibling/relative made to impress you but somehow manages to entertain you at the same time despite its broken aspects. All in all, the singleplayer is worthless but the multiplayer is a surprising gem with qualities of Dark Souls, Diablo stye looting, and Oblivion small open world maps with quests to deal with. I can't recommend the full price but you absolutely should pick it up on sale for five bucks a copy- it's like a cheesy movie you'll find yourself enamored with.Also, it charmingly included alchemy into a multiplayer game and that seems rather cool to me. TLDR: Buy it on sale for five bucks or less to play with your friends who all have hamachi. You'll get some time of entertainment.			"

												Youtube the theme song if you don't play this game, it's very nice.. I bought this game first on the Xbox 360 when it came out, the story mode is fun and compareing to other games it's a bit lacking but some of it I find funny. Not a game to take seriously just try to enjoy what you can of it. lol			"

												(I know I haven't got a lot of time at all on this game but I played it for a god awful amount of time on Xbox)""Oblivion on Steroids"" - More like Oblivion after being on Meth for a long time, after all its teeth have fallen out. To me this game is so bad that it's great; the terrible dialog, the silly combat animations, the horribly hard to follow plot, they all make this so much fun. And even with all those bad points the game isn't actually too bad when you look at it little by little, it has a large variety of weapons and armour, some of which even look kind of cool. The environment of the game its self is actually a bit pretty on max settings and the map is quite large with a lot of places to explore, there are a lot of side quest separate from the main plot, and the magic system is interesting (Although it's way better on Two Worlds 2)If you're a serious player then this game probably isn't for you, if you like to play for the entertainment value of a game then I wholeheartedly recommend this. I also recommend trying out the sequel, which is of much higher quality than this and it closer to a genuine serious game than this is.			"

The game wants all that♥♥♥♥♥♥like, where you live, your gender, etc. from you + the activation key. You cannot play otherwise.3. You got an eternity of intro before the game starts and then it doesn't give you a real tutorial (it tells me how to walk and how to pick of♥♥♥♥♥♥ i don't know, how I'm supposed to do other stuff, i just need to guess).4.

(Around 5 Hours in)And aside from the big tanking guys that can one-shot you, you will plow through the enemies.You are a mercenary, you do missions for gold and you try to not seem attached. Some quests will do more harm than good for the NPCs. Your main goal is to save your sister, but there is no rush.			"

												Despite the horrible voice-acting and preety generic quests, the game proved to be a enjoyable experience, that is if you manage to get through the first couple of hours of gameplay and get used to the mechanics (You will have a hard time fighting more than one enemy face-to-face, early on, so you will have to kite them around shrines or into groups of friendly npcs).PS: Finishing the main quest will also finish the game, so you won't be able to continue playing with your character without reloading a save-game.

Similar to an Elder Scrolls game in some aspects, but also an MMORPG in the feel of the environment (its single player, mostly) and the way the game pans out. Pretty typical controls, menus and dialogues for an RPG, and the graphics aren't groundbreaking. A satisfactory addition to an RPG fan's collection. ***			"

												Yes this game is broken (Honestly could've done a much better job with it), but it is not a bad game. Very fun to run around and kill everything in the game(Within reason of course ~ Joke lol), and overall a fun grind'em up. The voice acting is an atrocity that kinda makes it a comedy more or less. So, with that in mind, it's like playing a comedic rpg where the story isn't super serious. But here's where it gets really good. This game has almost an ENDLESS amount to upgrading and leveling up and such. There really are few limits to what you can do when you want to upgrade your armor and such. There are a ton of weapons and armor, albeit with some similar designs, but nevertheless this game is quite a good play. Not I wouldn't recommend buying it market price, but when it is on sale for around 99 cents, you should take it up. Quite the good game to pass time.			"

												...no doubt worthy of being called ""a modern-retro classic,"" if such a term may be applied to something other than 2D pixels...Regarding multiplayer: Only one server based in Europe is active. Textures are prone to spazzing, Creatures will float if near an edge (i.e. cave walls/stairs up a tower), The horrible connection (am using Hamachi, have done all I know to do) reduces melee combat to ""I can't even 'Jump Back' (dodge) since it never registers proper (get hit before or right after having done so - as in, enemies warp to you because of the lag, so it's futile to try), just rush, respawn, keep rushing."" TO BE SURE, it seems the longer you stay in-game, the stronger the connection becomes. Not sure of how much sense that makes but both my friend and I have noticed it; patience is necessary.Despite all that, I feel this game does not deserve the terrible reviews it has garnered; perhaps I'm a dope for being satisfied with it, perhaps others expected too much of it. This game is reminiscent of the Souls games + Oblivion; the gear and progression is apparently like in the Souls games (so says my buddy, I've not played them much) - the environments are straight out of Tamriel. There is a bare minimum of hand-holding; every time I play the game, I learn something new. If the combat/connection was tweaked a little tighter, I would no doubt be playing the game constant. There is a sequel though, and it is seriously mind-blowing how much better it is (though some of the tweaks are for the worse).You can combine gear of the same type to strengthen it; you can learn any skill you want to - can respec your character - though it might just be better to pay the 500 gold (not so steep after a few levels) to make a new one. ALSO, BE SURE, after your first character, TO GO BUY EVERY SKILL YOU WANT WHEN YOUR NEW CHARACTER IS LEVEL 0 - each skill costs 100 gold from the beginning, but after a few levels, it goes from 1,000 to 10,000... so yeah.For what it is, and the discounted price of $1 - if you have great patience and the ability to find fun in a game's faults (none quite so game-breaking, have crashed only once, because of Steam, not the game), Two Worlds is worth consideration.Should you get it, addressing your choice of Class:Recall what I said about melee, if you want to be a Knight/Barbarian - be patient and bear in mind it is an old game (if nothing else, go to single player, I had zero issues in the short time I tried it); You must spend ALL your points in Archery should you wish to be a Thief/Archer  (otherwise you will literally connect one out of a hundred arrows, if that many) - Dexterity is required to use some of the better shields; Wizards are, as always, badass - I don't think you need a robe or a staff to cast, so up your magic appropriately then get strength so you can use armor.Really, unless you are going as a wizard, Strength and Dexterity (of course Vitality every couple levels or so) deserve the most attention; though the Wizards are overpowered, it seems much of the gear is inclined to melee, or at least STRONG, characters.EDIT:

												Two Worlds is not the horrible game I was led to believe it to be. It's also not a good game in any respect. The game has some decent ideas, but in the end it fails on every front.The graphics are a mixed bag; environments look decent considering the year the game was released (it looks very similar to the environments found in Oblivion, to the point where it almost looks plagiarized), the character models and effects however are disastrous, looking like upcaled 5th gen models running at 10 fps. The sound fails in all respects. I can't think of a single track from the game. The only thing I can recall just a day after beating the game is the annoying low health sound.The story premise starts interesting enough, but plays out extremely tediously and dull. The ending is the most uneventful I've ever seen in a game.If you're a die-hard RPG player that has run out of other games to play during a dry spell, give this a try. Otherwise, stay far away and play another game for your RPG fix.			"

												Great game ! Right up there with elder scrolls. I like Two Worlds  better than oblivion and equal with morrowind. The graphics are a bit dated but not that bad - like xbox 360 era graphics. Its a little slow getting started but you level fast so the talent tree will have you growing more powerful in no time. im level 29 at the moment and there are still areas in the game i will not survive. I think the main story is good and i enjoy the side quests/stories as well. lots of reviews are complaining about the voice acting....its not that bad at all. ive definitely heard worse !   I highly recommend this game i got in in a package deal "" Two Worlds collection"" im glad i played this first before jumping right into the more modern Two Worlds 2. its really a great adventure worth playing. if you like elder scrolls type games you wont want to miss this. The only thing that had me frustrated at first is the registration.  If you have a PC that has onboard graphics and hgh powered video card it will probably auto run the game to the onboard if its decent ( i have HD 4600 which is impressive for onboard ) anyway when i tried to force my high powered video card to run the game, the game thought i was trying to register the same game code on a different computer and wouldnt allow me to log in. so make sure you force the correct video card to run the game before you register,			"

												Two Worlds Epic Edition (Two worlds 1) is a hidden gem. It is Well worth the sticker price of US $9.99 . Two Worlds Epic Edition plays allot like the Elder scrolls or the Torchlight games. In play style, Two worlds feels like a simplified mix of the two styles. The voice acting is quite good as is the writing and quests. Gold is plentiful, Alchemy is fairly easy, and ""crafting"" is fairly easy. Inventory management is fairly easy suffering only from a few glitches common to most games - there never enough room and this detracts from gameplay. TW1 however makes it easy to teleport around to shops and sell your goods and get back to game play. Two worlds 1 has its own small mod community over at www.insidetwoworlds.com/forumdisplay.php?f=3 IF you want to download one of the mods, I suggest using the Two world control panel - http://www.insidetwoworlds.com/showthread.php?t=26659 . TW also has a mod sdk and nice tools. TW1 really has not seen much mod authoring since about 2007-2008 and the forum while not deserted, lacks the excitement you find in Torchlight or the Elder scrolls games. Using mods is optional in TW1 - its really a nice game on its own.TW1 has a multiplayer mode I did not try.So if you like adventure games, pick it up, as part of the US$5 bundle and don’t feel badly if you pay full price since TW1 is well worth the US$9.99 sticker price!

												Tworlds: Epic Edition is actually a fun game. I came into the game knowing that it was not the best game, not what it was hyped up to be, and I enjoyed it. It is much better on pc than it was on console. There is no combat lag that I could tell, and the combat reminded me of dark souls which I had a ton of fun playing.The game is only $3 on the Black Friday sale and is a great buy for anyone who is into RPGs and is looking for another one to add to their collection. The game has its bugs and glitches, but if you can look past them I know everyone will enjoy the game. The best part about knowing that it is a bad game is that you can laugh at stuff that happens like the dialogue and some of the combat mechanics and noises.			"

												Two Worlds is not the horrible game I was led to believe it to be. It's also not a good game in any respect. The game has some decent ideas, but in the end it fails on every front.The graphics are a mixed bag; environments look decent considering the year the game was released (it looks very similar to the environments found in Oblivion, to the point where it almost looks plagiarized), the character models and effects however are disastrous, looking like upcaled 5th gen models running at 10 fps. The sound fails in all respects. I can't think of a single track from the game. The only thing I can recall just a day after beating the game is the annoying low health sound.The story premise starts interesting enough, but plays out extremely tediously and dull. The ending is the most uneventful I've ever seen in a game.If you're a die-hard RPG player that has run out of other games to play during a dry spell, give this a try. Otherwise, stay far away and play another game for your RPG fix.			"

												I first came across this game in a website article about the worst RPG games of all time.  Being a conniseur of the truly awful and noble defender of that which is unjustly labeled so, I must say that this is indeed a good game.  It is not an Elder Scrolls game, nor does it try to be.  It is however a fun game.  the unique item upgrade system whereby stacking an item on top of an identical item makes a stronger item.  This made looting more fun and strategic, do you lose the weaker sword in favor of the better sword? or do you keep the weaker sword because you know it's more common and could be upgraded to be more powerful than the better sword?  Weapons have slashing, bashing, or pearsing damage.  And enemies have different resistances to each, and not mild resistances either, it's a case of 'look it's a skeleton, should I use (A) a sword and half a dozen health potions and kill it in about 15-30 hits, or, (B) a club no potions and kill it in 2-3 hits.If anything, the game reminds me of an open world titan quest with 3rd person view and WASD movement.Tons of side quests and one of the only games where being the brave hero type can screw over innocent people.This game is often on special and it only cost me $1 something.Buy it, relax and have fun.

												This game has lots of visible potential that I really like about it, but it does not come without flaws. The environments look really good, especially for the time this game was made, and the music is pretty good as well. The story is a joke though; it doesn't make much sense at all, and things just kind of happen.The gameplay is simple enough to get used to, and you'll probably find yourself invested in it at some point. There's a cool sense of progression because of your ability to constantly find good weapons and armor not just from the stores, but as enemy drops and treasure. The voice acting and animations in general are really bad, but this becomes VERY entertaining.Overall, it feels like a somewhat hackneyed cash-in on the things that the Elder Scrolls series was pulling that didn't quite work out for Reality Pump, especially due to the amount of hype it had generated prior to its release. But all of that is past, and we can now appreciate it for what it is, rather than what it should have been. And for what this game does well, I believe it deserves a second look. Don't know if I would pay the standard $10 for it, but if you can get it for a good price, you might be surprised.			"

I will be playing it more in the future.. I just need to get my hands on Two Worlds 2. The game itself is... Well... A little shabby. It's not bad, but not amazing. It leaves you wanting more.

												Well the game is one of those games you really hate even if you really try not to. The first time I tried it was at launch on a 360 that means that I had to load every few steps so I remembered a much longer game that what I saw this time (My computer doesn't load ever few steps, it is actually quite smooth)Short versionIs this game really cheap right now? I mean dirt cheap, steam sale cheap $2Do you have a free wekend ahead and nothing else to do?Do you want dual cleavers called ""run dodo run""?Want to relive 2007? if you answered yes to any go ahead get it, if not well you are going to keep wondering how bad could it be.The goodWell you can get Katanas♥♥♥♥loads of armors and weapons (Seriously MMO ammounts of them)Crafting, enchanting and the likes - those may be the norm now but they were something new back then.The badQuests are badQuests are brokenLike 4 kind of enemiesRepetitiveAny combat other than magic and meleeVoice actingThe so bad it is goodVoice actingYou are way too overpowered in combat untouchable if you learn how to dodge right. That means you can finish the game at level two if you dodge and attack (May take a while to do enough damage though)If you get mad at a quest just kill everyone in town you will fail the quest but you get to level up, loot their corpses finding anything you needed.

												Own it on disc and played it for ages but didn't mind paying the £1.50 sale price rather than look for it in the cupboard to give it another go. The animations might be a bit ropey but the visuals aren't too bad. The combat could have been done better and feels a bit dated, using the bow is pretty poor, but if you can look beyond it's faults there is a huge game for the tiny price. Always liked the way you can combine matching items to boost them up (mouse over them in the inventory and if they match they turn green, then just drag 'n' drop). I would suggest using the 'jump-back' key to avoid enemy attacks and survive combat for longer though, especially at the start, and carry a mix of slashing, piercing and bashing weapons with different elemental upgrades. Horses have their own inventory, just stand next to them and get the panel up, use these to solve your storage problems by gathering a few around a teleport site. Doing this and having different ones for different item types makes it easier to collect armour sets etc and to keep matching items to combine them.   Huge world, loads of locations to discover, tons of loot, vast number of quests, hacking down creatures while on horseback, if you want an epic rpg experience and give it the chance it deserves you'll soon find yourself ignoring it's failings and find a good game, get it at sale price and you can't go wrong.

Personally I think of it like a separate series of game, and I like it. It's a big and solid game with lots and lots of content, and many hours of enjoyment. Doesn't look half bad either to be honest, even though it's slightly dated. There's also community patches to fix certain aspects of the game I believe, since the developer has most likely stopped patching the game all together. I like it, and if you like 3rd person action RPG's with a huge open world packed with stuff to do, you will too. 8/10			"

There's a cool sense of progression because of your ability to constantly find good weapons and armor not just from the stores, but as enemy drops and treasure. The voice acting and animations in general are really bad, but this becomes VERY entertaining.Overall, it feels like a somewhat hackneyed cash-in on the things that the Elder Scrolls series was pulling that didn't quite work out for Reality Pump, especially due to the amount of hype it had generated prior to its release. But all of that is past, and we can now appreciate it for what it is, rather than what it should have been. And for what this game does well, I believe it deserves a second look. Don't know if I would pay the standard $10 for it, but if you can get it for a good price, you might be surprised.			"

												Open world RPG similar to the big name games like Oblivion but with a smaller budget. Two Worlds takes you into a large open world with tons of quests, numerous monsters and a wide range of weaponry. It reminds me a lot of the Divinity games which are equally entertaining and fun if you're looking for a low budget, cheaper alternative to the popular Oblivion franchise.			"

												Well the game is one of those games you really hate even if you really try not to. The first time I tried it was at launch on a 360 that means that I had to load every few steps so I remembered a much longer game that what I saw this time (My computer doesn't load ever few steps, it is actually quite smooth)Short versionIs this game really cheap right now? I mean dirt cheap, steam sale cheap $2Do you have a free wekend ahead and nothing else to do?Do you want dual cleavers called ""run dodo run""?Want to relive 2007? if you answered yes to any go ahead get it, if not well you are going to keep wondering how bad could it be.The goodWell you can get Katanas♥♥♥♥loads of armors and weapons (Seriously MMO ammounts of them)Crafting, enchanting and the likes - those may be the norm now but they were something new back then.The badQuests are badQuests are brokenLike 4 kind of enemiesRepetitiveAny combat other than magic and meleeVoice actingThe so bad it is goodVoice actingYou are way too overpowered in combat untouchable if you learn how to dodge right. That means you can finish the game at level two if you dodge and attack (May take a while to do enough damage though)If you get mad at a quest just kill everyone in town you will fail the quest but you get to level up, loot their corpses finding anything you needed.

												The games rather retro, the voice acting/script is horrid - not so much the voices as the script they are forced to follow. Ugh. But it distracts only a little. The controls are a bit odd, but thankfully you can customize some. There's a hotbar, but the F7 one is set, use one of the others to customize your own way. The storyline is playable, there's plenty of freedom to roam about. But make sure that you can deal with the wildlife... they tend to see you as something to kos if you are anywhere near them. Take the time to get the feel of fighting, it's not just a stand there and hit type of game. You need to move or you'll go down will little effort on the attacker's part. Upgrade your items as often as you can, grab what you can brew and make sure to be careful what you put together when your experimenting. There's all sorts of things you can make...All in all, it's not a bad game, rough sure... but not bad. There's no comparing it to today's games, since it was made some time ago. But I don't think it got the attention it should have when it came out. There are lots of forgotten gems like this one out there. The new one Two Worlds 2 picks up some time after this one ends... I started playing it, but I wanted to find out the backstory to it. That's why I'm playing this one. Hope that you'll give both of the games a chance. I'm glad I did... even though I'm not really one for retro games. "

												Two Worlds Epic Edition is an okay game. I've had both Two Worlds and Two Worlds 2 on the Xbox 360 and have enjoyed it immensely. When I saw it for sale on Steam, I couldn't resist. I will be playing it more in the future.. I just need to get my hands on Two Worlds 2. The game itself is... Well... A little shabby. It's not bad, but not amazing. It leaves you wanting more. The multiplayer is probably the best feature since you can keep everything you earn. (Not the PvP.. The story mode.)			"

												Despite the horrible voice-acting and preety generic quests, the game proved to be a enjoyable experience, that is if you manage to get through the first couple of hours of gameplay and get used to the mechanics (You will have a hard time fighting more than one enemy face-to-face, early on, so you will have to kite them around shrines or into groups of friendly npcs).PS: Finishing the main quest will also finish the game, so you won't be able to continue playing with your character without reloading a save-game.

												Great game ! Right up there with elder scrolls. I like Two Worlds  better than oblivion and equal with morrowind. The graphics are a bit dated but not that bad - like xbox 360 era graphics. Its a little slow getting started but you level fast so the talent tree will have you growing more powerful in no time. im level 29 at the moment and there are still areas in the game i will not survive. I think the main story is good and i enjoy the side quests/stories as well. lots of reviews are complaining about the voice acting....its not that bad at all. ive definitely heard worse !   I highly recommend this game i got in in a package deal "" Two Worlds collection"" im glad i played this first before jumping right into the more modern Two Worlds 2. its really a great adventure worth playing. if you like elder scrolls type games you wont want to miss this. The only thing that had me frustrated at first is the registration.  If you have a PC that has onboard graphics and hgh powered video card it will probably auto run the game to the onboard if its decent ( i have HD 4600 which is impressive for onboard ) anyway when i tried to force my high powered video card to run the game, the game thought i was trying to register the same game code on a different computer and wouldnt allow me to log in. so make sure you force the correct video card to run the game before you register,			"

												I know this got bad reviews and a lot of people hate it. It is a glorified hack and slash in an open world. I have always had a lot of fun with it though. I like the alchemy that uses rare ingredients to add permanently to your characters stats. I like picking an armor and a weapon and finding as many copies as possible to boost them. The voice acting and copywriting is pretty bad, but the premise is ok. The graphics are not the greatest but are not as bad as some people say. To me they don't have to be picture realiztic for a game to be immersive...but then I did play Zork at maximum verbosity back in the day so maybe I'm used to using my imagination.Bottom line. I have fun with this. I have replayed it several times over the years. And I paid 99 cents for it on Steam. There's no down side there.			"

												Tworlds: Epic Edition is actually a fun game. I came into the game knowing that it was not the best game, not what it was hyped up to be, and I enjoyed it. It is much better on pc than it was on console. There is no combat lag that I could tell, and the combat reminded me of dark souls which I had a ton of fun playing.The game is only $3 on the Black Friday sale and is a great buy for anyone who is into RPGs and is looking for another one to add to their collection. The game has its bugs and glitches, but if you can look past them I know everyone will enjoy the game. The best part about knowing that it is a bad game is that you can laugh at stuff that happens like the dialogue and some of the combat mechanics and noises.			"

												Before starting the game up, I recommend, or at least you will need to (if you have an Nvidia graphics card) download a certain driver to even be able to start up the game. After you download the driver, the game turns out to be okay, IF you buy it on sale. I bought mine for a dollar and I think it was worth it. But don't spend the full price for it. It's just not worth it. Think of it as a poverty version of Oblivion, with overly difficult enemies, and an AWESOME weapon and gear upgrading system.			"

												Non-serious review:You can just ressurect whoever you want when your air magic skill is full and you own the resurrection spell.Even your resurrected enemies go friendly and help you in combat.I murdered an entire village for necromancers... I resurrected all of them. They don't care that I killed them, or even acknowledged that I resurrected them...Went back to the necromancers and killed all of the necromancers except for one, who for some reason chose not to fight me. Even though he witnessed me murder all of his brethren, he still welcomed me... Killed him... Resurrected them all... Pretty much all of them are scared s**tless of me now...10/10Would resurrect everything (and betray people) again.Serious review:To start of, this game is amazing. But, unfortunately, the cons mask the actual game. However, if you can get past those cons and ignore it, the game is actually one of the best RPGs I have played in a long time, and if the series was to come back with much better features and a more developed lore (the lore is pretty good though), it could actually rival the Elder Scrolls series. No joke.Note: The game starts of rather slowly and you're quite weak, but if you put the time and effort in you can become a tank. The best part is that even as a tank, you'll still find certain parts of the game difficult.Plot and basic story neccessary gameplay:The plot's quite simple. It's a lets save a damsel in distress kind of story, except the damsel is actually your kidnapped sister and you go on some crappy wild goose chase to find her. Despite it being crappy and starts with some rather unneccessary bits, it's still actually quite good. One thing I like about this game is the fact that you can't just go and hammer the main quest straight through right away. You will be forced to do side quests and kill some more basic enemies to become strong enough to fight the enemies you will encounter on your adventures (Tip: Save when fighting hard enemies (At the start and mid-fight when you've taken a substantial amount of the enemy's/enemies' health down) and use the jump back ability to avoid the enemies swings. Powerful enemies can kill you with just one damn hit). Anyway, so your sister's been kidnapped by some weird mysterious cult like group and you try to track her down. You then get sent on quests by this cult to obtain items they want in return for your sister. Your character also comes off as quite an ignorant fool to the cult as he does not believe in the legend of his ancestors and his family legacy. The two endings are quite anti-climatic, but still fairly interesting. Oh, by the way, there is 100% no problem with this unless your somebody who gives a damn about being able to change your characters gender, but you have to be a man unless playing multi-player. There's no problem with that for me as I don't care about my character's gender in a game.Gameplay:The game features a fairly basic combat system but I still found it fun. I can't really go into much detail, but sometimes, fights do seem quite action packed. There is also a basic but interesting skill system, a developed alchemy system, and a simple but helpful weapon and armour upgrade system. The roleplaying system is quite basic but fun as well. There is also a faction relations system which is too easy to earn trust with but is a nice touch nonetheless. The multiplayer mode is basically just parts of the map from the single-player game (there are several to choose from) but with different quests and characters and it's playable with friends. It's essentially a free MMO thrown in with the single-player game. Or you can choose an arena mode which is much different and much like any other arena deathmatch game. Magic is also featured as a key point of the game. Quite a few bugs are bundled in with this game to give you the ""man-we-must-have-rushed-this-on-a-cheap-budget-but-hey-it's-still-quite-good"" feeling. And as mentioned above in the non-serious review... You can resurrect everyone... Like literally everyone... That's god damn fun!Graphics:Well, it's very mixed. The graphics are certainly dated but do sometimes look fairly attractive. Rarely, but they can. The render distance is horrible though. Just ewww, devs. I feel incredibly short-sighted and by that I mean the short-sighted kind that can only see objects randomly appear when close enough. Y'know, the kind which doesn't exist. *shivers* Er... Just thinking about it gives me the chills!Music:Actually really suprisingly interesting and engaging. It usually fits the atmosphere but can sometimes take a while to fit in (for example, I may have peaceful music on when fighting an enemy as I had just been adventuring peacefully for a while). The main theme (the name escapes me, unfortunately) really matches the game and it's plot. It actually feels like the depth of the song goes quite deep. Look it up on YouTube. It's really good. The finale music at the end of the game is really quite thrilling and action packed.Voice Acting and voice related content:So this is the main criticism for the game, in most peoples opinions. But actually, not mine. I actually really enjoyed the almost always cheesy voice acting. It actually sometimes felt quite good! xD The player's voice is actually really bad♥♥♥♥♥in my opinion! Unfortunately, it is cheesy and can ruin the atmosphere, so that's a quite a con right there. I enjoy the way in which the developers thought of using old english such as ""'Tis"", ""Mayhap"" and ""Pray"". It really fits the medievel stlye of the game.Game world and lore:One of the most amazing things about this game is the sheer size of the world. It's massive and really engaging. The lore is also incredibly engaging, in fact, there's so much I can't share it all with you. So I'll put in a few words of what it features:GodsAncientsMedieval themesRoman-like themesFantasy themesLot's of different kinds of enemiesFaction relationshipsCivil war-like scenario (Skelden House vs The Karga Clan)Orc vs Humans scenarioNecromancersMages guild (The Society)And much much more.Pros: Engaging world and lore.Nice gameplay mechanics.Massive world.Amazing music.Can resurrect eveything if you feel bad about killing things(!)!Mixed:Voice Acting. The cheesy and bad voice acting gives the game some humour and does actually sometimes sound quite good, at least to me. The world's not supposed to be mega-humouress and it wasn't intentional, so it doesn't quite fit with the game, but it's still not awful. It could definitely be better though.Basic principles of graphics. Not too awful for the time this was released. (Well actually, they even updated the graphics at a later date to improve them as release graphics were awful).Cons:Render distance. Seriously... That is bull s**t on modern hardware - in fact, even for the time of release it was awful...Starts a little too slow with player character development.Too easy to earn trust with factions.Bugs... That s**t was completely unneccesary... You may not encounter them too often, but when you do... They're horrible.The game crashed on me once... I had to restart my entire PC. :(Overall judgementFor time of release (with original graphics (I've only seen these in images though)): 6For time of release (with improved graphics): 8Now: 7.5Give it a go when it goes dirt cheap on sale. I mean, I got it for £0.69 or something. One of the best purchases I have ever made. I did once play this game on the XBox 360 though.			"

												How are one suppose to rate this as a good game? The story is dreadful and moves at the pace of a snail. I have never had any issues with the dialog, just press space and read the quest objective if you're so picky. The worst part of it is when you have become overpowered because of your insane permanent potions, sticking 2 swords together and rubbing gemstone on the blade sensually. It isn't that buggy, when your foe dies the ragdoll is amazing and may glitch. Monsters hiding inside walls (still killable from the right angle) and you accidently venture into some old mans sex dungeon and he bends you over a table and... (metaphor for getting owned by strong monsters). However, I still loves this game, it is senseless and fun and allows more freedom than so many other games. You heard about the rebels, go inside their camp and kill them if you'd like. 8/10 for good memories and much laughter			"

The voice-acting isn't the thing that's bad (although it's not great either), the writing is :), not sure what atmosphere they were trying to evoke, but the wording is quite awkward. If it's on sale for a buck or two, why not give it a chance, better than some games I paid $50 for, installed, played for 5 seconds (not counting load times, intro screens, opening movie, etc.) and then uninstalled, never to touch again.

												I know this got bad reviews and a lot of people hate it. It is a glorified hack and slash in an open world. I have always had a lot of fun with it though. I like the alchemy that uses rare ingredients to add permanently to your characters stats. I like picking an armor and a weapon and finding as many copies as possible to boost them. The voice acting and copywriting is pretty bad, but the premise is ok. The graphics are not the greatest but are not as bad as some people say. To me they don't have to be picture realiztic for a game to be immersive...but then I did play Zork at maximum verbosity back in the day so maybe I'm used to using my imagination.Bottom line. I have fun with this. I have replayed it several times over the years. And I paid 99 cents for it on Steam. There's no down side there.			"

												Tworlds: Epic Edition is actually a fun game. I came into the game knowing that it was not the best game, not what it was hyped up to be, and I enjoyed it. It is much better on pc than it was on console. There is no combat lag that I could tell, and the combat reminded me of dark souls which I had a ton of fun playing.The game is only $3 on the Black Friday sale and is a great buy for anyone who is into RPGs and is looking for another one to add to their collection. The game has its bugs and glitches, but if you can look past them I know everyone will enjoy the game. The best part about knowing that it is a bad game is that you can laugh at stuff that happens like the dialogue and some of the combat mechanics and noises.			"

												I didn't understand what people were trying to say in their reviews when they said that this game was flawed, but enjoyable. i get the concept of 'so bad they're good' movies, but thought the concept didn't apply to video games. This game changed my mind. I don't have any long-lasting great nostalgic love for this game, but I do like it, not joking. There are so many things wrong with this game, my first impression was awful - mostly due to the overly-invasive registration garbage, stiff combat, a glitchy map system and an undescriptive quest log. But the cheesy cornball acting and questing for loot kept me going. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a hidden masterpiece. This isn't a fulfilling RPG experience on-par with the Elder Scrolls - despite numerous quotes to the contrary - but if you don't take it too seriously you might have some fun riding through forests cutting down orcs for their pocket change.I do think this game is more worthy of play than it's successor, as TWII lost the charm of the original and somehow made the controls, map and quest log even worse.

												I want to give this game a negative review, but I can't bring myself to do it as I have not played enough yet. However, I will state that within the first hour of gameplay I had no idea what it was that I was doing. Hardly any tutorials, and no direction nor motivation to do anything. just go, so i did. I'm sure there was some sort of story that I missed but to be truthful what little story they gave bored me to the point that I just didn't care. I really tried hard to enjoy this game, but I cant even sit down and play it more then an hour before I get bored. I will give this game a positive review for the open ended aspect, and the non watered down combat that we are all so used to.			"

												Great game ! Right up there with elder scrolls. I like Two Worlds  better than oblivion and equal with morrowind. The graphics are a bit dated but not that bad - like xbox 360 era graphics. Its a little slow getting started but you level fast so the talent tree will have you growing more powerful in no time. im level 29 at the moment and there are still areas in the game i will not survive. I think the main story is good and i enjoy the side quests/stories as well. lots of reviews are complaining about the voice acting....its not that bad at all. ive definitely heard worse !   I highly recommend this game i got in in a package deal "" Two Worlds collection"" im glad i played this first before jumping right into the more modern Two Worlds 2. its really a great adventure worth playing. if you like elder scrolls type games you wont want to miss this. The only thing that had me frustrated at first is the registration.  If you have a PC that has onboard graphics and hgh powered video card it will probably auto run the game to the onboard if its decent ( i have HD 4600 which is impressive for onboard ) anyway when i tried to force my high powered video card to run the game, the game thought i was trying to register the same game code on a different computer and wouldnt allow me to log in. so make sure you force the correct video card to run the game before you register,			"

												This is a pretty standard fantasy RPG game, once you get the Legacy Physx drivers(read the forums, it's all over there.) The landscapes can be beautiful, some of the trees rival Skyrim.The character animations are so clunky and repetitive, though, I'm reminded of a poor version of Double Dragon. The voice acting is awful. Just awful. Again, the play is fun. Nothing unique, but it sometimes helps to play a game you haven't played a billion times through.If you like this sort of game, you'll like this game, if you can forgive it's glaring flaws.			"

												Non-serious review:You can just ressurect whoever you want when your air magic skill is full and you own the resurrection spell.Even your resurrected enemies go friendly and help you in combat.I murdered an entire village for necromancers... I resurrected all of them. They don't care that I killed them, or even acknowledged that I resurrected them...Went back to the necromancers and killed all of the necromancers except for one, who for some reason chose not to fight me. Even though he witnessed me murder all of his brethren, he still welcomed me... Killed him... Resurrected them all... Pretty much all of them are scared s**tless of me now...10/10Would resurrect everything (and betray people) again.Serious review:To start of, this game is amazing. But, unfortunately, the cons mask the actual game. However, if you can get past those cons and ignore it, the game is actually one of the best RPGs I have played in a long time, and if the series was to come back with much better features and a more developed lore (the lore is pretty good though), it could actually rival the Elder Scrolls series. No joke.Note: The game starts of rather slowly and you're quite weak, but if you put the time and effort in you can become a tank. The best part is that even as a tank, you'll still find certain parts of the game difficult.Plot and basic story neccessary gameplay:The plot's quite simple. It's a lets save a damsel in distress kind of story, except the damsel is actually your kidnapped sister and you go on some crappy wild goose chase to find her. Despite it being crappy and starts with some rather unneccessary bits, it's still actually quite good. One thing I like about this game is the fact that you can't just go and hammer the main quest straight through right away. You will be forced to do side quests and kill some more basic enemies to become strong enough to fight the enemies you will encounter on your adventures (Tip: Save when fighting hard enemies (At the start and mid-fight when you've taken a substantial amount of the enemy's/enemies' health down) and use the jump back ability to avoid the enemies swings. Powerful enemies can kill you with just one damn hit). Anyway, so your sister's been kidnapped by some weird mysterious cult like group and you try to track her down. You then get sent on quests by this cult to obtain items they want in return for your sister. Your character also comes off as quite an ignorant fool to the cult as he does not believe in the legend of his ancestors and his family legacy. The two endings are quite anti-climatic, but still fairly interesting. Oh, by the way, there is 100% no problem with this unless your somebody who gives a damn about being able to change your characters gender, but you have to be a man unless playing multi-player. There's no problem with that for me as I don't care about my character's gender in a game.Gameplay:The game features a fairly basic combat system but I still found it fun. I can't really go into much detail, but sometimes, fights do seem quite action packed. There is also a basic but interesting skill system, a developed alchemy system, and a simple but helpful weapon and armour upgrade system. The roleplaying system is quite basic but fun as well. There is also a faction relations system which is too easy to earn trust with but is a nice touch nonetheless. The multiplayer mode is basically just parts of the map from the single-player game (there are several to choose from) but with different quests and characters and it's playable with friends. It's essentially a free MMO thrown in with the single-player game. Or you can choose an arena mode which is much different and much like any other arena deathmatch game. Magic is also featured as a key point of the game. Quite a few bugs are bundled in with this game to give you the ""man-we-must-have-rushed-this-on-a-cheap-budget-but-hey-it's-still-quite-good"" feeling. And as mentioned above in the non-serious review... You can resurrect everyone... Like literally everyone... That's god damn fun!Graphics:Well, it's very mixed. The graphics are certainly dated but do sometimes look fairly attractive. Rarely, but they can. The render distance is horrible though. Just ewww, devs. I feel incredibly short-sighted and by that I mean the short-sighted kind that can only see objects randomly appear when close enough. Y'know, the kind which doesn't exist. *shivers* Er... Just thinking about it gives me the chills!Music:Actually really suprisingly interesting and engaging. It usually fits the atmosphere but can sometimes take a while to fit in (for example, I may have peaceful music on when fighting an enemy as I had just been adventuring peacefully for a while). The main theme (the name escapes me, unfortunately) really matches the game and it's plot. It actually feels like the depth of the song goes quite deep. Look it up on YouTube. It's really good. The finale music at the end of the game is really quite thrilling and action packed.Voice Acting and voice related content:So this is the main criticism for the game, in most peoples opinions. But actually, not mine. I actually really enjoyed the almost always cheesy voice acting. It actually sometimes felt quite good! xD The player's voice is actually really bad♥♥♥♥♥in my opinion! Unfortunately, it is cheesy and can ruin the atmosphere, so that's a quite a con right there. I enjoy the way in which the developers thought of using old english such as ""'Tis"", ""Mayhap"" and ""Pray"". It really fits the medievel stlye of the game.Game world and lore:One of the most amazing things about this game is the sheer size of the world. It's massive and really engaging. The lore is also incredibly engaging, in fact, there's so much I can't share it all with you. So I'll put in a few words of what it features:GodsAncientsMedieval themesRoman-like themesFantasy themesLot's of different kinds of enemiesFaction relationshipsCivil war-like scenario (Skelden House vs The Karga Clan)Orc vs Humans scenarioNecromancersMages guild (The Society)And much much more.Pros: Engaging world and lore.Nice gameplay mechanics.Massive world.Amazing music.Can resurrect eveything if you feel bad about killing things(!)!Mixed:Voice Acting. The cheesy and bad voice acting gives the game some humour and does actually sometimes sound quite good, at least to me. The world's not supposed to be mega-humouress and it wasn't intentional, so it doesn't quite fit with the game, but it's still not awful. It could definitely be better though.Basic principles of graphics. Not too awful for the time this was released. (Well actually, they even updated the graphics at a later date to improve them as release graphics were awful).Cons:Render distance. Seriously... That is bull s**t on modern hardware - in fact, even for the time of release it was awful...Starts a little too slow with player character development.Too easy to earn trust with factions.Bugs... That s**t was completely unneccesary... You may not encounter them too often, but when you do... They're horrible.The game crashed on me once... I had to restart my entire PC. :(Overall judgementFor time of release (with original graphics (I've only seen these in images though)): 6For time of release (with improved graphics): 8Now: 7.5Give it a go when it goes dirt cheap on sale. I mean, I got it for £0.69 or something. One of the best purchases I have ever made. I did once play this game on the XBox 360 though.			"

												Despite the universal negative criticisms, Two Worlds Epic Edition is actually a decent Action RPG. Fans of the Gothic series may find themselves at home in this expansive world.If you think a game relies heavily on appearances (graphics, animations, etc), then this will not be a game for you, as the game clearly shows its age, even with the graphics maxed out. But if you can enjoy a game simply based on the game itself, give it a try.There's a large variety of skills, weapons, and armor to really fit your playstyle. While there is no traditional blocking, you can dodge attacks by moving or hopping out of the way, making combat really focused on watching your enemy and taking advantages of their openings. And it can be VERY challenging.In fact, most enemies will likely overwhelm you by either brute strength or numbers. The key is to not get hit. Essentially, by dodging and maneuvering around attacks, a level one character could take down ANYTHING with enough time and skill. The longer fights can get very intense, especially in one-on-one combat.Suffice it to say, Two Worlds Epic Edition is not a bad game at all. That doesn't mean YOU have to like it, but I encourage you to give it a try. If even $10 seems like too much for you to spend to try out a game, I suggest waiting for a sale.Just like with Two Worlds II, I would suggest sticking to the multiplayer if the singleplayer story doesn't interest you that much. The multiplayer allows you to create your own character with a good variety of options (including races and gender) and gives you large maps in which to go and quest! Guaranteed hours of fun, even if you play it alone. (Yes, you can enter maps by yourself in multiplayer. Playing with other people is not required, but encouraged!)			"

												Got it for €10 on Xbox 360, ran pretty poor on it so got it for PC, saw little difference, runs kinda shakey even with a computer well able to handle it. Good game over all, somewhat comically cheesy. Can't really compare it to any Elder Scroll game but you kill everything you see, you loot everything you see hack n' slash your way through it all not bad but ain't great or revolutionary!			"

												You spend 50% of the time exploring, 25% killing enemies and 25% visiting the shopIt has an interesting mechanic where you can combine equipment with the same name to improve it.You get overpowered so easily. (Around 5 Hours in)And aside from the big tanking guys that can one-shot you, you will plow through the enemies.You are a mercenary, you do missions for gold and you try to not seem attached. Some quests will do more harm than good for the NPCs. Your main goal is to save your sister, but there is no rush.			"

												The original version of this game with its endless item stacking was much more fun to play. Very unique. Then they patched it became just an above average game, though worth playing. Sadly the downward trend continued with the sequel.			"

												I didn't play a lot of this game, but I don't like it.1. To even start the game, you'll need to uninstall Nvdia Physix first.2. The game wants all that♥♥♥♥♥♥like, where you live, your gender, etc. from you + the activation key. You cannot play otherwise.3. You got an eternity of intro before the game starts and then it doesn't give you a real tutorial (it tells me how to walk and how to pick of♥♥♥♥♥♥ i don't know, how I'm supposed to do other stuff, i just need to guess).4. For a game of 2009 the graphics are bad as hell. Really, the characters of half Life 2 from 2002 looked better than these guys.			"

												Graphics:From a mere visual standpoint, this teeters on the better end of ""average"". It has common problems of its genre and time, such as touchy ragdoll physics, lackluster animations (outside of combat), foliage that appears and disappears with movement, props that frequently expose unfinished portions of themselves, and way too much bloom. Enemies also sometimes appear from thin air when I enter an area too quickly. Compounding this is an odd sort of strobe effect on movement animations, that would not look out of place in Quake, that can directly influence gameplay (especially horses, but I'll get to that later). On the flip side? The world is deceptively large, and allows for long-distance observation, by not resorting to permanent hazy filters or ridiculously short draw distance, as well as exploration, to every nook and cranny between the large mountains that make up the edges of the map. This will take the player to plenty of locales, such as mountain forests, jungles, and deserts, each of which feels atmospherically unique. Combining this with intense visual effects and minute texture detail, this is a game that can and will look stunning when it really wants to.Sound:Aside from the simple sound effects, this game's audio is original Deus Ex tier, in both good and bad ways. Bad, in that the voice acting is pretty forced, but still tries hard to have its special charm, while delivering dialogue of a similar caliber. Good, as in the music is a combination of regular RPG ambience and stuff that's good enough to listen to outside of the game. Of course, you won't hear it unless you go to the settings menu and crank it all the way up. It seems as though somebody thought it was so embarrassing that it deserved to be hidden by generic enemy grunts and the main character's quipping, which is a shame because the music's variation, subtle undertones, strong meters, and bizarre instrumentation make it an absolute treat to listen to even when not playing.Customization:Impressively deep, the game allows the player to toy with every aspect of his character, from looks to equipment. Armor not only includes variations by type, but variations within specific types, as well as an ability to combine identically-named equipment to produce stronger variations, and this is all on top of bonus statistics and resistances. Alchemy allows the player to brew potions and weapon upgrades from scratch. The magic system lets the player use spells that can be strengthened by adding more of the same type, using boosters, or using bonuses from other spells or pieces of equipment. This all congeals to create a character that uniquely fits the player's gameplay preferences, an experience I haven't had with this depth in a video game since Morrowind. Unfortunately, my feelings don't entirely extend to the skills list. While it is impressive to have so many skills, many of them are important parts for certain gameplay styles (the ability to silently kill enemies, for example), and some of these are locked at the beginning, requiring the player to conform to a different style until he comes across the NPC who will unlock said skill. The hotbars can also be a pain to set up.Combat:I found the combat to work fine in one-on-one situations, but the game rarely gives those out, instead focusing on battles against hordes of enemies which are often slowly beaten using a ""one step forward, two steps backward"" sort of approach that limits the depth that is readily available. Melee attacks are similar to those of the game ""Enclave"", putting animation in front of effectiveness, but here the problem is ameliorated slightly due to generally being directed at enemies even without specific directional commands, and still allowing movement during said attacks. This works to hamper the combat as well, though, as I sometimes find myself accidentally ttacking allies, or using the backstep when surrounded by enemies, which will launch me right back into them. Every other approach to combat seems to supplement the melee, as it can be challenging to get the range necessary to use bow exclusively, and magic is somewhat weak for the majority of the game. Towards the end of the game, where the difficulty takes a sharp increase, the clear lack of enemy scaling sets in, and many battles will become too easy, or too hard.Horses:Gave it its own section because of how weird they are in this game. Mounted combat works well because of the extra range given to weapons while on horseback. However, the horses themselves can be hard to control. They have a tendency to steer themselves, regardless of which direction I want to go. At first I thought it was just an elevation issue, but it's also happened over small props and pathways. The ""strobe effect"" I mentioned earlier takes away some control when the horse is moving at slow speeds. Though the horse is often faster, I find myself walking on foot most of the time, because I know I can go over terrain that the horse will not.Quests:I don't mind a little investigation, but when confronted with a locked, unpickable door, I would at least like to be pointed in the right direction to open it. While the main story offers a great deal of freedom, going so far as to tackle the objectives in any order I wish, the sidequests often required to complete these objectives (and even those that aren't required) can be hard to figure out. For most of the experience, I am left with far more questions than solutions.If I'm locked out of a faction stronghold because my reputation with them isn't high enough, can I at least be told where to find someone outside the stronghold who can increase my reputation? If I'm told to go into a cave as part of a quest, can I please open the door to get into said cave? If not, can I please be directed to someone who will give me the key? Is there a reason the NPC vital to this quest has not spawned yet?This is how the open, choice-driven quest system shoots itself in the leg. A distinct lack of explanation can make it tough to complete some of the objectives without an outside source.Factions: The faction system can barely be called as such. In short, it only provides small benefits that may not actually be reflective of the player's actions in the world.For example, during the Karga-Skelden section, I sided with Skelden, and had to improve my rep with them. One such required quest told me to intercept someone who was stealing documents. I was not given a location, a name, or anything else. I decided to check a guide, which told me that the NPC would only spawn if I started a certain quest for Karga. So, I go to their stronghold, and the guy at the gate tells me to get lost. Clearly, he would not let me in unless I killed him, or had increased my reputation with Karga. Out of utter indifference, I kill him, enter the Karga camp, and start the quest to spawn the NPC I need. I obtain the documents, kill the guy who had them, and keep going with Skelden's quests. Eventually, this led to Skelden wiping out the Karga stronghold completely, allowing me to walk into the deepest part of their base and take the item I needed. It was at this point that I checked my faction relations chart, and noticed that my reputation with Karga was 2/10. As far as I know, every faction relation starts at 0 and cannot go any lower.Really? 2/10? I directly caused the events that led to the elimination of Karga, and they still think I'm a 2/10 human being? Like, what did I do to deserve those points? The one quest they gave me, I betrayed them.For its flounderings in the major categories of combat, quests, and factions, I can understand why some people don't like it. Personally, I think that the depth, customization, and scale shines through, and even though there were some moments that infuriated me, there were more than a few moments at which I sat back and felt satisfied with what it did right. Good game.Also, taint.			"

												Although at first glance this game seems quite lame, it holds hours of fun. At the start of the game things go a tad slow, you're just another average joe, and the tutorial is sub par. However, once you gain a few levels, and discover the inner workings of the game it becomes one of the best RPG experiences I've encountered.Suggestions for your Enjoyment-Magic is very weak early game. Build up your sword arm-Alchemy is very useful, some ingrediants provide permenant bonuses (if it's a gem or mineral pair it with healing so you           don't get a magic dmg stone for your weapon -Equipment that is the same can be combined into each other to make one better one ( two longswords?

												(I know I haven't got a lot of time at all on this game but I played it for a god awful amount of time on Xbox)""Oblivion on Steroids"" - More like Oblivion after being on Meth for a long time, after all its teeth have fallen out. To me this game is so bad that it's great; the terrible dialog, the silly combat animations, the horribly hard to follow plot, they all make this so much fun. And even with all those bad points the game isn't actually too bad when you look at it little by little, it has a large variety of weapons and armour, some of which even look kind of cool. The environment of the game its self is actually a bit pretty on max settings and the map is quite large with a lot of places to explore, there are a lot of side quest separate from the main plot, and the magic system is interesting (Although it's way better on Two Worlds 2)If you're a serious player then this game probably isn't for you, if you like to play for the entertainment value of a game then I wholeheartedly recommend this. I also recommend trying out the sequel, which is of much higher quality than this and it closer to a genuine serious game than this is.			"

												Two Worlds is not the horrible game I was led to believe it to be. It's also not a good game in any respect. The game has some decent ideas, but in the end it fails on every front.The graphics are a mixed bag; environments look decent considering the year the game was released (it looks very similar to the environments found in Oblivion, to the point where it almost looks plagiarized), the character models and effects however are disastrous, looking like upcaled 5th gen models running at 10 fps. The sound fails in all respects. I can't think of a single track from the game. The only thing I can recall just a day after beating the game is the annoying low health sound.The story premise starts interesting enough, but plays out extremely tediously and dull. The ending is the most uneventful I've ever seen in a game.If you're a die-hard RPG player that has run out of other games to play during a dry spell, give this a try. Otherwise, stay far away and play another game for your RPG fix.			"

												Where to start? The controls for PC are poorly optimized (having played this on both 360 and PC). The combat system is more screwy than anyone should have to wrap their head around. The plot is atrocious, and the content of the game is repetative and generally junk. All this could even possibly be forgiven..... If... just if the creatures in the game ACTUALLY RESPAWNED. Yes. You heard it right. Nothing in this game respawns. Once an area is cleared of monsters, they are gone forever. Not that it really matters, because this is one of the ONLY open-world games where when you complete the main quest, the game simply ends. And not even in a satisfying manner. Seriously, avoid at all costs. The ONLY good thing to come from this game is the ridiculously good menu theme music. Which is the only reason I give this game a 2/10.			"

I actually wanted to start playing Two Worlds 2 but this game came cheap in a package so I decided to give it a good try.I guess my main problem is I was expecting it to be similar to Gothic 3 but it isn't.  The combat in Two Worlds is a tad too hack n slash for my taste.  Combat became sort of repetitive after a while.  Also, the sound effects are a bit corny as if the reverb is turned up.  Keeping up with the myriad of inventory choices and item upgrades became a chore.  The friggin horse is hard to steer also. I'm starting to nitpick now.Anyway,  I could have continued playing but there is so much out there that's better.			"

												After reading most of the reviews i decided to give this a try and found out that it wasn't so bad as mentioned.  If you are a person who is picky about the gameplay, AI intelligence, etc... then i would admit that this would probably make you want to play another game rather than spend time playing it.  However, If you are just looking for a game to explore an open world type of RPG and can create your own adventures without playing a linear story, then i would definitely recommend this as i had a fun time myself just doing what i wanted. I must admit though, that the horse can be stubborn when going down certain hills or at certain edges of terrain sometimes and the game has crashed once or twice whilst i was in the middle of saving but it was one hell of an adventure.  At the end of it all, for me, i found out that i could summon two times the amount of any and every creature i wanted (at least 6 types of creatures at one time though there is a max limit) whilst i was against the last boss but i think you can do the same anywhere anytime as long as you unlocked that specific water magic spell.  Overall, this was worth it for me because i did what i wanted and not had to stick to the story line to get the relic stones (I rode all the way down to the bottom of the map at the beginning and slaughtered a few bandits, dead knights, beasts and orcs along the way).  I would recommend it for open world adventurers (who would just like to have fun whilst fighting unknown dangers) and first timers who are new to open world RPG games just so they can have a taste of what it's like.  Also, there's no harm being the bad guy in a game and going against the rules with power in your control every now and then.  :)			"

I find i enjoy it more than two worlds 2.  Bigger world, more to do. Enjoyed it on Xbox now get to enjoy it again on pc. downside is no controller with the game. But once you get used to the keyboard and mouse it's not all that bad. No customization your human male, can accidently make your guy look like a walking corpse, or on purpose =p.

												I rember owning this game before I even knew steam exsisted, remembered as soon as I seen the opening view in the temple. Your guys runs at a different pace then the floor scrolls by, there is no accel or decel when you move(even the original gothic had that) not to mention i spent 20 min just trying to get a stupid registation code that finaly came to my email. I really wanted to like it back then, was the first game that I actually didn't enjoy playing.			"

												This is a Review for the PC Game Two Worlds The Epic Fail Edition50 Cons :1.♥♥♥♥♥♥Poor Animations.2.♥♥♥♥♥♥Poor Voice Acting.3. Horrible Dialogue.4. Horrible game storyline.5. Idiotic side quest storylines and downright illogical continuations.6. Lame movespeed with no sprinting.7. Mediocre character. Never felt like playing his role. Hes a jackass for all I care.8. Couldnt select female character for some reason. I thought this was an RPG.9. The towns at the beginning of the game have no women or children, they just have grown old men with lots of hair on chest.10. Horse whistle sounds like bird chirping. It is what a sparrow sounds like, not a human being's whistle.11. Horses move like cars, when they are running towards your whistle they slide towards you.12. Turning around a horse is like turning around a car only difference being you are either on full speed or you STOP completely and move around then press forward.13. Stiff horse animations get you stuck everywhere.14. Horse combat is almost impossible to do right.15. Sneaking is an active skill and not a character movement thing.16. Combat is ridiculous.17. Hit detection does not exist.18. Protagonist's sister is the most unattractive female in all of Tamriel. (Because I bet nobody remembers what the world in Two world's is called)19.

												It reminds me a LOT of Gothic 3 in all the good and bad things about it. It has a huge open world, no monster respawning, even the leveling system and the effects of some spells just remind me of Gothic 3. But it just made the same mistakes as the creators of the third Gothic, it just somehow lacks in storytelling and I just cannot get immersed into its world, maybe it is just something that happens with such a huge world. Personally that was also the case for me with Oblivion and Skyrim.<beginning_of_a_personal_nostalgic_note>I really miss the days of playing Gothic 1 and 2, because they had relatively small worlds and a band of NPC friends (funny I still remember even some of their names after over 8 years - like Diego, Fester, Milten, Gorn).And it is not just because of the voice acting, let's be honest the voice acting in gothic 1 and 2 wasn't perfect.</end_of_personal_nostalgic_note>Yeah and as for the weapons it reminds me a bit of Borderlands. There is a ton of weapon and armor models with more or less randomly generated stats + enchantments, so the final effect is, that there is practicaly an infinite number of their variations. That turns most of the progress into that weapon-stat game, where you will never have the best possible weapon or armor, there is always something stronger that can be generated by the all-powerful RNG.Verdict:I think the ""mixed"" summary that it has as of the day I wrote this review fits it well. So if you liked Gothic 3 get it, you will not be dissapointed it is almost the same in terms of gameplay. So overall I recommend it on a (-50% or -75%) sale.			"

												I enjoy the game. The voice acting is kinda meh. Horse control sucks. but there is just something about the game that is good fun. Love robbing everyone. giving them a little pay off. which always seems to be they want 75% of your gold. But despite it's flaws its still quite fun to play. I find i enjoy it more than two worlds 2.  Bigger world, more to do. Enjoyed it on Xbox now get to enjoy it again on pc. downside is no controller with the game. But once you get used to the keyboard and mouse it's not all that bad. No customization your human male, can accidently make your guy look like a walking corpse, or on purpose =p. Map is hard to follow. Combat is ok. Pretty great game. I would recommend giving it a try when its nice and cheap again. ^_^			"

												My recommendation is ONLY for the DRM free version, which you get elsewhere but sadly not on steam!!!Such a shame, the game was killed off by a greedy publisher with one of the worst (and first) DRM in gaming history. And with (limited) oline activations. Cancelled with every tiny change in the system. After 3 or 5 times you had to PHONE the support and beg for another activation.The Steam version still has key and online activation. I dont know, to which extend the DRM crap is still in it..Because underneath this it's actually a very nice open world RPG. Good story, Very big open world with lots of stuff to do and find. A good skill system. A interesting crafting system. And it doesn't even look too horrible today, given his age. Some animations are a bit strange and the voice acting isn't too great. Having said that: it looks better then morrwowind.It was always in the shadow of the elder scroll and gothic games. And sure has it's rough edges but not too much. But concept wise it's not too far from the elder scrolls games.PS: Invisible mouse pointer bug (only buttons higlighted, no keyboard control in menu)  with controller connected: blindly click your way to  interface options and turn hardware cursor off. It has controller support apprently but the option only appearred for me after registry fiddling (trying to turn hardware cursor off outside game, which i couldn't). You got to choose at game start, no flying swapping.PPS: Via registry editing full 21:9 support in 3440x1440. Hello Skyrim.			"

												So bad it is strangely addictive...I first played this game on the xbox years ago, then on the pc. I have more hours than my record shows but have still not completed this game. I am  huge fan of Skyrim, Fallout, those types of RPG. This game is nowhere near as good graphically, mechanically, or story-wise. If you are looking for a polished, immersive RPG, then avoid this.However, if you have a wry sense of humour, and this is on sale, it's worth it just to experience how awful the voice acting and dialogue are. The story is a bit random - got to find your sister who is being held hostage by somebody or other, and kill goblins and bears en route. The fighting is pure button mashing. But the loot system lets you combine item after item, making your armour and weapons really strong, so you can pretty much one-hit things eventually.So, ignore the bugs, put your tongue firmly in your cheek, and revel in the ""Ah! It's raining!""			"

												If you like a good fatasy rpg then this is a good game. It's s cheap 10$ game. Most reveiews when doing pros and cons talk about the stale converstaions and clunkcy battle actions. I often remember this is Pre skyrim. So there is no mass amount of modders altering everything. Yes the characters in it aren't all eye candy or spouting 720 hd but the game is from 2009 so it should be given a little slack for it what it is. It's a good game and for the price should be worth it. If you have friends it can be even better because it doesn't say it but there are Online fetures and this game was one of the first that tried to hybread into a mmo. The mmo part is mostly dead but's still alive.			"

												For maybe the first 30 minutes or maybe the first hour I can safely say that I hated this game. I hated it mostly because of how the graphics really weren't the best, I didn't really get the point of the game, and the voice acting was pretty bad. The thing is though, you really should not look at this game through the lens of comparing it to Skyrim, which was what I did at first. After maybe the first hour and completing a few quests you probably will start to appreciate the game and start to like it a lot. All in all, -10/10 Would highly recommend			"

												I like the game, but do not purchase the collection if you want to purchase the strategy guide (at least until Steam fixes whatever problem there is with the collection).I think the game is great, and there are so many ways to play it.I do suggest refraining from doing too much with regard to things that will gain you experience levels till you get trained in every skill (the basic training for each skill will cost you gold). There are a few things you will need to do at the beginning, like the starting quest, and the quests to get the teleporters working. After that, don't kill anything you don't absolutely have to (just pick locked containers for loot to sell for gold, and steal horses from enemies for storage - at least that's my starting strategy). Finding the trainers may mean sneaking past a lot of enemies and looking in a lot of places, but it's worth it.I like the scenery, the combat isn't too challenging (for someone who'd rather be looting and exploring than fighting), but you can get killed if overwhelmed (not a big deal, since you get revived at the nearest health shrine).The quests can have you doing a lot of running here and there, and there are several factions you can side with (all at once), try to keep that decision for as late in the game as you can, so you can accept as many quests from both sides as possible.My only disappointment is, you cannot side with the Orcs.PK			"

												It's really not that bad of a game, guys. You can't compare it by todays standards and be fair, but eevn so, it's not that bad. It's not complicated, it looks decent, and is fun. I know what everyone means by it's ""charm."" It's slightly cheesey, but it seems like it's on purpose. It's trying to be super mdeeival or something. It kind of reminds me of playinh D&D.Ultimately, it's an inexpensive, simple, pretty good-looking fantasy game. I bought it for stupid cheap as something to♥♥♥♥♥♥around on, and I am satisfied. Of course I'm glad I paid next to nothing forit, but I would have paid more and been just as happy.			"

												This review was on the strategy guide only.It originally said:The game may be okay but DO NOT buy the strategy guide.  It will not download for many and they provide ZERO support.  I've owned it since 3/21/16 and have been trying to get help to actually install the guide for two weeks..My new edit:After months of trying to find help on the issue I've come to realize they screwed up on their process.  When I purchased the Epic Edition they added the Strategy Guide to my library but it would not download.When I would try putting it in my cart it would say I already owned it so I went round and round with Steam, Topware, and the forum Dev for months. BUT, now I think I understand what happened through no help from any of the support areas...They had the purchasing part screwed up and it was giving the Guide when it should not have.  The download portion however knew I didn't own it so wouldn't download it.  They finally fixed it so now when I add it to my cart it no longer shows that I already own it and it no longer shows on my owned DLC page.So, they screwed up, took months to fix it, and didn't explain♥♥♥♥♥♥but I won't hold it against the guide/game any longer.

												Let me get this straight from the start:This game is not a good one, it is old, poorly optimised, has a pretyy boooooring story and mechanical flaws.Yet this game was one of the first ones to introduce me to RPGs and that's why I love this game. I've first had it in 2008 or 2009 as a demo from a gaming magazine and I've played that demo day and night at 15 FPS on my bucket-like-pc for about 20 hours. Years later found it again and finished it 2 times in the same year and today I'm on my 3rd playtrough of this game and I love it.It is a fun game, the fun comes from the side quests, the magic system, the bugs and because you can get overpowered quickly.

 Two Worlds: Epic Edition Review === Rating: 3.5 / 10 - Greatness forsaken, and forever left unfinished ===GRAPHICS: 8 / 10Honestly, for being a game from 2007, graphics are very good. Textures are mostly detailed, there is AA, FOV, good particle effects, well done enemies... models of people are kinda deformed sometimes, but the game more than makes up, on this side at least, with very well done armors, weapons and environments.SOUND: 6 / 10Well, the sound design is average, no shame and no glory. The main theme music deserves a mention because it's very good, then the in-game ambience and sounds are average. GAMEPLAY: 3 / 10The gameplay part of this title is really flawed by major problems. I will just say this here and then focus on detail later in the review.LONGEVITY: 9 / 10If you are a completitionist, to find everything the huge world has to offer will take you a very long time. There are a myriad of quests and secret dungeons to discover, no doubt about this. === The Good - Very large world to explore, there are really a lot of dungeons and places to discover, cities to visit and stuff to loot in said places.- Great variety of weapons, armors, crafting materials and accessories, there are around 250 different sets of armor and something around 150 different weapons, which is not bad at all.- Complex and rewarding alchemy system: combine the elements you find from nature or defeated enemies to create custom potions with effects based on what you put in them. Even combine potions with each other to create more powerful ones.- Decent number of spells and character skills- Good variety of enemies: undeads, wild animals, constructs, demons, golems, dragons, and more- Cities are quite crowded and you can enter almost all buildings, plus there are many vendors and skill trainers around=== The Bad - Horse travel is crippled by major problems, and is the only way to explore undiscovered areas quickly. Horses have bugged pathfinding, will get stuck randomly, are very clunky and will stay where you left them in the world. The problem with this last thing is that the Call Horse command does not work if you are farther than around 50 metres from your horse.- The world may be huge but is really empty. Most of the time exploring, it will just feel like travelling in a demo map with some trees, rocks and some props. The world does not feel alive and linked together as it should be, but instead feels like dungeons and cities put inside a vast nothingess with no interest apart the occasional wild animal or alchemy herb. Very limited interactivity and dynamicity of environment in the overall game world.- NPCs in the cities are always the same 5-6 models, it will happen to see the same NPC models over and over very quicly, even groups of them being just plain clones. All NPCs will answer the same 3-4 default questions and have nothing characterizing them apart from few main quest characters, all the rest is just a bunch of generic placeholders just there to trade or give quests. Immersion and RP experience is really downgraded because of this.- Externally, cities are all the same, big dark brown stone walls, doesn't matter if the city is Nanic, Human or whatever other race. Zero characterization of racial buildings in this aspect.- Enemy AI is rudimental and will just follow the player to attack him, ranged enemies will run away if a melee player gets too close. enemies lack any semblance of coordination or group support actions such as ie. mages healing fighters and similar. Huge mobs of enemies can be carried around indefinitely. Enemies will just attack the player on sight without any role-playing interacion or eventual faction alliegances, there are allies by default and enemies by default, no grey in the middle, and that's it.- Zero role-playing decisions player-side. Each dialogue is scripted and apart from general questions about some characters or the world, there is no reallly matter of choice in anything, just accept or decline an assignment, with no depth in choices or branching of events during any quest.- Combat system is clunky and just underwhelming: melee characters will just have to swing a weapon until low on HP, drink all the potions they want and just keep spamming attacks until everyone is dead. Ranged classes can just run away from the enemy, then stop, aim, fire, and then run away again before the enemy can target them. Potions can be spammed so challenge is zero because as long as you have money to buy potions you are good.- Economy is broken: you can pick up all the stuff an enemy has on him, then when you are full of stuff go to a city and sell everything for massive amounts of money even from early game. You also can go and travel to a high level area, go to a random merchant, and buy crystals / potions / rings / anything with no level restriction of 20 levels ahead of you and just use them right there. Merchants will also havfe unlimited money and buy everything, always.- There is a skill to get bonus damage against enemies riding horses. But in the game there is no enemy ridiing a horse. There just isn't. I put this just to get you an idea of how half-finished this game really is.=== The Ugly - Alchemy is completely game breaking: ingredients can be combined to make potions, but also different potions with the SAME effects can be stacked. Example, you make 5 potions, all of them give you a Bonus to Strenght attribute, right, but all of them have a different name and a slight difference in the bonus, example: they give +10,+11,+12,+13 and +14 Strenght. Well you can drink ALL of them together and get ALL of the bonuses TOGETHER, for a total, in the example, of +60 Strenght, this applies to any potion you can imagine. Basically, when the game gets hard, just drink all the potions you have created and become a demi-god for a short time, kill anything, and done.- Weapon upgrading is aswell completely game breaking: you can stack an unlimite damount of upgrade crystals (which grant a % of bonus damage based on the element they are) on a weapon, so if you have like 50 upgrade crystals, which can be found easily or created with alchemy, you can put all of them on a weapon, getting a +10% damage bonus 50 TIMES. So that weapon will become just ridiculous.- Healing shrines ruin combat: in the world there are many, TOO many healing shrines, which will give the player a very high health regen over time. They are on many roads and even inside dungeons. fact is, you can make enemis follow you and stay inside a healing shrine to fight, so you will have health regen and be near invincible, but enemies will not have the bonuss and so your fight will be really easy. Same thing goes for Mana shrines if you are a mage, same principle but with mana, so unlimited power.- Inexplicable random stuttering inside cities or in crowded combats, even on recent computer system, this is a result of bad optimization on the overall game engine both graphical and coding-wise.- Main quest and side missions are just anonymous, uninvolving, poorly written and underwhelming, sketched, half finished, poorly refined.=== Conclusions Some aspects of Two Worlds are well done, almost too much well done, like the incredible number of weapons and armor, or the variety of enemies, or the principle upon the alchemy system is based,. But, as i explained, a lot of other aspects have been butchered with poor realization, badly thought out balance and gamaplay implementation, or just left there half finished.This is a game with GREAT potential, which has been released unfinished like a lot of today's Early Access games, because in the end this is an early access game, an alpha, a demonstration of the potential this game COULD achieve if it was finished fully.

												After reading most of the reviews i decided to give this a try and found out that it wasn't so bad as mentioned.  If you are a person who is picky about the gameplay, AI intelligence, etc... then i would admit that this would probably make you want to play another game rather than spend time playing it.  However, If you are just looking for a game to explore an open world type of RPG and can create your own adventures without playing a linear story, then i would definitely recommend this as i had a fun time myself just doing what i wanted. I must admit though, that the horse can be stubborn when going down certain hills or at certain edges of terrain sometimes and the game has crashed once or twice whilst i was in the middle of saving but it was one hell of an adventure.  At the end of it all, for me, i found out that i could summon two times the amount of any and every creature i wanted (at least 6 types of creatures at one time though there is a max limit) whilst i was against the last boss but i think you can do the same anywhere anytime as long as you unlocked that specific water magic spell.  Overall, this was worth it for me because i did what i wanted and not had to stick to the story line to get the relic stones (I rode all the way down to the bottom of the map at the beginning and slaughtered a few bandits, dead knights, beasts and orcs along the way).  I would recommend it for open world adventurers (who would just like to have fun whilst fighting unknown dangers) and first timers who are new to open world RPG games just so they can have a taste of what it's like.  Also, there's no harm being the bad guy in a game and going against the rules with power in your control every now and then.  :)			"

												Let me get this straight from the start:This game is not a good one, it is old, poorly optimised, has a pretyy boooooring story and mechanical flaws.Yet this game was one of the first ones to introduce me to RPGs and that's why I love this game. I've first had it in 2008 or 2009 as a demo from a gaming magazine and I've played that demo day and night at 15 FPS on my bucket-like-pc for about 20 hours. Years later found it again and finished it 2 times in the same year and today I'm on my 3rd playtrough of this game and I love it.It is a fun game, the fun comes from the side quests, the magic system, the bugs and because you can get overpowered quickly.

 Two Worlds: Epic Edition Review === Rating: 3.5 / 10 - Greatness forsaken, and forever left unfinished ===GRAPHICS: 8 / 10Honestly, for being a game from 2007, graphics are very good. Textures are mostly detailed, there is AA, FOV, good particle effects, well done enemies... models of people are kinda deformed sometimes, but the game more than makes up, on this side at least, with very well done armors, weapons and environments.SOUND: 6 / 10Well, the sound design is average, no shame and no glory. The main theme music deserves a mention because it's very good, then the in-game ambience and sounds are average. GAMEPLAY: 3 / 10The gameplay part of this title is really flawed by major problems. I will just say this here and then focus on detail later in the review.LONGEVITY: 9 / 10If you are a completitionist, to find everything the huge world has to offer will take you a very long time. There are a myriad of quests and secret dungeons to discover, no doubt about this. === The Good - Very large world to explore, there are really a lot of dungeons and places to discover, cities to visit and stuff to loot in said places.- Great variety of weapons, armors, crafting materials and accessories, there are around 250 different sets of armor and something around 150 different weapons, which is not bad at all.- Complex and rewarding alchemy system: combine the elements you find from nature or defeated enemies to create custom potions with effects based on what you put in them. Even combine potions with each other to create more powerful ones.- Decent number of spells and character skills- Good variety of enemies: undeads, wild animals, constructs, demons, golems, dragons, and more- Cities are quite crowded and you can enter almost all buildings, plus there are many vendors and skill trainers around=== The Bad - Horse travel is crippled by major problems, and is the only way to explore undiscovered areas quickly. Horses have bugged pathfinding, will get stuck randomly, are very clunky and will stay where you left them in the world. The problem with this last thing is that the Call Horse command does not work if you are farther than around 50 metres from your horse.- The world may be huge but is really empty. Most of the time exploring, it will just feel like travelling in a demo map with some trees, rocks and some props. The world does not feel alive and linked together as it should be, but instead feels like dungeons and cities put inside a vast nothingess with no interest apart the occasional wild animal or alchemy herb. Very limited interactivity and dynamicity of environment in the overall game world.- NPCs in the cities are always the same 5-6 models, it will happen to see the same NPC models over and over very quicly, even groups of them being just plain clones. All NPCs will answer the same 3-4 default questions and have nothing characterizing them apart from few main quest characters, all the rest is just a bunch of generic placeholders just there to trade or give quests. Immersion and RP experience is really downgraded because of this.- Externally, cities are all the same, big dark brown stone walls, doesn't matter if the city is Nanic, Human or whatever other race. Zero characterization of racial buildings in this aspect.- Enemy AI is rudimental and will just follow the player to attack him, ranged enemies will run away if a melee player gets too close. enemies lack any semblance of coordination or group support actions such as ie. mages healing fighters and similar. Huge mobs of enemies can be carried around indefinitely. Enemies will just attack the player on sight without any role-playing interacion or eventual faction alliegances, there are allies by default and enemies by default, no grey in the middle, and that's it.- Zero role-playing decisions player-side. Each dialogue is scripted and apart from general questions about some characters or the world, there is no reallly matter of choice in anything, just accept or decline an assignment, with no depth in choices or branching of events during any quest.- Combat system is clunky and just underwhelming: melee characters will just have to swing a weapon until low on HP, drink all the potions they want and just keep spamming attacks until everyone is dead. Ranged classes can just run away from the enemy, then stop, aim, fire, and then run away again before the enemy can target them. Potions can be spammed so challenge is zero because as long as you have money to buy potions you are good.- Economy is broken: you can pick up all the stuff an enemy has on him, then when you are full of stuff go to a city and sell everything for massive amounts of money even from early game. You also can go and travel to a high level area, go to a random merchant, and buy crystals / potions / rings / anything with no level restriction of 20 levels ahead of you and just use them right there. Merchants will also havfe unlimited money and buy everything, always.- There is a skill to get bonus damage against enemies riding horses. But in the game there is no enemy ridiing a horse.

												Two Worlds is easily one of my favorite games. The controls take some getting used to, but you can alter them to your preferences. The graphics are absolutely stunning, and if you are at a high enough altitude you can see most of the world layed out before you.  There's a gem system that's pretty much a rip off of Diablo II, which was one of my favorite aspects. All weopons, and armor can be upgraded just by finding duplicates of them. There are some pretty epic skills, particularly for the archer. There are also various biomes, and weather, and the map is much bigger than it looks.My favorite aspect of the game is just wandering around the woods. It's seriously beautiful.			"

												The game is extremely fun I still enjoy it, I enjoyed it back on the xbox 360 when it was just Two Worlds, but if I'm going to be honest, I myself see no big changed between Two worlds (Original game) and Two worlds Epic edition (""Updated"" game) the graphics If I'm being honest look exactly the same (The changes in my personal opinion are too minimal for me to notice)I run pretty good fps in the game (So I can't complain) but when out in the wilderness (Not in a city, which is where I expected an fps drop, I expected more of an fps drop in qudinar) but at random points I'll get the drop in the wilderness in an mainly unpopulated area (I get them sometimes in cave but I've only ever noticed one a play session) I expected it to be due to monsters but I thought if there's no fps drop in qudinar then how can monsters be that much of a problem unless there's more monsters in this chunk than npcs in qudinar)Gameplay, where do I start? I see no difference at all and that could because I've only played around 11 hours? but I would have hoped for the creatures in normal mode to be buffed (I see no buff at all they are the same old week creatures) I kind of wanted certain npcs (Such as guards) and all monsters (to level around one level behind you) to make the game feel more of a challenge because when you get to about 10k health and have weapons that do 2k+ damage it becomes easy to kill the enemies that are seen (orcs, groms, wolfs, gamma orcs etc) the only enemies I found even an inkling of a challenge with (which I defeated pretty easily due to jump back and potion spam) were ogres Most golems, Dragons and Giant Trachidis.Shop selling and buying, well let me say that I saw no problem with the pricing I thought it was as good as the old game, until It came to some of the swords, but I still think that using the shop could be made a lot easier (For bothing buying and selling) I always hated the fact that if I wanted to buy a gem but they were in stacks so I wanted to put both on a weapon but even if I bought two at the same time and hovered over a weapon one still goes into the inventory, I would have liked both to go on, but I can also see you wanted to use the gem on another weapon. buying potions... I don't know if it's just me but there always seemed to be that lag/latency when buying potions where they wouldn't go into your inventory till you bought another potion or another item, I also think it could have been made easier to buy things by having every weapon/potion/armorpiece in a pile rather than having to buy it one by one it's time consuming. Selling I always disliked selling in two worlds (For no good reason either just for me it felt slow and sluggish and I only ever did it if I needed the money or wanted the money) like selling it would have been so much easier to sell armor/weapons in stacks rather than one by one.The abilities feel far too over powered but on a trade off feel very inaccurate and even sometimes I feel like the hits take a couple seconds to register, which in most situations I felt like when doing it I could die a lot easier I guess that's sort of a trade off? You sacrifice accuracy for damage and sometimes even sacrifice your own life to take down a large enemy because the last hit decided not the register till he had hit you and took your last little bit of health off.I've gone pretty critical on the game for the main fact that It's meant to be a better version and in my person opinion it wasn't.I think combat for the most part (At lower levels) was pretty blanced you took a lot of damage but with the jump back ability it made one enemy fights pretty fair the only reason the fighting was a con was because of how it easy to kill the creatures that were seen the most (Aka wolves/Orcs/Groms/Bears) at a high level once I got past around 5k health and did around six hundred damage I was pretty golden as long as I remembered to jump backwards.Pricing, the pricing was a bit of a plus in my personal opinion it wasn't changed too much but it wasn't amped up by the thousands which is what i had feared upon purchase, but it was nice to see it stayed the same or at least quite close to the same.Horses, they were kind of a pro and a con as they helped me get around but it felt like even at the tiniest slope the horse would veer off course to a slope that seemed to be even bigger, the combat on a horse (Just forget about it) I don't even try to fight on a horse I find it's a lot easier to fight on the ground where I wouldn't fall off randomly because the horse died the aiming I just felt it to be off.All up I'm going to recommend the game for the main fact that it is pretty fun even though there are some aspects of it that could be improved to make the gameplay even more enjoyable and more satisfying.

												Fun game, definitely buy it when it's on sale. Bought it because of nostalgic reasons and because my Disc didn't work anymore, but I truly enjoy the game.			"

												The protagonist is a hilarious sarcastic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking to get some mad ♥♥♥♥♥. Basically rpg Bender from futurama with weird old english. Lots of loot, good map design, bad writing, boring npcs, weird♥♥♥♥♥story, better action than oblivion and a simple pure bliss levelling system that doesn't need you to min max like oblivion. Morrowind ftw Basically low budget oblivion with better loot,combat and map design.			"

												PROs:Graphics are good for an older game, gameplay and mechanics are solid. Interesting world. CONs:Voice acting and dialogue is terrible sometimes. Like a B grade movie.Overall:Reccomended particularly if on sale. Competes with and feels somewhat similar to other RPGs e.g. the Witcher, Elder Scrolls, Bioware games. Whilst it might n't be as good as some of them, I think the game was thoroughly enjoyable. The voice acting is lol at first but you get used to it.			"

												Okay I'll be perfectly honest, I got this game because of Projared's review, I love games that are so bad they are good.That said, Two Worlds, is my favorite of that crop.It's music is decent, it's dialogue is cheesy and unashamed, it is on par with Dark Souls difficulty wise (granted you don't cheat, which can produce fun results as well), get it on sale, it's worth the .99 I payed for it.I've bought this game twice by the way, one physical for $1.00 and this for .99 cents.Why?Because HOLY SH*T A WYVERN!

												Old graphics, but fun RPG system. For me its similar to Gothic 2 gameplay. A lot of items will drop and if your like me, looting everything, you will use the teleport stone feature regularly (plus the horses inventory as storage :D )			"

												Played this game at the time it got out in 2007 and i loved it.Recently bought on steam and said hey lets give it a go now i can't stop playing.Yes the game is ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; the voice acting is terible and so on but the time you spend playing the game is special.BTW Two Worlds 2 is one of the best sequels made and the dev team improved the game beyond what i expected.

												I love two worlds and the game as a whole however it requires you to jump through hoops just to make it work and that is not fair to the content and the player but the game is awesome and if you can get past all the issues I highly recommend this game.			"
