												A very atmospheric, dark-fantasy/steampunk Action-RPG.I wasn't sure about buying it, as ARPGs aren't my favourite (though i really enjoyed Diablo 2), but i didn't regret it.Actually, it's pretty well done.You play the son of the famous Van Helsing, accompanied by the ghost of Lady Katarina, which will aid you in your battle against werewolves, robots and all sorts of other monsters.The world is dark and with lots of steampunk elements in it, very detailed and atmospheric.As you progress, you also hear some nice dialogues between the two main characters, which are pretty humorous sometimes. The game is also filled with some pop-culture-references (Lord of the Rings, The Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy, as to name only 2).Though it has some minor flaws and might not be as polished as bigger productions, it's a nice and well done game, which i would recommend to anyone who likes ARPGs.

												Excellent voice acting, original atmospheric music , 15+ hour storyline and great attention to detail easily matches full price releases. Very underrated and together with path of exile the best in their genre (with PoE being the more hardcore/advanced option).The class dlc is somewhat scummy but seeing as how the base game is so cheap its pretty bearable (plus the 'new' classes are just very specialized variants on the base class but still completely new in terms of trees and skills)Minor critiques is that the gem slot system barely makes an impact but that wont ruin your enjoyment and fairly long load times on zone transitions (but barely slowdown once properly loaded)Warning: game seems to use a consistent 1,5K-2,5K ram depending on settings			"

												How to begin...The first impression of the game wasn't that great. A rather generic forest area with expectable enemies didn't get my hopes up too high, but after around an hour the game gained a lot in both presentation and interesting content. For around 7-8 hours afterwards you are in for a great ride with excellent graphics, music and quests. Your companion really adds to game and lifts it above most Diablo clones. Sadly at a certain point the game turns into a pure grind fest and the content runs thin, very thin. The final battle is over the top hard and while it's certainly finishable, nothing in the game prepares you for it.A lot of great ideas and lovely designed areas will keep you entertained for a few hours and if you can forgive the game a rather rushed/forced ending, I'd say it's a really good hack 'n slash RPG.Pro:- Great design- Atmospheric music- Interesting skill system- Sarcastic and entertaining companionCon:- Too short and yet it still feels lengthy in the last 1/4 of the game- Crashes occasionally			"

 “Be a hunter, they said. Kill monsters, they said! No one ever mentioned something about picking flowers!” The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing represents a solid action role-playing game, based on Bram Stoker’s legendary vampire slayer. It has a charming atmosphere in combination with an interesting storyline and lovely characters, set in a gothic–noir universe resembling the 19th century Eastern Europe, that is filled with original monsters, magic and weird technology. The protagonist and his delightful ghostly companion have a wry sense of humor and contribute to the game’s atmosphere with many snappy dialogues. Especially the details in form of allusions to certain films, comics and the original book by Bram Stoker will keep you entertained.The only shortcoming of this game is the rather stiff combat system, which would have needed more attention to establish a more fluent hack & slash feeling.

Nice but short gameVan Helsing is a typical hack'n'slay with skill tree, mana, cooldowns and so on.I took me about 18 hours to complete the game with one character (caster aka Thaumaturge), this include finishing all sidequests and expose every single area. Compared with other games like torchlight this is a bit short.One variety was a tower defence part and the possibility to power up the generator for the traps. Unfortunately there were only 2 events were you have to defeat the secret lab. After I finished the game I also tried the Scneario mode which contain higher difficulties starting from 31 (current cap level for the player is 30). In this mode you could gain glory points instead of xp. Normally you should find better items on this single map scenarios but compared with the items I already had the weren't better. But this depends on kind of luck you have (like in other games).So I created new characters to test the other classes, but after a short time it doesn't makes fun playing the same story again.At last I tried the ""Neverending Story"" mode which was described as ""The monster will keep getting stronger while your only way to improve is to play even better. See how far you can get!"".Well it was really hard and the main thing I did was casting my spells and run away till all was dead. For stronger monsters that means run in a circle arround them casting again and again and don't stop to drink healt potions. And the bad thing was, this tooks a lot of time and after a while it gets boring. Short game summary- Level cap: 30- Skill and ability  points could be assigned- Skill and ability points could be assigned to your aide (Lady Katarina)- Perks: by finishing quest and killing enemies you gain reputation. There are 10 levels of reputation and on each of them you could choose one perk to activate e.g Unstoppable (Immunity to all movement impedding effects)   - Glory: after reching max level you could gain glory points in scenario mode. And with these points you could increase stats like attack rate, fire damage or cooldown reduction- game modes:-- Story-- Scenario-- Neverending Story- classes:-- Hunter (blades, firearms) -- Thaumaturge (caster)-- Arcane Mechanic (expulsion cannon)- difficulties:-- casual-- normal-- hard-- heroic-- hardcore character as special option (like in other games ""death is final"") - multiplayer modePositive:- good hack'n'slay: I played it through in 18 hours on two days caused of pickup loot and leveling up - chest were you could share items with other characters- single skills from the skill tree of player and aide could be removed by paying gold (same for abilities)- multiplayerNegative:- too short- difficulty could only be choosen on character creation time and not be changed after that - difficulty varies to much: normal game could be played through no problem but the ""Neverending Story"" mode was too hard.Conclusion:It's a nice game which facinates me from the beginning till the end. Even if it's a short game I would definitely suggest this game.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a third person hack and slash game very similar to the Diablo / Torchlight series. If you’ve played any of those, you should be able to drop right into Van Helsing with a good idea of how to play. The game seems pretty demanding hardware wise, and it heats up my computer, which is unusual for a top down isometric game.You play the title character Van Helsing, a monster hunter on a mission to the country of Borgovia to answer a distress letter. It seems some unspecified evil is causing trouble for the people there. In the game’s world, monsters seem pretty commonplace, and you are actually accompanied on your quest by a snarky ghost named Lady Katarina. Gameplay-wise Lady Katarina is the equivalent of the “pet” in Torchlight, or a “merc” in Diablo 2, except that she talks to you all the time as part of the story. She has her own gear/stats/skills and can go back to town to sell loot for you, just like the pet in Torchlight. In combat she can hold her own for a while, but dies pretty quickly later on in the game.The game is broken up into 2 city hubs like Diablo 2 Acts, each with its own main town, NPC shops, and quests. The game is filled with little hidden quests that you may not find in 1 playthrough, even though the maps are not randomly generated.  I’ve finished 2 characters and the maps were exactly the same both times. There is an option in the main menu to have enemies respawn each time you leave and re-enter a game (like Diablo 2), and you can turn this on or off whenever you want. Like Diablo 2, you can’t see what level the enemies are, but if you’re having a hard time, you should probably go back and level up a little more.  This isn’t possible if the enemies don’t respawn. In my experience if you don’t grind at least a few levels, you’ll end the game around level 27 (max level is 30).The game has an extensive loot system similar to Diablo/Torchlight with normal/rare/set/epic item types as well as “+magic find%” attributes that can be found on gear to boost your chances of getting rarer items. There is also a way to upgrade particular items with “essence” which is kind of like gems in Diablo, or ember in Torchlight. I haven’t used the system much since every time I find a better weapon I just sell the old one, and don’t bother breaking it down for all the essences that I’ve put into it. The game’s stat system should be familiar to people who play dungeon crawler games. Body (hp / melee damage), Dexterity (dodge chance / range damage), Willpower (magic damage/ mana), and Luck (critical damage / magic find) are your four stats and you get 5 per level up to distribute as you please.  The skill system is more complicated because you don’t just choose skills (which can cost more than 1 skill point), you can also choose the “power ups” that can be used with the skills. These power ups are activated before you cast the skill, and use a “rage” meter which is separate from your mana bar.  You build rage by killing monsters while mana just regenerates by itself. So an example would be activating a damage boost power up right before casting a lightning bolt spell. The power up drains some of your rage bar and the spell drains some of your mana bar with the result being a lightning bolt with increased damage.  You can toggle an auto-activate to your power ups if you don’t want to deal with pressing the button every time.  You’ll probably run out of rage really quickly though.Another thing to note about the skill system is that your skills are broken up into several categories, though they all take skill points to level up. There are your main Skills, Auras, and Tricks. Auras are passive boosts that you have on permanently, though you can only have 2 auras active at any time. An example would be the Rampage aura which boosts your critical hit damage. Tricks are just another set of skills and personally I don’t see why they were separated from the other skills, except that they don’t use mana. An example would be Arcane Healing, which is an area affecting heal spell. Tricks have a cool down to prevent you from constantly spamming them. Pros:+Decent story set in a medieval fantasy world.+Gameplay is mostly intuitive though some things really could benefit from further explanation. For example there is no explanation of the skill system. I went about 5 – 6 levels before I put points into any skills because I was afraid I might be wasting points on weak skills. Turns out you can re-spec them later, so go wild.+Pretty simple multi player co-op system. I’m able to join my brother’s game pretty quickly and easily with an average ping of 80 ms. One thing I noticed is that the game’s multiplayer server browser doesn’t tell you if a person’s game has a password until you’ve tried connecting to it. That’s kind of dumb. A bunch of people constantly try connecting to my brother and my games and disconnecting because they don’t know the password.Cons:-There is very little information online for beginners. In most games of this type, you can find a wiki or strategy website where people share their character builds. I found one site like this, but a lot of the info is outdated. In RPG games I hate feeling like I missed out on something cool.If you got this game from the Humble Jumbo 2 bundle, you should have the “Complete Pack” which includes the Thaumaturge and Arcane Mechanic DLCs. These DLCs are 2 new character classes along with a few class specific quests. That means you can see a few areas in the game that you can’t get into unless you’re one of these 2 new classes. The Thaumaturge is a pure spell caster and is probably the most enjoyable class, but easily killed. The Arcane Mechanic is a ranged attacker who shoots slow moving grenades and can summon support units. The base class Hunter is a little bit of everything, but really best as a melee tank with some back up spells.I’ve heard people say that the game is pretty short, but personally I’m happy with a 12 hour game, especially one in the $1 tier of a humble bundle.  I'm actually glad it doesn't have an end game grind like Diablo, where you just play over and over looking for better gear after you've finished the main storyline. Van Helsing also has a hardcore mode for people who want that extra element of risk (death is permanent). I never have and probably never will create a hardcore character since I die all the time in games like this. Overall I give the game a thumbs up if you enjoy hack and slash dungeon crawlers. You’ll find the graphics comparable with Path of Exile, and the loot finding should keep you occupied for a while. "

												Beside the Torchlight franchise, Titan Quest and the free Path of Exile NeocoreGames' Van Helsing represents another alternative for those finding the latest Diablo entry a bit too casual. What's more is that while Van Helsing is shorter than aforementioned hack 'n' slash games it still offers a decent story and a lot of content. Due to the additional game modes (scenario and neverending story) it has a high replayability value, as well.The game follows a quest of Van Helsing and his companion, the ghost Katharina, who try to get to Borgovia to stop a mad scientist. Along the way you encounter dozens of different enemies throughout numerous different environments. Some of these locales look stunningly beautiful: you traverse through a muddy forest fighting hideous monsters and evil spirits and also join the resistance in a town to fight the soldier-machines. These machines add the steampunk part of the game - with all the traps and contraptions you find they make the game even more diverse.One of the things I liked about Van Helsing was its atmosphere. Sound effects and the score are excellent and I liked the sarcastic conversations between Helsing and Katharina. One-liners are common from them as well as from enemies and there are numerous references to other video games and films throughout the game. In order to find all of them it's worth hovering the cursor over all objects in every environment - Van Helsing might collect a quest item or just make a funny comment.There are many sidemissions, of course, as it is common in this genre and there's even one that takes you throughout the game. You just need to carefully look everywhere and open all chests, containers, destroy all barrels and boxes as you might find the next piece of the puzzle. It's worth mentioning, though, that not all items are related to a quest, still, they will be part of the corresponding tab in your inventory.Normally, Van Helsing wields two swords and two pistols. You can decide which way to go from there in terms of customisation. Beside these two tabs there is also one called Tricks (active spells) and Auras (passive skills). Every level-up grants you ability points (the good-old attributes we are talking about here), skill points and occasionally reputation points, but the latter is not related to quest but more to the annihilation of strong beasts. Your reputation can then yields you perks - the list is gradually increasing and you can pick more and more of them along the way.Katharina, the ghost companion is a bit similar to the pet we have in Torchlight. She can do the shopping on behalf of us and can also pick up loot by category. Her behaviour is completely modifiable. Of course, she has many skills and also attributes - her skills either make her stronger or support Van Helsing in combat. While there are no other companions in the game the abovementioned customisation I described for Van Helsing is the Hunter class only. With the added DLCs you can play as a Thaumaturge or Arcane Mechanic. I hear they are pretty fun and diverse, too, so this is all the more in favour of the longevity of this game.Van Helsing is pretty cool game considering it is a relatively low-budget hack 'n' slash. It is filled with content and there's high replayability due to the 3 different classes, more difficulty levels, hardcore mode, online cooperative mode in the game. I look forward to playing with its sequel. In the meantime, if you are the fan of the genre Van Helsing should be in your library. Word of advice: buckle up as the game can be pretty challenging even on normal difficulty setting!			"

												If you're looking for a quick ARPG fix you can't really go wrong with The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.  In my opinion it's a better experience in comparison to Diablo 3.  There's a fun variety of loot with some really cool unique weapons that you can find early in the game which is exciting.  There's also a endless story mode where creatures get more and more difficult at ""end game"" max level being 30.  There are also scenarios that can be played at level 30 that offer even more challenges with unique bosses and objectives.  Def a recommended game if you're into this sort of thing.			"

												Most of the negative reviews are related to multiplayer. I'm a hermit in real life and in gaming, so that didn't phase me. Without reading tutorials and by taking my time and enjoying the game on normal, I beat the game in about 15 hours. I didn't notice any glitches. With the summer sale, I went ahead and bought the DLC, so I can try the other classes next weekend. If you're buying the game, and you're buying it for the 1p experience, save a few bucks by buying the game+dlc pack.			"

												I started playing this game because I didn't really feel like playing Diablo 3, and all in all I'm pretty happy with my choice.Story:I was expecting the game to be a Diablo-clone in most ways, so having the big bad be a mad human scientist instead of a demon-monster-creature was a pretty nice surprise. Fighting robots(?) in a steampunk-ish world also felt a bit fresh compared to fighting the same old demons and mythological creatures (some of which do appear in this game as well). The basic story is of course the good old ""hack your way through a bunch of enemies to defeat the big bad trying to take over the world (or country?)"", but there's nothing wrong with that.Gameplay:If you have played Diablo or any other ARPG you will probably recognize the play style right away. You use your mouse and a couple of buttons to dash out various spells while keeping an eye on your health and mana. The addition of rage, which refills when you kill a creature and can be used to power up your spells, was a nice  touch. It gives you an extra thing to do during fights, as well as more ways to personalize your skill tree, so an extra plus there.Graphics:The graphics were fine. Not great, not bad. Some creatures looked pretty good, some looked pretty bland. The same can be said for the environment. Personally I enjoyed the city zones more than the nature zones. The (few and short) cut scenes were pretty meh, especially compared to the Diablo cut scenes, but that's acceptable.Music:While playing the game I thought that the music fit the mood pretty well, but as soon as I stopped playing I forgot the soundtrack right away.The voice acting in this game... At first I thought that the voice acting was just really, really bad, and almost lol'ed a couple of times during the first few hours of the game. But then I realized that that was what they were going for (probably?). Sort of cheesy, over-the-top voice acting, that when you get used to it fit the game really well, and was sometimes just really funny (in a good way!). Some of the comments from both Van Helsing and Lady Katarina were just hilarious, although by the end of the game Katarina was becoming quite annoying.Overall:Overall I enjoyed this game, even my second playthrough, which was a little unexpected. I don't really want to call Van Helsing a Diablo-clone, since there were a couple of things that set it apart from Diablo, so let's just call it a decent option if you like ARPGs. I recommend this game, even at full price if you don't want to wait for a sale, however I do have a couple of warnings:1. There are some bugs in the game, the most common being corpses stuck in walls or terrain that can't be looted. I also found a couple of chests that I couldn't open for whatever reason. The biggest bug I faced was a door leading to the next zone being closed, forcing me to start over with a new character. (Luckily this didn't happen with my hardcore heroic character.) There was a fix posted on the developer's forum to fix this, but that fix didn't work for me. On July 2nd 2015 they added the ""Mantis Bug Tracker"" to the game, which should help fix more bugs, but I wasn't able to test this out myself.2. If you care about achievements you can get most of the achievements by playing through the game twice. None of them are really that hard to get, as my first playthrough was on hardcore heroic difficulty (=perma-death), and I only died four times, so the game is fairly easy. However, there is one achievement that is just plain stupid. It requires you to get 500,000 kills, which is a lot, seeing as you only get about 10,000-15,000 kills per playthrough. Luckily there is a way to make Lady Katarina afk farm kills for you, which she is doing for me as I am typing this, but just be aware that there is this one really annoying achievement if you (like me) want to clear the game 100%.But all in all, a really good game.

Action RPG taken to perfectionThe first game in what would become a series a three, was released by Neocore Games in May 2013. At first sight, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing doesn't seem to offer much new or original to a well-established gaming genre: the fast-paced action rpg, played from an isometric point of view. After all, we had the Diablo and Torchlight series, which did a pretty good job at delivering extremely enjoyable games.From my first impressions with this game, it was clear that Neocore Games knows its classics: they stayed true to the core of this particular genre, which is the combination of the fast-paced hack 'n slash (or shoot 'n bewitch) gameplay with the development of your character and the endless craving for loot. After all, what's more rewarding than mowing down horde after horde of enemies, in order to find dozens of lootable items, among which there might be just that one special items? Or breaking hundreds of barrels, hoping to stumble upon a golden ring belonging to a named set?Actually, Van Helsing goes several steps further than most other action rpg when it comes to loot, objects and what you can accomplish with them. I've played through the entire game twice (first as a gun-oriented hunter, than as a melee character), and both times I found myself busy with objects for a fair amount of time. There's not only an incredible number of weapons, armour, rings, boots, gloves, hats, capes and trophees, there's also the possibility to enchant and even enhance them with small magical pieces, ""essences"". The best items come with a slot for one or more essences, and it's great fun to upgrade one's armour or items in this way. The game gives you a huge amount of customization options over your character (although you can only play as Van Helsing himself, obviously) too: upon levelling up, you can spend 5 ability points (to build your character's strenghts) and 3 skill points (spent in a very extensive skill & spell tree). Part of the immense fun this game provides, lies in building a well-balanced, skilled character that's up to the task and to the items he can wield. There are ""perks"" too, which offer a general or more specific buff and which unlock after meeting certain requirements.But Neocore Games went even one step further by introducing a companion to Van Helsing: a female ghost, who can help you defeating the enemies in several ways (melee, range or simply by enhancing your capabilities). Even better: Katharina also gains experience and can be upgraded, can learn skill and can be equipped with weapons, rings and armour. All of which can be upgraded and enchanted, of course. So if you like that sort of finetuning a character, Van Helsing offers a fantastic experience. And Katharina even helps to solve to everlasting problem of having too much loot but too little inventory space: you can send her off to town to sell some items for cash, or for potions.Compared to such an extensive character building & enhancing system, the actual gameplay is a little more bland, although it's still pretty solid and enjoyable. With the aid of good weaponry, skills, spells and aura's it is great fun to mow down entire legions of enemies, which the game keeps throwing at you. But towards the latter part of the game it becomes clear which skills are best suited to your style of playing, and the gameplay starts to show some repetition. The story itself is decent enough - nothing special, but it does the job of keeping the game going, and Katherina is a humorous sidekick in many situations. The user interfaces (and the extremely important inventory screens) are a marvel of lay-out and offer whatever you want at a mouse-click. This game offers the perfect example of how developers can make life easy and enjoyable, even in the most complex of situations.And if all of this were not enough, Van Helsing offers perfect integration with Steam through leaderboards, co-op multiplayer, and nearly one hundred achievements which offer an extra challenge and a great fun to hunt after. The three main dlc's are pretty useful too: they offer two new sets of skills & spells so that you can play either as a magic character or as an ""arcane mechanic"" (have to try that one out sometime). The third dlc offers a new set of skills for your female companion.Highly recommend, and an essential purchase for everyone who loves a good action rpg. "

												I finished my 1st playthrough of Van Helsing the other day. It was pretty good, the graphics were fine (nothing great), the story was very average (the usual save the world from the bad-guy & his minions), & the gameplay was similar to Torchlight/Diablo ARPG's.I ended up with 73/95 Achievements, & that's ok with me. To get them all you would need to do multiple playthrough's, & i wasn't impressed enough to want to replay it, maybe in another year or so.All in all, it was a good game. I used a controller, & it worked fine. If you like ARPG's, i'd say give it a try, but don't expect an involved storyline. It's more loot collecting & monster killing, so if you like that sort of game, you'll like this.Enjoy   :) "

												I'm going to be honest - I love Diablo 3.Why? Well, I loved Diablo 2...but I grew up, got as job, got responsibilities, lost all my free time and any gaming is done briefly. To put it simply - I need bang for my buck. Don't get me wrong: I'd love to be able to lose myself in Paths of Exiles skill trees, or spend ages on new builds in Torchlight but these don't matter when I have an hour to sit down and, dammit, I wanna see monsters explode and organs fly across the screen while I whirlwind across the screen.And that's why I recommend Van Helsing - it looks good, feels good, sounds good and doesn't require massive amounts of time and commitment - the skill trees are basic, items work well and you feel more or less done once you've played through once.Pick it up in a sale (I think it's worth full price), drop 20ish hours into, reminisce about how terrified you were twenty (!) years ago the first time you heard ""Ah, fresh meat!"", and appreciate the fun that is Van Helsing.

												This game is as its name implies: ""INCREDIBLE""!I have played Diablo, Diablo 2, Torchlight, Torchlight 2, and not one of them was as pure fun as this.The main characters, Van Helsing and Katharina are what makes the game great. They're incredibly funny to listen to. Great dialogue, with very nice voiceovers which seem almost impossibly good for such a small game. The references to other games, books and movies are great and fit the tone, which is always one of (mostly) lighthearted fun. The game is set in a sort of dark steampunk/clockwork setting, but it always aims to amuse and not to drag you down. It doesn't take itself too seriously and that is rare in games like this.It is a solid ARPG, and the mechanics are simple and still have depth and it's really fun and rewarding trying out different approaches. You can play your Van Helsing as a gun-toting Monsterhunter or as a sword-fighting Slayer. You can even play him as a Mage. Each class plays very different and you can also adjust your companion similarly, which is a great idea.As I said, I got more fun out of this than Torchlight 2, for example (the story here and the graphics fit my tastes better), so it is a definitve must buy for any ARPG fan, especially if it's on sale.

												Genre - Steampunk/Supernatural Action RPGI am a massive fan of the Diablo games and enjoy Path of Exile. I got this game on sale and randomly chose to give it a try. I have been through the whole game on normal using one character (I had the DLC to expand the choice). The game is enjoyable and a decent length. I spent 15 hours re-visitng some sections and fully exploring most maps. The humour is good and the dialogue with your ghostly companion keeps the story flowing. There is a hardcore mode if you are that way inclined and different difficulty settings. At a couple of points in the game it allows you to do tower defence, which can break up the game a bit. I have found out you can also take your level 30 character (max level) into the next game. So I will definately be getting that at some point.			"

												An extremely addicting and visually stunning ARPG. Solid graphics and an extremely well designed world with a steampunk-noir feel. If you're a fan of Torchlight, PoE, Diablo (especially if you were left less than satisfied with Diablo 3) then this should be right up your alley. The character development is pretty unique, in a very good way. Each skill offers various ""powerups"" which you can use during fights to better suit whatever challenge you face. This makes for a very fun combat system that I would love to see more of in the future. Besides skills, you also have the ability to use XP to purchase auras, tricks, and perks. Your companion, Katarina, has her own attributes as well as unique skills which you can select as she levels with you. This all combines to make for one of the most customizable games I've played in a while. For this quality and the playtime which it offers this game is well worth the purchase, especially if you factor in the replay value which the DLC's bring with their addictional classes. This game seems to go on sale fairly frequently, so if you can manage to catch it during one of those times you'll be getting more than your moneys worth.			"

												Gorgeous looking Hack N' Slash, (Diablo, Torchlight, Etc.), with that lovely Van Helsing vibe.  Lovely monster design, great looking levels, and an overall good atmosphere.  Character development is two fold, yourself and your companion can both be upgraded through leveling up and adding not only Ability Points for stats, but Skill points for Skills,(Spells,Attacks, Auras, Tricks, etc.), which opens up the play style for all three classes to your own interuptation quite well. Finished it in around 20hrs, with a few more discovering all the extra the game has to offer after completion, which is a scenario mode for a challenge and chance at some better drops.  Also Neverending Story, which is like a New Game+ mode, where you continue on, but this time, because you'll probably be maxed at level 30, you start to gain Glory, and each level of that, lets you further strengthen and build your character.  Overall I had a great time playing, only had a few bugs here and there, which I've read are being constantly worked on and fixed, and didn't have any trouble running the game, minus extended load times, and an occasion stutter on certain levels due to the sheer amount of plantlife and monsters I suppose. In Closing: Worth Picking up if you love Hack N' Slash.  It's not going to be a game changer, but it's a great 20 hours+ depending on your love for the game.  Which should be quite great!			"

												Played the game on hard mode.The previous reviews pretty much summarized the good sides of this game:- Well designed world.- Some really nice background music (definitely getting game OST if there is one). - Attractive graphics.- Highly customizable settings (could play this game on my laptop).- Some interesting references to pop culture (really liked Baggins dude!).- Good voice acting.- Decent storyline.But all in all I would advise you to avoid this game. Here is why:- If you do not buy DLCs then there is only one character class you can 'choose' from. The character can do both melee and range attacks, however, due to horrible difficulty balance I had to specialize only on one attack type. The result is there is not a lot of variation in the action. - Except very rare short conversations, the sidekick ghost lady is useless. She dies really fast and eats up all the health potions. I have ended up keeping her in a ghost form all the time. The result is the game would not change much if she was removed completely.- The game gives you impression of customization, but it actuallly punishes you for doint it. After mid point of the game, customization becomes really expensive and you can end up spending all the gold and still not getting what you want.- The essense system (aka gems and gem slots) is useless. Items where you can put gems are rare. If one is found then usually it does not have enough essense capacity to put useful essense. You can use an essense to increase the capacity but during my 27 hours of gameplay I had collected only 3 capacity increasing essense. Finally, there is not a lot of variation in essense types. I had collected only 20 or so different essense types during the entire game!- The fighting becomes really repetitive quite fast. There are many enemies that look different, but really just a skin deep difference. All off them can be categorized into melee enemies that charge in mass, melee enemies with hooks and ranged enemies. There is no interesting behavior from AI. More challenging enemies have simply 1) more HP and higher defense points, 2) just attack in bigger numbers, or 3) have more HP and defense and attack in higher numbers. It is not possible to use interesting tactics. Most of my gameplay consisted of repeating two things: have a short skirmish and then running away to use potion before having another short skirmish. Bullet spongy enemies just killed all the fun for me in this game. Most annoying are the enemies with hooks. It is not possible to predict or avoid hooks using your skills. The hook animation is instantaneous. The problem is, at least on higher difficulty, if you get hooked then you are basically dead.- Horrible camera angles. It is not possible to control the camera. Did I tell you about enemies with hooks? Well many times I was hooked by enemies I could not even see. I am not even talking about number of times I was shot at by enemies outside of the screen.- Bad character controls. There is no keyboard-based movement control. Mouse is used to click on a place where you want to move your character. Sounds good enough right? Well not. Combined with horrible camera angles and enemies swarming everywhere you will end up in many situation where you cannot find a free space to click on and move your character. I ended up more than dozen times dead because my character refused to move. The complexity of the surrounding world makes the situation even worse because it is not immediately obvious where you can and cannot click.If you are looking for a good ARPG then go for Path of Exile. PoE is superior to this game in everyway. Plus, PoE is free, and there is no DLC nonsense.			"

 The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing – REVIEW    Graphics (Environment 9/10, Models 7/10) 8/10   Animations 7/10   Sound 6/10   Music 8/10   Story 6.5/10   Gameplay 6.5/10   Inovation 7/10   TOTAL SCORE 7  GraphicsOn all max settings this game looked very nice. Environments and most models of the enemy creatures were designed pretty well, but sadly the characters of people felt 'just' boring. AnimationsThe animated events that happened while playing were nicely done, but that can't be said for animations of your character, Katarina and other enemies, which felt too repetitious, harsh and halting, that definitely spoiled the feeling of a smoother and more efficient gameplay. Sound & MusicThe voice acting and other sounds in this game were mostly bad and disappointing, but the soundtrack was good and enjoyable. StoryEven the Blizzard's Diablo, with its all magnificence in every aspect, sometimes fell short in the story, so there's not much to say about the story of Van Helsing. I completed the first chapter which seemed really short with a main story that wasn't any special (with a few side quests). Second chapter put me in exploring of a steampunk city called Borgova, which I personally found a little better. But because of bad gameplay mechanics and other repetitive elements were 13 hours spent in the game just enough for me to get an overall impression and write a review. GameplayMany players complained about the difficulty of this game, which is really hard even on normal settings! But the problem isn't just in some ridiculously 'strong' enemies, but in the hordes that attack you all at once. That's when the game of a cat and mouse begin, which really spoils the charm of your gameplay and feels totally unbalanced.If you have ever played Dota 2 or (to be more fair and precise) Diablo III or some other quality hack'n'slash rpgs and truly experienced (mastered?) their gameplay, than you should know how far superior are their gameplay mechanics to the game like The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. It definitely tries and has some new cards in its hands, but it doesn't come really close. ConslusionThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing has some new ideas and approaches in this genre and some of its parts are done pretty well, but on the other hand lacks of some vital and more polished details that would make this game a truly unique gaming experience ...Replay value: This game was built for it, but in my opinion: NO.Recommended: Yes, but ONLY ON SALE!  by Garret A.M.

												The Incredible Adventures Of Van Helsing is a decent action RPG experience. I've seen games that were a lot worse in the last couple of months. Van Helsing brings nothing new to the table but is enjoyable nevertheless. If you ever played Diablo or Torchlight, or any other aRPG, you know exactly what to expect. Lots of killing, upgrading, sidequests to complete and loot to collect. This game has tons of loot, by the way. Maybe not all useful, but enough to let you choose your own equipment, creating a character based on your preferences. Same goes for the skills and perks. Plenty of choice here.The game is pretty challenging, but it's not because of its carefully placed (groups of) enemies, but because of the fact that enemies are on every corner of the road, never alone and always in groups. It feels like the developer just spammed enemies on the map, not knowing it would result in difficulty spikes. These enemies frequently get mixed up with a bunch of elites/uniques as well, making the game even harder than it probably should be.Please note that I do like a challenge, as long as it's fair.Graphically it looks pretty and it runs reasonably well, despite its framerate issues. The voice acting is mediocre, but I guess it gets the job done. There isn't a lot of acting anyway, so it's alright.Van Helsing doesn't do anything particularly wrong except for the enemy placement, and what's there is mostly good fun so if you'd like to have a cheap but lenghty aRPG give this one a spin.[Rating: 72/100]			"

												Van Helsing is a game similar to Path of Exile&thelike in terms of how the combat plays out. Except there are a few twists that make Van Helsing worth picking up.+The story is filled with entertaining humor.+You get a game-long companion in the form of a ghost named katarina, similar to the companion in Torchlight. Every one of her lines are witty and help the humor and flavor of the game.+There is a large set of skill trees to customize your character AND katarina with. While you cannot max it out, I enjoy how it forced me to assign certain roles to myself and Katarina.+There is functioning co-op. Further being able to assign roles with friends and their katarinas really helped make the game fun. And there are plenty of modes you can play with your friends.+PLENTY OF LOOT. Which I understand is a big thing in these kinds of games.+Graphics are great! The art design really helps create an atmosphere in which you can get immersed into this game.-There's a SINGLE broken quest in this game. They are never going to fix it. It's a side quest so it's not game-breaking. But do know you will NEVER be able to finish every quest in this game.+A very innovative and interesting tower-defense 'minigame' is in this. It seems to be a bit glitchy in coop mode but it's a lot of fun and inspired the game ""Deathtrap"".Overall I really liked this game. It's nothing special though. Just another ARPG, this one making its mark with its tower defense mechanic and its witty writing. If those don't turn you on however, then it's just an average ARPG like PoE, Diablo, and Torchlight- with nothing setting it apart other than that.I give it an 8/10. Was a whole lot of fun and I do recommened picking this up. But do note my negative points, some persons I know, may find them critical.			"

												Having just finished the heroic hardcore mode, these are my thoughts of the game, spoiler free!Even though i failed a few times, i still think the game is pretty easy. My fails were mostly because i got pulled in the middle of a mob all of a sudden, and couldn't get out. Even though i had good defense, they were still too much to handle eventually. So there was bad luck, and that's why my playing hours are what they are. My game usually ended near the end, so hours clocked in when i started again.Game is fun, my only ARPG experience is D2 and Torchlight really but i liked this as well. Dialoque has it's moments that made me laugh. The world is interesting, though the ink dungeons got a bit tiring. But the some of the areas were really detailed and i was genuinely interested in exploring them.Now to the part why i think this game is easy. As i said, i finished it on the hardest difficulty, with permadeath on. There's lots of builds that are just plain OP. Those times that i was in the middle of the mobs, it took time to kill me, except once when there was 2,5 mobs on me :D Then it was over pretty quick. No game breaking bugs encountered, only some minor ones like gargoyles staying stuck high in the sky, or some enemies teleporting outside a bridge etc. This is  fun game, funny dialoque interesting and diverse world, good came to kill time for a while (again, don't look at my playing hours :D).

												Van Helsing is a game with a lot of promise: a fresh take on the action rpg dungeon crawler genre that has been rather stale in recent years.  It has some great successes, and some great failures in this goal.  After almost finishing the game, I have to say I'm not feeling as good about it as when I started.The game follows the structure you'd expect: you run around, kill monsters, do quests, get loot.  Combat is mediocre, not having much feedback and pretty poor animations and sound, though the graphical effects are nice.  The game likes to throw massive hordes of enemies at you though so that does liven things up a bit.The skill system is interesting an unique, though I don't think it's been balanced very well.  You have a set of skills in 2 trees encompassing melee, ranged, and magic attacks as well as a few passive skills.  Each skill unlocks powerup abilities when you put enough points in which you have to activate manually by consuming rage (which you gain from killing monsters.)  It's a nice system that keeps you focused on what you're doing, though I wish there was a bit more flexibility and variety in it.The quests are well done for the most part.  There are a few choices to be made, and the quests that feel rather bland your ghost companion will make snarky comments about.  I feel safe saying she's the best character in the game and she does a pretty good job livening things up.The graphics are very good, though unfortunately the loading times are very high due to this.  The engine is fairly scalable and it runs decently on older computers though not as well as I'd like.  It does its job well and is surprisingly stable considering how buggy other aspects of the game are.I've run into a lot of situations where clicking to walk up a staircase makes me run down the staircase to try to get underneath it, or trying to hit an enemy with a spell shoots it straight into the ground.  Enemy selection boxes always seem to be the wrong size, feeling extremely large when you need to move so all you can do is attack, and extremely small when you're trying to hit them so you only seem to be able to move.  I don't know why these games have so much trouble with selection boxes these days, Diablo 3 had plenty of problems with this as well.  Multiplayer has done really strange things to save games (though I believe the devs have fixed most of this,) only saving progress on the host's save and even replacing your gear with completely random items.  Somehow my character was missing an NPC in the second hub town so I didn't have a shop available for a long time due to these bugs.Now the game's greatest failing is balance.  The early game is very easy, and ramps up very suddenly later in the game.  Certain enemies do tons of damage and come in massive hordes, all but guaranteeing your death unless you play a melee tank.  In fact, melee tank seems to be the only real choice as it does the most damage as well as being the only survivable build.  What really put the nail in the coffin for me playing a magic user, however, was reaching the final boss and finding him impossible to beat.  So much for that.So while being initially excited and quite enjoying the game, after reaching the end I have to say, wait for Grim Dawn.  Maybe it can breathe life back into this genre like no other games seem to be able to.  If you can't wait, give Marvel Heroes a try.			"

												This is a hard one to judge.I purchased this on the release day with the sole purpose of playing coop with a friend, but that failed miserably as the net-code of the game was severely broken and it was unplayable @ multiplayer.So, I forgot about this game for half a year and just now realised that I've haven't played it yet, so I gave it a try.This is a classic hack-n-slash, let's break it down to points a little bit.pros:-Good setting, steampunk, mad scientists, vampires, monsters. All that good stuff.-Gameplay feels solid. UI is good, mechanics are there and do not fall apart.-Katarina =)cons:-Out of 3 classes of heroes - 2 are locked away in DLC. That's just a ♥♥♥♥ move really.-Simplicity of it's core. Zero build diversity, while you have to appoint attributes and skills - it's pretty much useless, you might as well had them auto-allocated. Action is not as good and diverse as in Diablo 3, systems behind the game are not as deep and complex as in Path of Exile.I will definitely finish the game, because it grabbed me in some way, but I really couldn't recommend to buy this game, as it seems like a easily skippable one.

												Generally, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing appears to me as a fun production, but a little misguided. At times it is extended like a big hack & slash in which we play for weeks or even months - but it is not. It's pleasant, climatic, well-sounding and truly impressive-looking action game, little sophisticated, but without much problem, able to keep it with you for several hours. I can't stop thinking how cool it could be if it hadn't devoted as much time and resources on masking her and dressing in robes ""game similar to Diablo"" ... which wasn't needed because its main strength lies elsewhere and it had to focus on. If instead of extensive character development, loot system and crafting they had been devoted to improving combat mechanics and creating more decent plot, Van Helsing could be a really good game. But it is not, unfortunately. I admit it with pain, because I liked it for the ambience and Katarinas jokes. It is simply bearable. However, spending 15 euros (5 while discount) on it, isn't the worst idea, especially if u are fed up with more or less infantile fantasy, which offers us ARPG games. Well, also if one would like to play in a slightly different scenery - just because the authors managed to create it gloriously.			"

I see it a little bit wearisome, running around holding left mouse button and every end of cooldown clicking on specail abilities, where from whole skill tree are only a few useful. This game is a real challenge if you overlook this deficiencies and try hardcore mode, there you gotta be very careful and the game starts to demand more use of your skills in strategy. 6/10			"

												6/10: Really bad execution with exploring the world of the game and controls, but a good experience once a guide is used and controls are modified.I need to be as clear as possible when I say the default settings and controls make this game a 3/10, where it's practically impossible to play on Hardcore, let alone the highest difficulty due to enemies having large hit boxes and no easy way to move without using the mouse. The arrow keys can be used, but considering the game requires the use of a mouse for targeting, as well as the number keys and QWERTY, the range of motion for play is too frantic for a realistic level of fun while playing. Immediately change the game to use WASD to move and play the game like that when fighting enemies or it'll be a hassle during tough fights.The next negative that is important to mention is the bulk of quests have no method to learn what to do, let alone not mess it up since they can't be repeated to get it done correctly. It practically requires using a guide because the game doesn't do anything useful to hint at what to do, or even warn if the quest leads to a boss fight you can't run away from.I'm still giving it a positive review because those problems can be solved outside of the game, but I will give it a massive deduction in score because of that. The voice acting and dialogue are well done, the atmosphere is something I greatly enjoy and overall, it's worth it if you pay about $5. As of right now, it's not worth $15 because the game has too many issues that should have been solved in development and are obvious how easy they are to fix once the player experiences the bad decisions.

												A memorable hack-n'-slash ARPG. The gameplay is not necessarily unique, but the game manages to stand out in its own way with its 'magic vs machine' theme. It also has quite a bit of technical flaws, but the art style and the steampunk atmosphere manages to make up for it. (I have not tried co-op mode yet, so do not expect it to be included in this review)Pros: Immersive steampunk setting and soundtrack Amazing voice acting, one of the best I've heard so far Flavorful dialogues, that does not make you want to skip them (some even have references) I personally liked the character design and personality of Katarina, your companion, as she really feels like a living (lol) partner you actually share your adventure with Character designs of the mobs/monsters are also interesting and original Tons of loot A handful of quests are fun and creative Lots of options to customize your character build, from skills, to spells, to auras and tricks, etc.Cons: Gameplay is entirely similar to that of Torchlight II and Diablo III, pretty much same formula While Katarina has an interesting character, her function has been reduced to that of Torchlight II's pet (she can go to town and buy potions/sell stuff on her inventory, etc) which seems out of character for her Too much mobs in one area with the same AI, so that they can easily crowd you ^ Because of this, combat feels too repetitive and bland at late-game Limited variation of mobs, as the same mobs appear in different areas and levels of the game I'm not sure if this was only me, but unique items in the game seemed too easy to acquire (I ended up with lots of uniques even though I never went out of my way to acquire them or whatever) Loading screens take longer as you progress further into the story. And whenever you die, you are brought back to a loading screen unless you spend gold to resurrect yourself on the spot Game also freezes for no reason in the middle of combatOverall Rating:7.5/10Edit 05/10/16: Just corrected a few in-game terms I have used "

												I wasn't expecting much from this, seeing the low metacritic (72), but it turned out to be better than its score implied, especially considering the low price point.The high points are solid ARPG gameplay, graphics, and atmosphere.The atmosphere features Eastern European (""gothic-noir"") influences not often seen in the genre (and steampunk elements very often seen in the genre lately).Mechanically, it's a mix of other recent ARPG titles - most closely resembling Torchlight (with at least one overt reference to it during the game). It also has odd Tower Defense sequences thrown in at the end (think Sanctum, but with ARPG instead of FPS mechanics).The itemization is solid, albeit relatively unimaginative. Apart from well balanced base rolls and selection of basic, magic, rare, set, and unique items, you can further enhance your gear by adding a stat (Enchant) to any item for cost, and some items can hold ""essences"" (a sort of socketing system, minus the sockets) for even more customization. There is also gambling and a limited form of crafting (item rerolls/recycling via Artifact Forge).For those of you wondering - you can respec individual skill and stat points at (relatively low) cost (or all points at once for Katarina), so there is freedom to experiment and no need to grind out multiple characters to experience the entire skill tree.Especially notable is your companion ghost, Lady Katarina, who serves as both a wose-cracking companion to make your single player adventure less lonely, and an able fighter in her own right, with her own equipment slots, inventory, skill trees, and behavior settings. She can also go shopping for you.The most disappointing aspect is the prevalence of bugs, which have been getting fixed over time, but are still apparent as of writing. This includes some game breaking bugs that make it impossible or difficult (via a workaround) to progress with the main quest.The low metacritic can largely be explained by the shortcomings of the original release, which have since been amended via updates and DLC. The updates include additional endgame content (high level ""scenarios"", Glory System (perks for completing scenarios), and a new game+ mode).DLC adds two character classes (previously there was just one, with a melee, ranged, and magic path), a passive skill tree for Katarina, and more endgame content (high level ""scenarios"", and a new game+ mode). Not having played the DLC classes yet, I can't comment on whether they are worth it. Blue Blood basically makes Katarina substantially more powerful, which is certainly eyebrow raising, but that DLC could be skipped with limited gameplay consequences.Overall, I would recommend the game as an enjoyable diversion for any fan of ARPGs, especially for anyone looking for an atmospherically unusual ARPG or fans of the source material, but keep in mind that my own experience was limited to single player.

												You liked D2:LoD? GET THIS GAME! Detailed review is below. (Sorry for English, not my native)A short ""what is it all about?"" - hack'n'slash with great and complex character development, decent number of items (magic, uniques, sets, legendaries are included), great crafting system for improving gear. Good interface and interesting monsters to slay (available in great quantities). Replayable and good for multiplayer.This is one of the best aRPG games I've ever played. And my gaming 'career' is long and glorious - started aRPG genre with original Diablo, carved my way throught D2:LoD [and kept carving it until 2012], tried my luck in Sacred series, Titan Quest and lots of other titles. Except D2:LoD, none managed to kept my attention - sure, I played them, finished them but always returned to good'ol.What I have to say it that this game for me is second to D2:LoD only - with a chances to even surpasses it, never forget that this is only one third of full game. What made me put an unfinished game over, for instance D3 or PoE? Regarding D3 - Van Helsing is what D3 should have been. Regarding PoE - it's a close match, but i prefer graphics, interface and overall feeling to a more complex and somewhat confusing skill system. Don't get me wrong, I've played fair share of both, regretting deeply what D3 could become and seeing potential in PoE.Game itself is fun to play, even repeatedly over and over. Price is fine, and you don't REALLY need paid DLCs (except 1.5EUR ""Blue Blood"") - the basic game brings more builds and customization of character than whole D3 - and I stand firmly behind this claim. Interface is excellent, any D2 veteran will find himself at home. So is the monster density and constant action (but with good measure!). Character progression is good, there is a 'respec' option (I don't like it personally, but it seems like a trend nowadays), but some choices are permanent, as it should be.Voice casting is excellent, and dialogues between main character and ghost sidekick (which can be customized almost as much as main character, making a deadly duo in fight, and source of fun inbetween - again, clever dialogues doesn't make it boring).I was with the game since release, and developer team knows what they are doing - many additions/changes were always for the better - I've returned to the game after few months hiatus and got surprised by amount of small, but important quality oflife improvements. And bug/exploit fixes. And new feeling and better endgame.Pros: - High technical quality (graphics, sound, voice-acting)- Various builds for each character- Complex companion development, something unseen in aRPG before- Intriguing (and unfinished) storyline- A unique game settings: alternate history with slavic mythology mixed with steampunk, working PERFECTLY- Storytelling is very good- Game lore is excellent, and so are little details who mean much - names of the people, equipment etc - all very atmospheric- Character progression is complex, depending on several separated systems - dwarfing D3, keeping in line with PoE (on a different level, though) and succeeding D2:LoD rapidlyCons:- Non-random maps and moster type/positions- Lack of random events and quest- Scripted story - not really a problem, but little more open game with randomization and wide range of optional quests appearing randomly - would add more replayability. There is a replayability value, don't get me wrong, but more never hurts- Bugs in multiplayer - once plagued the game, now mostly fixed - and this 'mostly' is why I mention this. Won't destroy your days of playing, but you'll maybe need to repeat quest, for instance. Big deal.Finishing thoughts:I understand that now there is a demo. At least try it. As of myself, I've bought several copies as a gifts to my friends. DLCs add multiplayer value - you can have dedicated melee/ranged/caster characters (and companions with different builds!) with regular game, and it's way better than parties in D3, but DLCs add more.If you like D2:LoD, you'll probably like Van Helsing - it is true spiritual successor of a legendary game. If you think that D3 is what aRPG should be, you probably should try anyway - just to see a different side of a coin, how modern game functions with different mechanics. It's just 17% of what you paid for D3.			"

												Rating - 84/100Recommendation - There's something for everyone. Even non-ARPG-fans.It is a travesty how far under the radar this game has flown. Even rather diehard ARPG fans have overlooked it, which is not only a sin, but should also be a crime. This game is GREAT.All the hallmarks of a modern ARPG are here: Hordes and hordes of enemies, quick level-ups, copious perks and skill points, gigantic boss monsters, and a minion you can outfit who levels up alongside you. There are 3 acts, waypoints, hidden quests, socketables, stashes, etc. Don't go thinking this game is just like every other ARPG, however. There are a number of ways Van Helsing differs from its siblings.The main surprise for me was how Lady Katarina (Van Helsing's companion) feels like a fully-fledged player character. Her skills can be absurdly powerful, and you can build her to either be completely passive and only provide boosts to Van Helsing, or as a hell-raising destruction machine (with Van Helsing providing boosts to her if wanted). She has a full set of skills, mildly-programmable AI, and nearly the same amount of equipment options as Van Helsing himself. While minions in other games really feel like nothing more than pets, Katarina felt more like a full co-op partner.Another part that surprised me was the skill system. When you level up, you earn points that you can use to unlock skills and skill upgrades. In battle, you can use your mana to unleash special attacks, and use so-called rage points (you have a rage meter that charges up as you use regular attacks) to add modifiers to your skills. For example, you can use a lightning strike that sends 3 small electric tendrils snaking out along the ground, and you can use your rage points to add additional tendrils, increase the damage, or add a stun effect. Each modifier can be stacked up to 3 times, and the effects can be devastatingly powerful. Rage charges up rather slowly, though, so it's best to save them up for any one of the brutally-difficult boss fights.Speaking of difficulty, this game skates the same tough-but-doable line that other recent ARPGs (other than Diablo 3) have. It's also worth mentioning that playing in co-op increases the difficulty drastically. I found it much easier when I played in single player, so bring a friend who knows what they're doing.Overall, I have nothing that I can complain about with this game. The graphics are great, the voice acting is well-done and often hilarious, the multiplayer is stable, the combat is visceral and entertaining, the skill system is unique and robust, the difficulty is even and fair, the story is interesting, the game length is just right, and the whole affair is filled with the mindless slaughtering of countless enemies that you've come to know and love. There are riddles, cultural references, ethereal ""rift"" sections, and even a few little tower defense distractions.If you are at all a fan of ARPGs, I honestly cannot recommend it enough. Even if you aren't a fan of the genre, this one does just enough things differently that you will likely find something to enjoy. If not, well, at least it's cheap.-DrB			"

												I'm a casual player. I mostly spend my time on simple games or on the ones which handle a story that I really like. The only serious, well-made RPG game I started and finished was DragonAge. And then came Van Helsing.I have never thought I would encounter a game that will mix up steampunk, monster killing and the legend on Van Helsing in such a perfect manner.The game is just amazing. I only played the hunter class, but I just can't wait to start it again as a mechanic or a thaumaturge. Well-balanced, fun to play, and Lady Katarina's character is just brilliant.It's worth every penny.			"

												I heard of this game by accident and, after playing Torchlight I & II, I decided to give it a try since it seemed so dark and atmospheric.  And it seams I wasn't wrong. The first thing I noticed was that, unlike other similar games, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a game with a distinct ""personality"" (assuming this can be said about a video game). The action takes place in the dark and mysterious world of Borgovia, a world where magic and science(and of course mad scientists) can coexist. The world is beautifully designed and it seems the designers paid a lot of attention to details. The atmosphere somehow reminded me of London as imagined by Conan Doyle as well as Transylvania as portrayed by Bram Stocker in ""Dracula"". The soundtrack is great and it fits perfectly with the dark foggy streets full of strange creatures hiding in the shadows. It's really hard to tell how much it adds to the game feeling but it's obviously, once you start playing, that the game wouldn't be the same with a different soundtrack. The game features 3 classes, The Hunter, The Thaumaturge and The Arcane Mechanic, the last 2 being sold separately as 2 DLCs. Each class has a very complex skill system, with multiple skill trees as well as many abilities that can be both, passive or active. While this can be frustrating for those who don't like to replay the game, due to the fact that it's quite impossible to complete a skill tree in a single playthrough, unless you wonder around and kill monsters just for fun, this makes more sense if you plan on playing the sequel, since you can import everything and continue from where you left. The main character, Van Helsing, also has his own companion, Lady Katerina, the ghost of a noble lady. Just like Van Helsing, Lady Katarina has her own skill system with a few active and passive skills as well as different combat modes (melee, ranged). You can also set her to attack those who attack you, those you are attacking or anyone around or you can tell her to stay out of battle. She can be very useful when you're overwhelmed and she can also go grab loot for you and sell/buy items. Voice acting and dialog is great and you can actually see the chemistry between Van Helsing and Lady Katarina. The game also has a lot of pop culture references to movies/games like The Witcher and Lord Of The Rings. Unfortunately, for those who are used to games like Diablo and Torchlight, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, is a hard game and sometimes it can be very frustrating and cheap. There are moments when you will be overwhelmed by creatures 2+ levels ahead of you, in confined spaces and if their huge health given by the higher level won't be a problem for you, the huge number will eventually make it impossible for you to move so you'll just have to wait for your inevitable death and respawn. Overall, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a great game that will please many Diablo/Torchlight fans. 8.5/10			"

												In a cliched world of action RPGs involving medieval/fantasy type settings, it’s refreshing to discover Neocore’s 19th century steampunk gothic-noir type game, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. The game’s ambience of nighttime villages and murky swamps accompanied by a greatly appropriate soundtrack will keep you playing until your index finger gets numb. Character class and selection is so varied the game will probably warrant more than a single playthrough to flesh out all of its possibilities. Upon seeing the blank skill tree when first starting out it’s almost mind blowing to wonder where you’re going to put all of the skills, perks and auras the game allows you to. It’s not quite the endless skill tree as Path of Exile, but it’s deep enough you’ll feel your character grow as you play. Enemies come in waves, overwhelmingly so. I played a range character and being able to kite the enemies helped somewhat. If you decide to play as a melee class I think you’ll have your work cut out for you. Neocore is a small publisher out of Hungary, and big publishers could take some lessons from these guys. I’ve never had the desire to play an RPG through more than once until I played this. Despite the trappings, however, all is not perfect. There was no game manual included in the download, and for the developers to instruct players to read online forums and watch online videos to learn simple instructions about the game bears little in the way of professionalism. Once I learned how “rage” (the energy required to do super attacks, acquired through killing NPCs) worked I was able to accomplish much more. Some creatures in the game had an attribute called Abomination. I never did find out exactly what that was. And the final boss fight involved a lot of lag for me. I died many times because I simply lagged out. Definitely not a deal breaker, but it made that final fight more difficult than it had any right to be. This may or may not be an issue affecting anybody else. I have a state of the art rig, and I was surprised the lag even occured.Still, I’m glad I found this game. I look forward to playing through it again, experimenting with another class. And then I’ll look forward to tackling Neocore’s sophomore effort, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II. "

												This game is fine if you're a big fan of hack-and-slash action RPGs, otherwise I would not recommend it. I like the setting, and there's a lot of easter eggs in this game. But you get only one class with the game itself and 2 more as DLCs. You can differently build that single class, but there isn't much skills to chose from anyway. Surroundings are dull and gameplay quickly becomes too repetitive - just throw AoE attacks at huge and stupid crowds of enemies again and again. I haven't tried multiplayer, though - maybe that's where all the fun is hiding.			"

(Who DOESN'T love a good H and S?) The developers are also VERY active (from what I've seen) on the forums and bug fixing, which is a huge plus in my book. The Story is pretty linear, not a lot of ""open world"" adventuring, but it's unique story kept me coming back for more. It's a trilogy game set, so keep in mind this isn't the end. Has this interesting power-up system that allows you be both melee or ranged. You can even equip both weapons.			"

												This game is a real mixed bag.On one hand - its fun. It's well designed, has interesting character aspects (skills, perks, etc), a companion , nice graphics, good gameplay. On the other hand - its hard to enjoy it when the game is riddled with bugs. Some of which were litterally game stopping (eg Industrial Port / Palace quest bug - only recently (12/10/13) patched. There are also other numerous bugs (now with fixes via the /FixQuest command) - and MP hasn't worked for many (perhaps patched today as well) and warning of data loss for MP characters.For some, having your game not progress unexpectedly, requiring you to search the web for solutions, isn't enjoyable or expected from Steam games. Perhaps now, the game is bug free. Perhaps not.I would say this game is not one i'd reccomend due to how many issues there have been that are substantial (MP, game stopping bugs) - unless you can get it for a massive Steam discount (80% off). Then the risk would be worth the reward. Paying full price now - without time showing if all the bugs are fully worked out - is not something recommended.			"

												Initial positive impression, as soon as I got into chapter 3 things went sour. Overall, not touching it again. TLDR on the bottom.+ Decent storytelling, somewhat involved.+ Comments from Lady Katarina are pretty amusing.+ Good pacing, good attribute system, fairly decent itemization (by comparison, MILES ahead of Diablo 3).- Little enemy variety, weird incoming damage at times.- Skill variety on the Hunter class is extremely poor. A handful of reskinned shots, didn't really feel progression or much weight from using differerent skills. Same deal goes for the melee tree.- BUGS. Oh the bugs. One of my hunter tricks crashed multiplayer games when I hosted, had to respec / avoid using skill to keep playing. The ""slow time"" skill on the Thaumaturge often bugged entire maps, lasting forever and then on a second cast engaging turbo mode. Random client crashes every 20-30 minutes.TLDR: The game is not entirely bad, but does not warrant a positive review. If you want the hack and slash experience and don't mind restarting the game every 30 minutes or so, go ahead. It's built on a solid foundation, but lacks the necessary polish to be a true contender in this genre.			"

												☺ Everything an ARPG needs.☺ Great environments.☺ Nice soundtrack.☹ Repetitive encounters.An entertaining and enjoyable hack and slash, filled with loot, humour and atmosphere.If you're not a fan of Action Roleplaying Games, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing isn't going to be the game that changes your mind. However, if you're new to the genre or a fan of hack and slash loot fests, you're in luck! Van Helsing manages to provide an entertaining experience throughout its ten or so hour campaign (more so if you're an explorer like myself who likes to uncover all of the map).You take on the role of the famous Van Helsing (well one of them, his son to be exact) as he and his companion the ghostly Lady Katarina attempt to save the day as monsters and science collide to bring about death and destruction upon Borgovia. You empower the great monster hunter and snappy ghost with a variety of skills from melee to ranged attacks and can even increase your attack power or versatility mid combat by powering up said abilities. Although an interesting attempt at creating options in combat, I will admit I hardly ever used said system myself, as I created a character who got his benefits from not using Rage, the resource that powers the stronger attacks.The world itself is really well created with a lot of detail, creating a great mood as you hack and slash through groups of monsters. The encounters themselves are well balanced, but grow repetitive as you encounter the same groups of enemies again and again, a bit more variation in group makeup would have been welcome, but it's a slight issue rather than a deal breaker. Of course, the most important element for a game like this...the loot, is frequent and diverse. I was often switching over to newly acquired items or optimising my build.I must admit, I really enjoyed playing the game. The grim world is lightened with a sprinkling of humour, especially the witty banter between Van Helsing and Lady Katarina throughout the game, which is well acted and entertaining. The game itself is also littered with cultural references, if something is clickable, its likely Van Helsing has something to say about it that'll bring a smile to your face. I also found myself really enjoying the music, while not overly diverse, it's rather lovely and fits the world well.Listed under 'Main Features' is a section on building and developing traps to defend your lair. It's worth mentioning this is more of a brief distraction and isn't very deep. Those looking for a bit of tower defence in their ARPG might be a bit disappointed, despite the developers best intentions.I really do recommend the game to fans of action roleplaying games or for someone that fancies a simple, yet entertaining story with a touch of humour and a great deal of sparkly objects bursting out of everything you touch.

												I...really tried and yearned to love this game, as I do with every indie project that shows some semblance of original thought.I ended up...liking, if at times only TOLERATING, a lot of things about Van Helsing.Why do I say such a thing? because it got pretty bad at parts, but I also don't shy away from games totally unafraid to make me feel like a piece of ♥♥♥♥ like they did 15 years ago. This game succeeds on that front unquestionably.Ideally for 2-4 players, I actually just finished the entire game solo. Be forewarned, if you're not an ARPG guy, you're even in for a rough time on easy difficulty, which I all but mandate in your first playthrough. This game will swarm your ♥♥♥ like Starship troopers with things that do not, I repeat NOT, die in 1, 2, even 5 hits. It's rough, and it works for the setting and the game.Now at this point the average Joe has some idea of what they're in for, so maybe you ARPG die hards are now asking: ""What's in it for me?"" Well I'll tell you!Great music: I had to talk about this here. It's a standard we all have with games of substance, especially a good APRG. This game delivers EXCESSIVELY. The entire score features soft harps and pianos, things you would expect to hear in this alternative dark fantasy Transylvanian tale. Hit up youtube and hear some of it for yourself. This is one of few games that I actually left on while I wrote the review because of how great an atmosphere the menu theme provided. Story: One thing I found funny about a game as goofy as Torchlight 2 is that it took its Story as seriously as Diablo did. This flip flops- very believable, gritty, down to earth graphics, sounds, and atmopshere, totally slapstick everything else. The characters engage in light heartened banter while picking up quests, interacting with objects, and more. ♥♥♥♥, there's even a message board in town at the beginning that is for nothing beyond ""click for great pop culture reference."" It's a true joy to experience.Gameplay: Not much not already said here, You are in for a challenge, no way around that. A fun challenge with friends, but a challenge. Bring your A game, this game's ""easy"" is NOT TL2's.Fresh and new ideas: Ever think how badass it'd be to properly have your own hideout/camp, or even gather resources and build ♥♥♥♥ in a game like an ARPG? well VH almost delivers. I can't say there's any proper crafting, but midway your township where your vendors reside can actually get attacked, and you play a metagame of tower defense to protect it. Very innovative IMHO, and successful.Overall, if forcibly shoehorned into rating it on a 1-10 scale, which I like to refrain from, I would call this game a 7 without question. Flawed, buggy still, but the devs care about the latter and are working on it, it's an all out riot most of the time, and most important of all- it's fricken $10 until the 2nd. Consider snagging it if you're a fan of the genre, or even a new guy looking for a semi hardcore trial by fire.			"

This game will swarm your ♥♥♥ like Starship troopers with things that do not, I repeat NOT, die in 1, 2, even 5 hits. It's rough, and it works for the setting and the game.Now at this point the average Joe has some idea of what they're in for, so maybe you ARPG die hards are now asking: ""What's in it for me?"" Well I'll tell you!Great music: I had to talk about this here. It's a standard we all have with games of substance, especially a good APRG. This game delivers EXCESSIVELY. The entire score features soft harps and pianos, things you would expect to hear in this alternative dark fantasy Transylvanian tale. Hit up youtube and hear some of it for yourself. This is one of few games that I actually left on while I wrote the review because of how great an atmosphere the menu theme provided. Story: One thing I found funny about a game as goofy as Torchlight 2 is that it took its Story as seriously as Diablo did. This flip flops- very believable, gritty, down to earth graphics, sounds, and atmopshere, totally slapstick everything else. The characters engage in light heartened banter while picking up quests, interacting with objects, and more. ♥♥♥♥, there's even a message board in town at the beginning that is for nothing beyond ""click for great pop culture reference."" It's a true joy to experience.Gameplay: Not much not already said here, You are in for a challenge, no way around that. A fun challenge with friends, but a challenge. Bring your A game, this game's ""easy"" is NOT TL2's.Fresh and new ideas: Ever think how badass it'd be to properly have your own hideout/camp, or even gather resources and build ♥♥♥♥ in a game like an ARPG? well VH almost delivers. I can't say there's any proper crafting, but midway your township where your vendors reside can actually get attacked, and you play a metagame of tower defense to protect it. Very innovative IMHO, and successful.Overall, if forcibly shoehorned into rating it on a 1-10 scale, which I like to refrain from, I would call this game a 7 without question. Flawed, buggy still, but the devs care about the latter and are working on it, it's an all out riot most of the time, and most important of all- it's fricken $10 until the 2nd. Consider snagging it if you're a fan of the genre, or even a new guy looking for a semi hardcore trial by fire.			"

												I've always been a fan of ARPG's, since the very start of the first Diablo, so began my journey of endless clicking and replacing one pair of apparel with another due to a minor stat change! If you've played several ARPG's already, you'll know how they basically all share the same concept and pretty much are one in the same, perhaps the only difference would be the actual story, and even then it can become quite monotonous and you don't actually end up following it.Surprisingly, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is nothing like that! Sure it may be a hack 'n slash clickfest, but within its core lies a beautiful system unlike any other! The fast paced combat, the synergy with abilities and auras/tricks as well as the ability to craft (transmute) and enhance your items by adding and combining ""essences"" combined with a rather interesting story that one cannot help but follow (as there isn't many side quests to get lost on) makes for one hell of a good time in the beautiful world of Borgovia!I can however say from experience having played several ARPG's that this is by far the more challenging of the lot I've actually come across, and I mean that in a really good way. Though I did play on Hard it felt more like Hell of Diablo II right from the get go, and loot certainly wasn't overpowering (I was playing the newly released Thaumaturge class and it seems there isn't much unique loot as compared to the original Hunter class which every second unique I got was for it).The gameplay is really well polished, and so too are the graphics, which is surprising for an Indie release! I honestly cannot find any faults with the game itself, perhaps only that it was rather short (30 odd hours exploring EVERYTHING) but it strikes the perfect balance and somehow doesn't take you on a grindfest to actually progress and unlock everything you need or want! So all in all this is definitely a game I would recommend to any ARPG fans who loved Diablo or Torchlight!			"

												I found The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing to be a fun Diablo-esc game.  I did not purchase the DLC, as I got this game on sale at a much earlier point in time and only played it recently.  I did play the game on a normal difficulty setting, single player only.  If you are looking for a review of DLC or Multiplayer content, this is not for you.Van Helsing is filled with hand crafted art and textures, fair story writing, and the occassional surprising content.  There are quite a few references to what I imagine are their influences in game and story design.  On the flip side, I felt like the gameplay was lacking.  I also felt like the story was developing into something exciting, and quickly sputtered off like they lost the inspiration to keep going.I spent the first half of the game excited and drawn in.  The second half I felt like the gameplay had devolved into holding down the right mouse button waiting for my skills to kill ever increasing numbers of the same types of enemies.  It took me about 20 hours to finish based on my play time.  I felt like the skill trees had some fun possibilities, but nothing inspired me to branch out from what worked in the first hours of the game.  It was worth finishing the game to me, but I did feel this sense of, ""Was that it?"" -- I don't know that I could recommend this game to everyone.  I felt like it was worth the sale price I paid for it, and the 20 hours I invested in finishing it.  If it matters to those reading this I do not feel like its worth a replay, and I am not interested in DLC for it.  If I was to attach an arbitrary number to the game in regards to a ""score"", I would probably say a 60%.  It doesn't fail to create a fun game to play, but it did lack some kind of wow factor.			"

												This is pretty good. I am long since tired of Diablo clones, but I liked this one. It is worth a playthrough, somewhere on the order of 10 hours of play. It does not try to stretch that to 40 with fake longevity or 400 by asking you to keep re-running the same maps. It's not flawless, and I wouldn't recommend it without a sale (I got it in a Humble Bundle), but it does its job of being entertaining and engrossing.			"

												I was expecting something visceral and hard-hitting, and although the scenery is nice, as well as the number of enemies which can come rushing into you - Nothing you throw at them feels strong, nor does it feel satisfying when you use a strong ability.The animations are very lacking, as well, and the fact that you have to purchase DLC materials to get more than one character is the final nail in the coffin for me.Better stick to Diablo, even if everyone hates it.

												A more than passable, fun game that manages to pick and choose the best elements from many other ARPGs and fit them all into a nice tidy package (with the inclusion of the DLC).  Pros:-No suicide bomber enemies.-3 playable classes with their own class specific items/sets/uniques.-A versatile companion npc with her own skill tree and equipment slots .  She can be your magic finder, help with your survivability, give offensive support, or a combination thereof.-Well done character banter.Cons:-Some of the unmarked quests, especially the one that spans the entire game are very easy to miss.-Multiplayer got off on a shaky start and never fully recovered.-Some quests teleport you without much warning to prepare.Overall it is a great game and well worth the price of admission.

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is solid Diabloesque RPG on pc that plays well with a gamepad. That was my main draw point as got into the game. What I did not know is that it is actually very light-hearted and silly (in a positive way) RPG experience that really ended up enjoying.All the core mechanics work, the game play is solid, the story is there (perhaps not the best but certainly entertaining) and the game can be quite challenging at times. The questing is always about killing someone which ofc can be expected from this type of game and it might smother the enthusiast of some hard core RPG fans but aside from that it’s a very solid title.Crafting and enchanting provide plenty of variety; some interesting tower defence experiments were a fun idea as well. Graphics are nice as well but nothing amazing.An entertaining and fun RPG game that does not take itself seriously at all and provides just some solid entertainment.7.5/10PS: probably one of the best gamepad supported pc RPG games currently "

												I didn't enjoyed The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing more than any of Diablo games. But for some reason, it was more fun than Torchlight series. Why? Not sure. Maybe because it looks a little more dark and I really loved atmosphere in this game. Having a lovely companion also made me enjoy this game really much and the way you could spend her skill points in whatever way you want was a good idea - you can build her so she will be a real support for the way you will be playing, not some kind of obstacle. Maybe because I was focused on hand-to-hand combat, sometimes I really had hard times - every new area ended for me the same way, with more deads than I could count. Not that I hated it, maybe it was also my fault, but I enjoyed it. This way I had more fun than just running and killing everyone with 1 hit. Also, the boss fights are great.Graphics looks nice, music fits really well. I could only complaing about how game ends, and while the story isn't the best but not that it really matter, at least I look for something different in hack and slash games. If you are fan of those, if you look for something interesting in this genre - you should try The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. Maybe it's no use comparing it to other games like that but for sure it's worth playing. It's game that grabbed my attention for few hours and the time I spend playing it was truly fun.			"

												I recently purchased The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing Franchise pack and it's exactly the kind of game I've been looking for. Over-the-top monsters, decent world building and (for me) much more fun than Diablo 3. I wanted something that dealt with the supernatural and I wanted to kill a lot of monsters and this game gave me just that. I was already a big fan of the character's history and mythos (even though it's his son in this instance) I was very satisfied to step into the shoes of the world famous monster hunter. On the gameplay side of things, because I'm building strictly for ranged combat I like being able to set the behaviours of my companion Katarina and build her toward being a melee tank complimenting my own playstyle. The controls took a bit of getting used to, but they're quite cleverly implemented in that per shot you can decide which type of special round you'd like to load up into the gun. I'm still only very early into the game, but one of my favourite implementations that they've brought to the genre that I haven't seen anywhere else is that when you find a legendary item to gain it's full benefits you need to use the weapon to get kills in specific ways which unlock the item's abilities. It's one of those neat minor additions that helps keep the game interesting. Overall it has been a solid experience and I hope that this franchise can manage to keep going on strong.			"

												Underrated game that is extremly well done and so much fun especially for the low price. I played this only in co-op with my lovely girlfriend so I can't say if the game would be as much fun in singleplayer but it is a blast in co-op, it is also quite a long campaign with fun quests and dialog. The classes and skill tree and ability points are also well done and the companion ghost that you have with you throughout the game also levels up and gets skills and ability points and you can equip her with certain armor and weapons.To sum it up this is a really great & fun game that has good replayability and it also has a hardcore mode. The co-op is excellent!			"

												What Van Helsing may lack in overall polish and length, especially for a hack and slash game of this type when some of its contemporaries seem to march on forever, it certainly makes up for with particular East European flavor and largely successful attempts at humor. If Van Helsing has one thing going for itself it's the fact it happens to have a very well defined atmosphere as well as some tangential gameplay additions you would not necessarily expect, mainly in the form of tower defense game and some separate scenarios unlocked towards the end.That's not to say the negatives don't rear their ugly head; from a single playable class, unless you buy the remaining two in the form of DLC/complete version, wonky and unclear itemization which will make you return to old RPG territory and simply look for basic attribute bonuses, and sometimes outright weirdly paced difficulty. Latter could be the failing of my own poor character building skills, but somewhere around The Old Town area difficulty seems to ramp up for no real reason other than perhaps the introduction of particularly annoying new enemy types. Ending is also an obvious cliffhanger, which may or may not annoy you depending on your take on the final boss.You will be in familiar waters if you have any experience with the genre in general, although your patience may be tested at certain parts as you struggle with camera spazzing out and somewhat obtuse quest directions leading you astray. Still worth checking out, though. "

												I'm not a big fan of top-down RPG's, but Van Helsing is a surprisingly good game. Although, I still believe it would've been better as ARPG. It has a pretty interesting story and nice character design. With tons of secrets, far-stretching maps and numerous missions it has hours of fun to offer.PROS:- Interesting story- Detailed and beautiful environment with atmosphere that involves both steampunk and gothic elements- Impeccable level design (a rarity these days)- Companion that comes in handy when facing hordes of enemies (Lady Caterina – available through DLC); she has her own skill tree and stats and can carry extra items, too- Convenient interface (compared to older games in RPG genre)- Contrary to other RPGs, the player is not tormented with endless choices between items, which are slightly better than the previous item in one aspect and slightly worse in another- Automatic equipment feature (allows to auto-equip best items)- Versatile skill tree- Relatively easy achievements (although, some might consider it a bad thing)CONS:- It's very demanding in terms of processing power. I experienced occasional freezes and lags on some maps (playing on high or very high settings). Some say it's because of bad optimisation and I tend to agree, as those lags occur in specific areas only.- IMO, towards the end, enemy spawn is a bit unbalanced; it's literally armies of enemies rushing towards you and, if you retreat in the wrong directions, it means another army. At times, you're just surrounded by countless enemies in a small circle and doomed to die. These hordes also make the game lag.- Level cap of 30 (not even enough to cover 20% of the skill tree)- Some missions use the previous maps and you have to reveal the whole territory again, even if you had explored it all before- This game does not launch on all systems without problems. In order to play the IAVH, I had to edit the registry valuesMy overall rating: 9/10			"

I found it to be quite enjoyable, although not of a quality in game of that as perhaps Torchlight II but still very fun.What this game does have over Torchlight II is a *story.*The voice acting is absolutly fantastic, and humorous as well.Many people had issue with a skill tree with large amounts of passives. And while, I do wish there were far more actual powers, I like having several passives to choose from.So as we wait for our next gem in this under developed genre go and play this, its loads of fun.

												When I saw this, I thought this looks fun.  I was not wrong!  Besides the initial issue I had with DirectX (had to install DirectX 9 again), I had no problems or obvious bugs so far.  The game has performed well on my i7, 12GB memory, with SSD, and a GTX670 graphics card.Some users I noticed on the Steam forum have been having problems with the game not starting.  My wife and eldest son both play the game, and both had no problems.  But be aware that this seems to be happening with some people.  There is a dev that is on the forums at least trying to help now and then.Takes a short while to figure out the Rage, powerup settings and tricks, but once that is done, the rest of the game is easy to understand and grasp.  Pretty linear, just follow the quest markers.  Keep the tutorial on so you can easily get the initialy help you likely will need to better userstand the game.  Even then, you may need to play around a bit to fully understand the rage and powerup settings.  You can reset your abilitys, so don't worry about it being set in stone forever... just costs gold.Graphics and audio is great.  The audio is enjoyable and fits the action adventure gameplay.Some pointers:1. Take note that you can only have 10 perks during your 30 levels.  Many better perks don't show up initially in the game, so you may need to hold out before selecting.  Otherwise, find a resource online somewhere that provides all the perks and wait for the ones you want once you have seen them all.  Unlike your abilities and skills, you can't reset your perks.2. There is no save option, so you will always return to the waypoint (or ""ink"" point) of a certain area after you exit.  There is a setting in options that allows you stop the monsters from respawning if you exit.  Respawning after death costs money.  Once you get to your lair, you will be able to return to your lair for no cost.  Then you just run back to where ever you were when you died.  In general, the run back is not long for any place, so not a problem if you are a money scrooge.3. If you play all the quests, including most side quests, there is no need to grind for loot and leveling . Once you get further into the game, you can obtain a lot of loot by repeatedly killing certain mobs, bosses or champs, though in general there is no need to do this unless you want epic loot for all pieces of armour... and even more gold.  Gold is NOT difficult to come by.4. Your ghost, Lady Katarina, can be setup to pick up items for you.  Any items like potions and gold will be picked up on YOUR behalf.  So you will auto receive the items she gets.  She just saves you the inconvenience of going to collect them at times.  If you want her to actually use healing potions herself, you must specifically give them to her, and they will go in her potion's inventory tab.  On the other hand, the armour and weapons she picks up will go into her inventory.Overall, the game is fun, with some humour thrown in.  Make sure you get the DLC as it will give even more replayability.			"

												Van Helsing is a Diablo like action RPG developed by the Hungarian studio NeoCore Games known for their King Arthur series. Van Helsing combines a lot of the quality-of-life tweaks developers have been adding onto the genre ever since Diablo 2 became bigger than sliced bread. Some of these include the companion and pet system, the ability to respec your character without ever having to be afraid of gimping them, and the ability to disenchant and unsocket weapons without destroying either weapon or gem. However, the game is plagued by tons of bugs and performance issues and its multiplayer component should not even be considered playable.Issues in co-op:- The questline is not saved unless you are the host. Either play through the game entirely with a party or play it solo.- The tower defense portion and all the Secret Lair upgrades are inaccessible to anyone who is not the host.- Constant crashing when transitioning between areas.If you're opting for a single player only experience, then you'll get an average game that never takes off or goes anywhere. Remember, this is part 1 of an unfinished trilogy. Van Helsing lacks replay value as well. The level cap is 30 and there is no real endgame content. While the combat is genuinely fun despite adding nothing new to the genre, the customization options are very weak due to limited skill trees. NeoCore have rushed out an average game then proceeded to sell extra content for it without fixing longstanding issues. Both extra character classes, and the 2nd skill tree for Katarina, were sold for real money which is absolutely deplorable for an action RPG. Let’s not forget that people who pre-ordered this game got an exclusive permanent boost to their magic find. If you plan on buying the 2nd game, you can probably expect the same treatment. Buy a buggy game for $15, then pay $10 for additional content. These 3 games and all their content combined will end up costing you more money than a new game in the long run. Unless you've experienced every action RPG on the market right and starving for more, then there is no way I can recommend this title.My full video review is available at:

												One word: Katarina.  An amazing, funny and epically voiced companion who will add a lot of fun to your wondrous journey through Borgovia. More than once she made me smile with her smirky comments.There is abundance of references to other games and movies that are well placed and funny. The story is interesting and pulls you in more and more as you play, the combat on higher difficulty is actually challenging and you will find yourself dying more than once before you figure out a way to beat your enemy. As a first game in the series there are a few things that were a bit disappointing and some of them were even fixed later on in the second game:The traps are obsolete when you defending your lair on high difficulty; your own minions (if you chose to play this way) will trigger some of them; werewolf traps do not differentiate between you and the enemy and in most cases will get you killed.Once chosen, the difficulty cannot be changed.If you want to play with someone, you will have to invite a friend, because the multiplayer lobby is empty.You are given a very limited amount of skill points as you level up, placing the vast majority of perks and skills out of your reach so you will never have a chance to use them. I found myself using the same 3-4 skills/perks the entire game.That said, I enjoyed the game tremendously and maybe you will too...			"

												When I first played this game it had a sizeable number of bugsand a punishing difficulty, even on normal. But it was fun.Four playthroughs later, after using all three character classes; the game is a mix of Torchlight II in terms of mechanics and a steampunk-ish Dark Souls, with its keyboard-bashing AI swarmtactics and overpowered monsters thrown at the player.The game has its sizeable number of bugs trimmed down to'manageable' number of bugs with its patch history, but bugsremain. Some of the achievements do not unlock even whenall the prerequisites have been cleared, only to be unlocked in a separate playthrough with another character or when a level is loading between map screens.The writing in the game is, well; incredible. The introductorysequence alone leaves you wanting more with the variouslocations shown, but the witty banter between Van Helsing and Lady Katarina doesn't feel out-of-place in the grimly rendered, industrial-gothic-overtoned world.With design elements from other great games and its own combination of witty black humor and quirkiness, theIncredible Adventures of Van Helsing stands out well, morethan the sum of its parts. Recommended, but due to the bugs, proceed with caution.			"

												I want to like this game. The writing is decent and enjoyable, the ambiance is interesting, and it has a pet system similar to Torchlight, but with more customization and leveling options.However, ultimately, in my experience, it devolves into a tedius grind at higher levels, where virtually every fight wound up being 'aggro group of enemies, kite for an unforgivably long time until all dead, run to next group of enemies', and I really can't overlook that. Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't been playing on Hard difficulty, but the lack of variation in enemy AI and length of time every enemy took to kill really wore on me.Go download some mods for Torchlight II if you want to reinvigorate your Diablo-like experience.

												A great ARPG. Does everything we want from an ARPG title, and a bit more. Does have some flaw, but not a deal breaker. The first series of a trilogy. Review based on GOTY version as the based version might have other flaws as mentioned by other review.Pro Memorable companion. The ghost companion makes me feel like I'm not just going out to kill monster randomly. I’m out for an adventure. She’s a playful character and does make all those little things interesting by her quirky remarks. Quest system. The main quest system doesn’t differ much from any other ARPG, but the side quest is where it gets interesting. The game doesn’t use the standard exclamation-mark-quest-here for all quest. The quest might be out there hidden in the nearby area by interactable items. Once you get the item, read what the item tells you and look for any related items in the surrounding area. Tower defence mini game. The game manages to incorporate a tower defence game without slipping away from its main genre. You can’t fully rely on the traps provided thus you should deploy the trap tactically and let you yourself be the main defence. Unfortunately, there are not much chance to play this mini game and only playable depending on the storyline. The skill systems are well made. You have lots of build choice you can make. With the skill refund, you can change your playstyle midgame. The build might not be well balanced, but it might be just me, not good at creating a build.Con  Artificial difficulty. As other mention, the game uses artificial difficulty by employing a sheer number of enemies. I’m not saying the enemies design are bad, but you always need to fight with a sheer number of them, and by that I mean, a buttload of them up to the point that you can’t move due to being surrounded by them. It is not undefeatable though. Some skills are pure useless. The skill itself aren’t bad, but due to the artificial difficulty, some skills, especially single target skills are worthless. You’ll only use AOE skills or you won’t make it to kill each of the enemies one by one. The game feels pretty short. Granted that this is only the first part of a trilogy, but it does feels a bit short. Nevertheless, it makes you want to continue with the second instalment. Probably it’s not really a con point.  Some bug and glitches can still be seen. For example, the Mana per second for Ray of Destruction skill are listed as Skill.Common.ManaCostPerSecond. "

												The Incredible Lag of Van HelsingGenerally I don't write bad reviews about games, but this time I have to.The main reason why I give this game negative score is because the technical aspect of this game is on the same level as that garbage of this game's steampunk scenery:1. It is badly optimized2. Quests get bugged all the time3. Ability sets don't get saved4. The game tends to crash after minimizing itTo eleborate:1. You will need better hardware you think for this game to be playable, the recommended settings I can consider to be lies. Even if you tinker the settings to get FPS up, the game still suffers from annoying stuttering and screen-tearing. V-sync will dump your performance even more.2. Scripts, gate openings, cutscene launches after booses - such quest related things routinely fail to execute, but hey - the devs got a ""solution"", open chat and type ""/FixQuest"" then space and a number, which quest needs fixing... it is better than nothing but such cheap solution is an insult to paying users - why the hell wasn't the game released in a proper condition in the first place?3. Similar to other hack and slash games, you can switch between saved skill combinations, the thing is, they are resetting to basic attacks after each loading screen. I have asked about this, the support quickly replied and said they will look into this, kudos to them, but that problem actually happening was just another drop to my already aggravated patience.4. Oh, another quest bugged? Just Google, which quest number should be entered now for the command, you minimize the game and it crashes...Even apart from technical problems, there are other things:1. The fights in this game get extremely overwhelming, you are attacked by a lot of enemies at once who charge at you from large distances, in some areas the enemies simply keep respawning indefinitely after you've killed a wave...2. Abilities feel they have low impact. Nothing you throw makes a lot of difference, in most of the game you'll be orb-dancing and spamming ranged attacks, constantly drinking potions and waiting for Katarina to respawn.3. Katarina doesn't understand the concept of tactical retreat. You can adjust her combat behaviour but it doesn't make any noticable difference.Now positive qualities:1. Humour. There are funny situations and interesting dialogues between the main character and Katarina - the ghost companion.2. Visuals.The game does look good, despite unreasonably high actual system requirements.Note that if the technical part of this game would be fine, I would give this game positive rating, there certainly are some interesting ideas and nice sceneries, however - in the condition how it is now I just cannot recommend anyone to pay for this.I am glad I bought this on sale, not for full price! And speaking of money - you can play only ONE class in this game, you are asked to buy DLC if you want other classes...It is NOT worth the money!			"

												I bought this game to play multiplayer with my girlfriend, after we beat Diablo 3. Honestly, it was some of the most frustrating gaming I've ever experienced, and if it wasn't for the fact that not many other games of this genre exist, I would've uninstalled it ages ago.Pros:- nice atmosphere and art- interesting character builds- decent story and voice acting- the game looks great and runs pretty well - no sudden slowdowns or anything like thatCons:- frequent crashing/locking up when doing scene transitions, to the point where we were lucky to play 2h at a time- frequent bugs that interrupt the gameplay (ie you are dead and can't respawn, or you respawn in your home-base but are dead and need resurrecting *in the base*)- bugs that break missions (had en entire level bug out with no enemies spawning over multiple visits/session, broke the final boss quest 3 or 4 times)- ridiculous difficulty. maybe we were playing it wrong after Diablo but dying constantly on Casual difficulty was not fun- as a spellcaster, I had frequent lock-ups where a spell would remain stuck casting, so I couldn't cast any other spells and could not move - had to just wait to die and respawnNot sure how that stacks up in single-player since I was not interested in that aspect, so if you're never intending to play multiplayer read some other reviews. However, if you want to play multiplayer, I hope you have endless patience.			"

												9/10If you're a fan of Diablo or played the Fate demo on Windows XP as a kid you will like this game.It's a top-down RPG hack-n-slash set in a steampunk world where you are a monster hunter on a quest to take down the evil professor who's inventing a super weapon. Due to the simple, unremarkable gameplay and graphics, you'll either like this game or not. It has a very complex character building system that will take exploration, reading, trial and error, and Googling to master. Despite getting stuck on multiple occasions, it kept me coming back until I beat it.Bear in mind I am not a hardcore commited player of this game who's spend hundreds of hours and is on a quest to beat it on the hardest difficulty. I enjoyed it, but the one-track gameplay of this game and others like it is just something I and I think a lot of casual gamers find it hard to get into.			"

												Let me start by saying that this game doesnt really do much that is brand new. It is an action RPG in the vein of Diablo, and all the others. HOWEVER.. what it does, it does very, very well! It is truly a joy to play. Your Van Helsing can wield swords, or guns, or both. The guns really does add a fun dimension of ranged attack I havent really seen. The game has a marvelous steampunk type of setting, and it has loads of little inside jokes scattered around in dialogue and small details. I would definately pick this up... it doesnt play like the rest, even though it has similarities. It feels unique, even in its overplayed genre. 8.9/10			"

												This is a fun little ARPG. Without DLC there are effectively two options - swordy type or shooty type, and you can switch between them basically at will. Your ghostly companion can be set up as either range or melee as well. The combination is pretty cool.  I've had some success levelling my ghost up as a tank, and sitting back at range and using my guns to finish off opponents which are targeting her. There's also some limited magic which you can use for basic AoE attacks.Environments are nice. Maps tend to be pretty big, and the sort-of-steampunk atmosphere is a nice change.The voice acting is a bit hit-and-miss. The main characters are fine, but you'll bump into some real howlers early on who I suspect were voiced by the game's programmers.The game is a bit more story-driven than, for example, Diablo III seems to be. You get quests popping up all over the place, and finishing them isn't too much of a stretch. You do have to do a lot of kiting. More than I'm particularly comfortable with. You either get mobbed by a *LOT* of enemies, with no real way to damage more than one at a time... or you'll get one mob which takes a long time to kill, even though it's not particularly challenging.   This is a bit of a flaw, but it's not a major one, all things considered.I got this on special for $4, and it's well worth that. This holds up nicely, even given the fact that ARPGs aren't really all that hard to come by.It could do with more character/attack customisation (without DLC) and the loot system is a bit 'meh', but it seems to be a pretty solid, enjoyable game.

												Recommend?  Just barely.Pros- Great environment- Good music- Decent voice acting- Defending your lair against waves of enemies- DLC - Lady Katarina and Thaumaturge class- Cool monsters to interact with - rat men, werewolves, and necrosCons- Story is a bit muddled.  Individual pieces make sense, but the overall theme gets lost.- Display issues.  Played on an older system with Nvidia GTX 560ti and it was almost unplayable with everything cranked down.  Upgraded to basically new everything and ran great with everything cranked to max though I would still login and have to restart my computer sometimes due to graphic bugs.- Level cap?!  So weird, they give you the option to have monsters respawn in areas you've cleared, etc. Got to end of the game and my level is capped, perks are capped, and I'm assuming Lady Katarina was capped too.  Lame.  Really killed replayability with that character on the different modes.- Crafting was needlessly complex for a top down RPG.  Let me combine A and B and get C.  Not A, B, C, with D to regulate this variable with E controlling something else.  I went straight to enchanting - pay a fee for a particular stat increase			"

												Van Helsing is an aRPG set in the mythical land of Borgovia. If you've played Grim Dawn, Diablo or Torchlight you'll be familiar with the gameplay. The game does have a unique ability system though, as you fight you gain rage which can be spent to powerup your abilities. For example lets say you're using a lightning spell, powering it up may cause enemies to be shocked, or it may increase the number of enemies hit. A powered up spell only has one charge and can be activated with the spacebar, although this becomes tedious very fast and I'd wager 99.9% of people have this set to auto cast whenever available. The game allows you to set up powerup presets so you can very much set it and forget it and the game will automatically boost the chosen ability(s) whenever you have sufficient rage. Apart from that it's your usual aRPG fare, you have a standard talent tree with forks and paths, passive abilities and stat points which allow you to customise your character further. When you create your character you have the choice of three classes, the Arcane Mechanic who is an engineer archetype, the Thaumaturge who is a mage and finally the Hunter who is the iconic poster child for the series. All classes can have two different weapon sets which can be swapped on the fly, and the Hunter can also specialise in either melee or range attacks.Throughout the game you're accompanied by your ghostly companion, Katarina. She works very much like the Torchlight pet, she can pick up items, fight for you and even be sent back to town to sell and buy which saves you the bother! She also has her own stats and talent tree, you can either build her to become stronger herself, or build her as a complete buff bot which will give you lots of powerful auras. Usefulness aside she's actually a big part of the game, and the banter between you and her is often really enjoyable, the voice acting for both Van Helsing and Katarina is top notch (the same can't be said for all the characters though!).The story will take around 15 hours to complete which is decent, but beyond that there's not much reason to continuing playing at max level. You do unlock scenarios which are basically dungeons with over levelled mobs which makes for a stiffer challenge and supposed higher rewards (I didn't get anything of worth) but there's no real point as the loot is lacking, which is a pretty big deal in an aRPG and why I didn't score the game higher. During my playthrough I saw a total of three legendary items and barely upgraded my gear at all, plus the items are all very generic and frankly boring. There was no excitement when an item dropped. You're also able to gamble for items with gold, but once again I never got anything of worth. I will say that this has been improved in the second game, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II which I started after finishing the first game so I'm sure I wasn't the only one who noticed this massive flaw.Technically the game is fine, most quests have voice acting which isn't always a given for this genre, especially from the smaller studios, and while not perfect it is pretty funny at times and there are plenty of references to other games and TV shows which I enjoyed. Graphically the game is OK, it's a couple of years old and wouldn't have been anything to rave about back then, but it's fine, and it performs well, I was able to maintain 60fps on ultra without dips (as you'd expect from an older game on a GTX 970). The audio is decent and the voice acting is good for the main characters and acceptable for the supporting cast, the game doesn't take itself too seriously in this department and you will find yourself smiling throughout the game at the silly things that are said.Overall it's a decent aRPG with some major flaws that prevent it from being more than decent but if you can grab it at 75% off in a Steam sale I would say go ahead and buy it, you'll get your monies worth at that price and while it's not perfect, it is an enjoyable experience. The devs are also still supporting the game two years later, and plan to bring out a ""Final Cut"" of all three games with new features and a more streamlined experience, this will be free if you own all three games already. If you're interested in the series it may be smart to wait until September to play it as the Final Cut will be released then.6/10			"

												It's a game that does a lot of things right in the first 3/4ths of the game, but that last 1/4th becomes a bit of slog. Still, I had a lot of fun with it. If you want a D2-style aRPG and dislike playing a game three times to get to the ""real game"" - get Van Helsing. You'll have a good time with it.Definitely get the Blue Blood DLC as it has some very useful skills for Katarina (which should've been there in the first place, but I digress).			"

At first I didn't like it, but it gets progressively better the more you play. It has a few unique twists and mechanics to the whole ARPG formula that I really like. It's not quite a fluid and fast paced as Diablo, but that's not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion. Anyway, if you like ARPG's, then this is a no brainer.			"

												Diablo like game, I started multiplayer so I guess I didn't have any tutorial which made it more diffcult...Obviously it's not all like diablo, so I am happy because there is a really nice experience.I will definitely update this review when I keep progressing the game.UPDATE 04.03.2016 part 1-------------------------------I got stuck yesterday. I didn't see half of NPC in Secret Lair. Tried everything...Had to do Old town once again, thanks god it was multiplayer so the other person had proper save...USEFUL INFO 04.03.2016--------------------------------------- The game doesn't have ""I want to play once again"" experience.Maybe with DLC, but... probably nah.MUSIC-----------So far music is really nice and calming.But repeative and does not make any athmosphere.ISSUES-------------My game sometimes freezes while I'm playing and I need to wait till it will pass.Music and everything is fine, just have 1 frame per 6 seconds...MORE INFO AND SPOILERS...------------------------------------------------I wish there could be more essence adding gemstones...And more possibilities to mix essences.And also more powerful weapons... Fighting those monsters take ages with weapon 20-35 dmg...I've got 6 different green set items, each and every one from a different set.And I can mix 3 items into 1 item, but I got nothing good anyway.You have companion that acts like pet from Torchlight.You have sets like in Diablo.-------------------------------------------------Update 04.03.2016 Part 2---------------------------------------------There are some problems with the game.Firstly it's freezeing for no reason sometimes...Secondly it's repeative.When I mean repeative...I mean really... annoyingly repeative.The futher You go, the more it feels like grinding.Not hack and slash. I didn't get any better weapon since good 10 lvls...And the drop isn't good either.From some quests both players get the same items with same stats...When you do quest twice.. Happend to me, because of the invisible NPC bug...You get the same thing, same stats from the same quests...It is trully a one time game...I will update.Update 06-03-2016------------------------------Yesterday I finished the game. And I was very unhappy that I couldn't lvl up more than 30 lvl.That nothing really good dropped, and   the last boss was too easy All that grinding for this? Well... Still 7/10. But probably wouldn't play again.So far 7/10			"

												The Incredible Adventures of van Helsing is a really nice surprise. The game has a unique gothic atmosphere, a well designed character development system, dynamic combat, storyline with decisions to make and some tower defense elements. Unfortunately there are some errors and issues - a silly economy model and weak epic items, for instance. Still - Van Helsing isn't a game visibly worse, than other hack'n'slashes out there. If you like gothic mixed with strange machines, it's worth checking out			"

												With GrimDawn, TorchLight 2 and TitanQuest Anniversary, its really hard to recommend this game.The fighting... feels sluggish and most of the time punishing. Commonly facing over 10 Werewolves or enemies at the same time which kill you as fast as looking at them, in normal difficulty, is not fun and the animation for executing skills are all slow and a bit sluggish.You will have to tweak the sounds properties since Music tends to opaque the sounds and voices.The age of this game... well I would not blame the age but the execution. Animations are sluggish but the killing time is freaking high when the monster attack you.Torchlight 1, the first game(2009), feels a lot better as a Diablo clone that this product(2013).			"

												Exactly what it wants to be. Completely aware of what it is. A smoothly produced, atmospheric and thoroughly entertaining ARPG emphasising singleplayer, enjoyable quests and characters, and a focused experience. A single character and his ghostly partner (playing the role of a pet or minion, albeit with a strong personality and her own inventory, abilities and progression) romp across a neo-Transylvanian setting combing classic Gothic horror, Shelley's Frankenstein and Teslapunk/Steampunk aesthetics.I've not enjoyed any other traditional ARPG as much as this one - more challenging than Path of Exile, more varied and consistently entertaining than Diablo II, richer and far better presented than Titan Quest, and more involving than Torchlight.If you want some story, good writing and something a little more lively than the conventional grind in an exceedingly well made and satisfying ARPG, jump in. If you want to level mindlessly and play the game repeatedly in multiplayer, play something else.This crew deserve your money. - Jack			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is, first and foremost, engaging.It offers you classic hack-n-slash experience, well-written story with humorous dialogues, detailed world, nice graphics and good music. The mechanics aren't very original, and neither is the story - but it doesn't strive to be; the game clearly aims for enjoyment, and dry humour with multiple hidden (or not ;)) references to other games proves to be fun.I sincerely recommend this game if you like the genre, but also if you seek for an enjoyable experience :)			"

												The game is all right, but it doesn't do anything new. Feels like a cheap version of TL2, which in turn feels like a cheap version of D2.Maybe I just picked the wrong class playing as a hunter, but combat was extremely boring. Every monster felt identical since the best way to beat them was to fire, back away. Fire, back away. From smallest rat all the way up to the final boss, that was how I killed the 11'533 monsters I had to get through to complete the game. Quantity over quality, is the name of the game here.And the worst part is that gear, skills and stats don't matter, because everything just scales. You'll never be exited about finding a new item or gaining a level.I played it through to the end because I wanted to know how it ended, but it wasn't worth it. There really isn't any story, and the combat just isn't fun.5/10.			"

												Van Helsing was, to me, one of those games that was only pleasureful to play in c-op. I've started out playing it alone, but quickly grew tired of it. There isn't much holding this title up in terms of story or novel game mechanics. This is a classic, if a little simplistic RPG through and through. In co-op, however, I had the chance to play polar opposite builds with my gaming buddy which made for a more interesting, strategy-driven experience. Without this additional challenge, I wouldn't have found the incentive to ever finish this game. Your ghostly companion has a very enticing voice, though. All in all, I don't recommend it.			"

												Difficulty issues, boss fights not fun.This could have been a great game, but it's mediocre at its best.   Increase in difficulty = increase in number of enemies. It becomes a gangbang after a while.  Some boss fights are frustrating. For example during drill monster fight it's really hard to click on the trigger in the middle.   Currently shrines are broken. When you click on them your character starts running in opposite direction. There are lots of forum posts about this but no one has fixed it yet. "

The good part is it is not text heavy, I can see the where the story comes from, where it might go, but I don't have to take too much care of any epic background history knowledge, makes the experience more relaxing. There are also new gameplay mechanics makes it stand out from epic ARPGs like Diablo2. I recommend it to players who like Diablo but feeling like there are something wrong in Torchlight XD.			"

												This game is an action packed, button mashing, Werewolf horde of excitement. If you plan on getting this game make sure you have a good keyboard. It might be controller compatible, but it gets quite tedious and hard (you end up teleporting a lot when you don't mean to), so i suggest using a keyboard and setting all 92390280938902 key binds to things you will easily remember (even though I still don't know where everything is). There is a lot going on in this game, especially when trying to figure out what to do, what skills and spells to use, what to keep for your character and setting up your companion followers stuff too. This is a game you can't just jump right into and rule the world, it's confusing for new players, but don't give up on it because of the confusement, stick around, bash some buttons and eventually you will get the hang of it because it's a pretty cool game.Edit: Cool until you hit a bunch of bugged quests and can't go any further...

												A great start to a new franchise and one of the funnest, and funniest dungeon crawler RPG's I have ever played. Van Helsing and Katarina have great chemistry and quip with eachother the entire game and there is also plenty of humor and jokes hidden throughout. There are a few issues with the game that do hurt my rating of it, though. First, for a dungeon crawler it is pretty short, but it was meant to be a trilogy. Second, the game is very, VERY unbalanced. When the game begins it's simple enough and fun to play, but once you are a couple of hours in the difficulty ramps up out of nowhere and you are constantly dieing and respawning every few minutes and this lasts the rest of the game. Enemies seem to do ungodly amounts of damage and your stats or equipment don't seem to make any difference in how much damage you take or deal. It makes for a very frustrating experience in an otherwise top-notch RPG. I highly recommend it for the cheap going price.			"

A great art style mixing some steampunk and gothic elements and quite a few visual effects from your various powers that coincide with the fountains of blood that spew from the seven dozen monsters that are on screen at anytime.

Sadly, there is a good number of bugs which can prevent you from advancing further in the game.

												Solid Hack&Slash, one of the better games of its kind that I've played. There's a lot of character advancement options, the writing is witty and fun, and the theme is pretty unique (a mixture of steampunk, gothic fiction and folklore undertones). Some slight innovations and experiments give the mechanics of this game a fresh and instantly recognizable feel.Despite many shortcomings and a general lack of polish in most places, fans of the genre should really check this one out. Keep in mind, however, that after finishing the campaign (which ends around the time you hit the level cap, which isn't too high at 30) there's not much left to do other than start a new character. A definite ending is a nice throwback to the original Diablo and personally, I enjoyed the fact that I can actually complete this game and it will acknowledge that, but I know that this may be an issue for many die-hard fans of the genre.

												This is my first time playing Van Helsing.Just finished the game in Heroic Mode, and i must say if this is your first time playing Van Helsing and have no clue the first few levels are kinda hard and also boring.After Mid-game it gets way more interesting.Loved the voice actors  and the script for my taste in humour it is freaking genious, and also the relation between katarina and Van Helsing is unique. Katarina is pure awesomeness, loved her character!For me the game lacks a bit in info/hints/helps. It should at least teach you the basics enchancing/essences, although it is pretty easy to get the hang of it, i didn't have a problem with it but it's not friendly for new players into ARPG's.Also i didn't like the ending and i expected it to be more difficult.Might update this when i try the 2 modes that unlocked!

												Action RPG, Diablo-like game.Quite fun, environment is beautiful. Quite a lot of stuff you can customize as well.As of now there are 3 different classes, each with 2 different ability/skill paths.Hunter: Name defines the class, melee cool sword abilities, ranged revolver or shotgun battles, pretty cool effetcs and abilities.(the only class ive played), the other two are a battle mage, and a ranged specialist. All classes also has a set of Auras, and a set of ""Tricks"", special abilities rather said. Each ability can be infused with ""rage"" which you get form killing monsters and enemies. With the rage you make an ability stronger by choosing between three different powerups. SUch as 50% more dmg, or 5% heal per enemy hit, or mroe targets hit. the Artifical intelligence is quite something, works much better than in D3 and Torchlight 2, give it special acessories and upgade its abilities, which you choose yourself, talking about your companion, is it wasnt clear enough.Nice Features:Gem cutting, enhancing, upgrading.Armor forging, combine for chance to get better item(Artifact forge).Inktravel (basicly teleport).Enchanting, disenchanting.up to 4 player MP online OR local.Nice storyline, as well as great humor thrown in here and there.Companion called katarina, has her own abilities and passives, has 3 different ""modes"", defend, guard, and caster.Great environment, clothes could have been more detailed but still fits into the game perfectly.Spell details are also quite nice, but could have had more work, compared to the detaield environment and enemy-models.You get to play as the legendary monster hunter Van Helsing.I really recommend this game, very fun and entertaining, tons of quests and items with a large variety of ""stats"".9/10 for its astonishing humor, environment, customizing capability and storyline.

Also boosting  the skills with your rage is 50/50 for me. I can not decide if I like it yet. But I would give this game a 9/10 for its price. Get it and have fun.			"

												One of the better PC games I have played in a while.  It is also Full Controller Supported which makes it so much easier for me.  I am a console gamer at heart and this game is perfect for that feel.  This game feels a bit like Baldur's Gate with more extensive leveling and equipment.  The story is pretty good and after about 2 hours of gaming I can say I am pretty hooked.  Definitely a good purchase and well worth your time if you enjoy the RPG/Hack & Slash genre.			"

												I initially resisted buying this game because I thought it might be a lame movie tie-in game. However I decided to give it a shot after reading reviews. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is a very good arpg game. The game features standard arpg gameplay, well-adapted for using a controller. With dlc there are a few different classes, and different ways to build your character within those classes. The writing is good, with lots of clever banter between Van Helsing, his ghost companion, and sometimes the different characters you meet while adventuring. There are a few offbeat quests and amusing easter eggs to find. These touches help the game to stand out from the average hack n slash arpg. The action is top-notch. Mobs can be huge and overwhelming sometimes. The game definitely keeps you moving while in areas populated by enemies. This, combined with the large variety of monster types definitely keeps the game from getting repetitive. Monster respawn every time you leave an area. Fortunately the respawning can be turned off, and then can be turned on again if you feel you need to grind more xp before progressing further in the game. Overall I'd give the entire series an 8.5/10. This and its sequel are first class modern arpgs, just as good as Diablo III or Torchlight II.			"

												I have played Diabo (1-3), Torchlight 1-2, Titan Quest, and few more others, and so far, Van Helsing is on the top. The world is set in dark sci-fi fantasy + steampunk world. The Loot is great, colorful and many to choose from so it can be adapt to your build. The map is premade and first time round, very engaging story. Here are Pro & Con's:Pro- easy navigation- fast, and candy eye action- many build to try- talent is permanent, hence replaybility to find your perfect Van Helsing- combination of APRG with bit of action Tower Defense- Nice story- and best of all Lady Katarina and her sacarsmCons- Loading time - maybe its bug- 20GB download - are you serious??- It gets bit easy... but still enjoyable smashing through enemySound - 8Graphic - 8.5Gameplay - 9Replayability - 7Control - 8Value - 9Overall - 8.5 higly recommended and I am looking forward for sequel			"

A great art style mixing some steampunk and gothic elements and quite a few visual effects from your various powers that coincide with the fountains of blood that spew from the seven dozen monsters that are on screen at anytime. A great dungeon crawler/rpg with only some slight drawbacks being some bugs that can mess with your campaign progress or bug a quest at the worst. 8/10			"

												This game is an action packed, button mashing, Werewolf horde of excitement. If you plan on getting this game make sure you have a good keyboard. It might be controller compatible, but it gets quite tedious and hard (you end up teleporting a lot when you don't mean to), so i suggest using a keyboard and setting all 92390280938902 key binds to things you will easily remember (even though I still don't know where everything is). There is a lot going on in this game, especially when trying to figure out what to do, what skills and spells to use, what to keep for your character and setting up your companion followers stuff too. This is a game you can't just jump right into and rule the world, it's confusing for new players, but don't give up on it because of the confusement, stick around, bash some buttons and eventually you will get the hang of it because it's a pretty cool game.Edit: Cool until you hit a bunch of bugged quests and can't go any further...

												A great start to a new franchise and one of the funnest, and funniest dungeon crawler RPG's I have ever played. Van Helsing and Katarina have great chemistry and quip with eachother the entire game and there is also plenty of humor and jokes hidden throughout. There are a few issues with the game that do hurt my rating of it, though. First, for a dungeon crawler it is pretty short, but it was meant to be a trilogy. Second, the game is very, VERY unbalanced. When the game begins it's simple enough and fun to play, but once you are a couple of hours in the difficulty ramps up out of nowhere and you are constantly dieing and respawning every few minutes and this lasts the rest of the game. Enemies seem to do ungodly amounts of damage and your stats or equipment don't seem to make any difference in how much damage you take or deal. It makes for a very frustrating experience in an otherwise top-notch RPG. I highly recommend it for the cheap going price.			"

												An incredible, insanely addictive game with great characters, great voice acting, great graphics, design and gameplay. Sadly, there is a good number of bugs which can prevent you from advancing further in the game. But the good news is, the developer is very responsible towards players, so as soon they notice the complaint, they make a patch.At this point, I'd give it 8/10. It would be 9.5/10 easily if it was bug-free.			"

												Welcome Hunter!Lets start off with this, do you want another boring Diablo clone made by some crappy developer trying to make a quick buck? If so, you are in the wrong place my friend. Van Helsing takes Diablo and injects it with steroids. Action in every frame, loot in every crack, and death behind every corner. Van Helsing has the ability to blow Diablo out of the water, if it weren't for one thing: the Skill Tree. Cluttered, unmatching, and downright horrid. Yes, Ice + Water = Fire. Logic. If you can get past this little error, you will have an amazing journey collecting loot, fighting monsters, and laughing that hairy bum of yours off.Well, what are ya' waiting for!?

												First time I heard about this game I thought it was a cheap Hack n Slash similiar to Frater or Space Hack (which weren't really any good). The promo trailer shows a character being put in a bullet hell, but with monsters instead of bullets. This seemed like a good idea to me, but still I was thinking this only happens in special areas/zones, or during some in-game events.Couldn't be more wrong as this game is as intense as it should be. You can fight a lot of monsters and develop your skills in a way that expands your gameplay. Even though the plot and characters aren't really ""the best"" this is still a very good, plain hack'n'slash game. It offers a lot for the price of 3,73€. You should really try it. I'm a Diablo fan and even though I wouldn't play this over Diablo, I would totally play it over games like Torchlight. This game just gives you this feeling of fighting evil at it's finest.♥♥♥♥.

												I'd say if you don't care too much about lore, skip this first part of the van helsing series and go straight to part two to avoid a ton of headache. Multiplayer has a ton of compability issues with windows 10 among other major bugs. There is workarounds in the web but who wants to go through them just to get this game working?Other than that it's much like Van helsing 2 and I did enjoy playing van helsing 2 for about 40 hours until it ran completely out of content and loot.

												i  I recenly bought the game and i started palying it !! I have already play the Torchlight 2 and the Path of Exile , and i was kinda familiar for this game kind.. Well the game is really cool, it has a nice story , but i think it could be a bit deaper than it is now, but i guess that it will happen in The Sequel of the game that it comes.. The basic hero (hunder ) is ok , with some spells/skills be more powerfull than others , the melle is ok , but i prefered to play it on max range with guns... The good thing withthe game is that you can play it the way toy want it , it offers a great variety of gaming styes to chose what you really want.. I replayed as thaumaturge but this clas seemed a bit morre powerfull than the hunter....i dont know if this is my idea or not, but i finished the quest faster than the 1st time... Now i chosed the neverending story to find more chalenge in the game , which seems cool to me,, the ghost companion is a very good made implement in the game , and i ant to learn more about the lady..its on the high ights of thi game..the thing tha i dint like a lot is that i was 25-30 lvl and non of the items that i loot was good for me... i was with the same items from lvl 23 or so i think ,, which made the looot a very stupid thing... the only good thing bou t it in high levels is that you could selll them in high prises.. this continues in Neverending story.. i m still with the same item from before enter he mode, which is kinda stupid and boring..the replayability of the game  is pretty high and to be honnest is the first time in this kind of games tha i want to keep playing it .. also the achievments are kinda adictive i have to say, and i want to collect them alll.. the game ofc is not in the same level as Diablo 3 or POE but it is a great single play game that you hav to try if you are fan of those games!! Also the low prise helps in that, especially in dicount sales it costs 3-5 euro which is pretty cool if you thing the enjoyment that it will offer you...SO GUYS YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS GAME, IT WORTHS THE TIME AND THE MONEY			"

												A ton of fun. If you liked Titan Quest, this feels like a spiritual successor. It's not very long, guessing around 20 hours. I got it for less than $7 though, and that's a great value. I'll probably replay it at some point as well. I'd say it's easily worth the price at full price too. It feels more engaging than your typical isometric arpg, especially playing at higher difficulties. They made most of the abilities have combinations, so you're constantly doing things. Unless you're playing the game on an easier difficulty, it shouldn't be a matter of spamming a single ability over and over (which is nice compared to a majority of these style games).The leveling system feels nice. It's usually exciting to get a new level. There's also a reputation system, where you get to choose a new strong buff after gaining enough reputation. The reputation system felt a bit slow, though. I'm nearly at the end of the game and I've gotten around 6 levels in reputation. The loot system felt on-par with other games in this genre. I got the feeling that there weren't many ""set"" items, but that actually was a positive thing given the length of the game and it's focus on a single player experience. I was able to complete 2 sets in my playthrough. I usually don't like forced companions in these types of games, but I enjoyed the companion in this one. She had a lot of dialog, and actually felt helpful. She also buffs you as you level her up. There are side quests that give you unique items for the main Hunter class, but you can equip them on your companion if you're not a hunter.Overall, I had a ton of fun with this game, and I highly recommend it if it's on a sale or even if it's not. Just keep in mind isometric arpgs are not everyone's cup of tea.I did not try the multiplayer, so I cannot comment on that.			"

Game can be pretty fun but there are some difficulty spikes to over come at the beginning and then at the end. I didn't grind my character so that might have accounted for some difficulty.

												Since some folks may look into puchasing these games individually as opposed to in the ""Final Cut"" edition which includes all 3 games, I'm going to also post a review of the individual games, taken from my Final Cut review with very slight modifications. I'm going to call this one Van Helsing I (while the sequels will be II and III, of course).Van Helsing I's content was great. I expected a garbage Diablo clone with a ghost following me around that wouldn't say anything and would be useless in regard to gameplay; just serving as a stand-in for a co-op partner because the game's balancing wasn't made for single player. Boy, was I wrong. That ghost companion is my favorite thing about all three games. Her name is Katarina, she's wonderfully voice-acted, is the best character in all three games, and she is snarky, funny, and great to have around for gameplay purposes, as she has three separate skill trees and levels up on her own. You can boost everything from boosting your hero's critical hit chance, to your Magic Find (item drop quality), to her own damage output, to her own HP, etc. She takes scenes that would be boring in any other game and injects personality and humor into them which make them either enjoyable or less unenjoyable than they would be without her. I cannot properly express how much I like Katarina. If I were given heaps of video game characters to pick from and could choose her, I dare say she would be in my overall top 10 favorite video game characters list.With Katarina out of the way, the environments in the first segment of Van Helsing I are all outdoors, looking nice with rocks, grass, snow, swampland, trees, etc. It wasn't horribly exciting, but the sheer competence of the combat for a ""Diablo clone"" took me by surprise. The maps were huge with plenty of monsters to fight, loot to pick up, hidden treasure and a fair number of side quests. By the time I finished the first big leg of Van Helsing I, I was getting a little tired of the outdoor areas. So what does the game do? It goes full-on steampunk. The guns and a few clockwork-soldier-looking-dudes in the wilderness had that vibes, sure, but I never expected a steampunk city with Van Helsing as the hero, but a ghost sidekick, monster allies, and scientist villains. It was cheesy and the vampire ally is practically a cartoon character, but it was all so lovable and fun. There were a significant number of references to movies, film, games, etc., but they never felt like ""too much"" to me, and added some levity to the game. The third act was more steampunk city, but the classier end of town, so it felt fresh.The final boss to Van Helsing I was pretty easy, but I'd rather have easy than insufferably hard, because I'm here to have fun, rather than prove something to myself or others. The ending is a to-be-continued sort of thing, but not a cliff-hanger by any means. I thoroughly enjoyed Van Helsing I's original release, and the version you can find in the Final Cut version of the game appealed a bit more to me, thanks to the new skill trees, though that's a matter of taste which could vary from player to player. I cannot speak of the co-op in the original version as I have not tried it, but if it is functional, then I would imagine it's quite fun as it was in the Final Cut version. This is a very good game, though depending on the price, you may wish to grab the Final Cut, even if only to play through the Van Helsing I segment and then quit the game without continuing due to the dip in quality from the sequels.

												Well, I have to say I was never really a fan of ARPG's. Played Diablo II back in the day and while I did finish it I wasn't too trilled with it. I generally prefer to play any game with K+M but tried this with a controller and I must say I like it. The game itself is a bit buggy and preformance a bit iffy, but it's fun to play. It even got me to play some side quests and i only do that in games I truly enjoy. The graphics are decent, gameplay get's a bit repetitive toward the end and banter between Katalina and Van Helsing is truly delightful. All in all, i think it's worth a playtrough.			"

												This game. Buy it. It's worth the full asking price - and that's high praise coming from me. The story is fantastic, drawing you in and making you want to play more just to find out what comes next. The music is soulful, and haunting; the graphics quite good. The game itself plays like Diablo and Torchlight, so if you've played either, you shouldn't have any problems with the controls and skill trees. The references to memes, other games, and popular culture are wide spread in this game. Everything from Ghostbusters to Portal and many more are alluded to here. The only gripe that I have about the game is that the end boss was too easy to beat. I had more difficulty beating a lower level boss than I did the final one. But then, I did play single player and on easy difficulty, which probably affected things a bit. My next play through will be multiplayer and on a higher difficulty setting, so it should be a bit more challenging the next time through. Again, this game is highly recommended.			"

												This game is indeed pretty incredible, both in its amount of bugs (many still being patched as of when I played through it, and the devs are very willing to patch in fixes to busted save files and such if you ask on their boards), and how fun it is. It's basically an indie Diablo clone, but focusing much more on story and banter between the main character and his ghostly companion than is typical for the genre. To some degree, it ended up reminding me more of Dragon Age than a normal action RPG.I really enjoyed my playthrough with Umbaglo and would highly recommend this to anyone who likes action RPGs and is willing to put up with its slightly wonky design and the mass of hilarious bugs it suffers from. It's not super long (15-20 hours) and not as focused on playing through the same content 3+ times as many action RPGs, as well, so it's also not a huge expenditure of time to play through, while still being a satisfying length.

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is one of a number of games released in the last few years that succesfully tackles a popular but well-worn genre, and manages to be both faithful to the genre style, whilst streamlining the experience, leaving it feeling both new and deeply nostalgic at the same time. This game is one of the more fun isometric RPGs I've played, and I'd call myself a harsh critic of the genre. This and Torchlight 2 are probably my favourites, and share a lot in common in terms of updating and streamlining the experience. TIAVH is generally a well-made game, and despite some issues with player-character pathfinding, I can't really fault the production quality. It has wonderfully schlocky voice acting, humourous dialogue, lovely visuals, a deep, deep skill tree that you'll never completely discover in one playthorough, a streamlined inventory, tonnes of enemy types, plenty of wonderful locations, and LOTS of loot. The game also rewards you regularly with achievements, which keeps you pushing forward. With that being said, it doesn't reinvent the wheel, meaning that some of the clunkier core mechanics of the isometric RPG classics remain intact. Expect repetition, a relentless onslaught of enemies, lots of useless loot, and sharp, frustrating spikes in difficulty, particularly towards the last 25% of the game.While this does stick to a classic (and some might say tired) formula, the depth of the skill trees, the frequent validation by achievements, and the sheer personality of the characters and the world keep me playing onwards. Even with any gripes I have towards genre, I'd recommend this for full price, as the sheer depth of content will surely leave you feeling satisfied with your purchase. I hear that the sequel is even better, and I can't wait to play it!			"

												I can't really put my finger on what exactly turned me off from this game. Some of it probably has to do with a fairly uninspired loot system lacking many interesting and meaningful modifiers, and having it reduced to simply red or green numbers to tell you straight up if it was more dps or not. I'm sure the writing did its share to help out, which seemed to think that if it was somewhat self-aware about being terrible it would be less terrible. The companion system was ok, but didn't feel like it really differentiated itself from, say, Torchlight 2. The tower-defense portion was pretty interesting, but felt kind of tacked-on, and like it took up a lot of space for being so ultimately meaningless. The infusion/enchanting system also seemed to have potential, but most of the ones I found didn't seem like they were that useful so I never really bothered with it. Overall, it was a thoroughly mediocre hack-n-slass. I can't think of any good reason to play it over its competitors. It just kind of exists.			"

												It's a fun game by itself but once you start comparing it to other ARPGs, Van Helsing doesn't quite match up.  The single player can be fun and monsters challenging but there are only so many play styles that will work.  With online co-op mode you might be able to specialize, but that is if you can even get online to work. Co-op frequently disconnected even after configuring everything.  If your looking for more diversity from a cookie-cutter dungeon style ARPG, look else where.  The limited abilities/spells also takes away from what this game could be.  For the price it's hard not to compare it to Path of Exile, and come up wanting with Van Helsing.tldr; Buy it for the single player, not the co-op, but don't spend more than $5.			"

												This game is a decent time killer and worth a sale price of about $5, but not really more than that. I'm gonna mark it as ""Not Recommended"" only because even though it is fun, has some decent comedy, and has very good intentions, there are just too many little issues to recommend someone buy this:1. The game has a massive bug with newer operating systems that causes it to crash every 15 mins of gameplay. There are workarounds (which I used) to avoid the crashes but it involves editing Windows Services. So if you are not comfortable with that avoid the game entirely.2. Some bugs remain even nearly 4 years after release date. It's sad because the developers seem active in the community, but are either unwilling or unable to fix glaring issues in the game. Nothing game-breaking, but definitely frustrating.3. The loot system is not very well balanced. It just tosses GOBS of loot at you constantly and you have to figure out which piece is good for your build. It's not perticularly hard to get anything you need ... in fact you'll probably find 12 copies of what you are looking for in any given outing. The ""Go Shopping"" option for your companion also doesn't help matters cause it means, unlike other ARPGs, you don't even have to prioritize what you pick up and what you leave behind. Just grab EVERYTHING and send your companion to sell what you don't want for you when you are full.4. For all the options they give you in character building the actual process of creating a survivable character is pretty linear. You could try and mix up the abilities but in the end you have some key things you will need and not enough points in an average playthrough to get that AND the other stuff that might be fun.5. Repetitive. Not much more to say here. ARPGs in general are repetitive, but I found this one even more so. Act 3 has some great base defense stuff added in, but it takes too long to get to that point and most people will be bored before that.Overall it is still a fun game and if you like ARPGs, have played all the better ones already, and are just looking for a new one ... then this is a good game for you. The caveat is, expect minor issues and get it on sale.			"

												There is so much incomplete stuff in this game. It's really pity. Nice maps, nice style, lots of monsters. But there are a lots of bugs, poor animation and empty scenario. The first part of the game was really promising. But it's so boring in the second half. Pointless tower-defence minigame, absolutely the same fights with new models of monsters, bad jokes and story about nothing. Critical bugs which make game unplayable. (To be honest developers are constantly fixing game, but even now there are errors.)I was playing for Arcane class, i think it was a mistake. It's DLC class and it's not truly integrated in game. Most items from quests was given for the hunter class, for example.But i don't feel be interested to replay this game with hunter or to open last skills in the arcane skill tree. There was couple funny easter eggs in game but that's all. And you can spend some hours killing monsters and waiting for a new bug, but game isn't so solid as Torchlight 2 or of course Diablo 3.

												This was a fantastic buy during a Steam Sale when I first bought it, yeah it has some bugs and issues like any other PC game, but it's REALLY fun. Lots of people, including myself, like a challenge in a game, and being OP in a game is kind of boring. Not in this game, because you end up fighting hordes and hordes of enemies, so while you're OP against most enemies individually, you still get a good challenge to stay alive when fighting 50+ monsters clustering around you. The story is lacking some depth to it, the creators really focused on the dialogue between your main character and your companion, thus neglecting the story and creating something with more substance. Regardless, this is a great game to just kill things for fun, level up, and choose from a variety of playstyles and customization options.

												Being a sucker for top-down action-rpgs, i HAD to have this game on release, and I don't regret it one bit, even if it did take me forever to beat it. This game is a diablo style ARPG complete with tiered loot drops, character stat allocation, skill upgrades, and gems (essences) to put into slotted gear. There is even somewhat of a pet system. It is similar to Torchlight's, except your pet is your female busty-sidekick-follower. She has skills and stat points that you can upgrade, as well as limited gear allocation. There are only 3 Acts, which took me a total of 26 hours to complete on the hardest difficulty. And DAMN was it challenging at times. I experimented with various builds (its easy to respec your character stats AND skills) until I found the right one to deal with huge hoards of mobs. You are going to be dealing with a screen full of enemies for most of this game, and they're going to want to kill you. Combat ended up being me running in to nuke a hoard of enemies, using potions, and kiting back until potion cooldowns were up. Rinse and repeat. It sounds bad, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. IT was only this difficult because I was playing on the hardest difficulty. I prefer games of this genre to be challenging as hell.The story isn't anything spectacular, but the dialogue between the main character and his follower always made me smile. There is plenty humor in their banter, as well as the occaisional referential humor with quests.  I didn't try the multiplayer because I heard it was buggy. The graphics are ok and the music suits the game's style. TLDR: Great game. I recommend it to every fan of the Diablo genre.			"

That said, it's not an especially long game, and the time-tested ARPG system of challenging combat balanced out with a need for loot that works for your given playstyle, makes Van Helsing reasonably addicting anyhow. A good game for its price, held back by its own mediocrity, lack of skill variety, and short length. Still a must play for ARPG fans who want something new.			"

												Maybe I haven't played enough of it, but I haven't been all that impressed by it. It's well executed for what it is, but it feels a bit like someone took Diablo and slapped a steampunk skin on it. Since I've never actually been a fan of Diablo-style RPGs, it's not my cup of tea. Of course, since Diablo isn't my thing, either, this may well be a better execution of that style, I just don't know. Since it's not my taste, I don't think it's fair to give it a negative review.  It's very pretty, and the monsters and worldbuilding are very good, I just can't get into it.Edit 5/27/2015:I went and tried it out again, hoping that some time and different perspective would change my opinion. It didn't. I just can't get into it. A whole lot of it feels grimdark for the sake of grimdark, and there seems to be very little story other than ""genocide as many monsters as you can.""Overall, I'm just not impressed. Story is too shallow, too one-sided, and too focused on grimdark. It could stand to be a lot better. The mythology of Transylvania, the Carpathians, and the Caucasus is a lot deeper setting than this, and deserves a more thorough plot than ""kill everything that moves.""Also, why isn't there a female character option? Surely the progeny of the original Van Helsing could be either male or female and still kick plenty of monster butt.Also, I'm probably drunk while writing this edit. I feel that's just making me not pull any punches, but your mileage may vary.			"

												game much reminds me of classics like Diablo 1 and 2... I love the ability to choose difficulty levels and that the 2 top ones can be quite challanging... I miss that about the new titles on the market... they are simply too easy ... here at least i have somewhat of a choice... but where are the times when you would spend hours and much thinking to pass a boss (.e.g. passing the Arrart Hill High Council in D2 was quite a thing for assassin, so was the Kurast for magician...). Keep the good work up.. and do keep the challange for those old timers  that do like to have a bit of hard time in game ;-)			"

												   One of those rare instances where the zerg rush has been perfected outside of an RTS. The first in a trilogy of games, Van Helsing's Hack and Slash adventure offers some surprisingly diverse game play, witty banter, teeth grinding moments, and an overall good experience in one package.    The game allows for easy switching between ranged and melee attacks. You're ghostly companion is also useful, as well as buffs you. The game itself is well done, with a pletora of items, stats, askills, and abilities to tweak to your hearts content. It also gives you the ability to adjust your stats and skills (for a price) so you don't have to worry about making a mistake in your build. The story is also interesting, with some good humour written into it.   The game itself is a little buggy. Music tends to dissapear at times, and the melee skill habitually dissapeared, very annoying during a fight. Even on normal, enemy density is quite large in some areas, resulting in the veritable zerg rush that can quickly get you killed if your not ready for it. While it does force you to put some thoughts into tactics, it can also be quite annoying at times (waaaaaay too much zerg on the last boss).    The other potential issue, is that the other two classes, and the ability to manually level your companion, have to be acquired via dlc.    Overall however, this was an excellent and enjoyable game that is worth trying if you are into diablo-esque games (though you may want to try and pick it up on sale so you can get the all the dlc at a good price). Looking forward to playing th next two parts in the series to see how the plot will thicken.			"

												I was surprised by this title. It is reasonably well put together and enjoyable with great quips from the characters as you meander through the world. The quests are reasonable, although standard and they have a few scattered in the world as well. It is a bit more static than other games of this nature (At least up to the point I played) and I don't find the classes particularly gripping. The melee combat oriented Hunter, particularly, seems wildly unbalanced compared to the fellow wandering around with a flamethrower and his eyes closed and the purple outfit of the mage class just makes it something I want to put away.  It is worth a play, but only really if you're a Van Helsing fan or a regular ARPG type fanatic. "

The GoodSure, this game is YADC - yet another Diablo clone: you walk around, meet hordes of interesting monsters, and slay them. They drop loot and gold, you pick it up, and either wear it or sell it. A tried-and-true recipe with little to improve on.And yet... they managed. The ghost companion provides for rather amusing dialogue and banter, though her shopping spree quips do get old after a while. The setting is a classic, and well done, at that; the monsters are quite appropriate, and the Eastern-Slavic NPC's got at least a chuckle from me.The BadMaps are pretty much static; while loot drops are mostly random, the only thing that changes are the shrines - not their position, but only their conferred bonuses. It might not be a big deal, but a touch of variety wouldn't hurt.The UglyWithout the DLC's you only get a third of the game: one character out of three. And you still get loot drops for the characters you're missing. So if you're buying, take that into account: whatever the game price, add in the price of all the DLC's.This is not how DLC's should work, much as they often do.			"

												Well worth the purchase for the somewhat meagar price tag.  Although I believe that comes with the fact that this game will be episodic, so take that with a grain of salt.  All in all a single playthrough offers closer to a dozen hours of gameplay.  Fans of the Torchlight series should feel right at home here with the pet mechanics, gambling, enchanting, and various secrets (and sometimes surprisingly deep) secrets scattered across the level.  If you can look past some of the early bugs, I'd highly recommend checking this one out. P.S. Thanks steagle.			"

												Not since Sacred (2004) have we seen a Diablo-esq game of this type. What Van Helsing may lack in overall polish or content, it more than makes up for with an incredibly well-designed combat system and genuinely witty banter between the two main characters. The plot, though incomplete right now, ain’t half bad either.You play as Van Helsing, son of *that* Van Helsing, accompanied by the lovely (and beheaded) Katarina. Even though there’s only one playable class, Van Helsing provides ample customization variety. You toggle between sword-based melee and gun-based ranged attacks on the fly, both styles with their own skill trees and magic spells. All attacks have a kind of “power up” system that lets you add extra oomph to an attack on demand, if you have enough “rage” built up. It would take too long to explain the nuances of the combat here, which is a pity. Katarina is herself, a functional and very useful companion. You decide which skills she learns, when she should be using health potions, if she should pick up items or not, if she should stay ranged or attack up close, and like the pet in Torchlight II she can be sent off on an errand to sell items and buy potions. She acts as a great counterpoint to Van Helsing’s stoicism, throwing barbed insults at the up-and-coming monster hunter, but tempered with a genuine respect and warmth.The world being hand-crafted, everything is placed with purpose. There are plenty of secrets to find, and pop-culture references to stumble across. Monsters have a degree of randomness in where they spawn, but only when returning to cleared areas. This does limit the variety when doing subsequent playthroughs some. The upshot: when loading a previous save, you’re placed exactly where you left off instead of at the start of randomly-generated map, like in Diablo III.  Boss encounters deserve special mention for being imaginative and well designed, something quite rare in the genre.But how is the loot, since that’s what this genre is all about, right? To NeocoreGames credit, they seem to have a firm grasp on the kind of granular itemization games like this need. Items come in all the expected flavours (normal, magical, rare, legendary, set) and house a lot of the kind of stats that assist in build diversity. You might suddenly find an item that makes you consider changing your entire build paradigm, just to benefit from the item’s unique properties. Items may have hidden properties as well, only uncovered once certain criteria are met (damage dealt, enemies killed, etc).Everything is wrapped up nicely in a powerful game engine with an absurd amount of detail settings. The screenshots don’t do it justice.			"

												In a market filled with many games focused in loot and quests it may be hard for some games to get the recognition they deserve and with The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing I can honestly say that it was such a pleasant surprise that I hope it’s not something to go under your radar. As you can expect, you plan as Van Helsing while also having with your ghost friend and companion Lady Katarina. The world from the game is a mix of wilderness in forests, swamps and secret lairs with a combination of cities inspired by the gothic architecture that blends perfectly with the theme of Van Helsing. The Story is easy to follow and it is told in a very casual manner without taking itself too seriously by adding one little joke here and there. As you advance in your main story you will be asked to do another tasks, which, while entirely optional they are highly recommended to do since it will show you different enemies and different worlds. The best part of doing these side quests was that, not once I felt overwhelmed with a ridiculous amount of tasks to do, it’s just about the right amount of content if you just want to play a 20 hour long game without the need to grind by keep killing the same old monsters or soldiers over and over again. With the option to choose between a more ranged or melee approach to kill your enemies, the variety in the customization is also a pleasant surprise. Depending on the style you choose how you want to engage your enemies you can engage them from far or close and personal so it’s really up to you how to tackle them. There’s also a decent selection of Auras, Skills and other powers and abilities for you to explore and learn as you level up. Lady Katarina, your companion, is also customizable and you can even order her on how to approach your enemies as well what to you want her to do. She can attack from close or long range, focus on the weakest enemies or on those harming you not to mention you can ask her to go sell your unwanted loot or even to buy some health and mana potions, saving plenty of time to explore a bit while she’s shopping for you. It’s a very easy-to-follow game and fairly enjoyable. I never felt frustrated or bored and the game did not felt repetitive, something that may be common in these types of games. I had an enjoyable experience from start to finish while listening the pleasant soundtrack and the funny sayings from lady Katarina from time to time.  "

(you gotta find them by talking to some npcs, reading some stuff, or passing by some areas)-Katarina is funny as hell. (She is your companion)-You are a descendant from the Legendary Van hellsing the Monster Hunter.-The game has many hidden secret, side quests, voice acting, and lore to find.-You will feel badass progressing through the game and feel more powerful. (not like some other games i've played)-Quests aren't boring and most of them are fun/challeging)-the game is easy as hell on normal and easy settings, becomes normal on hard, and challenging on heroic(which is the one i recommend).-The lore of this game is addictive and hell creative.-Has some steam-punk features which is very well made and adapted to this game.-It is a little repetitive but no exausting.-Quest have multiple ending, so the outcome might be different based on your choice.Conclusion i would give this game a 9/10.The gameplay is very good, nice, smooth and envolving music, good voice acting, great quests, and satisfactory lore(excellent beggining and ending).

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is just another adventure RPG, hack, slash and loot game. I’m not a huge fan of inventory management, item optimisation and and choosing powers for that .03% increase in critical hit damage. Regardless, Van Helsing is a hack, slash and loot game that I thoroughly enjoyed, more so than I ever enjoyed Diablo, Sacred, Torchlight, or any other game from that genre that has been released in my memory.The over-complicated combat system isn’t inaccessible, it’s just a little unnecessary. The powers and skills themselves were fun to use and you leveled up at a good pace which means you were never far off your next skill or upgrade. The graphics are very good with some interesting and organic level designs which you don’t get often in these type of games. Though I find that all of Neocore’s games, while having good graphics, always seem to look foggy, like you’re playing the game through a haze.Van Hesling is one of the better ARPG adventure games I've played in a long time, the first one I've finished since Diablo II. It sets up for the sequel nicely, is fast-paced and has enough content to avoid grinding. Highly recommend it for any fan of hack, slash and loot games.For full review, visit:https://icarusreviews.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=984&action=edit&message=1 "

												There's not a lot to say about Van Helsing, either good or bad. Despite the pleasing graphics, witty banter and good voice acting, Van Helsing tends to meander on a bit. That said, it's not an especially long game, and the time-tested ARPG system of challenging combat balanced out with a need for loot that works for your given playstyle, makes Van Helsing reasonably addicting anyhow. A good game for its price, held back by its own mediocrity, lack of skill variety, and short length. Still a must play for ARPG fans who want something new.			"

												Maybe I haven't played enough of it, but I haven't been all that impressed by it. It's well executed for what it is, but it feels a bit like someone took Diablo and slapped a steampunk skin on it. Since I've never actually been a fan of Diablo-style RPGs, it's not my cup of tea. Of course, since Diablo isn't my thing, either, this may well be a better execution of that style, I just don't know. Since it's not my taste, I don't think it's fair to give it a negative review.  It's very pretty, and the monsters and worldbuilding are very good, I just can't get into it.Edit 5/27/2015:I went and tried it out again, hoping that some time and different perspective would change my opinion. It didn't. I just can't get into it. A whole lot of it feels grimdark for the sake of grimdark, and there seems to be very little story other than ""genocide as many monsters as you can.""Overall, I'm just not impressed. Story is too shallow, too one-sided, and too focused on grimdark. It could stand to be a lot better. The mythology of Transylvania, the Carpathians, and the Caucasus is a lot deeper setting than this, and deserves a more thorough plot than ""kill everything that moves.""Also, why isn't there a female character option? Surely the progeny of the original Van Helsing could be either male or female and still kick plenty of monster butt.Also, I'm probably drunk while writing this edit. I feel that's just making me not pull any punches, but your mileage may vary.			"

Point is you have to just kill the enemies before they get close, doesn't get any deeper than that. Some skills are OP, some are completely useless. Katarina can't tank because I do all the aggro. Lack of enemy variety. Skills don't feel that they have much impact (read=no flashy visual effect). etc etcThe atmosphere overall is good, though.

												2 thumbs WAY up for this one. I purchased it on sale for a few bucks, but for the quality/duration/enjoyment of gameplay, I'd say this title is well worth the cover price.

												Well worth the purchase for the somewhat meagar price tag.  Although I believe that comes with the fact that this game will be episodic, so take that with a grain of salt.  All in all a single playthrough offers closer to a dozen hours of gameplay.  Fans of the Torchlight series should feel right at home here with the pet mechanics, gambling, enchanting, and various secrets (and sometimes surprisingly deep) secrets scattered across the level.  If you can look past some of the early bugs, I'd highly recommend checking this one out. P.S. Thanks steagle.			"

												In a market filled with many games focused in loot and quests it may be hard for some games to get the recognition they deserve and with The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing I can honestly say that it was such a pleasant surprise that I hope it’s not something to go under your radar. As you can expect, you plan as Van Helsing while also having with your ghost friend and companion Lady Katarina. The world from the game is a mix of wilderness in forests, swamps and secret lairs with a combination of cities inspired by the gothic architecture that blends perfectly with the theme of Van Helsing. The Story is easy to follow and it is told in a very casual manner without taking itself too seriously by adding one little joke here and there. As you advance in your main story you will be asked to do another tasks, which, while entirely optional they are highly recommended to do since it will show you different enemies and different worlds. The best part of doing these side quests was that, not once I felt overwhelmed with a ridiculous amount of tasks to do, it’s just about the right amount of content if you just want to play a 20 hour long game without the need to grind by keep killing the same old monsters or soldiers over and over again. With the option to choose between a more ranged or melee approach to kill your enemies, the variety in the customization is also a pleasant surprise. Depending on the style you choose how you want to engage your enemies you can engage them from far or close and personal so it’s really up to you how to tackle them. There’s also a decent selection of Auras, Skills and other powers and abilities for you to explore and learn as you level up. Lady Katarina, your companion, is also customizable and you can even order her on how to approach your enemies as well what to you want her to do. She can attack from close or long range, focus on the weakest enemies or on those harming you not to mention you can ask her to go sell your unwanted loot or even to buy some health and mana potions, saving plenty of time to explore a bit while she’s shopping for you. It’s a very easy-to-follow game and fairly enjoyable. I never felt frustrated or bored and the game did not felt repetitive, something that may be common in these types of games. I had an enjoyable experience from start to finish while listening the pleasant soundtrack and the funny sayings from lady Katarina from time to time.  "

												If you want more from your regular hack-n-slash RPG than just... well, hack and slash monsters and demons; that is, if you also want some good story, beautiful looking landscapes, and a dense and unique atmosphere, then this one could be for you, since it possesses all these properties. But... who knows for sure? Maybe you want even more than that these days to be convinced, something new from an old genre. Let's see...Well...- How about a good - and we mean GOOD - soundtrack, that perfectly - and we mean PERFECTLY - matches with that said unique atmosphere? Yes?Check.- How about some really nice voice acting (most of the time, at least), with European accent and all? Ok? You know van Helsing's environment is Europe, right? You remember Bram Stocker? Without google, that is. I hope so.Ok, then, check.- How about some little puzzles with ancient, sacred pagan objects in the middle of some frightening bog, infested with demonic beasts trying to tear your hat - and your head inside it - mercilessly apart? How about fighting some blood-thirsty, hellish fiends that jump over you out of the blue, cause you're trying to retrieve some legendary, holy, long hidden relic? How about answering some riddles - yes, we said riddles - from enigmatic NPC's, to which a wrong answer could mean a quick, but no less painful death?Check those.- How about some funny moments that will put a smile on your foolish face: funny references to famous games, books, movies, and characters every now and then?Check this too.You want all that, don't you? Man, then this game is definitely for you! Just grab it now, cause it have it all, you fool!""Then it is perfect?"" you could ask. You know, no game is perfect.""So what's wrong with this one?"" Well... hum... let's see... Ah, yes! Some skills, mainly the melee ones, aren't flashy enough. Yes. That's it. They could be more flashy. Why not? Well, they are useful, they enhance your survivability, and they are fun to use and kill stuff with, but... not enough colourful lights onto the melee skills. The ranged skills are somewhat flashy, but the melee, not so much...Well...If that's not enough to keep you away from the game, then...But, to be fair, there's actually one more issue. Some people who played on easy or normal difficulty and rushed the main quest complained that the game is too short. They say 15 hours or so is too short. But... what game on easy or normal is not too short nowadays. After all, one one-shots almost anything stupid enough to cross one's way on those ""difficulties"". Our answer: stop playing on normal, you brainless cowards, and play games as they are supposed to be played! Your idiotic utterances do nothing but spread misinformation over the world of gaming!Just play The Incredible Adventures of van Helsing in no other difficulty than Heroic, which is the highest one, and you're on for a fantastic and rewarding adventure that will keep you busy for a good while.One more thing. Incredibly, this is an indie game, developed by some little known, small Hungarian group, and it's supposed to be the first part of a trilogy. So, give them your support for their making of this brilliant gem, if you like the game, and show them your interest in the subsequent ones.			"

												Despite a number of issues, this game is well enough. I purchased this game when it was on sale, so I don't have much to regret even if i didn't like it. The enemies are interesting, but eventually recolors. The lack of true screen control makes it hard to see enemies before you just run into them if you are headed south. The powers can be annoying to switch between, but a few interesting functionalities of 'set combos' and Rages save it; even though i never used either i can recognize its usefulness. All in all, i recommend this game for solo and multiplay for those who like top-down hack n' slash. Though, if you do not like the aesthetic of gothic victoria, then i recommend you just move onto torchlight. this game has ntohing to hold you.			"

												Van Helsing started off as a very promising game.  I enjoyed the first third particularly as the side quests and various other things to find in the world kept the entertainment levels high.  The 2nd and 3rd chapters were less inspiring and the end boss was rather ordinaryPositives - the banter between Katrina and Van Helsing was worthwhile and entertaining.  There were lots of monsters to kill and the setting had atmosphereNegatives - the skill trees were a little lack luster and I lost patience with the loot.  I also found the combat to be hectic and not really engagingWorth a few dollars but I doubt whether I'd be playing through the game a second time.

Patiko kartais net juokingi dialogai su kitais NPC ar savo kompanjone, kuri yra išties naudinga (taip pat turi savo stat point'us, skill tree). Pirmą kartą įsijungęs nusprendžiau žaist ant HARD, tai galiu pasakyt, kad buvo tikrai nelengva iš pradžių kol pripratau... Na ir dabar nelengva. :D Žaidimas naudoja kiek kitokia skill sistemą nei įprasta QWER ar 1234, bet ją jau pamatysit patys (daug aiškint ir dar aišku nesuprasit nepamatę). :DŽodžiu, šitą rekomenduoju visiem fanam.

The GoodSure, this game is YADC - yet another Diablo clone: you walk around, meet hordes of interesting monsters, and slay them. They drop loot and gold, you pick it up, and either wear it or sell it. A tried-and-true recipe with little to improve on.And yet... they managed. The ghost companion provides for rather amusing dialogue and banter, though her shopping spree quips do get old after a while. The setting is a classic, and well done, at that; the monsters are quite appropriate, and the Eastern-Slavic NPC's got at least a chuckle from me.The BadMaps are pretty much static; while loot drops are mostly random, the only thing that changes are the shrines - not their position, but only their conferred bonuses. It might not be a big deal, but a touch of variety wouldn't hurt.The UglyWithout the DLC's you only get a third of the game: one character out of three. And you still get loot drops for the characters you're missing. So if you're buying, take that into account: whatever the game price, add in the price of all the DLC's.This is not how DLC's should work, much as they often do.			"

												If you like Titan Quest and Dungeon Siege then this is for you! I will not really compare to D2 as it has no random maps. It is a more static world like Titan Quest. It is a nice game but with a lack of characters. Just 1 in fact unless you buy dlc's but even then you have a total of 3 and that's a little shy... I had fun playing it but it will take a while before i will again. The fact that your character stops leveling at level 30 hurted and leaves no room for advancement even if you play the game again with that caracter. Compared to a Titan Quest having 9 characters that can be combined in many ways kills this one.One thing that is really amazing is Katarina the ghost that fights along your side and is the same compared to the pets in Torchlight. She is so funny, I love the humor they have put in this game and is welcome to see more like these in future.Overall it's a good game with still bugs to fix and things to add like playable characters and much more Unique items or sets. Gameplay and graphics are great and hope they keep it for Van Helsing 2 (and perhaps 3,4 and 5 as announced)But compared to a game like Titan Quest it still lacks many things6/10 "

												Excellent action/adventure game in the spirit of Diablo II. Solid story, very fun NPC interaction, interesting monsters.  Skill tree is intuitive and combat has lots of options without requiring a massive amount of complexity.  The DLC as not been to my preference, but you should check that out on your own to decide.  The multiplayer really reminds me a great deal of Diablo II.Very playful, fun and very entertaining.  It took about 20 minutes to come up to speed, then 15 minutes to adapt the controls and options to my preferences, and then I was off to the races.  The skill trees are varied enough to allow for multiple character ""classes"" and then the 2 DLC options are also available.  The equipment has a wide range of randomized enchantments, with an additional enchant and ""gem slots"" available.Well designed, the gameplay is fluid and easy without being dull.  The story is strong and compelling, but leaves a bunch of exploration options so it does not feel railroaded.I recommend to anyone who enjoys fantasy action games.			"

												Every ARPG seems to excel in some manner over the other ARPG's on the market.  Van Helsing excels at the boss fights and companion configuration.  Simply the best boss fights and most configurable/usable companion to be found.  If you're an ARPG fan, then Van Helsing should not be missed.  It's right up there with Diablo 2 (notice, not 3) with regards to quality.  Give it a try, you will not be disappointed!			"

												The incredible Adventures of Van Helsing ( an all dlc version review )This game offers you a choice of 3 different classes, each with a very solid selection of skills, first being a hunter which can actually be built in 3 different ways entirely on its own, or hybridized to your hearts content, having melee, ranged ( pistols and rifles ) and occult ( magic ) skills at his disposal.The second class is the Thaumaturge who is a pure spellcaster with plethora of skills at his disposal both offensive and control/support, all having their specific use, and the final class is a unique Arcane mechanic, having mine and grenade skills at his disposal, as well as gadgets and turrets.It is a very well done, unique and incredibly refreshing setting that this game is taking place in, there are no dwarves, no elfs, no typical fantasy arpg of which there is 16874 on the market and all look the same in the end.The game is set in a beautiful gothic noir setting with mythical, as well as mechanical creatures to be fought, and with exciting places to explore.Speaking about the monsters -They are designed well and look unique, there is swarms of them, so there is always alot of action, and thus, there is also tons of actually good loot, what more could you wish for, right?Speaking of loot, the itemization in this game is very well done. There is very typical item system of normal, magic, rare ( thus far the exact same as diablo II, including colors ) and finally epic and set items, which all have functionality like stat comparison to your equipped item, comparison to your followers equipped items ( more on that in a bit ) etc, a bit of a downside perhaps could be  that later on in the game, you may start getting lost in the constant stat comparations, because in this game it is fairly usual to be swapping items for new ones often.And what deserves a mention as well is that the devs were not afraid to actually let you drop or be rewarded with the epic items, one of my dislikes about other recent Arpg's is that you basically never get to see any of the highest tier items unless you farm for them for ages or play advanced game modes.This brings me to quest rewards, and money, since they go hand in hand.This is another area this game excels at. You get very, very good rewards even for sidequests you'd think were meaningless or not worth to bother with, being used to that from other, maybe even most rpg's.But in here, you are always rewarded with a rare item, sometimes in fact a unique ( epic ) one, with skill or stat points ( sometimes for you, sometimes for your follower ), and a decent sum of money, which are useful for quite alot of things as well.The experience reward for quests could I thought be higher, but then again, I reached the max level just playing the game normally, so there was no need for it then.And regarding money, another often overlooked area in other games, in here, you can then spend them upgrading your weapons, reseting your stat or skill points ( no other limits  for that then your money, awesome! ), gambling for items, and later on even improving the hideout where your character interacts with friendly npc's.Remember the mention of a follower? You indeed have one, bound to you by the storyline, and when I saw this, I was not happy about that, having experiences from most other games where followers are just constantly dead and useless.Not so in here, your follower, a ghost woman called Katarina has her own level progression with attribute points and 2 skill trees, one of which improves you by her actions/simply being with you, and the other purely improving her alone.This leaves incredible versatility and usefulness to her because you are completely free to make her an uberpowerful tank if you need it, and if it so happens she'd die, you can actually enable her to explode on death, usually clearing the whole mob of enemies that was attacking her.If you are melee, you are in turn completely free to make her your ranged support, or even if you so wish, to leave her out of the battle and just give you a permanent 10% dmg reduction.Furthermore, you could also tell her which items she would pick up ( if any ) and in which way should she attack your enemies, I wouldnt ask for more.Along Katarinas level up progression, and yours, which of course also lets you assign the typical attribute and skill points, there is more for your character than that. Much more.Along the regular skill tree ( or trees, for the Hunter class ), you also get an entire additional passive skill tree, which is in part unique and partially shared to/by all the classes, where you could choose from a number of passive skills two that you want to have active at all times.Want dmg reduction? Its there, want to heal Katarina with your attacks? Sure, and so much more.And thats still not all. There is an additional skill tree called ""tricks"" which you can also invest skill points, which are very useful active abilities like stopping the time, making 2 more katarinas temporarily to help you, or my spellcasters favourite, being able to burn all your mana for a massive explosion around him.Since the Thaumaturgist's spells are mainly focused on damage over time ( DoT ), this is a great tool to have for burst damage.Thought thats all? Nope, still not yet, because there are additionally perks too..You get those for killing big bosses and in general unusual monsters like veterans and champions, and they furthermore permanently improve your character to the point where you can choose to be impossible to be stopped in your tracks, or to not die when killed, and merely become incorporeal for several seconds.Now thats what I call a character progression, and to my best knowledge, I can honestly say it is unparalleled by any other single player Arpg's out there.The game as it is at the moment is imo a truly great experience free of any glitches or bugs, after being patched multiple times, which is incredibly impressive for a game studio so small that the final credits only rolled for about 1 single minute, no exaggeration.The game has very professional voice acting, as well as enjoyable music which deserves a mention, and the game is also full of very funny references to all kinds of things, including other games, of the same genre or otherwise, sometimes fairly hidden, sometimes very obvious.Some games may try to make jokes which dont fit in it, or some games just go full ""funny"" all the way, but what is impressive  about this game is that it manages to have an interesting, serious, believable world and atmosphere, and yet, effortlessly manages to include funny references in it that just make you smile..The games lenght is very solid 18 hours for one playthrough which is great, considering there are scenario mode and a game+ mode available as well, so replayability is great.Sumarry: An amazing action rpg game that has been a ton of pure fun thanks to its for a single player rpg unrivaled character development options, unique setting, fluent game mechanics that are clear and work exactly as youd expect at all times, and thanks to the constant rewards the game gives you which will never make you leave it for long until youve seen it all.And that would take at least a while.Highly recommended to get, the developers really deserve to be rewarded for a game this polished and with this many gameplay features.Rating: 89/100Pros:Unique settingCharacter developmentUseful followerItem types, customization optionsNpc functionalitiesGame's lasting appealSmart, funny referencesMade by a very small team, yet feeling as an AAA title forCons:Recycling of enemies in some levelsSometimes can become messy with swarms of enemies aroundStat comparing may feel a bit confusing "

												I was surprised by this title. It is reasonably well put together and enjoyable with great quips from the characters as you meander through the world. The quests are reasonable, although standard and they have a few scattered in the world as well. It is a bit more static than other games of this nature (At least up to the point I played) and I don't find the classes particularly gripping. The melee combat oriented Hunter, particularly, seems wildly unbalanced compared to the fellow wandering around with a flamethrower and his eyes closed and the purple outfit of the mage class just makes it something I want to put away.  It is worth a play, but only really if you're a Van Helsing fan or a regular ARPG type fanatic. "

												Rating: 8/10This game definitely belongs to the better half of the hack'n'slash RPG out there and has probably the best kind of humor amongst them all. Gameplay is really nice and smooth, with various skill tree (tricks/actives/passives/auras...) and many side-quests, hovewer, it's pretty short in comparison to other similar pieces. You can extend your game experience by playing single scenarious or start neverending story mode (something like NG+). If you decide to buy this game, I would recommend to get the DLC's as well, since they really add some nice features which original game lacks (new skill tree for Katarina, and most importantly, two new classes - Thaumaturge and Arcane Mechanic).

												Van Helsing seemed like a pretty unoriginal but promising Diablo clone, but late in to the game tremendous technical issues caused constant CTDs (these are known issues - check the Steam discussions for proof of how common they are) and these literally prevented me from finishing the game. I couldn't have even if I'd wanted to. What's worse is that these are not new issues. These are known problems that the developer acknowledged but never bothered to fix.I will never buy another Neocore product again, not even on sale (which is how I purchased Van Helsing), and I do not wish their studio well.

												     I really love this game. One playthrough takes about 21 hours if you don't rush and do all of the side quests. There are three character types to choose from. You get a ghost companion named Katarina who follows & destroys enemies with you. It is action packed, has a good plot. There is just mob after mob to get to where you need to go. I would compare it to FATE, except this has way better graphics. It also has pretty good variation in the mosters you battle. There are also side quests that add to the experience. It's different than most RPG's and honestly, especially if it's on sale, you just should try it out.			"

												As I sometimes venture in RPGs similar to Diablo or Torchlight I did enjoy TIAOVH. For a game that looks good, is somewhat challenging I would recommend it to a casual player to spend a Sunday evening when you don't know what to play. The graphics is OK for today's standards, nothing new and groundbreaking, nothing fancy. The scripts and the animation is decent. But this game is not about graphics, it's about gameplay.It's smooth, the controls are very similar to other hack and slash games making it easy just to venture in the game. The best part of the combat is the diversity how you can approach the hordes of enemies. You can dive in or you can pick them off from a far and with multiple skill trees to make it interesting. Considering sound I did find the voice acting standing out from all other sounds in the game and it can become quite irritatingIf you are looking for something to pass the time, this is the game you should consider to add to your library.I've had time to play the game for a couple of hours for now but I will surely finish this on some Sunday afternoon for sure.

But if you want this game for 100% achievement's complete, be ready for really tough game and at least one hundred hours in this game. But I recommend it you, definitely.			"

												Van Helsing is an arpg fantasy game set in the not too distant past. You play as the son of Van Helsing and, like your father, you have a variety of spells, ranged weapons, and blade weapons at your disposal. The story isn’t great, but it’s also no worse than the stories in other arpgs. Van Helsing, the ghostly companion, and a few other notable characters have decent voice work, but the rest of the cast is plagued by lines likely composed by the programmers themselves. Most of the locations are graphically pleasing, but some appear slightly blurry (idk why???). The-game play is smooth and responsive; the enemies vary in aesthetics and behavior; and the progression system is elaborate and rewarding. Overall, the game at its core is great, but bugs, glitches, and oversights (see comment section) compound to drastically ravage the overall experience.

												One of my favorite games on steam. It's combat is similar to that of Diablo. Your methods of attack are of course Ranged (Guns) and Melee (Swords). The skill tree system allows you to specialize in one or the other but also allows you to mix and match to find a style that find a style that fits your method of playing. The game is pretty long with plenty of side quests and the story is pretty good. The dialog could be better for other characters but the conversations between you and your partner are quite humorous. There isn't any grinding in this game so the game pretty much encourages you to do side quests to make sure that you're at the appropriate level so things aren't to hard. There is some strategy involved in combat so you can't just go rushing into a fight expecting to win all the time. I learned that the hard way. You're ghostly companion can also be leveled up and the game allows you to spend her stat points as you please, so you can make her a tank or an all out brawler. She also has two modes of attack: Melee and Ranged which you can switch at anytime you want even in the midst of combat. She has plenty of buffs you can choose from when you level her up, giving you more defense, attack, etc. The games multiplayer isn't that bad but it's kind of dead so maybe you might want to try and get a friend to play with you. Overall the game is worth the buy even at full price. My personal score for the game is an 8/10 so give it a try!			"

												Slice up werewolves, then shoot the faces off frog demons. Fun. Appropriately challenging on normal difficulty. Don't try to start on hard (like this guy)! If you seek a challenging experience, start with normal and you'll find challenging enemies soon.It's well written. The voice acting feels right. Characters are interesting. Katarina, your ghostly battle-buddy, chimes in with witty comments or advice at the right times, and these feel welcome (no Navi syndrome here). There's plenty of humor to be found in NPCs. There are plenty of nods to folklore and even historical figures (e.g., Elizabeth Bathory).Graphics and animations look satisfying enough, as of Summer, 2014 standards. Really, nobody should expect triple A visuals from an indie title. It does come pretty close.This hack 'n slash dungeon crawler takes some old elements of the genre: health/mana potions, stat points and skill trees, hordes of enemies, ect., and adds a few new elements. Not too many, though. This is still a dungeon crawler lootfest. Fans of the genre will be pleased. As for shortcomings, I have thus far found minor ones. Few bugs. Pathfinding is a minor issue at times. There is only one class in the default game (2 more with DLCs). Granted, this one class has plenty of customization; you can build Van Helsing mostly how you'd like. You can also customize Katarina's skills and stats, allowing her to cover weaknesses in your build, or to prop up your strengths even further. However, there is no significant tutorial system except a handful of control blurbs. As for how to build your character, you have to figure that out. Thankfully, there are plenty of respeccing opportunities; just pay an NPC some gold.			"

												I picked this up a few weeks ago on sale and so far, have greatly enjoyed it.  It's an action rpg with surprisingly good character chemsitry and voice acting.  The interactions between the protagonist and his ghostly companion are well acted and entertaining.  The companion helps in combat, either through a ranged form, melee form, or passive form that grants you 10% damage resistance.The skill system (for the primary Hunter character) is divided into 4 parts.  Melee, Ranged, Tricks, and Auras.  Melee and Ranged are self-explanatory.  Tricks give you spells that don't require mana but have a timer, that range from healing, to cloning your ghost, to ramming through your enemies.  Auras grant you passive improvements to your character.  One aspect I really enjoy of the skill system is the ability to upgrade your ghostly companion.  You can spec her to have skills that passively benefit you (such as increased magic find or defense) or enhance her damage and survivabilty. Combat is a bit diferent in that you can enhance your skills with adrenaline.  Each skill offers 3 different side-grades that you can enhance your attack with all at once (e.g., +30% damage, +10% damage resistance, +10% length) or dump all of your adrenaline into one for maximum effect (e.g, +90% damage).  The combinations are interesting and even the early skills remain viable throughout the game.  Combat can be irratating because you are constantly being swarmed by gangs of monsters, so the focus tends to be more on crowd control than anything else.  As you progress through the story, some monsters are downright brutal and can kill you very quickly if you are not careful.  The story is on par for the genre and the setting, while appropriately grim, isn't anything spectacular.  There are a few bugs here and there, so be forewarned.  At times, the game will hang, which can be really annoying.  Generally it clears up but I have had to force-quit on at least one occassion.With the vanilla pack, there is only the Hunter class.  While you can spec Van Helsing with all sorts of skills, if you want a pure magic based or technology based character, you will have to pay for them in separate DLC. Bottom line:  If you like action RPGS, you will like The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.  It's not perfect, but I think it has enough charm to help it stand out in the crowd.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is an ARPG. It's a very good, entertaining ARPG. I've had plenty of fun with the game, especially once the online was fixed and I picked up the Thaumaturge. The DLC classes are a bit pricey, especially since they add a bit of much-needed diversity to the game, but the base content is by no means bad. Just a bit limited in your character options, especially for more than 2-3 people.The atmosphere and tone of the game is dark, but at the same time it's not. The dialouge is surprisingly entertaining, but not all that great. The back and forth with Katarina and the hunter is especially amusing. There are a few other humorous characters (like the priest in the village), but no one really THAT memorable.The combat is pretty standard fare for the genre, but it's not bad, or even bland. I'm not a Diablo 2 veteran or anything, so I can't really say for sure how ""done-to-death"" this whole system is, but I enjoyed it.IT""S a good game. If you like ARPGs, or want to try them, it's not a bad one to pick up. Especially if it's on sale. Like it is right now.			"

It's an action-RPG with some really excellent character and graphics design and tight gameplay with a variety of weaponry and loot. The twist this time is that you have an AI companion (with good AI, don't worry) that's a ghost that accompanies you, along with clever dialogue. The horror/supernatural/early modern setting is also a bit different. Good dialogue, good story, good game.If you like Diablo-style games, buy now.			"

												This game is good. I really enjoyed it. I did not come across any bugs or things that i don't like in general. Not everybody likes this type of game (I personaly don't), but i wanted to give this one a spin, because it look a bit better than Diablo 3 and other games of this genre. It has that strange authentic feel between fantasy and history, which in my opinion make it somewhat more likable. I have heard and read, that the multiplayer sucks, but that isn' t that important for me. I think it gives a nice experience when you play singleplayer. I found some parts that were pretty challenging. For instance, when there is this huge group of monsters charging at you. Now THAT is scary! (and hard to deal with)The graphics are not the best, but they surely are nice. The lighting effects are really nice and give you a good feeling when you are in the wilderness.Overall i give this game a 8/10. If you like this type of games, DO NOT miss out on this one.+ it's nice to blow monsters up into litlle pieces of meat. :3			"

												I really love ARPGs and the way they play, that said I absolutely despise this game.I'm reccomending it because despite its major flaws it's still playable and has a great atmosphere, although you're very likely to get fed up with it and uninstall.I'll start this off by saying that all of its problems are caused by too many enemies at once, this game goes completely overboard in that department.Area of effect damage is a requirement, anything that does single target is next to useless here. The further you go into the game the larger the mob of enemies it constantly throws at you becomes, you can't even pick them off from a distance because chances are that the entire mob is going to react and come after you, and another thing to note is that your ranged attacks do not go over enemies which means all those high damage ranged enemies are safe behind the giant wall in your face. And on top of that some of them can heal other enemies, so you HAVE to kill them first.There is a perk that makes you atheral when your health runs out, you're going to find yourself getting a lot of useage out of that one. Along with that you're going to find yourself needing to heal constantly, so cooldown reduction is an absolute must so you can use heal often.I cannot even fathom playing the game class due the fact that there are enemies who drain your mana beyond faster than you can regenerate it even with mana potions, and this doesn't stop being a pain if with other classes, because all of your skills cost mana to use except your default skills.

												Diablo-style isometric games seem to be enjoying a rennaissance since Torchlight and in spite (or maybe because) of how abysmally shallow Diablo 3 was. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is another entrant in this category, but one that smartly does a few things differently than its contemporaries. I won't go as far as to say that it's necessarily better than my current fave, Torchlight 2, but it's DIFFERENT. And it does it well. If you've never played one of these, Torchlight (1 or 2) might be a better introduction, but for the money they're asking Van Helsing will do fine.Since I already made the Torchlight 2 comparison, I should stick with it. Gameplay is largely similar, but Van Helsing amps the utility of the companion character. This is a sharp-tongued ghost whose banter with Van Helsing brings in a smattering of levity in sometimes not so appropriate circumstances. While she has a bit less depth than the player character she brings her own skill trees, stats and gear to taylor her to your needs. Which is to say, for my heavy hitting ranged attacker I've specced her to be a 'tank', but she can set up for added damage or support as well. On top of that, Van Helsing has a set of aura skills which further refine the relationship between the two characters. This alone allows for a number of gameplay variety. Add to this a tower defense style subgame for even more fun and two DLC character classes for even more variety and you have a game that seldomly feels boring.But the real star to me is the setting of Van Helsing. Taking cues from the Hugh Jackman movie of the same name and not being afraid to reach deeply into a cliché vault, the game presents a turn of the century world full of fairy tale monsters, mythical beasts and mad scientists replete with clockwork soldiers and mutant troopers. As hinted at above the game often doesn't take itself too seriously and that is ultimately what makes the mixture work. While not as thought through as the backdrop of, say, Dishonored, it's a nice departure from the generic fantasy tropes you get in most any form of RPG to this day.The game is far from perfect, still plagued by bugs and balance issues and the way scenery fades out so as to not obstruct your view (or pops back in) can be pretty jarring. But for the price it's being sold at I find that perfectly acceptable. It's not like it's the 3rd part in an acclaimed series from a purported top studio that is a dumbed down version of its predecessor, it doesn't force you to be always online, has no attached con artistry like a cash auction house... you probably get the idea. For what it is, it's a rocking game.			"

												Its odd, the first thing i felt when i started it was a feeling of diablo, the way youre just running around gathering mobs, just to turn around and spam a AoE button :) There is not too many flaws in this game. BUT they could have made the tips a little better :) I found my self looking for how to activate my abilities, and I just coulndt.. theres a number system right above your abilities, and so far of what ive learned thats how many times you stack it. TO get the stack ability you need rage, and how do you get rage you ask? well you use youre normal attack, be it use of sword or rifle.The game is really adictive to a certain point. it highly lacks of replayability, as once you killed a creature, it stays killed forever. Some might find it better and more fitting to the story and stuff. but say if you needed cash, or a little exp to survive in the next area, *buzz wrong sound* youre wrong.... The only way to proceed in certain scenarios like that, is trial and error, respec, try and die, respec, try and win. Thats one of the few flaws this game has. but overall really good looking, awesome single player aspects (Havent played online, so wont review that part)Overall rating for this game would be a 7/10			"

												A brillaint charming dungeon crawler that does what few Diablo clones do. It uses the relationship between Van Helsing Jr and Katarina to inject some humour into the genre. These two have brilliant chemistry together and makes the game a joy to play. The gamepad support is brilliant, the grpahics are nice and clean and crisp, with very few framedrops. The loot is sensational and the levels and enemies are well designed. The map isn't the greatest of tools and can leave you scratching your head, but the game does have quite a linear desgn when it comes to level design. I would rate this game 7.5/10. A brilliant indie title like torchlight, but with more humour and better character development, but the levels are a bit linear and the map should be clearer			"

												Van Helsing is a stellar representative of the action-RPG genre. Katarina, your constant ghostly companion, is a witty follower you'll be glad to have at your side. She functions very much like Torchlight's pets, and she and Van Helsing engage in frequent, humourous banter. There's a large world to explore which sports a rather steampunk flair, and it overflows with an equally large roster of enemies which take cues from popular fantasy villains, all with a mechanical overlay. (Electric werewolves, anyone?) One of my favorite features that made late gameplay much easier was the ability to reset skill and ability points for both yourself and Katarina. This allows you to readjust your stats for how you've developed your play style. Because I never focused on ranged combat, removing nearly all my points in that ability and pumping up my melee attack made what had become frustrating game time a pleasure again. Unfortunately, most equipment largely looks the same, so your character never appears visually as epic as Torchlight characters. A few times gameplay feels unessessarily stretched with a similar mission repeated or a mandatory replay of an already-cleared area. These litle grieveances aside, Van Helsing is a surprisingly great game. Fans of Diablo and Torchlight need look no further for their next fix.			"

												This game has its ups and downs, but all in all, it was a good ride.The atmosphere is well-presented, and it goes well with the musical score (which is even better). If you're an older gamer, or a movie aficionado, you're gonna love the ""one-liners"" and references made throughout the game.Now, let's focus on the negative sides of this little hack'n'slash treat. Even though it's been more than 2 years since its release, there are still quests that don't work, the camera is still a bit wonky, and the character pathfinding gets a bit confused from time to time.Oh, and the ending is a bit sudden. :D			"

												I adore this style of gaming and the fantasy theme calls to something within me. So when the game on sale I quickly clicked 'buy' and began my quest as a Van Helsing. So, what did I think (and still do as I have by no means completed it)?I FREAKING LOVE this game! The theme and back-drop to the game is spot on as you wade through hordes of all varieties of mythical monstrosities.  Graphically, the game delivers well and is pleasing to the eye. The voice acting for Van Helsing and Katarina (DLC) is superb. Really well done! The banter between them adds depth to their characters and is a real treat to hear. The musical score/sound effects are brilliant too and again adds to the immersion.Character customisation is varied and gives much choice to the three classes to choose from. Each gives a different way of combating the horrors that await.Loot... oh the loot. Much is to be gathered and acquired as one would expect from a game such as this. The game is fun to play, even more so with friends (or my dad in my case) but beware, the game (for me) can get addictive. I always feel I need to keep playing just to get that next item that will boost my DPS or to see what new enemies are lurking around the corner.For all its pros there are unfortunately some cons. Certain shrines cannot be activated, instead once clicked causes your character to wander trying to find it even though it's right in front of them, denying you an XP/DMG boost. With the Arcane Mechanic class (which I play and love burning monsters with) when I click over an enemy to attack, he wonders off, not knowing where it is. A pathing issue with this and the shrines I'm thinking.The worst issue (for me) is no matter how long I play for, be it five minutes or five hours, upon exiting the game my PC shows a CPU temperature warning. My PC is not old and boasts some high-end hardware so I was quite surprised when the message popped up. Never before have I seen such a message other than playing Skyrim (with mods and graphical enhancements) for almost an entire day straight, which is justified. These issues I have are not enough for me to stop playing, but it would be nice if they were resolved.9/10			"

												I really love ARPGs and the way they play, that said I absolutely despise this game.I'm reccomending it because despite its major flaws it's still playable and has a great atmosphere, although you're very likely to get fed up with it and uninstall.I'll start this off by saying that all of its problems are caused by too many enemies at once, this game goes completely overboard in that department.Area of effect damage is a requirement, anything that does single target is next to useless here. The further you go into the game the larger the mob of enemies it constantly throws at you becomes, you can't even pick them off from a distance because chances are that the entire mob is going to react and come after you, and another thing to note is that your ranged attacks do not go over enemies which means all those high damage ranged enemies are safe behind the giant wall in your face. And on top of that some of them can heal other enemies, so you HAVE to kill them first.There is a perk that makes you atheral when your health runs out, you're going to find yourself getting a lot of useage out of that one. Along with that you're going to find yourself needing to heal constantly, so cooldown reduction is an absolute must so you can use heal often.I cannot even fathom playing the game class due the fact that there are enemies who drain your mana beyond faster than you can regenerate it even with mana potions, and this doesn't stop being a pain if with other classes, because all of your skills cost mana to use except your default skills.

												★★★★☆Ah, now this was a good game, the story progression is done really really well, the graphics are amazing! The levelling up system and companion all work well with each other. This is a really good game, only negative point I have to mention is that the other classes are DLC and even if you do not have the DLC for them items still drop for those classes -_- so in other words you can get a legendary weapon and be all excited about it and then you see it’s for a class you don’t even own -_- . Other than that awesome game, great side quests and choices that come back at you later on and a decent final boss, I was not expecting to be fighting a ***********-boss in the final battle in a Helsing game. 4/5!!! Good game! Buy now! Play now!!!			"

												Personal Rating: 7.5 of 10Hack and Slash RPG game. Gameplay and mechanics is identical to Diablo and it comes with decent graphics and soundtrack. The developer has come a long way to patch and fix the game since its release but it still has tonnes of bugs. However, developers are still pretty much active to resolve them. The only drawback of the game is that the maps are not randomly generated hence reducing the replayability greatly.			"

												Well what can I say about this game. It's fun, it's not that long thankfully because the game can get redundant pretty quickly, especially if you have Unlimited Spawn selected like I did the first time I tried and gave up. It was only after a couple of years I learnd about that option (didn't see it the first time in the options) so I went back to play it and I actually enjoyed it much better.This is what I would call a low impact game. For me, something to play to relax and not worry about multiplayer chaos like CS-GO. If you like Neverwinter Nights, it's something like the same style of gameplay. There is a lot to learn about the game but unfortunately I didn't encourage myself to learn the spells and tricks that the player can use in the game. I played straight up, in your face combat. The only thing that I found that was a bit out of character of Van Helsing is that you are not fighting many werewolves. There are not vampires and classic monsters that we all know and love, though the story is based on mechanical monsters aspect. The beginning of the game does give you that vampire hunter feeling, but it doesn't last long. Still, if you are looking for a game to pass the time, this would be good for you.As always, I recommend on buying it on a discount. $5 on a Winter sale I think I got it.			"

												Okey guys. If you like RPG's (Diablo, Neverwinternights, Torchlight, Dragon Age...etc) this game is jsut for you. It has cool story line full of different interesting quests and jokes. And jokes are really funny. + amazing sound + amazing details + cool upgrade system and, of course its gameplay. I did this game on nightmare(or whatever last lvl says), and i got tonn of pleasure. It wasn't so easy to make some quests,but that is all the point - hard game means emotional game. For example one achievement about killing Igor's (don't worry,not a  spoiler) worth a lot. You are trying to kill another ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s,while Igors try to kill you, that's unforgetable. Last time i was so happy after game'd ended - Dragon age 1-st (also nightmare). _______To summ up: buy it,feel it, listen to it. enjoy it			"

												A bit torn on reviewing this badly because while I played through the whole game and thought it was fun. It is an episodic A-rpg which I find really really lame. basically a good game if your just dipping your feet in action-rpg's but ultimately there are better choices in the genre. action-rpgs aren't games that you should complete then want to drop forever. If you want to play through the whole thing then your going to start shelling out tons of cash for something that should have been ONE complete game.overall, if your thinking about buying this. i would just do yourself a favor and pick up Grim Dawn or Torchlight 2 instead. even Diablo 3, which i don't like to support, would be a better choice.

												I struggled with my rating on this game. It's at once terrible and kind of addicting. The dialog straddles the line between downright bad and intentionally campy. It's tough to tell for sure whether they meant for it to be as bad as it was.As far as gameplay goes, it's a reasonable clone of Diablo mixed with some Torchlight. The lack of polish on the game was the deciding factor in giving it a Nay instead of Yay. Having the game simply end with no recognition that you've completed anything is tough to overlook. Add to that the MP crashing bugs and wonky key bindings and you have a take it/leave it game.			"

In my opinion this game is unplayable in coop, I think there has been enough tim for bugfixing since May 2013!For me and my friends it was a waste of money.I think I will deinstall the game before even having seen the end (which is against my normal gaming habit)			"

												IAVH is a fun, solid game with a few problems that keeps it from rising above a 8/10.The Good:Now with 3 character classes, you are no longer stuck with one guy that does everything half-♥♥♥♥♥. Classes are still rather plain being the melee, magic and ranged stereotypes. The skills the classes feature are mostly unique, with a small selection of them being repeats of skills other classes have.The perk system is fun and adds a unique feel to your character. Katarina the ghost WAS a ♥♥♥♥-poor addition. With all the patches and full dlc I feel she is actually worth putting into combat now. Having her tank damage and aggro for me has been rather effective, rather than before when she was dying in 5 hits while being built tanky. Loot drop rate is still really high, but the loot is much better and I find myself playing just to find the next drop. I've not used the glory system yet but it looks like a decent way to keep higher levels interested in their build.The Bad:Multiplayer community is tiny. You will rarely see more than 25 games during peak time, and as little as none during others. Rarely will the games be hosted in the US region. What this means is basically if you're in the US, you need friends to play this game with. Relying on random people from the internet is merely not enough. If you can get past the glaring lag, there's still many more issues that need to be addressed. As such, I can only recommend that if you pickup IAVH for the multiplayer, get your friends to do so as well, or don't get it at all. There are also technical problems with the graphical engine. Running IAVH on full settings produces BSOD extremely often. Although entirely capable of running the game maxed, I can't because of blue screens. Games released both before and after have no problem being maxed without technical problems. This is something that can be fixed, but there's no guarantee that it will be.Ultimately, I enjoy the game and I think you would too. If you must have multiplayer, but do not have any PC gaming buddies to play with, I'd pass over this one, random internet denizens will just not be enough.			"

												This game is a real bitter sweet one. It is both amazingly creative and the most lazy game ever.So lets play the sweet and bitter game. For everything good there is almost something equally bad about this game.This game has some REALLY cool monsters. If you have never seen Teslapunk before you are in for a fun suprise, however it is overshadowed by the excessive use of them and constant combat. I played on the middle difficulty and towards the end there are enemys that just take forever to put down, and they arnt even the ones that do good damage either so you end up kiting one enemy for almost a full minute even if you killed everything else.The Enviroments look amazing. Statues, monuments, temples and even the sewer level look very nice. However the plot makes it so you have to go back and do parts of the map over again to progress the story so you start to sigh as you do a level over again.The voice acting is very well done. The problem are the constant meme, references and pop culture get rather tiring cause you have heard them all before in something with a far better plot. Speaking of the plot the game starts out really interesting then kind of tapers off and then crashes and burns towards the end. I think the best way to describe this is the final boss.When you encounter him you have your confrontations something like this:""We finally have you! Why did you do all this?"" ""Why? Because I am evil! This is what I do. Your the good guy I am the bad guy."" Granted there are tons of 007 references and many other tropy things but that just sort of killed the illusion there had been a plot for me.Overall this game really has no replay value and I cant really say I would reccomend buying it because its just another Diablo style clone.

												The Complete Pack is not complete, they didn't include the Pre-order DLCs, instead they expect us to buy it directly from them.so that is already a big minus, because it can already be called as a fraud.Pro :- Graphics are good enough.- 360 controller are supported (for those that love to use gamepad)Con :- Can't easily switch between gamepad and K+M- Combat are not fluid enough- Poor Optimization.- The game somehow doesn't want to recognize the DLCs that i got from complete pack.- Story is crap- Complete pack is a fraud because not all DLCs are included.- Gameplay felt like a chore- Max Level is only 30, for an ARPG that is a big fail (i'm guessing they want to do Borderland style of level cap, but the game failed to take off).- There is still a lot of bugs (ex : i often had my lady katarina stuck a lot of time, and she can't seem to free herself).Conclusion :If you like chores, then this game is for you, otherwise stay away, but if you really dying to play an ARPG, then this game is decent enough.Overall i gave this game : 5.7 out of 10Reason : some of the cons can be fixed, if the dev willing to do it, but since it seems the Dev have started making the sequel,  chances are high that they are gonna abandon this game.@Dev : if you make a complete pack, include all DLCs, the ""Complete Pack"" = all DLCs included, and why not sell those preorder DLC in steam store too ? why hold it back ? this game is decent, but its nothing special.

What a Diablo clone needs is a good balance in loot drops, skills and enemies. Van Helsing has handled this pretty well. So it has nailed the most important part of the game. It also has an interesting steampunk/fantasy setting. But other than that, it doesn't really stand out much. People had a few complaints about this game. I'll address them here:BugsThe release was buggy, but with the December patch things are running more smoothly. I've tried both singleplayer and co-op and it works fine.Only 1 ClassThe game features only 1 class: the hunter. Very meager, but the DLCs adds 2 more interesting classes.

												Having finished Van Helsing in Heroic Hardcore with melee orientated setup, I can only say that it has been a worthy and enjoyable fill to my Diablo 2 addiction. The Blue Blood DLC helped a lot to clear up later levels which previously I found too hard (completed it by only reaching lvl28). Single playthrough took about 35 hours completing about 75% of achievements (could have been higher but gave up on achievements after aiming for the ""But they are so cute! one by not killing any Igors at all, until the very end when one died by accident having forgotten to switch Katarina to ethereal). Enjoyed the good graphics, very funny dialogue and a lot of action. My only disapointment was the let down felt once completed, with only a 30sec cinematic ending the game. TL;DR: I would highly recommend ""The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing"" to anyone that is a fan of Diablo 2 type of games or anyone looking for an action/ hack and slash rpg adventure. "

												(Do note I haven't played online) This game is great, plenty of loot, abilities, fun skills, controls and interface is solid, and game can be challenging at times. Before I go into what i didn't like and the final anwser i'll talk about all the positive things. They added variety to the game with the multiple classes and the extendtion for your companions skills, the areas look detailed and urges you to explore. You can build your character in multiple ways because of the way the skill tree is, so You have a melee section, ranged section, tricks and auras as you move further down the techtree it costs more to level the abilities which means you cant just get everything. You have to plan out what kind of character you want to make allowing you to be different from other players characters. This also adds to the replayability to try new combos.After you beat the game you can play 2 other modes that extend the lifespan of a single character, trying to make them the perfect hunter, by playing these gamemodes you get to find better loot and get points to further increase their stats. The max level is 30, I use to think this was bad but as I played it fit perfectly for the content available and with the glory point system in the other game modes you can still make them better.The puzzles and side quests are also a lot of fun since it keeps things interesting.The powerup abilities for your skills also adds depth to how you use your abilities.Now for some negetive points, once in awhile buildings got in my way from seeing what was happening (they wouldn't go transparent) though this was only in a few places it still should happen. Some of the enemy champions (elites) have unfair abilities, the wall is fine since you can shoot it, the drain is fine since you can run away from it, most of them are fine except for 2, grapple is annoying and unfair, it grabs you from so far away, cant be dodged (haven't seen it miss), it stuns you as it pulls you to them, they can all cast it sametime increasing the stun effect. It has gotten me killed on multiple accounts. the other is the skeleton hand that cages you, you have to attack the hand to break free however you cant move and it works the same way as the grapple, it doesn't miss (haven't seen it miss) but these are from my experience there might be a way.The lack of map variety, to what I see the maps are static, not randomized each time.The game has some strange difficulty spikes, one moment its simple and easy, next moment you are running spamming pots cause the mobs are no joke anymore but overall it doesn't happen often.If you accidently forget to complete a quest, the journal doesn't tell you which area the quest is for, so you have to do quite a bit of backtracking to find out which can be a pain.Loading screens, it's not that bad but it would be nice if it was faster, it intrupts the flow of the game.The music is good and the sound effects are pleasing. The graphics are great and the game runs very smooth. The variety of loot, enchanting, using essences, the dialogue, voice acting are all good. the game was lots of fun to play and got my monies worth.I give the game a 8.5/10 for being what its suppose to be, to offer some unique features and have a good pace. But for the lack of replayability because of repeating exactly what you did before and the loading screens with not that great backtracking method, no randomized maps and some inconsistency. It's worth buying and offers enough and some for what you pay for.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing played like any other hack and slash game on the market.  Really nothing new about it.  The game play and progression trees are both just fine.  The story was fairly interesting but again nothing really remarkable.  I enjoyed my first few hours of gameplay but became somewhat bored with the game and set it aside for awhile.  Recently I returned to the game in the hopes of finishing the story and being able to get a full impression of it.  Alas, it was not to be...This game quickly shows it's true colors if you visit the forums for the game.  Many of the quests are broken and need to be reset using console commands to complete them.  This is just lazy on the part of the Dev. team who created a sequel and couldn't be bothered to fix the first one.  You'll also find many people have had problems getting the game to even launch...anyway from my personal experience the game will no longer resume story when I click ""resume story"" just a wonderful crash to desktop.  After spending a few hours verifying the game cache on steam and even going as far as reinstalling the game and following all steps mentioned on the forums to fix the game.  I discovered that my save file was corrupted.  I can start a new character but at this point I'm far to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and dissapointed in the developer for not fixing all the bugs to the original game before making a sequel that will probably be just as bug ridden.Bottom Line__________________ AVOID THIS GAME.  There are numerous hack & slash games on the market that are far better so don't bother with this game it will just dissapoint and frustrate you.  It's quite unfortunate because I really wanted to like this game and was even planning on getting the sequel after finishing the first.  I doubt that will happen now.			"

												This is a very mediocre ""Diablo"" like game.  It borrows mechanics from many games and does them all poorly.  Leveling up isn't very interesting because all your skills ramp down so quickly.  For example, skill point 1 gets you +5% damage (meh).  Point 2 brings it to 7.5%, point 3 bring it to 8.5%, etc...  All skills work like this, so by the time you are level 20 or so, you have all the skills you want and leveling up just seems pointless.The combat isn't interesing either.  You can buff your powers by spending ""rage"" which you generate while fighting. Yet the same thing applies and the effects arn't worth the effort.  There are better games out there.   Titian Quest Gold,  Torchlight 1 and 2, and most certainly Diablo 3.			"

												I usaully dont reviews games, but this one caught my attention:1.Voice actng is average2. story is decant3. Gemplay elements are ok4. Side missions are creative, but broken5. Everything can one shoot you6. Some zones you cant leave you are forced to use town portal7. 60 potions will only last you for about a min8. The mobs have over 5 buffs and mini boses's have over 12... and that was all in the first area... later on they became so fast and area so narrow you cant even kite themDo i recommend this game; yes if you are bored and  got nothing better to dooh and if you think diablo 1 was hard, I recommend you trying this one out It will change your mind.I was playing on casual with a friend( who happened  to wrote his review right bellow me) and the scaling was on hard , and when we tried hard it was heroic... the expirence of hardcore is basicly right click delte save game file, because you will die on first incounter....if you are playing this for the sake of story save yourself time and patience and go watch a playtrough (if  anyone actualyl lasted for 70+h )DONT LISTEN TO THE GUY BELLOW ME  OR EVEN ME PLAY THIS GAME AND EXPEREINCE  THIS AMAZING ADVENTURE OF GLITCHINES!

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a Hack 'N' Slay RPG.You are Van Helsing, a monster hunter.On your site is a hot evil ghost called Katarina.You traveled into a region called Borgova.Something evil is happening there and you have to find out what it is.Your way leads you through cities, forests, caves and many more things just to find the person who is responsible for everything.The gameplay is nice. Its like other Hack 'N' Slays like Diablo or Torchlight but it has a dark steampunk touch.I really like the whole design of the game, beats Diablo and Torchlight in my opinion.There is an incredible amount of weapons and accessoires.The game has a typical level up system which gives you skillpoints everytime you level up.Some items are also only usable when having a certain level.Furthermore there are bonuses for finishing certain quests like killing 100 werewolves or whatever.You can choose some bonuses from time to time.Nearly everything is also supported by Katarina.The enemy varity is pretty much actually. There are several groups of enemies and those have always different levels.Masters are the most dangerous. There are also veterans and others.Also there are some bosses ingame.People in the world might give you quests from time to time, nothing special but gives you a lot of loot.Loot is the best about this game anyway. Its addicting collecting loot.The difficult is higher than usual I think, at least I died several times even with using healing mage and a lot of potions.I played on Normal. I personally skilled myself on far fight. Isnt easy though because the monster approach you very fast.The Graphics are good for a game of that sort, nothing special though.But I really liked the whole design especially of the forest.It will also run on older PCs.I also have to say that the music of the game is really nice.I read that there is a soundtrack avaiable, but only for the second game.Should include the music from the first game too, I read.The game also has some sort of Multiplayer, didnt looked into it until now though.It has Coop which is nice, I will probably try it sometime.I have to say that I didnt awaited a lot of this game but I really started to love it.Its addicting and has a interesting story and design.Definitely a good game for Hack 'N' Slay fans.I will probably buy the second game earlier or later.I will give the game 8/10 points.

Fast pace with huge groups of well animinated and imagiative monsters. Somewhat like Diablo 2 in it's loot system. Character building is deep and flexable though not every ability feels equally useful. The addition of a follower that can sell unneeded items for you and buy healing potions is nice without being new, though the flexbility offered by the ghostly companion is nice. Tower-defense like sections break things up nicely and don't overstay their welcome.			"

												Van Helsing is definately not a game without flaws, but for the most part they all seem to have counterpoints.  The lack of meaningful character customization is off-set by the tightly focused story-driven nature of the game.  The static maps kill replayability a bit, but also allow for better designed set pieces. The skill system is a shallow ocean- giving the illusion of depth but in order to be viable you really need to pick a set of a couple skills and pour all your points into them. I can't speak for the ranged tree as I primarily played melee, your choices are somewhat limited given the crazy mob density that this game throws at you- which, don't get me wrong, was definately a positive- but it means that you need abilities that will kill a lot of guys at once in order to keep from being overwhelmed or whittling guys down at a choke point one at a time for hours on end. Then, while you're doing that you realize you could just be Earthquaking all the guys in a row and be done 10 times quicker.In short, Van Helsing is worth the price of admission, especially if you can catch it on sale.  It's a fun, short romp that does what it advertises, just don't expect a Diablo/Torchlight/Path of Exile killer.			"

												An all around wondeful game.It has a dark steampunk kind of atmosphere, with a decent story and good replayability, especially since two new characters came out.I wholeheartedly recommend getting the complete pack as it's a great value.The gameplay is really good, the maps are big open wide environments, except some areas seem a bit too crowded and you risk getting overwhelmed easily.The tower defense mechanics don't seem forced on and are really fun to do.The only flaw for me is that you are restricted to 2 spells only(with a recent patch you can use the 4 bottom slots as well,but still having a nice hotbar would've been great!).Play this with a friend(or two) and you have a great game at a great price!

												You like Diablo? You want more? Then you'll probably enjoy this game too.Is the game better than Diablo (2-3)? No. It is good enough and a worthy Diablo clone? YesWhy is it good? What a Diablo clone needs is a good balance in loot drops, skills and enemies. Van Helsing has handled this pretty well. So it has nailed the most important part of the game. It also has an interesting steampunk/fantasy setting. But other than that, it doesn't really stand out much. People had a few complaints about this game. I'll address them here:BugsThe release was buggy, but with the December patch things are running more smoothly. I've tried both singleplayer and co-op and it works fine.Only 1 ClassThe game features only 1 class: the hunter. Very meager, but the DLCs adds 2 more interesting classes. Still not a lot, but it has enough differences; each class is unique in skills and style.			"

												This is a very mediocre ""Diablo"" like game.  It borrows mechanics from many games and does them all poorly.  Leveling up isn't very interesting because all your skills ramp down so quickly.  For example, skill point 1 gets you +5% damage (meh).  Point 2 brings it to 7.5%, point 3 bring it to 8.5%, etc...  All skills work like this, so by the time you are level 20 or so, you have all the skills you want and leveling up just seems pointless.The combat isn't interesing either.  You can buff your powers by spending ""rage"" which you generate while fighting. Yet the same thing applies and the effects arn't worth the effort.  There are better games out there.   Titian Quest Gold,  Torchlight 1 and 2, and most certainly Diablo 3.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a Hack 'N' Slay RPG.You are Van Helsing, a monster hunter.On your site is a hot evil ghost called Katarina.You traveled into a region called Borgova.Something evil is happening there and you have to find out what it is.Your way leads you through cities, forests, caves and many more things just to find the person who is responsible for everything.The gameplay is nice. Its like other Hack 'N' Slays like Diablo or Torchlight but it has a dark steampunk touch.I really like the whole design of the game, beats Diablo and Torchlight in my opinion.There is an incredible amount of weapons and accessoires.The game has a typical level up system which gives you skillpoints everytime you level up.Some items are also only usable when having a certain level.Furthermore there are bonuses for finishing certain quests like killing 100 werewolves or whatever.You can choose some bonuses from time to time.Nearly everything is also supported by Katarina.The enemy varity is pretty much actually. There are several groups of enemies and those have always different levels.Masters are the most dangerous. There are also veterans and others.Also there are some bosses ingame.People in the world might give you quests from time to time, nothing special but gives you a lot of loot.Loot is the best about this game anyway. Its addicting collecting loot.The difficult is higher than usual I think, at least I died several times even with using healing mage and a lot of potions.I played on Normal. I personally skilled myself on far fight. Isnt easy though because the monster approach you very fast.The Graphics are good for a game of that sort, nothing special though.But I really liked the whole design especially of the forest.It will also run on older PCs.I also have to say that the music of the game is really nice.I read that there is a soundtrack avaiable, but only for the second game.Should include the music from the first game too, I read.The game also has some sort of Multiplayer, didnt looked into it until now though.It has Coop which is nice, I will probably try it sometime.I have to say that I didnt awaited a lot of this game but I really started to love it.Its addicting and has a interesting story and design.Definitely a good game for Hack 'N' Slay fans.I will probably buy the second game earlier or later.I will give the game 8/10 points.

												The game is a moderately amusing Diablo-style single-player romp through a ruchly stylized world filled with entertaining characters.However, the amount and magnitude of bugs in the game renders it anywhere from frustrating to completely unplayable, and for every bug they fix, two more seem to take its place.

												By chance I bought this game from bundle, and say one thing. It was a brilliant buy, I have not played such a good RPG.The game itself has little to do with the film. Here also it comes to killing monsters, but it is much better.The main character is accompanied by a friend of the spirit. We can change it in the physical character, then she will help us in the fight.We can choose a lot of skills and a powerful arsenal of weapons and armors, which you can freely upgrade.The story is brilliant, and really addictive.The graphics are good, nice to look at the character models and environments.Great music perfectly captures the mood of the game.I recommend.

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing played like any other hack and slash game on the market.  Really nothing new about it.  The game play and progression trees are both just fine.  The story was fairly interesting but again nothing really remarkable.  I enjoyed my first few hours of gameplay but became somewhat bored with the game and set it aside for awhile.  Recently I returned to the game in the hopes of finishing the story and being able to get a full impression of it.  Alas, it was not to be...This game quickly shows it's true colors if you visit the forums for the game.  Many of the quests are broken and need to be reset using console commands to complete them.  This is just lazy on the part of the Dev. team who created a sequel and couldn't be bothered to fix the first one.  You'll also find many people have had problems getting the game to even launch...anyway from my personal experience the game will no longer resume story when I click ""resume story"" just a wonderful crash to desktop.  After spending a few hours verifying the game cache on steam and even going as far as reinstalling the game and following all steps mentioned on the forums to fix the game.  I discovered that my save file was corrupted.  I can start a new character but at this point I'm far to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and dissapointed in the developer for not fixing all the bugs to the original game before making a sequel that will probably be just as bug ridden.Bottom Line__________________ AVOID THIS GAME.  There are numerous hack & slash games on the market that are far better so don't bother with this game it will just dissapoint and frustrate you.  It's quite unfortunate because I really wanted to like this game and was even planning on getting the sequel after finishing the first.  I doubt that will happen now.			"

												The game is fun, but not that much of a challenge in normal mode. I topped the Max level of 30 before I reached the end scene. There is a ""crafting"" system letting you upgrade weapons and armours with powerful attributes.The environments (maps) are beautiful but not seamless. You use portals to enter/exit each map.I kept my weapons and armour updated and maxed out my primary weapon skills as early as possible and played it through in 20 hours. The campaign wasn't that much of a challenge and the supposed anti climax when defeating the last boss was more like ""what, was this all?""However, after playing the full campaign, a new mode is unlocked that gives more hardcore gaming.Overall, it gave me 20 hours of game play and after the campaign, you get bigger challenges.

I really do hope this gets the patchwork it needs to be a good game, otherwise just another game to put into the bleh bin.			"

												Let me start by saying I haven't beaten this game yet, but at level 26, I'm far enough in to give a review. I'm going to list pros and cons and then expand upon them down below. I'm not really going to touch upon the story all that much.Pros:Story is alright (nothing special, but it's better than most of what you'll find these days)Nice level designGame provides a challenge (both a pro and a con, see below)Katarina is a pretty cool character Varied enemiesCons:Framerate tanks to below 30 in some areas if you can believe thatAI partner is uselessGame provides a challenge (both a pro and a con, see below)Very lame skilltree as a mageVoice acting is pretty lame (Van Helsing isn't too bad, Katarina is hit or miss and the rest of the NPC's are pretty bad)Combat is boringTo start off, you play as Van Helsing's son (yea, THE Van Helsing). Something is wrong in this city that your father cleared out years ago and you must save the day. You are accompanied by Katarina, a ghost who is bound to serve your family. She is your partner in combat and can either be a melee or ranged specialist. She also levels up and has her own skill tree.This game does a few things right. Level design is something you will notice upon loading up a new area. The areas you prod around in are generally large and look pretty good. So far I've been through a small village, forested areas, a mine, a sewer, secret laboratories, The Ink (kind of a take on The Fade from Dragon Age) and a big city. Each location has impressed me thus far. Also a plus is Katarina herself. Trudging around the game by yourself would get pretty boring. Her presence, combined with the banter she has with Van Helsing is decent enough to where the game doesn't feel so grindy. Also a plus are the various types of enemies with different abilities. The game groups up different enemies constantly, and some of the battles can be very tough.Unfortunately, for every thing this game does right, there's two things it does wrong. Firstly, the game tanks to below 30 FPS in certain areas. This is on a 4770k with 2x 7870 Myst Editions. It's happened in two areas so far. It's not in one little spot on the map, either. The framerate keeps tanking throughout the whole area. If I leave the area, I start getting great frames again. As soon as I go back in, it tanks again. I guess those areas were just very poorly optimized. Next, combat is weak at best. I am playing as a mage, and combat doesn't feel good at all. None of the spells you can unlock feel good/forceful, and some of them require you to keep clicking your mouse button to charge up a spell, draw a line on the screen for a wall of fire, etc. This wouldn't be such a problem if you weren't fighting 20+ enemies at a time, and if your AI partner was competent. Katarina is utterly useless. I thought setting her up as a melee specialist would let her tank damage and draw enemy aggro as I hit them from range with my spells. Not quite. Enemies run right by her as if she's not even there and book it straight at me. This leads to every battle turning into a StraCraft-esque kite-fest, which gets old, fast. To make matters worse, you cannot command Katarina to attack a target. You can setup behaviors for her where she'll attack your target, the weakest target, the most vulnerable target, or the target that is attacking you (which is all of them), but you can't click on a target for her to attack. This means you have to aggro the enemies yourself. Not a problem if you're playing a sword-wielding badass, but as a mage it's terrible.As I mentioned the game provides a challenge. Some of that is due to good enemy design, but most of it is artificial. Katarina being terrible and enemies running straight for you are the two biggest culprits of that artificial difficulty. Also contributing to this are some of the enemy groups you will run into. For instance, there is a part in a laboratory where you run into 6-7 Champion versions (the enemies have different tiers, Champion being the toughest) of this one enemy that has the ability to raise undead, trap you temporarily, form a temporary barrier, lay down an AOE poison spell, and an AOE spell that just drains your health as soon as you step into it. The fight went something like this. Step into area, trigger aggro on the 6-7 enemies, they cast raise undead to the 50+ rat-like corpses on the ground, use barrier so I can't go anywhere, use trap to hold me in place, cast poison or the other AOE spell on me while the rat things beat on me and I'm dead in seconds. I died 10+ times in that one place, due solely to how cheap the enemies were. This type of nonsense happens every now and again.When it comes down to it, I can't recommend this game. If only the combat matched the pretty visuals...			"

												TL:DR : go play Diablo, Sacred, Marvel heroes, Titan Quest or PoE instead...Like others bad HnS games, they try too hard to be like Diablo, but different than Diablo, which generally means that they fail at both. Van Helsing makes no exception. It feels like a bad gimmick made by people who don't understand the basic gameplay features of an HnS game :- stupid ""skill power up"" system that makes you feel like you're using the two same skills over and over.- incredibly bad balancing. I tried to continue my first game ( normal mode ) near the end of the story after not playing for months and just got killed again and again by a pack of werewolves, just outside the exit of the lair... Thought I wasn't used to the game anymore so I started a new character in casual, and the mobs are either a pice of cake and don't do any damage, or they are ultra resistants and kill me and Katarina in seconds...- fighting mechanics suck. It's either hold down the click until everyone is dead, or move, attack, move, attack, move, attack ad nauseam to avoid damage.- loot suck. Why is there blue and gold items if they are always worst than white ? Also most of the time I find items several levels over me and I can't use them, so they just clutter my inventory or I sell them, and then I'm undergeared.- we can find loot for DLC classes that we don't even have bought...- inventory is ridiculously small for a game with so much loot ( fortunately you can send Katarina to sell stuff, but having to fill her inventory every 5 min and then wait for her return is boring ).- the town portal brings you back to the city but you can't go back to where you came from... what's the point ? Those guys don't even know what a town portal is made for...- armor design is bland and barely noticeable anyway.- NOT ENOUGH RAGE ! ( due to the stupid ""auto power up"" option... who the hell got this idea ? )- the game randomly changes my resolution when I start.- Vsync either doesn't work or is deactivated after alt-tabbing.- the character gets stuck in invisible walls, and can't move when there are too many mobs on the screen. Thanksfully we can move with WASD, but even that sometimes doesn't help.- Katarina is completely useless even as a tank with all points in body/melee.- 99% of the mobs attack in close combat, so you get ganked if you play melee, and if you play ranged once Kat is out of combat...- the game made my PC totally freeze, had to hard reboot.- SPOILER : the final boss is lame and you don't even kill him, he just flees... all this for nothing.- and then you unlock the ""neverending"" mode, where mobs are big HP bags, you get one shot several times in a row by mobs that pull you toward them and stun you, you kinda don't get much XP and there is no reason to suffer through the whole game a second time anyway. Loot is still crap by the way.On the positive side :- the character moves fast enough- graphics and music are nice ( characters are ugly though )- lots of mobs- eastern Europe folklore- i like Katarina's sassy dialogue and the duo works well, even if Van Helsing doesn't have much personality for a hero... would be totally bland without Kat.

												After finishing Torchlight 2 I wanted to play something that looks alike. Finally, I got this game at sale with some friends of mine. At first sight everything seemed to be great: lots of skills and branches, very helpful assistant Catherine that can also level-up and has different builds. The first negative impression came on the first location after the town. My friend couldn’t load. After several changes of lobby leader and re-launching the game, the problem was solved. Ok, sh*t happens, nevermind. After a few hours one of  the characters reached 12 lvl and 99% and then stopped gaining any experience. After re-launching the game its level was 12 and 50%. Okaaay, let’s go forward. We all were 13 lvl, killed a boss on the quest location and…a miracle! Two characters stayed lvl 13 and the third one became lvl 5! He got 21 skill point and was unable to put on any clothes above his 5th lvl. This time re-launching didn’t help us at all, so after this I’ve lost any wish to continue playing this “fascinating” masterpiece. We’ll see what developers got at The incredible adventures of Van Helsing Final Cut.			"

You can play on casual and still get onehits throughout the game, but most of the time you just hold RMB and wait til it's over.It's an okay-ish game in its price range that would have needed some polishing. It looks mostly budget or dated, but still takes a lot more performance than what you get for in return. Could have been more.			"

												After finishing Torchlight 2 I wanted to play something that looks alike. Finally, I got this game at sale with some friends of mine. At first sight everything seemed to be great: lots of skills and branches, very helpful assistant Catherine that can also level-up and has different builds. The first negative impression came on the first location after the town. My friend couldn’t load. After several changes of lobby leader and re-launching the game, the problem was solved. Ok, sh*t happens, nevermind. After a few hours one of  the characters reached 12 lvl and 99% and then stopped gaining any experience. After re-launching the game its level was 12 and 50%. Okaaay, let’s go forward. We all were 13 lvl, killed a boss on the quest location and…a miracle! Two characters stayed lvl 13 and the third one became lvl 5! He got 21 skill point and was unable to put on any clothes above his 5th lvl. This time re-launching didn’t help us at all, so after this I’ve lost any wish to continue playing this “fascinating” masterpiece. We’ll see what developers got at The incredible adventures of Van Helsing Final Cut.			"

												I'd like to say in advance, I LOVE Steampunk games, I LOVE Hack 'n Slash, but most of all, I LOVE Van Helsing. This game is, in many ways, a fantastic one. The behavioral settings on Lady Katarina are interesting and helpful, the loot system is ok, the music and environment are great, and the voice acting is one of the best in Indie gaming history. The Drawback, however, is in the actual ""Hack 'n Slash"" part. This games Combat is HORRIBLE. and the reasons are that, one, you hold still and sit there everytime you attack which is annoying for ranged players and downright punishing for melee players. The other problem with combat is the fact that the game attacks your targets for you, meaning I, a ranged player, cannot chose which guy I'm gunna shoot at. Instead the game is gunna make me shoot the wolf instead of the wolf handler, or the boss. So I don't get to chose my targets which hurt melee players even more, because, unless they are lucky, can't Dps the highest damage monster and are forced to sit there and take hits from all the guys while they are stuck hit that Fricking wolf that deals no damage whatsoever. So those are the problems with combat. Other problems include the lack of tutorial on how the inventory and level ups and as well as specail attacks work. It wasn't a glaring problem since I am a Dark Souls player and don't need my hand held, but it took me a frustrating 10 Mins to figure out how to equip better gear. My final qualm is this. Why do I need to set what percentage of health Katarina needs to be at before she is allowed to drink a health potion? Just... why? At first I didn't know what it was so I set it to the max and then gave Katarina some health potions. We get into a fight and she downed all five health potions like they were tick-tacks. She then was complaining about her lack of Health potions and i replied ""Sweetheart, you drank those last five health potions at the speed of light. I'm not gunna give you anymore."" So that sums up why a am not going to recommend this game. As much is I like it and had fun, the glaringly painful combat ruined what could have been a really great tribute to Steampunk Hack 'n Slashes.			"

												Van Helsing gets a couple of things right: the atmosphere is great, the graphics look pretty good and remind me of Diablo 2. Having a companion who is always cracking jokes, usually at your expense is also entertaining, I thought the voice acting was done quite well.As an ARPG though, this game is a disapointment. The main campain is rather short, you can easily finish it in 10 hours. Unlike other ARPG's, there is no grinding for better items or skills since there are no areas where enemies respawn and you will have visited almost every part of every area once you finish the game the first time. There is no reason to revisit it since there is no new game+ either.The one aspect of the game that really interested me was the tower defense element. Unfortunately this is also a disappointment as it does not fit into the story well and seems more tacked on, not only that but there are only two short tower defense parts in the whole game and no way to do any optional missions at all.Multiplayer doesn't work well, I've read many reports of people experiencing bugs and I also had a couple of problems when I tried it, quests getting stuck and similar problems. Another problem is that when a person in your party starts a bug you are forced to join after 5 seconds, even if you are in a dialogue with an NPC.			"

												If you really enjoyed Diablo or those type of games, it's worth checking this game out. The developers obviously cared about their finished product.If you're on the fence or you do not enjoy those games, do not try this. The first half of the game is pretty enjoyable, but after a while you either get so specialized and good with your skills that you are ripping stuff apart or it just feels downright repetitive, although that may just be a hallmark of this type of game's combat system.It's about 15 hours long, give or take a few hours depending on how quickly you move through it and how thorough you are. I played the entire game single player, so perhaps multiplayer is a completely different experience. If you plan on playing this alone though, unless you're really in love with this type of game, do not purchase it.			"

												okay here is the deal. Van helsing is proberly the worst of the diablo games that are out atm. The late game is very broken since mobs do huge amount of dmg and you can only use range weapens for that reason. The last few hours of this already short game, is a grind where nothing new really happends and where you just go around kiting all the time. My advice? Go buy Torchlight 2 or even Diablo 3 Reaper of souls, they are both much better and have many times more play time in them. (Btw your companion Katarina... she is really just more of a totem most of the game since she dies so quickly to anything past the 2nd act.Dont buy it, there are so many better dungeon crawlers out there.

												To preface this, I won this on steamgifts.com.It took me about 16 hours to play through the entire game, I found it to be a decent ARPG. The story was very blah, simple. It had a ton of action though, and plenty of different ways I could have built my character. I decided to take a brawn approach with my character (side note... I have been doing that a lot recently... my most recent Skyrim character has been brute force kinda guy and my couple newest DnD characters have been Barbarians). This maybe where I struggled a bit, as I tried to max/min the character to a bit but still tried to get as many achievements as I could. This could have definitely tainted my experience with the game.Overall, I think the game controlled great, never cheated me or anything of that nature, and definitely had a fluid nature. I absolutely adored the fact that I could send my ghost back to town and she would just sell all my crap loot without the need to stop play. I think that is something more ARPGs could handle better, is the amount of loot you attain. But with that being said, I never had that ah ha moment where I just felt like a badass that could slay anything in my path or that I really accomplished anything in general. That with its perceived that it had a shallow system of progression melee or range with a few different types of kickers with the perk system. That's why I would give it a 3/5 stars, but if you are looking for some loot grabbing, enemy smashing, you could go much worse than Van Helsing here. "

												SNAPSHOTAn uninspired Diablo clone that does more wrong than it does right. I wish I had more to say here.OVERALL - 4.5 / 10PROS+ art is actually pretty goodCONS- extremely clunky movement / combat- ability point buy / upgrade system is extremely boring and lackluster- story and dialogue are cringe-worthy- lots of loading- $4 DLC single talent treesDETAILSWhile I really wanted to like this game, overall it just falls flat in all regards. From the beginning, Van Helsing has been fraught with bugs and a lack of anything going right. To start, multiplayer was completely inaccessible for the first 6-7 months after release, and many quests were bugged such that they could not be completed. Releasing an extremely buggy game: strike #1.Supposedly a lot of bugs have been fixed in the past 6 months, but this game was purchased specifically to play multiplayer at release and months went by with other (seemingly less important) bugs being fixed, and multiplayer is still not one of them. I have seen multiple instances of it being marked ""fixed"" in patch notes, only to find it is still as buggy as ever. Even without multiplayer, there are still a LOT of bugs that are easily found that stick out like sore thumbs. On top of this fact, DLC was apparently being worked on for the game starting after it was released, using vital manpower that should have been used to fix bugs to instead leave people that bought the game out in the cold. Focusing on future profits instead of fixing buggy products for current customers: strike #2.Turns out that all of the DLC (at this writing) just adds single talent trees to Van Helsing or the companion, Katarina, for a ""measly"" price of $4. Not only that, but items in the game drop that require the DLC, WITHOUT HAVING PURCHASED THE DLC. Thinking your customers are chumps with bags of money lying around: strike #3.Ranting aside, I can get past my personal issues with the motives of developers if the game is good, but I have to rack my brain for a while to just think of something nice to say. For a Diablo clone, it has about 1/10th of the content and customization of other games: there are no classes to choose from, the default talent trees (all 2 of them, one is a melee tree, the other is a ranged tree) are not viable to split putting points into unless you're playing on Easy difficulty, and each talent tree only has 8 abilities, of which you'll actually only use 3 or 4. There is no real diversity in any of the trees, either, especially since most of the abilities and upgrades are just terrible. The overall impression is that someone put way too much time and effort into making sure no single ability was powerful, even with upgrades, causing the entire combat experience to be extremely diluded. Given that Diablo clones are all about fun combat mechanics and getting loot, that should be enough to stay far away from this game. If that's your thing, though, feel free to keep reading.The gameplay of fighting enemies is in itself a chore: any ability that has any real power to it has a long cooldown, meaning that you'll spend most of your time using a basic attack that has no real flair to it. Combine that with the fact that Van Helsing's movements cause him to spend way too much time standing still when actually fighting and you have a game reminiscent of the time when ATARI made consoles and not just games. What's worse is that the clunkiness could potentially be overlooked if the abilities the player used actually looked good when fighting, but for the most part combat VFX are almost non-existent. Player abilities don’t really stand out from the rest of the world, and are so short lived that the player might wonder if they cast an ability at all. There are very few noticeable VFX from enemies, as well, and if they didn't actually have physical attack animations then I wouldn't even be sure they were attacking. A lot of times the player just seems to take damage when enemies are around, but because you fight almost everything in the game you just know to expect it.Although gameplay isn't everything, Van Helsing doesn't have much more to stand on. The dialogue between Van Helsing and his companion Katarina are terribly hokey and feels forced at all points. The art in the game is actually pretty good, but for the most part it’s all just static environments and doesn’t really engage the player at all, making it loses a lot of the potential it had at really being a “wow” moment. Because of this, some of the environments are actually very distracting and can be annoying to try and find things in, especially if there are quest-related objectives. Sound is never really my thing in games, and Van Helsing does nothing to change that. It is mostly just… there, although the constant dialogue / noises from friends and foes alike detract from whatever potential it had.I think that covers everything, hopefully it gives people a good look at what this game is actually all about. I, for one, will hopefully not be making the same mistake twice with this company, the lackluster game and their focus on money over content has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth.			"

												A standard top down RPG with some things different here and there.From what I've played of it, the normal difficulty is more like ""very hard"" and the easy is more like ""here, take this fancy loot and one shot these bad guys"".And thats just within the first hour of gameplay (between the two respective difficulty levels).  I don't mind a challenge.  On most games I go out of my way to pick the harder difficulty so that I don't fly through them.  But with this game, I've no choice.  The standard difficulty is so damn hard that I find it unplayable (and yes, unplayable within the first 30 mins!).People have had a lot of good to say about this game, so I won't judge just yet.  But the difficulty settings so far have me yearning for something in between a normal setting that rips you appart for not playing like a pro, and an easy difficulty that treats you as a fool.So far from what I've gathered, I'd rather spend my time playing Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2.

Achievement hunters will take varying amounts of time depending on what difficulty they choose at the start and whether or not they select hardcore mode, but should be aware that several achievements involve a great deal of grinding.  I took around 30 hours to get all of the achievements besides those related to hardcore mode and difficulty and those involving the greatest amount of grinding.SCORE:5 out of 10I happened to start playing this after an update that broke a few aspects of the game.  It took too long for the developers to address these issues and, even when they did, some remained.  For example, the Thaumaturge's blizzard skill is supposed to do a certain amount of damage in a small visible area on the screen, but instead causes massive (fatal) damage to all enemies within 2 screens of the player.  This can easily be abused to make every area and boss a joke.  I also found myself unable to complete a main quest because of a bug that prevents a quest item spawn, yet the only fix available is to actually type a command into the game.  The game has been out since May 2013 and the developers have gone on to make Van Helsing II, Van Helsing III, and a spin-off of the tower defense element of the game.  At this point, there is no excuse for persistent bugs and lazy fixes.Still, if these bugs were my only problem with the game, I would recommend it.  The trouble is that it's not particularly fun.  Gameplay consists of running from one mob of enemies to the next, using the same two or three skills again and again.  The game does feature a unique mechanic called Fury, which is gained by attacking enemies and spent to give skills unique buffs if the player has spent skill points on those buffs.  For example:  if the player uses skill points to unlock the flamethrower skill and additional skill points to unlock one of its 3-5 buffs, flamethrower might do 50% more damage or cause persistent fire damage to enemies if the buff is invoked.  However, the buff is also spent upon activation, meaning fury must be used to ready it again for any subsequent attack.  I found the system rather awkward to use because of all of the key presses involved, but others might enjoy it, so I list it neither as a pro nor a con.  In any case, it didn't change the nature or feel of the gameplay for me.The three unique bosses (one for the end of each act) offer something different, but only because the player has to first run around activating towers, completing a tower defense section, or destroying spawners first to have a good chance of killing them.  The developers apparently thought that the tower defense section of the second act was good enough to turn into a stand-alone game (Death Trap), but to me it seemed to drag on for too long.  It is like Orcs Must Die! (one of my favorite games) in the sense that the player places traps on tiles and is free to assist his traps in killing enemies, who can also target him.  However, the player must gather materials to place traps and also has a limit on how many can be placed.  The trap variety is decent, at least for what amounts to a mini-game, but in the interest of achievement hunting, I followed others' advice and used just one kind of trap:  the werewolf cage.  Perhaps the experience would have been more enjoyable if I had been more adventurous, but I doubt it.  The length of this section and the constant micromanagement with the player character, which I enjoyed in Orcs Must Die! but disliked here, just sapped any fun out of it.  And then I had to do it again for another quest.The story is arguably the biggest disappointment, as it merely amounts to a hunt for a one-dimensional villain who is out to hurt people.  There is no depth, minimal world-building, and no incentive to play apart from an interest in getting better weapons and putting points into skills, neither of which conveyed much of a sense of progression.  The player only gets enough points to max out a handful of skills, most of which both look and feel unimpressive, and the weapons all handle about the same way, with minimal boosts to damage as the player progresses.The cooperative aspect of the game was the biggest draw for me since I have a wife who occasionally likes to play.  Our first problem was getting the game to work:  even though her computer surpasses the minimum requirements and mine surpasses the recommended, we both got stuck on an endless initial loading screen.  Eventually I got it working, but it wasn't long before the next problem.  When we reached the second large map (Gallowsbog), the game lagged too much even on the lowest settings for her to be able to do anything at all.  I was forced to play the rest of the game on my own, without company to distract me from the game's other failures.After finishing the game, I had little interest in buying the next in the series.  After reading some of the reviews and glitch reports for both sequels, I lost what little interest I had left.For the tedious gameplay, poor optimization, unimpressive skills, and bugs that remain unfixed to this day, I give this game a 5 out of 10.

I actually had a group of baddies that mobbed me and I kept respawning in the same spot so it was more of an annoyance than anything to respawn 100 times whilst I wasted wave after wave of baddies. Loot drops are nearly useless, I think every 150-200 drops I got something that might be useful on another character type.

If the game wasn't so riddled with bugs it would be a fun enough, controller driven, Diablo light.A decent game that is severely marred by bugs, and one of the worst inventory management schemes I think I've ever had to use.If you like ARPGs, you may still enjoy this game if you can get it cheap enough.  Being able to play an ARPG on the PC with a controller is the big draw to this game, at least for me.Be warned, there are some potentially game stopping bugs in the critical path.  There do seem to be various work arounds for many of these, but it's a bit of a crap shoot.			"

												Good for hours of playtime, but not much else.  The storyline is forgettable, the voice-acting is okay, and the visuals are pretty decent for this style of game.  However, you will die multiple times even on normal, due to the fact that most enemies will simply swarm your character.  Even after lowering the graphics settings, my computer would lag to the point where it simply wouldn't register button presses, hence my character wouldn't use a crucial potion and died.  And died.  After beating the campaign you have the option to complete scenarios (aka, recycled levels from the game) to level up or start a new game with the same character.  I tried the latter and made it a short way into the story before giving up, as the difficulty is much greater on the new game plus.			"

												If you are someone who plays games on a MAC, do not even bother buying this game. It should not be advertised as a MAC compatible game! Neocore has known about the problems concerning this game for years yet they refuse to fix them. The game looks terrible and is prone to frequent crashing. When changing the settings it is near impossible to see the change. The game will constantly be pixelated regardless of how you change the settings. Along with the blurry images which can be dealt with, the text size is so tiny that it is required for the player to either squint to make out what is being said or turn down the resolution, and even then the situation is barely improved.If you are looking for a new game to play on MAC, you are better off buying diablo, which is ported at a much better quality. The lack of support and seeming care of the development team is obvious. This game is not worth the money and time. I really wanted to enjoy this game but the blantent lack of care has lead me to have a distaste for this game. Van Helsing 2 also suffers from this lack of support, adopting all the problems from this game.Save your money.Don't buy this game.			"

												It's not as deep as Path of Exile, Diablo, or Titan Quest. The essence modification of gear can be interesting, but the builds mainly revolve around using two abilities. Thus, there's not really a lot of interesting decisions to be made. You basically just up your numbers and if you're on a harder difficulty, hope you can come up with a good build. All Hack and Slash ARPGs are pretty repetitive, but the good ones mask it well. Van Helsing masks it well for a while but not long enough.That said, Katarina is awesome. The interactions between her and Van Helsing kept me playing past the game's natural lifespan.			"

												Surprisingly motivating, considering it's just a hack&shoot. Maybe it's the actual existence of a somewhat interesting story, maybe the tons of achievements.The character customization is interesting, too, though.You can choose whether to have respawning mobs or not for single player story.There are weapons that grow more powerful with use and stuff is sharable between your chars.There is some interesting variety in gameplay to shake up the relatively dull hack&shoot a bit.I play it on easy and it's still enjoyable.I got the game in a bundle though, not because I deliberately wanted to have it. Since Valve doesn't allow neutral reviews and I'm focusing on a certain downside that might be of interest to some people, I'll give this a negative one. (Really can't decide.)The amount of loot that drops in this game borders on trolling. There's too damn much loot, and the stats compare is a pain, not only because you have to do it for two characters, but because it's confusing and unreliable. A lot of the gametime tends to be about sorting out items.I think I'm only managing to keep playing it because of the achievements.(The game has a demo, so the rest you can derive from that.)- Terrain scrolling is far from being smooth. Considering the visual quality and my system, it's a bit sad. Fog even causes extreme framerate drops. This engine seems unoptimized.- Fakenook, Twitter and Youtube links on the main screen, hurting immersion. This is about as annoying as Youtubers saying ""like, comment, favorite and subscribe"" all the time.- And now the big issue right at the beginning:Rarely does a game bombard a personal firewall as much as this. It tries to connect to api.parse.com and amazonaws.com and oftentimes every half a second to mail.neocoregames.com (even after startup - it basically bombards your firewall permanently) and if you don't allow this stuff, then the game will freeze for several minutes before you even see the main menu.This is with a set block rule, mind you. And turning off my network is not an option since it's a Steam game. Unless you are willing to not care about the motivational factor of achievements. (Not sure whether they register in offline mode though. The game does have its own achievement UI.)First time it didn't switch to the resolution I selected, and since it can't switch it in-game, I had to wait yet another couple of minutes. I thought that would fix the ugly text, but it seems the game uses a web font without hinting, so even in native resolution text in the menus still looked ugly.Oh and if I alt-tab out of the game while it pauses with futile connection attempts, it might default to 640x480, requiring me to launch it yet again.And don't say ""Just let it connect."". I pay attention to what the software on my PC tries to do, since it's necessary these days.Most games with internet connectivity get the message and don't spam firewall logs like that and stop doing anything. Especially since I already have set a block rule.(Another game that has this kind of issue (even worse) is Super Meat Boy, although there the problem might have resolved itself somehow.)P.S.: The game is a real space waster. Its videos (intro, cutscene, outro) are present in ten different languages, and the difference is really just the audio track and the subtitles. Extremely clumsy way to do that. 149 MB English videos and 912 MB other-language versions. They could have used that space to provide lossless sounds instead of OGG for example.And the map files are present as separate huge versions for low, medium and high detail. Model files too. And both sometimes are of exactly the same size. (Otherwise it would probably be necessary data.)Then again, since this game has all files separately, if you need the space and only play on high detail, you can delete 6.42 GB of terrain data alone. This plus the video thing taken care of and the game has now 11.8 GB instead of 19.1 GB.			"

												Tried this on my Macbook. Latest drivers, latest OS, latest patch (Feb 14 2014.) The character configuration screen is illegible and unusable, missing images and with text and mouseovers all over the place.That alone wouldn't make me sad; I like supporting indy developers and understand there may be some debugging involved. But then I tried to join their forums to report the problem, and the enrollment didn't work. When I eventually mailed them (with screenshots, diagnostics, etc.) I got one answer telling me to update my drivers, and then they went dark. Not cool.I guess I'll be reclaiming some much-needed hard drive space.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing looks like a great game. I was very excited to try this, and when it came up in the recent holiday sale, I nabbed it. Before buying, I verified that the game supports Mac and controllers. These top down games are some of my favorites, and I prefer the game controller to mouse and keyboard for them. Unfortunately, it seems that Mac is supported and controller is supported, but the two together are not supported. So I have not been able to play. I gave them almost four months to patch this issue, but, while other updates have been coming out, no fix for controllers on Macs has been seen. I won't buy another NeoCore game. I find their practices deceptive.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, I really did. Positive:-Small development team, who made a playable (not really enjoyable) game.

There's also no loading indicator until 10 seconds prior to the next area loads up. So you're stuck looking at a boring map for 1-2 minutes, wondering if the game crashed.-This games default settings are ridiculous and slow down the game (newsflash the majority of PC gamers don't have crossfire video cards). -I found a few work arounds to speed up the load times to about 35-45 seconds but even then this game felt poorly optimized.-I have a pretty decent rig that can still play Far Cry 3, Skyrim, and Deus EX on high, with my frame rate rarely dropping below 35-45 fps. So why the hell can this game barely stutter by at 5 fps?? I haven't seen a game stutter and drop the framerate this much since my '07 gateway when I played WoW.-Oddly enough, I did find the frame rate to improve if I turned certain specs up not down (seriously).-The enviroments are generic, the same old muddy sewers/forest/foggy forest/cave, you've seen a million times in generic RPGs.-This game takes little to no strategy, I rarely died. When I did die, it was usually do to the screen stuttering and having my character jump across  the scene do to lag or a screen freeze.-The character models are pretty dull, you fight the same spiders/rats/zombies from every RPG. Although they do have some cool looking revolutionary robot soldiers and Van Helsing himself looks alright, even if he is a walking cliché. -Also for some reason the audio cuts in and out.-Gameplay is weird, they try to be so different from Diablo/Torchlight, that they remap certain keys and get rid of others altogether. All I wanted was another hack'n'slash diabloesque RPG, yet this game tries to reinvent the wheel and ends up making a square tire.Bottomline: This game is only worth picking up if it's part of some Humble Bundle or under $2. The forgettable story, boring graphics, frame rate issues, and loading screens will have you uninstalling this monster in less time then it takes to watch a trailer for that lame Van Helsing movie starring Wolverine. 1/5			"

The ghost companion Katarina is also nice, she's basically the equivalent to torchlights pets, just with more talking.			"

												The Incredible Adventures берет другим — подачей и оформлением. Охотник за нечистью очень приятно и литературно выражается, идеально сохраняя образ; его подруга каждые 15 минут выдает остроты; окружающие персонажи продуманы и прописаны настолько, чтобы каждая из отведенных им фраз звучала свежо и интересно. В этом смысле игру хочется сравнить, наверное, с Magicka — все не настолько абсурдно, но настолько же талантливо.Отличные диалоги накладываются на постоянное обновление места действия — каждые пару часов стиль игры радикально преображается. Просторные полянки сменяются многоуровневыми улочками, классические злые вороны вытесняются изощренными франкенштейнами, а сопровождается это обновлением цветовой гаммы и музыкальной темы. Саундтрек вообще хочется выделить отдельно — очень уж он приятен для малобюджетного проекта.			"

												Actually i wasn't expecting much from this game. I learned about it existence only four days ago. Read some preview and wasn't impressed. But i've learened to never trust someones opinion before trying something myself.Probably because i didn't expect much i really like the game now. I was surprised with the price on it. The game seemed like a solid project and they aren't usually cost as much :D I like visual style of the game. I'm pretty tired of ""childish"" colors in other games. Probably i'm not creating an uber build, but i like the fact that the game always keeps me focused otherwise it'll take only a few seconds to die. And one thing i like the most about the game is the story. I have no idea how it was intended to be told, but sometimes i just can't stop laughing. And that's i guess the main thing among many more that pushes me to go ahead, I can't wait for Van Helsing and Katarina to start talking with each other or someone else again. So far i gained from Van Helsing more fun that from Titan Quest, D3 and TL2 all together. I can't remember a single sentence said by anyone in those games, but i'm sure some phrases from Van Helsing will stay with me forever.			"

It's amazing that I overlooked this game for so long.Gameplay is a little repetitive, but in a good way.

												This game is a one of mixed perceptions. Just by browsing through the reviews, you can probably guess that your take on this game will depend very much on your luck of the draw in terms of specs, since this game isn't THAT well optimized and certainly not bug-free.On my first playthrough of the game, I ran into a game-breaking bug where I went into the boss area of the second major area of the game of the first act, but then after the brief dialogue I spawned outside of the lightning barriers that locked in the boss area with no way of opening them. Loading it up on a new system and making a new profile resolved the issue after many months of taking a break from the game, but by the accounts of everyone else on here, there are plenty of other places for this game to potentially crash, break, or otherwise ♥♥♥♥ with you. So its a bit of a gamble on you actually being able to run this stably.If you can get around that, its basically a Diablo clone with some nice graphics, a monster-hunter fantasy story, and some solid gameplay that anyone familiar with the genre will probably enjoy.The story and overall writing is most parody and humorous throughout the whole game. So don't be expecting MUCH seriousness, but I also wouldn't say that its a complete comedy or satire. The banter between Van Helsing Jr. and Katarina is the high point of the game's writing for me. My biggest problem being that the game basically hints at all kinds of other interesting or fun adventures they went on prior to the game's time that I would have liked to have played in this one, but that's a minor greviance.Gameplay is meh. You're going to be kiting A LOT in this game, especially when dealing with swarms of enemies that love to melee you and do massive damage (which with the expection of certain ranged units is I'd say the majority of the enemies in this game), but the enemies don't respawn and dying doesn't matter THAT much in this game since you can buy immediate respawns with your gold that IMO you're not going to be spending on much else anyway. I recommend it, with provisions that in buying it you're taking a chance on it working as intended so I wouldn't buy it for that much.			"

												A quality aRPG that is sure to have gone under the radar of many. A unique story with a follower that levels alongside you, and many of the modern streamlining conveniences similar to Torchlight 2 that have their own added intricacies. Having only one class with others behind DLC is a bit bothersome, but the standard class is versatile on its own and the campaign is a good length. Postgame goes beyond the standard new game+ and adds especially hard challenge missions to the mix.  Overall, a must for the aRPG fan.			"

												Extremely repetitive where most times you will be running / kiting monsters as you try to whittle them down so instead of 50 monsters swarming you - die a few times so there may be only 30 when you go back in.I found very few equipment upgrades last part of the game - mostly just vendor trash - even the set pieces / yellow.End of game  you have 2 options - scenario or endless - which they expect the player to put countless hours into grinding for some form of ""purple"" bonus' that take forever to move so you may get a few pieces of good equipment to stand a remote chance in the scenarios or endless.

												BIG WARNING! I hate to write this review. The game itself looks great. The atmosphere and especially the ghost girl Katrina and her antics are soo cute. But what put me off and ask Steam for a refund within 30 minutes of gameplay is severe fps drops and comstant lag in single player mode itself.I am playing on ASUS ROG machine which runs almost any game at high/ultra settings but this 'normal' ARPG is causing pain in the butt. Obviously, the game isn't optimized at all with respect to performance. Even the graphics, its bit strange they look absoultely great when it comes to details but there is something missing feeling. It might have to do with washed out look and fuzzyness. Many times i have to wide open my eyes to read a text or see an item clearly. You won't be surprised to loose focus on your character when he is surronded by hoards of enemies. The shades are so washed out that everthing gets mixedup quite often.If you think the game suits you, buy it by all means and be prepared to ask for a refund incase your pc also has the same problems running this.

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing may seem imitative from several aspects, but it does bring entertainment to the table for this genre. The Blue Blood, Thaumaturge and Arcane Mechanic DLCs, bring more set of skills, tricks and auras to the game, including more quests in the campaign, and these come with only a $10 price tag. In comparison to the lights of the Diablo series, this game may dim a little, but it provides a solid experience especially considering it is an indie title. For its staggering visuals and wittiness, fans of this genre or Van Helsing will not want to miss playing The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.  Full Review[www.noobfeed.com].			"

												Would be a great hack'n'slash Diablo-clone game with witty banter and storyline if only it weren't for the frustratingly constant CTDs that lose your progress each time they occur.  Forums show many others having the same problem, and turning off Steam Saves did help significantly reducing the CTDs from every single time you made an area transition to once every 3 or 4 times, but that's still far too many CTDs that prevent you from enjoying an otherwise fun game. There were many other bugs that are unfixed in the game as well, but most of those have workarounds to resolve them in the Community Forums. I had decided to try to finish this game before buying the sequel, but never could finish because of the frequent CTDs, which honestly will keep me from buying the sequel. Truly sad because it was rather growing on me despite all the other bugs.			"

This game type is so much more fun with the use of my controller which i never thought it could be and having a ghost friend to come along on your adventures make's things so much easier to deal with the more frustraiting parts about the genre.

												If I had to pick an ""underrated game of 2013"" this is it. Beautiful animations, a compelling setting, an interesting AI companion, and an adequate story already set this game apart from its competitors in the ARPG market - and that's to say nothing of character development and the combat mechanics system. A lot of criticisms of this game target the lack of build diversity, since the vanilla version only has one character ""class"" with two build paths, melee and ranged. However, these concerns are ameliorated by the DLC classes, a mage and a trap-setting ranged fighter, which are worth getting if you like the base game. I love the setting, which is somewhere between Mary Shelley / Bram Stoker Gothic and Stephen Hunt steampunk. Katarina, the ghost companion of the player, is well-written and feels useful in combat (but not TOO useful, so van Helsing still feels like the star.)Combat is simple enough to be accessible, but complex enough to reward careful character building. 4 primary stats - essentially Melee, Ranged, Magic, and Critical - govern around 10 secondary stats, all of which are easy to understand. The skill tree is fairly simple but has enough depth that the same class could be built effectively in a few different ways. There is a neat mechanic about managing a resource called Rage, used to enhance attacks with sub-skills called Powerups; so far these seem interesting, but not necessary to play the game if you don't want to worry about them.I got this game on sale for $7, and at that price it's a no-brainer. At the full price ($15 + $5 DLC) it's still worthwhile, but there are better titles on Steam at that price point if you're not an action-RPG fan. In comparison to Torchlight 2, it is a bit less accessible to genre newcomers, but with a more interesting setting and a darker, more visceral tone. TOTAL 8.5/10+ Art style and setting+ Animations and voice acting+ Combat system (Power-ups/rage, balance of skills, diversity of skills and gear)+ Endgame play modes (Scenario and Neverending Story allow players to continue after finishing the game)- Feels limited by production cost (Short story, only a few monster models and terrain palettes)- Some technical problems (occasional, minor bugs that do not crash the game, but get irritating)			"

												Good game to play through once, with the blue blood pack to make the ghost useful in combat;  It's certainly worth the 15$.Just be aware that there's no replayability; No new game +, no starting the campaign again with the char that you finished the game with.There is the abilty to load up in a harder mode that basically lets you go through a few of the more annoying areas again, with higher level enemies; not really fun or entertaining to do that though.There is multiplayer, but it adds very little; Maybe you want to go through the campaign with your friend?

												I don't know why that's so much hate on this game. It's a good game but sadly it's extremely underrated. While games like Call of Duty gets the most attention and it's the same ♥♥♥♥ every year. The game is like your typical ARPG games just like Diablo or Torchlight. So if you like games like Diablo or any other ARPG games, then maybe you'll like this (or not). Plus the graphics are awesome, give it a try.			"

												Would be a great hack'n'slash Diablo-clone game with witty banter and storyline if only it weren't for the frustratingly constant CTDs that lose your progress each time they occur.  Forums show many others having the same problem, and turning off Steam Saves did help significantly reducing the CTDs from every single time you made an area transition to once every 3 or 4 times, but that's still far too many CTDs that prevent you from enjoying an otherwise fun game. There were many other bugs that are unfixed in the game as well, but most of those have workarounds to resolve them in the Community Forums. I had decided to try to finish this game before buying the sequel, but never could finish because of the frequent CTDs, which honestly will keep me from buying the sequel. Truly sad because it was rather growing on me despite all the other bugs.			"

												This is a good diabloesque game with interesting mechanics and nice, but not spectacular graphics. It plays well, the combat is satisfying, but... I'm still disappointed. This could have been a cool, dark, gloomy, scary game, but instead, it's pulled down by insipid, childish, failed attempts at being funny. It breaks the mood and the immersion. It isn't funny enough to be a humorous game and it's too frivolous to be a serious game, so it just sits awkwardly in the middle sucking at both. Maybe I've just been spoiled by much better humor from games like Bastion, Borderlands 1 & 2, Saints Row the Third, and others who got it right. But I still have to give it a positive score on technical merits.			"

												This game is amazing. On the scale of bad-ok-good-great-diablo 2 it's near Diablo 2. It has an interesting steampunk setting, where magic is at war with science and most monsters from mythology make their way in to be shot, burned, blown up or carved. You can dual wield pistols and one handed weapons, there are two handed swords and rifles, magic and gadgets (from the dlc, two new clases.). The game looks very nice given that it isn't an AAA produciton and the voice acting and interactions of the two mains, Van Helsing and his ghost lady Katarina is very pleasant. The game has a bit of short commings in some combat situations and is a bit low on places to go and quests to do, but it's an indie title, so that is kind of expected. For it's price it delivers a lot. I strongly recommend it to people who like hack and slash RPGs a la Diablo 2.			"

												Surprisingly good game. It's got a lot of Diablo/Titan Quest kind of vibe but they take away a lot of annoying stuff and streamline it quite well. You're instantly given a permanent pet, and the ability to do both melee and ranged attacks. Meaning that you're basically every class at once. From there you just choose to specialize, better pets, better melee, better ranged, more magical, more physical. Depending on how you specialize is how the game unfolds. It also has a sense of humor which I find refreshing and the voice acting is pretty decent. The plot is a bit weak but the gameplay, graphics and action is fun and impressive. All in all I was caught by surprise by this game and I do like it quite a bit. Fills that niche that Diablo III didn't quite fill.			"

The Incredible Adventures of Van HelsingRating: 7 / 10Fun Action-RPG in a nice and detailed steam-punk world. Maps are a bit big and pre-filled which makes the pace a bit slow as you cannot 'run' though these levels. Lots of interesting loot, lots of upgrade options for skills and abilities. Halfway an interesting twist as you have to defend and expand your hideout in a tower-defence like way. Shops could be better and the gameplay is a bit too linear for my taste. Still a big thumbs up for giving me a great time. (Not finished yet)			"

												I got this game for myself and a friend while it was on sale, and we've gotten some fun times out of it. My expectations were pretty low going in; I didn't really think that this game would be as much fun as it is. The writing and voice acting is pretty good, and I love the banter between your ghostly compainion, Lady Katarina, and Van Helsing. From a gameplay perspective, everything seems to be well thought out and well balanced, but there are certain aspects (like the combo system) that I didn't really understand for a while (probably because I disabled the tutorial). One of my favorite things about the game is just how hard it can be sometimes. There are certain enemies that can kill you in just a few hits, so it becomes really important to use potions all the time (but don't worry... they drop off of anything and everything so you will have trouble running out).One of the side-quests (to kill the hunter-machines) seems to be bugged for me, and I am not sure if all my skills are working the way they should (the upgrade to one of the skills should heal me each hit, but I can't really tell if it is working), but overall I love this game and think it's absolutely fantastic. The metascore clocks in at 72/100, which seems about right from a critical perspective, but the question I always ask myself is: Do I have fun playing this game, and how much fun am I having? The answer for The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing: Yes, this game is a blast and I am choosing to play it over the other games in my 181-game library on a nightly basis. Higly recommended for playing with friends (I haven't played solo).			"

												Van Helsing is a good indie aRPG. I say indie, because if this had been released from a well known publisher it would have been treated as garbage and been on every 80% off sale it could find. Why do I say that? Well first let me just say that I wholly recommend this game! It's very fun and engaging. It presents a decent reward system. The graphics and sounds go along well with the pace of the action. So why call it garbage? I didn't, I said it would have been treated as garbage had it been released from a big company. Van Helsing has bugs... Game breaking bugs wherein you can not complete main/storyline quests. Multiplayer bugs where games will just crash randomly or lag for no apparent reason or even spawn you into places where you are not supposed to reach thereby making you have to quit and return to the game. No tutorial for advanced features. Want to know how to upgrade (socket) items? So do I, go look for a youtube video, because this game honestly never tells you. The sounds, while going along well are somewhat repetative or campy. Also, the graphics, while they look well, enemies have a tendency to blend into the scene making it hard to know if you've killed everyone. It sports a strange control scheme and has no option to evade combat. If you're ranged and you get swarmed you can't run away because clicking in any direction means you're going to auto-attack. Also, if you have a controller plugged in, the game will not allow you to use a mouse and keyboard. You must exit, disconnect the controller, and restart the game.Wooo... That was a long list of dislikes! I'm sorry, but I want you to know what you're getting into if you decide to purchase this title. Van Helsing has issues, BUT the game is fun! There is good dialogue and a story that makes sense. How many aRPG's have a story... and that makes sense!? The action is paced very well and never gets boring. There are quite a few quests to complete and I never had an issue figuring out where to go to complete them. Even though there are bugs the development team is working hard to correct them. Yes there are some instances where quests can't be completed, but until that's fixed, they've released a patch where you can bring up a console and complete the quest you're stuck on. The DLC classes provide more options. I like the Thaumaturge class. I'm very squishy, but I can take down the largest of monsters with ease. So here's my final recommendation: If you like aRPG's and are looking for something to fill the gap between releases from big companies then I say grab this title. You will not be dissapointed. If aRPG's are not in your cup of tea, this game will not change your mind. If you are on the fence, just look over my comments about the bads and the goods. If you can live with the bads I think you'll find a lot of fun to be had here!			"

												Its quite a good game overall. Fairly fun ""diablo clone"" but lacks to much diversity because there are only two classes (with the DLC). But specializing between melee/ranged gives varying play styles and even those can be broken down more due to more spell/physical damage style you can do. I'm only in act 2, but I've seen enough to say I am enjoying the level design and music a lot. Certainly 8/10 and  if more classes were to be added or more skills in general it could easily be 8+For 15 dollar,s you'll get your moneys worth, at least.			"

												This action RPG is way better than Diablo 3!  The addition of a ghost sidekick really helps the gameplay as it allows the character to switch from melee to a ranged style without too much fear of being swarmed by enemies.  Moreover, the graphics and audio are a cut above the rest.  The writing is excellent with plenty of hilarity and biting, sarcastic commentary on modern-day gaming.  If you get this, DEFINITELY get the DLC as the thaumaturge (mage) class is sooooooo much fun to play with!!!!			"

												If I had to pick an ""underrated game of 2013"" this is it. Beautiful animations, a compelling setting, an interesting AI companion, and an adequate story already set this game apart from its competitors in the ARPG market - and that's to say nothing of character development and the combat mechanics system. A lot of criticisms of this game target the lack of build diversity, since the vanilla version only has one character ""class"" with two build paths, melee and ranged. However, these concerns are ameliorated by the DLC classes, a mage and a trap-setting ranged fighter, which are worth getting if you like the base game. I love the setting, which is somewhere between Mary Shelley / Bram Stoker Gothic and Stephen Hunt steampunk. Katarina, the ghost companion of the player, is well-written and feels useful in combat (but not TOO useful, so van Helsing still feels like the star.)Combat is simple enough to be accessible, but complex enough to reward careful character building. 4 primary stats - essentially Melee, Ranged, Magic, and Critical - govern around 10 secondary stats, all of which are easy to understand. The skill tree is fairly simple but has enough depth that the same class could be built effectively in a few different ways. There is a neat mechanic about managing a resource called Rage, used to enhance attacks with sub-skills called Powerups; so far these seem interesting, but not necessary to play the game if you don't want to worry about them.I got this game on sale for $7, and at that price it's a no-brainer. At the full price ($15 + $5 DLC) it's still worthwhile, but there are better titles on Steam at that price point if you're not an action-RPG fan. In comparison to Torchlight 2, it is a bit less accessible to genre newcomers, but with a more interesting setting and a darker, more visceral tone. TOTAL 8.5/10+ Art style and setting+ Animations and voice acting+ Combat system (Power-ups/rage, balance of skills, diversity of skills and gear)+ Endgame play modes (Scenario and Neverending Story allow players to continue after finishing the game)- Feels limited by production cost (Short story, only a few monster models and terrain palettes)- Some technical problems (occasional, minor bugs that do not crash the game, but get irritating)			"

												Would be a great hack'n'slash Diablo-clone game with witty banter and storyline if only it weren't for the frustratingly constant CTDs that lose your progress each time they occur.  Forums show many others having the same problem, and turning off Steam Saves did help significantly reducing the CTDs from every single time you made an area transition to once every 3 or 4 times, but that's still far too many CTDs that prevent you from enjoying an otherwise fun game. There were many other bugs that are unfixed in the game as well, but most of those have workarounds to resolve them in the Community Forums. I had decided to try to finish this game before buying the sequel, but never could finish because of the frequent CTDs, which honestly will keep me from buying the sequel. Truly sad because it was rather growing on me despite all the other bugs.			"

												A quality aRPG that is sure to have gone under the radar of many. A unique story with a follower that levels alongside you, and many of the modern streamlining conveniences similar to Torchlight 2 that have their own added intricacies. Having only one class with others behind DLC is a bit bothersome, but the standard class is versatile on its own and the campaign is a good length. Postgame goes beyond the standard new game+ and adds especially hard challenge missions to the mix.  Overall, a must for the aRPG fan.			"

												The experience of playing The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing (TIOAVH), is like Diablo II but not as fun as Diablo II; as I continue to expand on my review, you will hear the ""like Diablo II but"" comparison quite often, with that in mind, let's get rolling.The Story campaign spilts into 3 chapters in TIOAVH, though in terms of map variation and sizes it only counts as two and a half since many areas are just a small pocket map and one map got used twice with different mobs. Like Diabo II, you'll fight a defining boss like mob at the end of each chapter which will then transition you to the next act, but not only is the campaign much shorter, the combat is much less fulfilling. In Diablo II, you play as the nameless hero conquering the demons, the fact that you remain nameless is what allows the player to fill in the void with their own imagination and make the experience their own; in TIOAVH, the main character is a decendant of Van Helsing, attempting to rid the town of Borgovia of a mad scientist. The player is just a Van Helsing Jr trying to make his own. Even though the story of TIOAVH has no fatal flaw, personally, Diablo II's story is much better.Class wise, TIOAVH only have 1 (3 with expansion) character to choose from, unlike the 5 (7 with expansion) character available in Diabo II. On top of that, the additional two character, arguably, has very similar style, elemental long range attack, so personally, I'd consider them the same addition but with a slight variation. Point Diablo II.Map wise TIOAVH doesn't have a lot to offer, in fact, most of the ink map are just mix and mash of the regular map, and one map you even visited twice; Diabo II on the otherhand offers a complete change of scenary, from grass field to desert to a swamp. Point Diablo II.AI/combat wise, TIOAVH suffers a blow back. Mob will either try to shoot you or rush you until they drop, which often result in the tactic commonly know as the ""run you ♥♥♥ off, till the enemy dies"", which could get faily repetitive fairly fast. Diablo on the other hand have enemy which fleeing, and even at one point, friendly NPC. Point Diablo II.To sum it up, if you're haven't play Diablo II, and you're interested in these type of action RPG, then you should definitely skip and give Diablo II a shot; if however, you're addicted to action RPG game and can't find any other action RPG out there, then suppose TIOVAH could tie you over until your next fix.

												The game is game is fun for the first 4 or so hours, with interesting enemies, nice visual effects and some witty voice acting from Katarina to go along side it all. The game seems very enjoyable at first but quickly deteriorates, the enemies become just tedious and you'll end up just trying to run past them to get to your objective. I played as the mage (or whatever name class is) and found that I could simply spam spells to enemy waves without any danger of dying. This simply takes away the intensity from the first few hours and creates a dull experience overall. The game does has some pleasing music, decent boss fights and the graphics aren't half bad. For me the journey stopped when nothing seemed to interest me/pose a real threat. I thought this was going to be a good dungeon crawler type game, unfortunately it wasn't for me and I hope they make a great sequel to correct these issues. 6.5/10			"

												Pros: 1) Interesting story, but it leaves you with the story unfinished, makeing you to buy the second game to see how the story develops.Personal oppinion: it's like diablo 1. You finish the game, but are not satisfied with what you did there...2) Good music.3) Easy to finish the game, here and there it's a little bit hard, but the entire game is quite easy. Cons: 1) Few good spells, imo. I haven't bought the DLCs, perhaps they added something cool there.2) Money is a big problem in this game, from my perspective. Because i could not make my ultimate gear withought farming like a noob.3) Useless legendaryis, from my perspective. You get some legendarys that help you to a certain level, but when you go NG+ the same legendary drops but with the same stats in you first game.			"

												This is a very fun ARPG. The play mechanics are excellent, the maps are huge, the quests are fun, and, for a lower budget game, the voice acting is quite nice. There are two DLCs thus far and for those who have the game, the dev has offered a unique item and an aura as a thank you. Diablo, Torchlight, Grim Dawn, and other ARPG players will feel right at home with this game. There is a LOT of loot, a nice skill tree for your main character plus your ghost companion - she is a blast BTW with her snide and condescending remarks to Van Helsing. But, unlike the annoying companion in Legend: Hand of God, THIS companion is also a potentially gruesome, merciless killing machine. The DLC offers more replayability, but, even without it, you can play through the game again and specialize in different kinds of attacks - the same goes for your companion.This game LOVES to swarm you and enemies will attack in all directions - it's absolutely glorious and at times, loot drops can be almost as crazy as Torchlight II.I hope that Neocore will consider making a sequel. The game would easily compete with the best triple A ARPGs out there. A random map function would really round the game out. Props to the devs who have been VERY responsive and have kept this jewel up to date. I am an ARPG fanatic and The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is one of the most fun I am still playing.			"

												This action rpg game is the Diablo 2 fix that you've been missing.  Werewolves, zombies, vampires, oh boy!  Fun maps and easy to complete in 20-30 hours, if you like to take your time, like me.Can't recommend this highly enough, and am really looking forward to the developers continuing on with Van Helsing 2!

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is an average Action-RPG that is clearly outshone by other games in the genre. There are fair sized skill and talent trees that are hindered by limited hotkeys and level requirements. These trees allow for a multitude of ways to spend skill points and while it would imply replayability to neutralise the fact that there are only three classes, builds are far too restricted by the lack of available skill points and level restrictions. The three available classes are not very flexible in playstyle apart from the Hunter, but even that only has the choice to switch between melee and ranged. The combat has a focus on area-of-effect skills as the game can easily swarm you with monsters at ambiguous and undefined spawn points that can even be on top of you without warning. Loot drops occur too often and has uninteresting basic stat upgrades which taints the experience of obtaining new and better equipment. The plot is uninteresting and written poorly, the voice acting is subpar as they do not portray their characters' intent appropriately. The environments, despite varied, are cliche and does not compensate for the lack of world building that the plot, characters and ambience do not provide. Cooperative play is available but seems tacked on and is the same experience as the singleplayer, but with added players and monster difficulty.			"

												I picked this up as part of a Humble Bundle and had a couple of false starts at getting into it, primarily due to my lack of familiarity with the character set-up possibilities. I am very glad I had another crack as this is good fun. The mechanics are fairly standard but have plenty of customisation options (although there is the occasional problem with not being able to move when surrounded - best avoided by not allowing yourself to get surrounded!) but it's the very nicely rendered and varied environments and tongue-in-cheek humour that make the game. It's clearly been developed by people that love the genre (both of the game and its source material) and there is a lot of detail applied to enhance the gamer's experience. There are loads of easter eggs, jokes and achievements as well (some very much more obscure than others). Definitely worth a go if you enjoy horror B-movies and/or hacking/blowing up hordes of baddies.			"

												I used to be just like you... a poor soul who didn't recognize how AWESOME the INCREDIBLE Adventures of Van Helsing truly is. Now I know. And I hope one day you can too.This game is a pretty classic realtime RPG, complete with a box inventory section. It's got four levels of difficulty, complete with a permadeath option. I made the mistake of enabling permadeath my first game around, and sent the world into an everlasting oblivion. There are different classes for different playstyles, and items that, frustratingly, can only be used by a particular class. The sense of humor built into this game is priceless.Can money buy happiness? Now it can.			"

												A LOT better than I originally thought it would be. When it was first released I was not at all interested, it looked cheap, generic, dull and just another fan fiction game with no substance. Damn, was I wrong. The base version only comes with one playable class(?) but with the DLC you can then choose from two more, the Thaumaturge which is basically your mage and the Arcane Mechanic wich is an engineer with cool gadgets. Very different from most birds eye view RPG's I've played, different gearing and gemming mechanics and styles but it does not lack what only some can offer: a fun, changing, new, challenging, mass killing, awesome adventure. The skill system works the same as most other games like this would, as you level up (killing monsteres, completeing quests, etc.) you gain skill poins, later on though you gain more per level but in turn your higher level abilities require more and one skill point (1, 2 and some 3). You have your main ability skills, (mostly activated and damaging abilities, some passive) Your Tricks ability page (special abilities that change or enhance game play [Thaumaturge can slow time for every thing around him, Arcane Mechanic can summon turrets, and other fun abilities]). And last are your Aura skills, you can have 2 auras on at a time that increase mana regen, critical damage boost, elemental damage increase, etc. The game play, design, UI lay out and the game mechanics are very user friendly. One thing that most games lack is undoing skill point allocation. In this game you can remove points from skills one point at a time (for a fee, of course) so you don't totally throw you build out the window, you can instead make samll tweaks to it, which I love. You can do the same for you Ability points: Body(STR equiv) Dexterity(AGI euiv) Willpower (INT equiv) and Luck (magic item find, crit chance, dodge change modifier). Your follower, Katarina, is a sassy spectre that helps out in battle but also adds a sense of humor to a seemingly bleak dark world. She has her own seperate Skillys and Abilities and you can change how she attacks and behave (Melee, Ranged, Passive while adding boosts to you). You can have her pick up items, and gold if you want, send her to town to do your shopping and she will back talk you the entire time. Different and weird at first, but she is a valuable asset to your goal of evil eradication. There's a lot to say about this game, but you will just have to play it for your self to experience the fun and actually quite enjoyable graphics. There are some zones that feel laggy and I did have to tweak my video settings for it to be a little less glitchy at times (Running with two GTX 670 vid cards, i7 3.4Ghz, 16Gb RAM, 1 TB HD with a 240Gb SSD) my computer is more than capable of running any game at max graphics setting but I still experienced lag at times. Like any game, there are glitches and bugs that can some times even progression imparing, check the forums, the game has a built in repair function if a quest stops working or something similar, nothing major but it can be frustrating at times.My over all verdict 8/10. Worth buying? Yes. Better with friends? Yes. I'ts a fun game and I have thoroughly enjoyed playing it.			"

												It's like a Diablo clone, but without proper Blizzard's polish.Quests are quite monotonous and all the same, doing all the side quests is dead boring. Storyline is hard to follow, you just run and slay hordes of enemies for almost no reason.And resource consumption is totally unoptimized. I've been playing every other game on medium or high settings without any problem and lag, but this game not only runs slow on low-medium settings but makes my monoblock PC trumpet like a plane taking off.

												I have to say I really enjoyed my first play  through of this little gem of an ARPG. Honestly my only gripe was the somewhat forced linear progression of some areas and a lack of mob respawning mechanics or procedurally generated side quests dungeons to create a deeper more replayable experience for even a single character. This combined with a fairly short playthrough time left me feeling honestly abit annoyed considering Torchlight 2 when onsale as it so frequently goes and its huge workshop mod community makes it such a modern titant among ARPGs that should be considered by others developing in the genre.The fact you have to pay for various classes as DLC vs again TR2s active modder community and free classes to explore need to be kept in mind by would be rivals. Still I honestly didnt mind grabbing the DLC for this game as it did show enough potential I wanted to try and show all the support I could.The vibes this game gives off are honestly the best of the ARPGs Ive seen for a while. The voice acting, banter from your ghostly lady companion, the story over all has a fun factor I have to admit captured my steam punkish goth nature very solidly.To me the real hidden treasure is the eventual base you get to set up and the handful of defense events you get to enjoy. IMO these needed to be more frequent or something, the system though alot of fun to watch the creatures die in the traps  and think it would of been great to see there be a way to have endless invasion options at the end to add to extending the life of a given play through.Over all if you enjoy the various related genres, the ARPG genre, and enjoy a shorter playthrough game to see the end I totally encourage this game for a easy dif with hardcore on one and done play approach for each class currently out.

												What's with all them people recommending abysmal, amateur games lately? Stop feeding me this pig grub and making me spend money on trash titles that only waste my time.Van Helsing is basically a shovelware title made only to generate income for the least possible costs possible. It's your standard, soulless, mediocre-but-annoyingly-bad-at-the-end hack'n'slash. Everything in this game screams with lack of creativity, the lack of any ultimate point of this title being even made besides ""people will buy anything at steam sales"" logic.Yeah, let's take an interesting theme and turn it into another uninspired shovelware. I fiddled around a little with characters, progressed a little into the story but the fundamentals of the gameplay, controls and the balance (that ranged class was a total afterthought, it's so underpowered and limited compared to the hunter) turned out to be terribly implemented and got me ultimately bored on hard difficulty. There's literally nothing of interest in this game, everything was done before and better. But the worst part is that killing enemies is fiddly (targeting is a chore, especially with the ranged character) and absolutely unrewarding, which means it's unsatysfying. Even putting down boss enemies turns into running in circles taking that HP bloat down for some crappy loot worse than anything you get from a vendor. Oh, yeah, how about tying difficulty level with number of enemies? That can't go wrong, can it? Yeah, it can and it did, because the only thing it changes is forcing the player into doing more circles kiting enemies until they all go down. How about ♥♥♥♥ voice actors on the top of that? Apparently some people liked them generic characters with terrible va - and terrible dialogue lines in this game are being described as ""humorous"". What? Straightforward terrible references and unfunny lines are ""humorous"" now? Seriously?Hard to see a good h'n's lately. Just get Torchlight 2 which is better in everything from Van Helsing. Even if it has arguably worse esthetics.			"

												If you've played Torchlight 2, you'll know what to expect.  The common root is Diablo, but The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing *is* Torchlight 2, to the extent that it feels like a rather underdone mod rather than a game in its own right.That's fine, of course - inbreeding and cheeky rip-offs have always been rampant in the games industry.  It doesn't matter if a game resembles another, what matters is what it brings to the table.  Van Helsing comes up very short, sadly, and the best that can be said about it is that it'll remind you of better games from time to time.Functionally it has everything you'd want from a game of this type, although it is a little buggy and nowhere near as configurable as it should be, but it feels like the work of people who got their game engine roughly working without any passion for the game they'd make with it.   It kind of pulls the right moves, but nothing really clicks.  Enemies are never exciting challenges, they're just pests who are either overpowered or underpowered, and combat is a constant annoyance.  A *constant* annoyance, as it never lets up - outside of safe town areas, fresh waves of enemies will always flood at you, which means that attempting to navigate the unnecessarily fussy character sheets, or even your inventory, will often result in death.You will die often, but it'll rarely be the result of something you have or haven't done.  Sometimes it will be down to the nice but confusing art style that makes your character impossible to find on the screen, but generally it's down to this game having absolutely nothing to do at any turn other than a weak sigh and 'eh, throw more enemies in there?'It's porridge floating in bathwater.  It's a game designed by people who don't understand games.  It's like eating a roll of wallpaper.  It is - and I don't say this lightly - perhaps the most tedious game I've ever played.  I go back to the Spectrum era, so I've seen some stinkers.  There's nothing here for anyone other than boredom. "

												Pretty much the same thing everyone else has been saying. The game has terrible mechanics, bad skills and customization, monsters don't level along with you so they're WAY too hard and OHKO you. It's a grind-fest with bad voice acting and honestly just terrible. If you like any other ARPG like Diablo, Torchlight, PoE, anything else... this game is NOTHING like it. I wanted to enjoy it but I just couldn't. My recommendation? Go get Victor Vran. It's everything this game should have been.			"

												Would have loved to play this game but despite my machine exceeding the listed OSX requirements, it would not play. I tried several methods others had reported working to get it to load (including renaming a file) but to no avail. I did not disable SIP as I do not feel a game is worth disabling system security protections so if you feel otherwise maybe you have other options that would work. Until the devs get it working for OSX, it should be removed as an OSX game. I can't recommend it specifically because it does not play for users who meet listed requirements.			"

												I grew up on a diet of late night monster movies and bad scifi flicks and if there's one thing I retained from those days, it's the knowledge that Van Helsing is the most bad ♥♥♥ monster hunter there is.  Well...some of the Van Helsing's are.  You see, in history, there's like 912 different Van Helsing's out there.   I think they're all related too, but I'm not 100% on that.  Some are kick ♥♥♥, some are not.  The Van Helsing in this game though is clsoer to the kick ♥♥♥ end of the scale. Even though I'm 40, I stil dream of being a monster slayer when I grow up.  It's probably never going to happen though, so having a monster slayer simulator is pretty nice.  This Van Helsing game pits you against large waves of monsters and let's you feel like Peter Cushing in a Hammer flick as you go to town with your dual swords, blood flying left and right and monsters falling like chumps.  (Two swords are always cooler than one sword, or a rifle you amateur)  As far as Action RPG's go, Van Helsing's a weird hybrd sandwiched between the buns of Diablo II and Torchlight II.  You get some min-maxing of stats on items, but not enough to feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥ lord, plus a limited amount of skills that make you actually think before you plunk your points down so that you don't wind up with a Van Helsing with a limp sword arm.  Plus, the environments are pretty nice and gothic with a creepy atomsphere, again like a Hammer flick so it plays well to horror nerds, such as myself. The game can be pretty tough, you're going drink potions like an addict and you're going to swear at your monitor a lot, but making up swear words is a fun part of being a gamer.   it still feels rewarding to be able to come up with a combination of wepons strenth and skill points to be able to kick the snot out of that werewolf that's been having it's way with your hind parts.   There's two downfall's to Van Helsing, one being that it's a one and done playthrough, meaning you're not going to play through it obsessively seven times to become the prettiest princess with the shiniest breast plate, but it's pretty fun for that one play through.   The other is that one of the things I enjoy in ARPG's the playing dress up with your toon to be the prettiest princess, finding the coolest looking.  Van Helsing's getup isn't going to change a whole lot throughout the game, but he still looks pretty cool to start.  He looks cooler than Hugh Jackman did as Van Helsing at the very lest.			"

												Excellent production standards in all areas make this one of the best ARPGs around. The story is engaging enough that you will play this to completion and some of the voiceover work is hammy in such a way as to make it amusing without being painful. Take a Diablo clone, inject a touch of Witcher atmosphere and this is pretty much what you get. The ONLY gripe I have is that area transition load times seem inordinately slow. Some have complained that it is too short but I would argue that it is more than worth its initial asking price. 90%			"

The voice acting was painfully bad, but that went along with the Mary-Sue writing.

												My Bite Sized Review - The Incredible Adventures of Van HelsingThe Good:+New game in the world of Van Helsing+Controller Enabled+Start the game with a companion that talks and can be used in combat+A good amount of different playstyles+Story through campanion banter is done wellThe Bad:-Graphics are very outdated-Combat is very standard (melee, magic, or guns)-Unlike Diablo 3 once you spend points into a build, you are stuck with it unless you pay gold to respec-Enviroments are not that different (All kind of run together)-Zombie AI (aka just run at character)-Elite Mobs kill you quick, but themselves are just bullet sponges with average combat tactics-In the late game, you are forced to just keep popping healing potions and mana to stay alive-Quests are forgetable and not that interestingThe Verdict:I will say I DO recommend this game if it is heavily discounted. Other than that though, this game is a very average diablo style role playing game. The combat and graphics show their age and mid to late game there is a boost in difficulty that I feel is very un-necessary. Like in Diablo 3 I understand that on Hell Difficulty it would be really hard, but here in this game mid way through enemies just start taking chunks out of you even though you have decent equipment. All in all a very average game that might not get recommended before some other games in the genre (For Example Titan Quest or Torchlight).			"

												Before I get started with this review, I'll go ahead and point out that I'm not an expert. No really, loot-based action-rpgs aren't really my forte. Sure I've spent hundreds if not thousands of hours on titles like Diablo 2 and its ilk, but I couldn't tell you a dang thing about any of them. Go ahead and ask me about Diablo 2, all I recall is Tristram run after Blood run after Baal run after run after run after...bleah. I fried my brain on the genre years ago so I have just a little understanding for ""strategy"", ""proper-builds"", and the inner-workings and mechanics of what makes this genre function. I still play them though because they're addictive as hell. Now then, what can I say about Van Helsing? Well, for starters the characters are a bit more amusing than most. This is one of the benefits of having a game where the main-characters stay the same no matter the class. Despite his appearance, Helsing is a good-humored dude, and isn't always deadly serious about his job. His ghostly partner Katarina always has a cutting remark ready for the vampire hunter. As a duo they're far more memorable than most loot-clicker casts. I went with ranged-build, mostly relying on the spread-shot for crowd-control. Kat was built to violently explode upon ""death"" for great damage. It worked out well enough I suppose. I played on hard difficulty and didn't run into many problems (didn't beat the game, more on that later).Van Helsing plays out much the same as any other loot-clicker. You have your equipment, your rares, your skills, and your build. Either through happenstance or a guide you find your build, you choose the right skills for it, allocate the appropriate stats, then just kill stuff for appropriate weapon upgrades. For some gamers, that's compelling enough on its own, but it's preferable to hunt for something more. Where Van Helsing falters is mostly in the map-design. Each area is largely uninteresting. Some areas (like the ink realm) are visually inventive, but that's about it. The maps in this game are largely just a lot of space filled with packs of enemies. Nothing really changes as you progress. In the forest you'll run into packs of wolves, somewhere else there will be packs of soldiers, or packs of demons, and so on. When monsters are grouped together like that the game becomes stagnant. After you've found your build you're not likely to use more than the same or 2 or 3 skills at all times. Variety isn't just fighting different monsters, it's fighting monsters that approach in different ways. Some should ambush, others call for help, hell maybe they're just wandering around. In this game, they just wait around in organized groups for a vampire hunter to come fight them. One particular area is also aggravating because it is split into two sections, which leads to several minutes (slight exaggeration) of wandering back to square one if you go the wrong way. I will give credit to one area in that portions of it are separated by chasms, so enemies can take pot-shots at you as you try to cross. Sure it's headache-inducing, but at least it's inducing a feeling of something more and not just ""oh look. All these monsters are standing around for the thousandeth time"" mediocrity....But I didn't quit the game yet.A real frustrating aspect of this game involves the hit mechanics. More precisely, when enemies attack, what constitutes a hit? When I see an enemy wind-up to attack -- pull their fist back, hold an axe over their head, etc. -- I should be able to move out of the way to dodge it. Loot-Clickers..no...Action-RPGs in general have dozens of stats, even a dodge rating. All the same, there should be an incentive for players to avoid attacks through direct-input, not just their number > the enemy's number. Van Helsing flicks a toothpick at that idea, and it is a consistent source of annoyance for me. Even when I'm clear out of the way of an attack I'll still take damage. But that's not why I quit the game.After a certain point Van Helsing is given control of a resistance base, and he can outfit it as he sees fit. This is basically the tower defense portion of the game and THANKFULLY it's largely optional. I put the emphasis on THANKFULLY because I hated it that much. I'm going to change subjects ever so slightly and talk about a PS2 game called Shining Force Exa. In this game there is a fortress that is regularly attacked. While one character is questing, the other holds down the fort (so to speak). When you strip enough elements away from tower-defense you're left with nothing but ""protect this thing"". However if the core of the game is entertaining enough, that doesn't really matter. I actually enjoyed these battles in Exa because they focused on the core. A lot of monsters were thrown at the player and that was the extent of it. Van Helsing has this whole set-up where you can buy traps and place them all over this corridor-abundant dungeon. The waves of enemies are too frequent, come from too many angles, and due to the way the dungeon is constructed you'll never reach them in time. You have to approach these battles almost entirely with a tower-defense mindset. This isn't what I signed up for when I started playing Van Helsing. To be fair, tower-defense was a hardly a thing when Exa came out, but really who wants to play that crap when they pick up an action-RPG?...But I didn't quit the game at that point. After all the tower-defense stuff is largely optional.No I didn't actually quit Van Helsing until I was maybe one or two dungeons away from the final boss. When Katarina had reached her level-cap, and Helsing was maybe one or two levels away from his, I quit. Yes, of all the things to quit a game over it's due to hitting a level-cap. Or maybe the real reason is because it dawned on me that this is only part one of Van Helsing's incredible adventures. I'm sure if I picked up the second game I'd get to continue leveling, to continue fighting in seemingly endless repetitive encounters, using the same skills I mastered hours ago, dealing with the crappy mechanics, and there'd probably be even more tower-defense garbage. I didn't think myself capable of stomaching another 15-20 hours of a sequel to this game, so I quit.I'll give credit where it's due, Van Helsing managed just enough in getting the basics down to keep me playing. I'm an exceptional case though, I play a lot of loot-clickers regardless of quality, so maybe my judgment isn't always sound. If I see yellows, purples, and golds dropping at a decent enough rate there's no telling what games I could be tricked into playing. It's only when the end of the road is in sight do I realize that maybe this game isn't for me and move on. This is where Van Helsing lies. It's not particularly bad, but it gave me reason enough to quit as soon as I shook out of its icy grip.			"

												Can't review the entire game because it crashes every 10 minutes (no exaggeration). My play time is close to 40 minutes and the game has crashed 4 times on me. I have the latest Intel processor (kaby Lake), with 16gb Ram, and an SSD. Minimum spec requirements is Intel HD4000 which is from 2013. I have that covered well. I've ran other games comparable to this one (e.g. Darksiders, NFSP Hot Pursuit, even Strider runs on this machine at very low fram rates, but it didn't crash). The best thing I can say for this experience is that I didn't pay full price; however, I should never have bought this game. It seems broken.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing represents a solid action role-playing game, based on Bram Stoker’s legendary vampire slayer. It has a charming atmosphere in combination with an interesting storyline and lovely characters, set in a gothic–noir universe resembling the 19th century Eastern Europe, that is filled with original monsters, magic and weird technology.

												Somewhat fun for starters, seemed way more cool before buying and playing than it actually is. No idea if I even played it halfway through, so many other games to enjoy on Steam. In my books, unfortunately this is not worth spending your precious time on.			"

												I have just recently purchased The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing - Complete Pack for £14.99 from the store. The main problem is that the game keeps crashing every 5-10 regardless of what I am doing. The specs for my pc are as follows: Windows 10 Home x64, Intel Core i5 4460T @ 1.90Ghz Quad Core, 8GB of DDR3 RAM, Intel HD4600 built-in. The screen is running at 1920 x 1080 @60 FPS. The settings are turned down to medium for most things and yet it still crashes for no apparent reason. With this in mind if this is not resolved I will be seeking for a complete refund.			"

												A cluster of poorly designed, poorly animated, and unexplained game mechanics that have no respect for source material, tactical logic or easy use. Painful to play and impossible to understand without delusions of enjoyment.			"
