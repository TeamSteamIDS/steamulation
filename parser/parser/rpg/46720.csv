												This game is sort of like Warcraft-lite, in a sense. It's been years since I played it, so my memory might be hazy, but I did play it to completion and remember it being serviceable, if a bit buggy (IE, one map required me to defend a building with my Hero unit and a few basic infantrymen, and all of the infantrymen died, except for one that somehow got 20 levels ahead of everybody else and became death personified). If you want some kind of RTS-lite type of fantasy game to amuse yourself for a weekend, then go for it, and if you don't like it you're only out ten bucks. Otherwise, stick with Warcraft or Spellforce or something. I'll reccomend it, but it's sort of a 'meh' reccomendation than a ""ZOMG GET IT NAO"" one. It works and it's amusing, but other games have done it better.			"

												12 minotes was all I could take.  Clunky interface, clunky camera, annoying and repetitive character vocalizations. The first NPC I met had some of the worst voice acting I've encountered recently. Uninstalled.			"

												I tried to play for more than an hour but the game itself just wouldn't allow me due to game-breaking glitches. It had potential to be something great but it was just riddled with unpolished everything.			"

												You can tell this would have been a potentially fun game but its ruined with unpolished mechanics/graphics/everything and the ultimate feeling that it feels like Warcraft 0.5For a large part of the time I played I could not even figure out how to use more than 1 combo. The tutorial is pretty straight-forward and clear but yes, even the tutorial feels like an unfinished product to me			"

												Wow this game is really bad,  The Grfx are  ok but the camera is zoomed in too far.  You use right click to move. You have to constantly fight your units including your hero to not blindly rush into a large agro mob.   Really hard to figure out how to do combos and really not worth figuring it out.  Over all its a no go for me!  Beware.			"

												This is a wanna be RPG/Hack n' Slash/Semi RTS game. Basically its an attempt at Warcraft, with more emphisis on the hero. Graphics - 3/5Gameplay - 2/5Sound - 3/5Replay Value - 1/5There are much better games out there.			"
